      "summary_orig": "Turkey unveiled dozens of new finds at a major archaeological site in southeast Turkey on Wednesday, giving fresh insight into an area seen as showing humanity’s transition from hunter-gatherers to settled societies more than 11,000 years ago. On a plateau overlooking the fertile plains of what is often called the “cradle of civilisation”, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gobeklitepe and nearby Karahantepe are transforming archaeologists’ understanding of prehistoric times. Among the latest finds in Sanliurfa province is a statue with a facial expression reminiscent of a deceased individual. Archaeologists said it was a unique discovery in terms of death rituals and symbolic expression among Neolithic communities. People walk at the Karahantepe excavation site, widely regarded with Gobeklitepe as keys to understanding the birth of symbolic thought, social complexity and monumental architecture thousands of years before cities or states existed, near the southeastern city of Sanliurfa, Turkey. —Reuters It was one of some 30 artefacts revealed on Wednesday, including human and animal statues, figurines, vessels, plates, necklaces and beads including a human-shaped one. “What makes these archaeological sites unique is the way they reshape our knowledge of Neolithic history, as well as the transition to settled life,” Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy told Reuters. He said the sites, which Turkey has dubbed the Stone Mounds project, show that humanity had a far higher level of consciousness in terms of belief, rituals, social organisation and cultural production than previously assumed. Gobeklitepe is expected to attract around 800,000 visitors this year, he said, illustrating the growing recognition of the site’s importance. The ministry-led project encompasses 12 Neolithic sites of settled communities in Sanliurfa dating back to 9,500 BC, with Gobeklitepe and Karahantepe featuring the world’s oldest structures used for gathering and performance rituals. A drone view of a Karahantepe excavation site, widely regarded with Gobeklitepe as keys to understanding the birth of symbolic thought, social complexity and monumental architecture thousands of years before cities or states existed, near the southeastern city of Sanliurfa, Turkey. —Reuters Among the most striking features at the sites are oval-shaped monumental structures up to 28 metres in diameter surrounded with T-shaped limestone pillars, regarded as representations of humans, with reliefs of animals depicted on some of them. Archaeologists say one recent excavation at Karahantepe uncovered a T-shaped pillar with a human face, representing the first known depiction of a human face on such a pillar. “From nutrition to architecture, from the symbolic world to the rituals, the vast diversity of evidence obtained here bring us incredibly close to prehistoric societies,” said Necmi Karul, the head of excavations, describing the builders of the structures as skilled craftsmen. He said that until recently it was assumed that settled life started with agriculture and animal husbandry but the project indicated that these people were still hunter-gatherers but had become settled.",

      "summary_orig": "The Chief Minister of India-occupied Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, on Wednesday assailed the use of religion as a criterion for student admissions at the territory’s Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence, according to Kashmiri media. According to the Kashmir Media Service (KMS), the institute was sanctioned 50 MBBS seats for the current academic year. Of the 50 seats, 42 were allotted to Muslim students based on merit, sparking protests from right-wing Hindu groups and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who said Hindu students should be prioritised as the institution’s funding came from donations to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine. Speaking at the golden jubilee programme of Jamia Ziaul Uloom institute in Poonch, Abdullah said that Constitution Day “should not be reduced to a symbolic observance”. “Today, Constitution Day is being celebrated. The meaning of Constitution Day is not that we remember the Constitution for an hour … its meaning is that every day of the year, we must keep it alive,” Abdullah was quoted as saying by the Kashmir Observer . The chief executive of the occupied territory noted that the Indian constitution’s preamble grants equal status to all religions, ensures democratic rights for every citizen and guarantees protection under the law, according to the Observer’s report. It added that he expressed concern that the country was witnessing a trend where even educational institutions were being viewed through a communal lens. “Today, in one of the medical colleges, it is being said that Muslims and non-Hindus should not study here. If we set aside merit and start making decisions on the basis of religion, then where will the Constitution go?” he was quoted as saying about the rejection of the student list. On Monday, Abdullah said that when the bill to establish the university was passed, there was no mention of people being excluded from admissions based on their religion. “Where was it written?” he asked the press. “It was said that admissions will be based on merit and not religion. When admission is granted based on merit, then some people don’t like that. If they are not in favour, then they can approach the Supreme Court.” He added that admissions cannot be decided without merit and said that admitting students based on religion would violate the Indian constitution. “Will social welfare schemes be handled based on religion?” He asked. “Will ration shops ask about [the customer’s] religion? Will policemen work based on religion? “Right now, secularism remains a key part of our constitution. If you do not want to keep the nation secular, then remove that from the constitution,” he added. “You (BJP) do what you will, we’ll do what we will.” In response to a question, Abdullah reiterated, “When students will be granted admission, it will be on merit. Some students will excel, while others will be left behind. It’s nobody’s fault.” In another press talk on Tuesday, the CM said that when the college was being built, it should have been classified as a “minority institute” in order to allow admission to any one religious group. “Admissions are based on NEET (National Eligibility Entrance Test) and entrance tests, not on religion,” he reiterated. “If you don’t want Muslims to study here, then declare it a minority institute. They’ll get admission elsewhere … they’ll go to Bangladesh or Turkiye. “But, if you point the finger at Muslims and call them communal, sectarian and don’t tolerate their children, then remember this situation,” he added. “When children are ready to attend an institution like Mata Vaishno Devi, they are not concerned about the name or where the funding comes from; they want to study and become doctors,” the CM said. “Now you want them to be denied admission based on their religion.”",

Of the 50 seats, 42 were allotted to Muslim students based on merit, sparking protests from right-wing Hindu groups and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who said Hindu students should be prioritised as the institution’s funding came from donations to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine. Speaking at the golden jubilee programme of Jamia Ziaul Uloom institute in Poonch, Abdullah said that Constitution Day “should not be reduced to a symbolic observance”. “Today, Constitution Day is being celebrated. The meaning of Constitution Day is not that we remember the Constitution for an hour … its meaning is that every day of the year, we must keep it alive,” Abdullah was quoted as saying by the Kashmir Observer . The chief executive of the occupied territory noted that the Indian constitution’s preamble grants equal status to all religions, ensures democratic rights for every citizen and guarantees protection under the law, according to the Observer’s report. It added that he expressed concern that the country was witnessing a trend where even educational institutions were being viewed through a communal lens. “Today, in one of the medical colleges, it is being said that Muslims and non-Hindus should not study here. If we set aside merit and start making decisions on the basis of religion, then where will the Constitution go?” he was quoted as saying about the rejection of the student list. On Monday, Abdullah said that when the bill to establish the university was passed, there was no mention of people being excluded from admissions based on their religion. “Where was it written?” he asked the press. “It was said that admissions will be based on merit and not religion. When admission is granted based on merit, then some people don’t like that. If they are not in favour, then they can approach the Supreme Court.” He added that admissions cannot be decided without merit and said that admitting students based on religion would violate the Indian constitution. “Will social welfare schemes be handled based on religion?” He asked. “Will ration shops ask about [the customer’s] religion? Will policemen work based on religion? “Right now, secularism remains a key part of our constitution. If you do not want to keep the nation secular, then remove that from the constitution,” he added. “You (BJP) do what you will, we’ll do what we will.” In response to a question, Abdullah reiterated, “When students will be granted admission, it will be on merit. Some students will excel, while others will be left behind. It’s nobody’s fault.” In another press talk on Tuesday, the CM said that when the college was being built, it should have been classified as a “minority institute” in order to allow admission to any one religious group. “Admissions are based on NEET (National Eligibility Entrance Test) and entrance tests, not on religion,” he reiterated. “If you don’t want Muslims to study here, then declare it a minority institute. They’ll get admission elsewhere … they’ll go to Bangladesh or Turkiye. “But, if you point the finger at Muslims and call them communal, sectarian and don’t tolerate their children, then remember this situation,” he added. “When children are ready to attend an institution like Mata Vaishno Devi, they are not concerned about the name or where the funding comes from; they want to study and become doctors,” the CM said. “Now you want them to be denied admission based on their religion.”",

      "summary_orig": "A protest and sit-in against the disappearance of a Baloch student entered its third day at Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) on Wednesday, bringing all academic activities to a halt. A protest camp was established by the Baloch Students Council (BSC) against the enforced disappearance of a sixth-semester student, Saeedullah Baloch. The BSC students had earlier reached out to students from other councils and groups to join the camp. However, fearing a larger protest campaign, the administration of QAU suspended all academic activities at the varsity. The BSC students participating in the sit-in remained wary of certain consequences and declined to disclose their names to the media. However, speakers at the protest camp said they had remained firm in their stance for the past three days and refused to remain silent. They added that these three days have shown that students cannot be intimidated when justice is denied. Mohammad Azam, brother of missing Saeedullah, said that the protest camp has become more than a protest site; it is a symbol of collective resilience. “With every hour that passes, our message grows louder, we will not accept enforced disappearances, we will not accept fear, and we will not walk away until our voices are heard,” he added. There was no official reply from the QAU administration over the situation and the continued suspension of studies on campus. However, a senior QAU official said the administration had reached out to the BSC, offering assistance and requesting that they not establish a protest camp over the enforced disappearance “But they flatly refused because the (varsity) administration was not in a position to offer any help, secondly, the BSC maintained that the protest camp was not a political activity but a demand for the recovery of a student of the university,” the official added. Saeedullah Baloch was a student of the Defence and Strategic Studies (DSS) department. The speakers at the camp highlighted that Saeedullah was forcibly taken away by unknown men in civil dress on July 8, 2025, between 7 and 7.30pm, from the Islamabad toll plaza when he and his friend were travelling to Quetta on a public bus. The protestors added that the abductors were accompanied by officials of law enforcement, and they offloaded the two from the bus. While Saeedullah’s friend was allowed to proceed on the same bus, he was taken away. The speakers, who preferred not to be named in the media, said that they were students, but they were also witnesses to illegal acts by the authorities. In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said. In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament held the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.",

The exercise, Al Battar-II, focused on enhancing joint proficiency in counter-terrorism operations, with an emphasis on fighting in urban terrain, countering improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and refining tactical drills and procedures through integrated training. “The exercise also served to further strengthen the deep-rooted and historic military-to-military ties between Pakistan and the KSA,” said the ISPR.

      "summary_orig": "Lawyers held a protest march in Karachi on Wednesday, demanding “immediate” steps for the protection and preservation of the Karoonjhar Mountain range. They also called for the withdrawal of an appeal by the Sindh government, challenging a two-judge Sindh High Court bench judgement on the preservation of Karoonjhar hills in Tharparkar. The appeal was filed in the Supreme Court, but it has now landed in the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which was established under the 27th Amendment. The Sindh High Court Bar Association had announced a protest today, calling for the preservation of the Karoonjhar Mountain range, and planned to march from the Sindh High Court to the Chief Minister House. View this post on Instagram However, the protesters were barred from reaching the CM House due to the placement of containers to block the routes leading to the building. The measure also created inconvenience for the commuters who were asked by the traffic police in multiple advisories to travel on alternative routes. Police personnel were also deployed in the area. The SHCBA protesters, meanwhile, gathered at PIDC Chowk, where the president of the lawyers’ body, Barrister Sarfaraz Metlo, addressed the demonstrators. He accused the Sindh government of having a “dual policy”, saying that the provincial government was “with those leasing out the [mountain site] and, at the same time, was also aligned with those protesting against the move”. “Karoonjhar Mountain belongs to Sindh. We demand the withdrawal of the [former] caretaker provincial government,” he said, apparently referring to a proposal by the last caretaker Sindh government for initiating a granite excavation project. He also called for the provincial government to withdraw its appeal filed regarding the matter, warning that the lawyers would hold another protest after 15 days if their demand was not met. Barrister Metlo, along with other representatives of the SHCBA, later visited the CM House for negotiations with the government, following which the lawyers ended the protest. After the meeting at the CM House, Barrister Metlo said while speaking to the media that they had met Sindh Law Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar. He claimed that the minister had assured him that the Sindh government would withdraw its appeal and committed to declaring the Karoonjhar Mountain range a national heritage site. He also claimed that the law minister had told him and his companions during the meeting that the Sindh government had “ended the contract for the lease of 21,000 acres” of the mountain site. Meanwhile, a statement issued by the CM Office said the lawyers’ delegation presented a memorandum and their demands in writing to the law minister. The CM Office’s statement quoted the memorandum as stating that the SHCBA “expresses reservations over existing and potential dangers faced by the mountain range. This mountain is a natural, cultural and historical heritage of Sindh, and its loss is irreparable”. The lawyers demanded “immediate and concrete” measures for the protection, survival and upkeep of the mountain range, according to the statement. It said Law Minister Lanjar assured the lawyers’ delegation that his party, the PPP, was determined to protect the natural, cultural and historical heritage of the province. “The land of Sindh is entrusted to us by our ancestors, and the government considers the protection of [Sindh’s] environment, mountains, natural resources and cultural identity its constitutional and moral responsibility,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. The law minister assured the lawyers that necessary legal, administrative and practical steps would be taken to protect all historical and environmental sites of Sindh, including Karoonjhar. According to the statement, Lanjar said recommendations of the legal community would be given “serious” consideration. “Damage to natural, environmental and cultural assets of Sindh will not be allowed under any circumstances,” Lanjar added. The statement said the two sides also signed a memorandum after the meeting. KBA protest Later, lawyers from the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) also reached PIDC Chowk, following which police deployment in the area was increased. Police then negotiated with the protesters. South Deputy Inspector General of Police Asad Raza told the media that they were trying to convince the lawyers to end their protest. KBA President Amir Warraich also spoke to the media, saying that they had been invited for talks at the CM House. “But, we refused to hold talks with the law minister,” he said, demanding that a “neutral senior minister” be sent by the government for talks. He also called for the Sindh government to withdraw its appeal pertaining to Karoonjhar. “We don’t accept the Federal Constitutional Court,” Warraich said, asserting that lawyers would protest “on every level for the protection of Karoonjhar”. He added: “We reject the 26th and 27th Amendments. The Federal Constitutional Court will heed those who created it.” The KBA president claimed that the Sindh advocate general had contacted the lawyers and claimed that the provincial government was mulling withdrawing its appeal. A delegation of the KBA later held talks with Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah at the Karachi commissioner’s office. Warraich later told the media that the lawyers had given the Sindh government 15 days, and the provincial government had assured them of withdrawing their appeal. He also said that the local government minister had said that the lawyers’ demand would be presented to the Sindh CM. ‘Always ready for dialogue’ Sindh Chief Minister addressed the matter while speaking to the media today after an event organised by the Sindh Higher Education Commission. The CM reaffirmed his government’s commitment to protecting Karoonjhar hills, declaring the mountain range a cultural and environmental asset for the province. “Karoonjhar is our treasure; we will not allow any damage to it,” he said. He asserted that the Sindh government valued the ancient and historical significance of Karoonjhar and would not compromise on its preservation. “Anyone creating hurdles in the path of development will be convinced through dialogue,” he added. He also criticised road closures and street protests by lawyers, saying: “Coming out on the roads and causing inconvenience to citizens is not acceptable. If lawyers want to talk to the government or Parliament, they are welcome. Or they may take the matter to court. I am always ready for dialogue, whoever wants to come to the CM House can come.” The Karoonjhar Mountain range in Tharparkar rises to a height of 305 metres and runs approximately 19 kilometres in length. Karoonjhar also has economic significance for the local people as it is rich in minerals and plants having medicinal value. The SHC judgement challenged by the Sindh government was issued in 2023. One of the pleas taken up on the matter by the high court was filed after the provincial mines department allowed companies to excavate at the site and granted them a lease, leading to outrage among civil society. Earlier this week, senior lawyer Salahuddin Ahmed had informed the Sindh government that he cannot not represent the province before the FCC in its appeal against the SHC judgement. In a letter sent to law and mines and mineral secretaries, as well as advocate general, he stated that the subject matter had recently been transferred from the Supreme Court to the FCC and fixed for hearing on Nov 26. “Due to the change in forum and on account of various concerns raised by different bars about the excessive level of government control over judicial appointments to the Federal Constitutional Court, I do not consider it possible for me to represent the government of Sindh before the Federal Constitutional Court,” he said.

The CM reaffirmed his government’s commitment to protecting Karoonjhar hills, declaring the mountain range a cultural and environmental asset for the province. “Karoonjhar is our treasure; we will not allow any damage to it,” he said. He asserted that the Sindh government valued the ancient and historical significance of Karoonjhar and would not compromise on its preservation. “Anyone creating hurdles in the path of development will be convinced through dialogue,” he added. He also criticised road closures and street protests by lawyers, saying: “Coming out on the roads and causing inconvenience to citizens is not acceptable. If lawyers want to talk to the government or Parliament, they are welcome. Or they may take the matter to court. I am always ready for dialogue, whoever wants to come to the CM House can come.” The Karoonjhar Mountain range in Tharparkar rises to a height of 305 metres and runs approximately 19 kilometres in length. Karoonjhar also has economic significance for the local people as it is rich in minerals and plants having medicinal value. The SHC judgement challenged by the Sindh government was issued in 2023. One of the pleas taken up on the matter by the high court was filed after the provincial mines department allowed companies to excavate at the site and granted them a lease, leading to outrage among civil society. Earlier this week, senior lawyer Salahuddin Ahmed had informed the Sindh government that he cannot not represent the province before the FCC in its appeal against the SHC judgement. In a letter sent to law and mines and mineral secretaries, as well as advocate general, he stated that the subject matter had recently been transferred from the Supreme Court to the FCC and fixed for hearing on Nov 26. “Due to the change in forum and on account of various concerns raised by different bars about the excessive level of government control over judicial appointments to the Federal Constitutional Court, I do not consider it possible for me to represent the government of Sindh before the Federal Constitutional Court,” he said.

      "summary": "Lawyers held a protest march in Karachi on Wednesday, demanding “immediate” steps for the protection and preservation of the Karoonjhar Mountain range. They also called for the withdrawal of an appeal by the Sindh government, challenging a two-judge Sindh High Court bench judgement on the preservation of Karoonjhar hills in Tharparkar. The appeal was filed in the Supreme Court, but it has now landed in the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which was established under the 27th Amendment. The Sindh High Court Bar Association had announced a protest today, calling for the preservation of the Karoonjhar Mountain range, and planned to march from the Sindh High Court to the Chief Minister House. View this post on Instagram However, the protesters were barred from reaching the CM House due to the placement of containers to block the routes leading to the building. The measure also created inconvenience for the commuters who were asked by the traffic police in multiple advisories to travel on alternative routes. Police personnel were also deployed in the area. The SHCBA protesters, meanwhile, gathered at PIDC Chowk, where the president of the lawyers’ body, Barrister Sarfaraz Metlo, addressed the demonstrators. He accused the Sindh government of having a “dual policy”, saying that the provincial government was “with those leasing out the [mountain site] and, at the same time, was also aligned with those protesting against the move”. “Karoonjhar Mountain belongs to Sindh. We demand the withdrawal of the [former] caretaker provincial government,” he said, apparently referring to a proposal by the last caretaker Sindh government for initiating a granite excavation project. He also called for the provincial government to withdraw its appeal filed regarding the matter, warning that the lawyers would hold another protest after 15 days if their demand was not met. Barrister Metlo, along with other representatives of the SHCBA, later visited the CM House for negotiations with the government, following which the lawyers ended the protest. After the meeting at the CM House, Barrister Metlo said while speaking to the media that they had met Sindh Law Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar. He claimed that the minister had assured him that the Sindh government would withdraw its appeal and committed to declaring the Karoonjhar Mountain range a national heritage site. He also claimed that the law minister had told him and his companions during the meeting that the Sindh government had “ended the contract for the lease of 21,000 acres” of the mountain site. Meanwhile, a statement issued by the CM Office said the lawyers’ delegation presented a memorandum and their demands in writing to the law minister. The CM Office’s statement quoted the memorandum as stating that the SHCBA “expresses reservations over existing and potential dangers faced by the mountain range. This mountain is a natural, cultural and historical heritage of Sindh, and its loss is irreparable”. The lawyers demanded “immediate and concrete” measures for the protection, survival and upkeep of the mountain range, according to the statement. It said Law Minister Lanjar assured the lawyers’ delegation that his party, the PPP, was determined to protect the natural, cultural and historical heritage of the province. “The land of Sindh is entrusted to us by our ancestors, and the government considers the protection of [Sindh’s] environment, mountains, natural resources and cultural identity its constitutional and moral responsibility,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. The law minister assured the lawyers that necessary legal, administrative and practical steps would be taken to protect all historical and environmental sites of Sindh, including Karoonjhar. According to the statement, Lanjar said recommendations of the legal community would be given “serious” consideration. “Damage to natural, environmental and cultural assets of Sindh will not be allowed under any circumstances,” Lanjar added. The statement said the two sides also signed a memorandum after the meeting. KBA protest Later, lawyers from the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) also reached PIDC Chowk, following which police deployment in the area was increased. Police then negotiated with the protesters. South Deputy Inspector General of Police Asad Raza told the media that they were trying to convince the lawyers to end their protest. KBA President Amir Warraich also spoke to the media, saying that they had been invited for talks at the CM House. “But, we refused to hold talks with the law minister,” he said, demanding that a “neutral senior minister” be sent by the government for talks. He also called for the Sindh government to withdraw its appeal pertaining to Karoonjhar. “We don’t accept the Federal Constitutional Court,” Warraich said, asserting that lawyers would protest “on every level for the protection of Karoonjhar”. He added: “We reject the 26th and 27th Amendments. The Federal Constitutional Court will heed those who created it.” The KBA president claimed that the Sindh advocate general had contacted the lawyers and claimed that the provincial government was mulling withdrawing its appeal. A delegation of the KBA later held talks with Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah at the Karachi commissioner’s office. Warraich later told the media that the lawyers had given the Sindh government 15 days, and the provincial government had assured them of withdrawing their appeal. He also said that the local government minister had said that the lawyers’ demand would be presented to the Sindh CM. ‘Always ready for dialogue’ Sindh Chief Minister addressed the matter while speaking to the media today after an event organised by the Sindh Higher Education Commission.

      "summary_orig": "Thousands of trade union workers across India protested on Wednesday against the government’s rollout of new labour codes , saying they would lead to corporate exploitation and erode their hard-won rights. The world’s fifth-largest economy last week implemented long-awaited labour laws that will replace colonial-era legislation and simplify a maze of confusing regulations. The overhaul consolidates 29 existing labour laws into four key codes, with the number of rules being cut from more than 1,400 to about 350, but unions say the reforms will hurt workers’ rights. Gautam Mody from the New Trade Union Initiative said workers from across all sectors were protesting on Wednesday outside factories and in many city centres. “Workers have been blindsided by the government,” he told AFP . “We want fairness, justice and equity before the law, which are being denied under the new codes.” Workers cut wooden logs using a machine at a warehouse in Varanasi, India on November 26. — AFP While the new regulations boost safety standards and mandate guaranteed social security benefits for gig workers, they also allow for longer factory shifts, make it tougher for workers to conduct strikes and easier for medium-sized firms to fire employees. A controversial key provision raises the threshold for firms that needed prior government permission for layoffs from 100 to 300 workers, which means companies with up to 300 employees can retrench staff without any approval. ‘Deceptive fraud’ The move has sparked worry among trade unions, aligned with parties opposed to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who have called it a “deceptive fraud” against the nation’s working people. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) said in a statement that the government wanted to portray these codes as “pro-worker” and “modernising”. But “in reality they constitute the most sweeping and aggressive abrogation of workers’ hard-won rights and entitlements since Independence, aimed at facilitating corporate exploitation, contractualisation and unrestrained hire-and-fire”. Modi has said the overhaul represented an opportunity to eliminate compliance-intensive labour laws, often seen as preventing the Indian economy from wooing foreign investors. He has described the changes as “one of the most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence.” Trade union members of the Communist Party of India stand beside party flags during a protest against the government’s new labour laws in Kolkata, India on November 26, 2025. — AFP India remains the world’s fastest-growing major economy , but a slowdown over the last year has left it short of the 8 per cent growth rate that most economists say is needed to create millions of well-paying jobs for its people. US President Donald Trump’s tariff blitz , partly sparked by the White House’s anger over New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil, has also clouded the country’s economic outlook and raised questions over its energy security. Analysts at Nomura said in a recent note that the labour law reform was an “attempt to modernise disparate, arcane and compliance-intensive labour laws” that have emerged as one of the “major challenges to the ease of doing business”. But they added it was “part of a broader trend by the government to hasten economic reforms, especially in the wake of the 50pc Trump tariffs”.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held delegation-level talks with Bahrain’s leadership at  Al Qudaibiya Palace in Manama on Wednesday, according to state broadcaster PTV News . The PM reached Bahrain’s capital Manama earlier today for a two-day visit. According to PTV , the premier received a warm welcome at the Manama airport by Bahrain’s Crown Prince and PM Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Deputy PM Khalid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, Foreign Minister Dr Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, and senior members of the Bahraini leadership. The delegation also includes Deputy PM and FM Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister of State for Railways Bilal Azhar Kayani, and other senior officials. According to a post on the Government of Pakistan’s X account, the PM also received a guard of honour at the Al Qudaibiya Palace. During his visit to Bahrain from November 26 to 27, PM Shehbaz will also hold “high-level” meetings with the Bahraini leadership. These meetings, as per PTV , will include engagements with Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad and Deputy PM Sheikh Khalid bin Abdullah. “This official visit reflects the longstanding cordial relations between the Kingdom of Bahrain and Pakistan, with the aim of promoting a results-oriented and strategic partnership between the two countries,” state media said. “The visit will strengthen traditionally warm and cordial relations, chart new avenues of partnership, and deepen people-to-people connections, which will contribute to mutually beneficial cooperation,” it added. Last month, the two countries agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in different fields during the first meeting of the Pakistan-Bahrain Parliamentary Friendship Group. They also agreed to establish a joint working group to enhance collaboration in areas such as counter-narcotics, counterterrorism, coastguard operations, border security, immigration and police training and decided to sign memoranda of understanding on extradition, mutual legal assistance and specialised battalion training. In September, the countries had also agreed to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics, and immigration during a meeting between Interior Minister Naqvi and his Bahraini counterpart, Gen Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa.",

      "summary_orig": "Brazil’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro to begin serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a failed coup, after he exhausted all appeals. The brash former army captain, who fired up Brazil’s right and reshaped the country’s politics, is ending a divisive career jailed in a small room at police headquarters equipped with a TV, mini-fridge, and air-conditioning. Bolsonaro, 70, was convicted in September over a scheme to stop Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office as president after the 2022 elections, a plan that included a plot to kill the veteran leftist. Prosecutors said the scheme failed only due to a lack of support from military top brass. The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to his sentence earlier this month and ruled the judgment final. The court also ordered a military tribunal to decide whether Bolsonaro should be stripped of his captain’s rank. Bolsonaro had been under house arrest until Saturday, when he was detained at police headquarters in Brasilia for tampering with his ankle monitor using a soldering iron. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said there were signs Bolsonaro planned to flee during a vigil organised by his son outside his home. The justice cited the nearby US embassy and Bolsonaro’s close relationship with former US President Donald Trump, suggesting he may have sought political asylum. Bolsonaro said he acted out of “paranoia” induced by medication and denied attempting to escape. The court ruled Bolsonaro will remain detained in the officers’ room, a secure space for protected prisoners, in Brasilia. Five of his co-accused, including military generals and former ministers, also began serving sentences of between 19 and 26 years on Tuesday. Former intelligence chief Alexandre Ramagem, sentenced to 16 years, was declared a fugitive after fleeing to the United States. Bolsonaro’s defence lawyer, Paulo Cunha Bueno, called the closure of the case “surprising” and said he would file an appeal regardless. Brazilian congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the president’s son, was also charged on Tuesday with obstruction of justice after promoting Trump-era measures seeking to interfere with his father’s trial. ‘Extremely fragile’ Bolsonaro is the fourth former president to be imprisoned since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985. In May, Fernando Collor de Mello was allowed to serve his nearly nine-year sentence for corruption at home due to health concerns. Bolsonaro’s defence team argues he should receive the same treatment, warning that detention endangers his life. He suffers the consequences of a stab wound sustained during a 2018 campaign attack and has required several follow-up surgeries. He also experiences persistent “uncontrollable hiccups” linked to gastric issues, leaving him breathless and fainting, according to doctors. Bolsonaro’s family has highlighted his poor mental and physical state. After visiting him on Tuesday, Carlos Bolsonaro described his father as “extremely fragile and psychologically devastated,” adding: “He’s eating very little — there’s no way for someone who knows he didn’t commit a crime to see this as normal.” Bolsonaro, president from 2019 to 2022, maintains his innocence and claims political persecution. With Bolsonaro sidelined, Brazil’s large conservative electorate lacks a champion ahead of the 2026 presidential elections, in which Lula, 80, has said he will seek a fourth term. Lula himself was jailed between mandates for corruption but had his conviction overturned by the Supreme Court after a year and a half.",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Wednesday expressed “grave concern” over a United Nations (UN) report that observed systemic human rights violations in India-occupied Kashmir. UN experts on Monday raised the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the government of India in the aftermath of a terror attack in Pahalgam in April this year, for which Delhi blamed Islamabad without any evidence. A press release issued by the FO today said, “Pakistan notes with grave concern the latest findings by the United Nations Special Procedures experts regarding India’s illegal measures in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).” It said that the report “once again underscores the severe and systematic human rights violations endured by the Kashmiri people under Indian occupation”. It noted “with alarm” the UN experts’ observations that India’s actions had resulted in the “extensive arbitrary arrest and detention of nearly 2,800 individuals, including journalists, students, and human rights advocates”. “The persistent application of draconian legislation, such as the Public Safety Act (PSA) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), has facilitated indefinite and unjustifiable detentions,” it added. “Instances of torture, custodial deaths, incommunicado detention, denial of due legal process and family contact, punitive demolitions and forced evictions, recurring communication blackouts, and suppression of press freedom — including the blocking of 8,000 social media accounts — as well as the rise in hate speech, lynching, and harassment directed at Kashmiris and Muslim communities across India, are equally deplorable and deeply troubling,” the statement said. It added, “These findings reaffirm Pakistan’s longstanding concerns regarding state-sponsored persecution of Kashmiri Muslims as well as discrimination against minorities across India.” The FO called upon India to “cease its coercive measures” and to unconditionally release all arbitrarily detained individuals in India-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. It also urged India to take concrete steps to end the persecution of all religious minorities, “particularly Muslims and Christians”. “Pakistan reiterates its commitment to a peaceful, just, and enduring resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people,” it said. The FO urged India to “halt its repressive policies, reverse demographic and legal alterations, restore fundamental freedoms, and engage sincerely in meaningful dialogue”. “Pakistan will continue to extend moral, political, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their just struggle against foreign occupation,” it added. The UN experts’ findings had noted that Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack. They further highlighted reports of punitive house demolitions , forced evictions and arbitrary displacement, and noted that some detainees were allegedly tortured, held incommunicado, and denied access to lawyers and family members. “These measures are disproportionate restrictions on freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” the experts noted.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Wednesday denied media reports alleging that an accident was averted at the Islamabad airport as a foreign carrier narrowly avoided landing on a closed runway, saying that it was “standard and internationally practised safety measure”. The statement came after multiple media outlets reported on Tuesday that flight SV278 — operated by Saudia Airlines from Jeddah to Islamabad — narrowly avoided a “ major disaster ” as the air traffic controller timely prevented the pilot from landing the plane on the wrong runway. The flight was scheduled to arrive at the airport at 4:05pm, but landed with a delay of more than an hour at 5:13pm, according to the tracker flightradar24 . In a statement issued today, the PAA said, “The recent go-around at Islamabad International Airport involving flight SV728 was a standard and internationally practised safety measure, executed precisely as per established protocols.” A go-around is a “safe, routine manoeuvre” that discontinues the landing approach and returns the aircraft to an altitude and configuration for another safe attempt, according to the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration . “Go-arounds are common, non-emergency procedures carried out to ensure the highest level of operational safety,” it explained. In its statement, the PAA requested media outlets to “avoid presenting routine aviation procedures in a sensational manner”. “Sensational reporting may unintentionally create unnecessary concern among the travelling public and lead to misunderstandings about normal aviation practices,” the authority cautioned. It affirmed that the PAA “values the media’s role as an important partner in keeping the public informed and encourages continued responsible reporting based on verified information”. “PAA remains committed to transparency and to maintaining the highest safety standards across all airports in Pakistan,” it added.",

      "summary_orig": "New Delhi has asserted that Arunachal Pradesh is an “integral part” of India in response to Beijing’s claim over the territory as the two countries rowed over the detention of an Indian citizen at Shanghai Airport. On Tuesday, India had issued a demarche to China over the detention of Prema Wangjom Thongdok, a UK-based woman from Arunachal Pradesh, at the Shanghai airport. Thongdok had said immigration officials had held for 18 hours and “mocked” her by saying the region was not a part of India. China says Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing calls Zangnan, is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed. Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi. Responding to queries during a press briefing on Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning had said that “Zangnan is China’s territory”. “The Chinese side has never recognised the so-called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’ illegally set up by India,” she said. She further stated there was “no so-called ‘detaining’ or ‘harassing’” of the woman at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport, adding that authorities carried out checks in accordance with the law. Subsequently, in a statement issued on Tuesday night, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said New Delhi had seen China’s remarks about Thongdok’s “arbitrary detention”. “Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a self-evident fact. No amount of denial by the Chinese side is going to change this indisputable reality,” Jaiswal said. On the woman’s detention, he said the issue had been taken up strongly with the Chinese authorities, who he said “have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel”. “The actions by the Chinese authorities also violate their own regulations that allow visa-free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries,” the spokesperson noted. Arunachal Pradesh woman’s ‘detention’ amidst attempts to improve ties The recent row between the two countries, who have been cautiously strengthening ties after four years of hostility, erupted after Thongdok claimed she was held back at the Shanghai airport for 18 hours on November 21. Thongdok said she was an Indian citizen who had been residing in the United Kingdom for about 14 years, and was detained by immigration staff at the Shanghai airport, where she had a layover during her trip from London to Japan. “They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh, which they claimed is Chinese territory,” she had said on social media platform X on November 23, referring to Chinese immigration officials and China Eastern Airlines’ staff. She had reached out to the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing, resulting in officials intervening to help her leave the country. Thongdok said the immigration officials declared her visa unacceptable and “mocked” her, saying Arunachal Pradesh was not a part of India. “You’re Chinese, you’re not Indian,” the woman quoted them as saying. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China in August for the first time in seven years, where he and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that the two countries were partners, not rivals. India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s. Ties were ruptured after a 2020 clash in the Himalayas, in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died in hand-to-hand combat.",

Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi. Responding to queries during a press briefing on Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning had said that “Zangnan is China’s territory”. “The Chinese side has never recognised the so-called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’ illegally set up by India,” she said. She further stated there was “no so-called ‘detaining’ or ‘harassing’” of the woman at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport, adding that authorities carried out checks in accordance with the law. Subsequently, in a statement issued on Tuesday night, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said New Delhi had seen China’s remarks about Thongdok’s “arbitrary detention”. “Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a self-evident fact. No amount of denial by the Chinese side is going to change this indisputable reality,” Jaiswal said. On the woman’s detention, he said the issue had been taken up strongly with the Chinese authorities, who he said “have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel”. “The actions by the Chinese authorities also violate their own regulations that allow visa-free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries,” the spokesperson noted. Arunachal Pradesh woman’s ‘detention’ amidst attempts to improve ties The recent row between the two countries, who have been cautiously strengthening ties after four years of hostility, erupted after Thongdok claimed she was held back at the Shanghai airport for 18 hours on November 21. Thongdok said she was an Indian citizen who had been residing in the United Kingdom for about 14 years, and was detained by immigration staff at the Shanghai airport, where she had a layover during her trip from London to Japan. “They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh, which they claimed is Chinese territory,” she had said on social media platform X on November 23, referring to Chinese immigration officials and China Eastern Airlines’ staff. She had reached out to the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing, resulting in officials intervening to help her leave the country. Thongdok said the immigration officials declared her visa unacceptable and “mocked” her, saying Arunachal Pradesh was not a part of India. “You’re Chinese, you’re not Indian,” the woman quoted them as saying. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China in August for the first time in seven years, where he and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that the two countries were partners, not rivals. India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s. Ties were ruptured after a 2020 clash in the Himalayas, in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died in hand-to-hand combat.",

      "summary": "New Delhi has asserted that Arunachal Pradesh is an “integral part” of India in response to Beijing’s claim over the territory as the two countries rowed over the detention of an Indian citizen at Shanghai Airport. On Tuesday, India had issued a demarche to China over the detention of Prema Wangjom Thongdok, a UK-based woman from Arunachal Pradesh, at the Shanghai airport. Thongdok had said immigration officials had held for 18 hours and “mocked” her by saying the region was not a part of India.

      "summary_orig": "Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday lauded the “professionalism, resolve and commitment” demonstrated by the armed forces during Marka-i-Haq, stressing that it “enhanced” Pakistan’s global stature. The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India, from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, as Marka-i-Haq in May. The army chief made the remarks while addressing the participants of the National Security Workshop–27 who visited the General Headquarters (GHQ), according to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). “The professionalism, resolve, and commitment of the armed forces displayed during Marka-i-Haq [have] enhanced the global stature of Pakistan,” the army chief was quoted as saying. In his remarks, the army chief stressed that Pakistan was a “country of consequence and is destined to reach its rightful place in the comity of nations”. “Our greatest strength lies in national unity, and together, we shall defeat the nefarious designs of our foes,” the ISPR quoted him as saying. According to the ISPR, the army chief also highlighted the “fluid regional environment shaped by heightened geopolitical competition, cross-border terrorism, and hybrid threats”. “He underscored that despite complex challenges, including externally supported militancy and information-centric warfare, Pakistan’s armed forces, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement institutions continue to demonstrate unwavering professionalism and resolve to safeguard national security,” the ISPR said. COAS Munir also reiterated that the territorial integrity, security, and protection of every Pakistani citizen was “paramount for the Pakistan Army and will not be compromised under any circumstances”. He also reaffirmed the army’s commitment to supporting federal and provincial governments. “Coordinated national efforts and institutional synergy are vital for lasting peace, stability, and prosperity,” the ISPR quoted him as saying. Meanwhile, the ISPR statement said the participants of the workshop were briefed on ongoing national efforts against illegal activities, including the crackdown on smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and organised criminal networks that adversely impact security. It added that updates were also shared on enhanced border controls and the repatriation of illegal foreigners, aimed at maintaining internal order and protecting national interests. The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . After New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later raising the tally to seven . Following tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire . Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets after three air bases were targeted.",

      "summary_orig": "Badruddin Umar, who died in Dhaka on September 7, 2025, at the age of 93, was often introduced as a Marxist theorist and a figure of the Bangladeshi left. That label never captured the real centre of gravity of his life’s work. His lasting contribution was scholarly. Umar left behind a meticulous body of English-language writing and translated work that gave international readers an empirically grounded view of East Bengal’s history, culture and class formation. The best of his English books and essays are neither slogans nor memoirs; they are archives in prose — dense with references, patient with evidence and consciously written to carry Bangladesh’s history beyond the limits of a single language community. For students of South Asia who read him first in English, Umar appears primarily as a historian of structures, a cartographer of class conflict and a translator who understood translation as an intellectual act. In the notice of his passing, Bangladeshi outlets described him as a public intellectual, researcher and teacher. These are apt terms but, to readers abroad, he is inseparable from the project of explaining East Pakistan and Bangladesh to the outside world, in the language that academic debates now most often use. Bangladesh intellectual Badruddin Umar, who passed away in September, was often dubbed a leftist theorist. But his real legacy is scholarly: one that gives international readers an empirically grounded view of the country’s contested past BEYOND NATIONALIST NARRATIVES The clearest portal into Umar’s English-language corpus is his two-volume study, published by Oxford University Press. The Emergence of Bangladesh, subtitled Class Struggles in East Pakistan 1947–1958, reconstructs the first post-Partition decade through newspapers, election records, union minutes, memoirs and government papers. It is a historian’s book with a sociologist’s questions. What kinds of class coalitions formed in East Bengal? How were their interests translated into the idioms of language, region and religion? How did policy and police shape the boundaries of legitimate dissent? Umar’s answer is pointed and empirical. He argues that the story has too often been told as a quarrel between two geographic “wings”, when the decisive conflicts were closer to the ground — in fields, mills and universities. The companion volume, The Emergence of Bangladesh Vol 2: Rise of Bengali Nationalism 1958–1971, resumes the story under martial law and follows it into the crowded politics of the sixties. It discusses contested agrarian change, the maturing of a Bengali middle class, and the growth of an oppositional public sphere, in which language, culture and class converged. If Volume 1 is a ledger of struggles that the state could still contain, Volume 2 is a chronicle of why it ultimately could not. In both volumes, Umar’s voice is quietly polemical. He is sceptical of narratives that flatten class antagonisms into regional grievances. One early passage challenges the fashionable mid-century talk of “disparity” between the two wings by insisting that the real divisions lay elsewhere. It is an analytic move, taking terms of nationalism and turning them back towards class. In Volume 1, he tracks the ‘Language Movement’ through the strikes, demonstrations and pamphleteering that gave it organisational form. What is striking is not just the detail but the care with which peasant and worker experiences are interpolated into a story that could easily have been told only as a tale of student leaders and capital-city eloquence. Because scholars outside Bangladesh often encounter him first in English, Umar’s journal essays matter as much as his books. In the late 1990s, he wrote a cluster of interventions for Economic & Political Weekly in Mumbai — pieces with titles that still circulate on reading lists. ‘Bangladesh: Intellectuals, Culture and Ruling Class’, ‘Peace in the Hills’, and ‘The Anti-Heroes of the Language Movement’ are just a couple of examples. These are less archival than the Oxford volumes but no less revealing of his method. In interviews, he would say, in substance, that writing across languages unsettled the hierarchy between a metropolitan centre and a linguistic periphery. This is consistent with the stance one finds in his essays: cultural politics is never just about symbols; it is about the channels through which knowledge is distributed and the audiences that are imagined or excluded. In English newspapers and magazines, he sometimes wrote with a sharper edge. One line of criticism that has been remembered, and sometimes misunderstood for its severity, is his description of Bangladesh’s early constitutional settlement as “a constitution for perpetual emergency.” The phrase is aphoristic but it is not casual; it distils an argument he made across several pieces about the retention of colonial instruments of rule and the concentration of executive power. It is the kind of line that was born to be misquoted and, yet, its survival in public memory says something about the role he played in English-language discourse. What makes Umar unusual among South Asian intellectuals of his cohort is that he did institution-building in both senses: he founded departments at the University of Rajshahi and he also built the paper institutions — the bibliographies, chronologies and typologies — on which later study depends. Because he wrote for international journals and because the Oxford books became standard shelf items in university libraries, Umar’s English voice shaped how non-Bangladeshi readers understand key episodes: the 1952 Language Movement, the fall of the Muslim League in East Bengal, the trade-union reorganisation after Partition, the United Front election of 1954, the many internal arguments of the 1960s. In The Emergence of Bangladesh, for example, he annotates the teachers’ strikes, peasant conferences and district-level by-elections that do not usually survive the drift of memory. One cannot write in English of the origins of the National Awami Party without encountering Umar’s citations and then the records to which they point. A SOCIOLOGY OF READING In the end, Umar knew that scholarship is also a sociology of reading. He understood that writing in English gave Bangladesh a seat at a certain table — one that did not always hear Bangla, however loudly it was spoken. If there is a single place to begin for readers who want to meet Umar in English, it is still The Emergence of Bangladesh. Start with the early chapters where he dissects 1947; watch how he connects Partition’s arithmetic to the sociology of who was counted. Then read his reconstruction of the Language Movement through the testimony of teachers and students. The familiar slogans are there, but the analysis lifts them off the banner and tests them against pay scales, by-laws and minutes. Then move to the 1960s and see how a vocabulary of class keeps reappearing beneath the talk of national destiny. Badruddin Umar will be remembered as a writer whose English works gave Bangladesh a durable presence in a wider scholarly conversation, and as a translator whose ethical premise was simple: that ideas should travel both ways. The writer is a columnist, educator and film critic. He can be contacted at mnazir1964@yahoo.co.uk . X: @NaazirMahmood Published in Dawn, EOS, November 23rd, 2025",

What makes Umar unusual among South Asian intellectuals of his cohort is that he did institution-building in both senses: he founded departments at the University of Rajshahi and he also built the paper institutions — the bibliographies, chronologies and typologies — on which later study depends.

In The Emergence of Bangladesh, for example, he annotates the teachers’ strikes, peasant conferences and district-level by-elections that do not usually survive the drift of memory.

      "title": "TRIBUTE: EXPLAINING BANGLADESH",
      "summary": "Badruddin Umar, who died in Dhaka on September 7, 2025, at the age of 93, was often introduced as a Marxist theorist and a figure of the Bangladeshi left. That label never captured the real centre of gravity of his life’s work. His lasting contribution was scholarly. Umar left behind a meticulous body of English-language writing and translated work that gave international readers an empirically grounded view of East Bengal’s history, culture and class formation. The best of his English books and essays are neither slogans nor memoirs; they are archives in prose — dense with references, patient with evidence and consciously written to carry Bangladesh’s history beyond the limits of a single language community. For students of South Asia who read him first in English, Umar appears primarily as a historian of structures, a cartographer of class conflict and a translator who understood translation as an intellectual act. In the notice of his passing, Bangladeshi outlets described him as a public intellectual, researcher and teacher. These are apt terms but, to readers abroad, he is inseparable from the project of explaining East Pakistan and Bangladesh to the outside world, in the language that academic debates now most often use. Bangladesh intellectual Badruddin Umar, who passed away in September, was often dubbed a leftist theorist. But his real legacy is scholarly: one that gives international readers an empirically grounded view of the country’s contested past BEYOND NATIONALIST NARRATIVES The clearest portal into Umar’s English-language corpus is his two-volume study, published by Oxford University Press. The Emergence of Bangladesh, subtitled Class Struggles in East Pakistan 1947–1958, reconstructs the first post-Partition decade through newspapers, election records, union minutes, memoirs and government papers. It is a historian’s book with a sociologist’s questions. What kinds of class coalitions formed in East Bengal? How were their interests translated into the idioms of language, region and religion? How did policy and police shape the boundaries of legitimate dissent? Umar’s answer is pointed and empirical. He argues that the story has too often been told as a quarrel between two geographic “wings”, when the decisive conflicts were closer to the ground — in fields, mills and universities. The companion volume, The Emergence of Bangladesh Vol 2: Rise of Bengali Nationalism 1958–1971, resumes the story under martial law and follows it into the crowded politics of the sixties. It discusses contested agrarian change, the maturing of a Bengali middle class, and the growth of an oppositional public sphere, in which language, culture and class converged. If Volume 1 is a ledger of struggles that the state could still contain, Volume 2 is a chronicle of why it ultimately could not. In both volumes, Umar’s voice is quietly polemical. He is sceptical of narratives that flatten class antagonisms into regional grievances. One early passage challenges the fashionable mid-century talk of “disparity” between the two wings by insisting that the real divisions lay elsewhere. It is an analytic move, taking terms of nationalism and turning them back towards class. In Volume 1, he tracks the ‘Language Movement’ through the strikes, demonstrations and pamphleteering that gave it organisational form. What is striking is not just the detail but the care with which peasant and worker experiences are interpolated into a story that could easily have been told only as a tale of student leaders and capital-city eloquence. Because scholars outside Bangladesh often encounter him first in English, Umar’s journal essays matter as much as his books. In the late 1990s, he wrote a cluster of interventions for Economic & Political Weekly in Mumbai — pieces with titles that still circulate on reading lists. ‘Bangladesh: Intellectuals, Culture and Ruling Class’, ‘Peace in the Hills’, and ‘The Anti-Heroes of the Language Movement’ are just a couple of examples. These are less archival than the Oxford volumes but no less revealing of his method. In interviews, he would say, in substance, that writing across languages unsettled the hierarchy between a metropolitan centre and a linguistic periphery. This is consistent with the stance one finds in his essays: cultural politics is never just about symbols; it is about the channels through which knowledge is distributed and the audiences that are imagined or excluded. In English newspapers and magazines, he sometimes wrote with a sharper edge. One line of criticism that has been remembered, and sometimes misunderstood for its severity, is his description of Bangladesh’s early constitutional settlement as “a constitution for perpetual emergency.” The phrase is aphoristic but it is not casual; it distils an argument he made across several pieces about the retention of colonial instruments of rule and the concentration of executive power. It is the kind of line that was born to be misquoted and, yet, its survival in public memory says something about the role he played in English-language discourse.
