      "summary_orig": "The Sindh High Court on Friday suspended a notification issued by the University of Karachi (KU) that cancelled the law degree of Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri. The court’s decision came during the hearing of a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri on Monday impugning the decisions of the KU’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate, which cancelled his degree in August last year. The KU registrar, the Sindh advocate general and others appeared before the court as it took up the plea today. They sought more time for submitting their replies on the plea, saying that they had received notices pertaining to the case yesterday. At that, Justice Iqbal Kalhoro remarked, “We are ready to give more time but what if any action is taken against the petitioner during this time? If we accept your request today and any action is taken tomorrow, who will take responsibility in that case?” He further enquired whether the respondents had issued any notice to Jahangiri before “taking action against him”. Noting that questions were being raised on Justice Jahangiri’s degree, the Justice Kalhoro added that he should have been issued a notice if an application was moved against him 30 to 35 years after the issuance of his degree. Judge Kalhoro further stated, “We are not saying that action cannot be taken against him because the law allows it … [but] how can we put someone’s honour at stake? Someone’s life-long earning is at stake here.” The court then adjourned the hearing, seeking replies from respondents on October 24. The petition In his petition, Justice Jahangiri contended that the “illegal and mala fide” cancellation of his LLB degree occurred in the context of his “unflinching judicial independence”. Justice Jahangiri claimed that when the campaign to have him removed through the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) failed, “a new strategy” was adopted by misusing official processes and institutions. He said the degree cancellation became the basis for the IHC’s decision to restrain him from judicial duties. He described the KU Unfair Means Committee’s decision as “shocking and surprising,” noting that the committee revived the issue after 32 years without issuing him a notice or providing reasons. Fake degree controversy The controversy pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s law degree began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations regarding the validity of the degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC . The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016. It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri. Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme. On July 10, 2024, the IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.” As the degree accusations came to light, a writ petition was filed, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer. At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that the petitioner was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC. On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said. The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree. Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself. To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person. On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the Supreme Court (SC). The IHC decision was declared “null and void” by the SC on Sept 30. Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea by Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions challenging the cancellation of his law degree. As lawyers protested the move, the bench also dismissed the set of pleas against the cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree for “non-prosecution”. On Thursday, Justice Jahangiri moved the SC, challenging the SHC ruling of dismissing his application.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Sherani district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday. In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on October 1, security forces conducted an IBO in Sherani on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of [the] operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said. It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in “numerous terrorist activities” in the area. According to the ISPR, a sanitisation operation was underway to eliminate other terrorists in the area. “The security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” it added. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Two reports , issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) on Wednesday, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.",

      "summary_orig": "Former women’s captain Sana Mir has issued a statement after receiving backlash from neighbouring India over saying that one of the Pakistan players included in the team for the Women’s World Cup belonged to Azad Kashmir, saying that things were being “blown out of proportion” and calling for it to not be politicised. The Women’s World Cup is officially being hosted by India while Pakistan are playing their matches in Colombo as per a hybrid model. Mir is part of the ICC’s commentary panel for the Women’s World Cup. During Pakistan’s match against Bangladesh on Thursday, which the Green Team lost, Mir had stated the following about Pakistan player Natalia Pervaiz: “A lot of these players are new, Natalia — who comes from Kashmir, Azad Kashmir — play in Lahore […]. She has to come to Lahore to play most of her cricket there.” According to Times of India , the remark immediately drew reactions across social media, with Indian fans tagging the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) demanding her removal for “allegedly politicising the broadcast”. “What caught even more attention was that Mir initially said ‘Kashmir’, before correcting herself to say ‘Azad Kashmir’,” Hindustan Times reported. Subsequently, in a statement posted on X, Mir — who in June became the first female cricketer in Pakistan to be inducted into the ICC’s Hall of Fame — said: “It’s unfortunate how things are being blown out of proportion and people in sports are being subjected to unnecessary pressure. It is sad that this requires an explanation at public level.” Without taking any names, she said that her comments about a “Pakistan player’s hometown” was only meant to “highlight the challenges she faced of coming from a certain region in Pakistan and her incredible journey”. “It is part of the story telling we do as commentators as where the players come from. I did that today for two other players coming from other regions, too. Please don’t politicise it,” she added. “As a commentator on the World Feed, we are meant to focus on the sport, teams, and players, highlighting inspiring stories of grit and perseverance. There is no malice in my heart or any intention to hurt sentiments,” she said. Along with her post, Mir also shared an image of Pervaiz’s ESPNCricinfo profile which showed her hometown as Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Currently, the page shows her hometown as “Pakistan-administered Kashmir”. “I am also attaching the screen shot of where I research most of my players from, whether from Pakistan or any other country. I realise that they have changed it by now, but this is what I was referring to,” Mir said in her statement. The development comes days after tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over onto the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Men’s Asia Cup staged in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during all three clashes in the tournament. The tensions had culminated in India not accepting the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief. The tournament had seen the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May after India had launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan had denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention .",

      "title_orig": "Can Trump’s plan bring long-term peace to Gaza?",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump’s plan for a ceasefire in Gaza may become a pivotal moment after nearly two years of war. It presents both the opportunity for a short-term cessation of hostilities and a long-term pathway to reordering Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories. In the short-term, if accepted by both Hamas and Israel, it would immediately bring relief to the Palestinian people. That’s the only positive bit for the people of occupied Palestine, in the wake of Israel’s brutal bombardment campaign over the last two years that has killed over 65,000 people and injured more than 165,000 civilians. A hostage-prisoner exchange will also relieve Israeli families. To this end, a template from the temporary ceasefire in January can be adopted. Beyond that, for the long-term, the proposal is way too ambitious, and frankly speaking, unworkable. Intractable conflicts aren’t resolved suddenly through sketchy plans. Politics is difficult to square across Palestine, Israel and the Muslim world. And while this ‘peace plan’ has been drawn up following considerable pressure from across the globe, eventually President Trump’s focus will shift away to the next crisis and then, implementation will become even more challenging. Ironically, the plan doesn’t even attempt to hold Israel accountable for its indiscriminate bombing of civilians, especially children over the past two years. Ceasefire: Realistic yet elusive For the people of Gaza and occupied territories, the two urgent priorities are a ceasefire agreement, followed by the resumption of aid. At this point, they cannot even think about the long-term mechanics of peace and prosperity. For them, a halt to the ongoing genocide and the indiscriminate bombing of civilians is a daily nightmare. This needs to end now. Until the atrocities are stopped, any concurrence of Israel’s Netanyahu to any version of Trump’s plan is meaningless. Unfortunately, even after Nethanyahu agreed to the American proposal, bombardment in Gaza continued. On Wednesday, the Israeli defence minister issued a final warning to the residents of Gaza city to flee towards the southern part of the strip, as the Israeli military intensified its ground offensive to encircle the city. For the people of Gaza, even the prospect of a ceasefire is elusive, until the strikes continue. For a realistic and sustainable ceasefire, a mechanism that places limitations on Israel’s military activity should have been included in the plan. Absent that, all substantive demands — political, military and governance — are being presented to Hamas as a fait accompli . The reason being: desperation of external stakeholders, especially regional actors, to broker a ceasefire where the fighting stops, even at the cost of the long-term interests of the Palestinian people. Enter the Muslim world and the US In recent weeks, as global diplomacy picked pace in New York on the sidelines of the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly , focus remained on the humanitarian crisis and the ongoing genocide in Gaza. To respond to global rage, the US leadership engaged leaders of leading Muslim-majority countries, even outside the Arab world, to craft a new plan that would achieve both: a ceasefire and an attempt at a long-term mechanism for peace. The original goal has been short-term — secure a ceasefire, at any cost, while the long-term details are ironed out. Qatar’s leadership has stated as much on the record, giving an insight into the motivations behind the frantic diplomacy witnessed in recent days. At a certain level, Israel and the US are adapting to the growing public pressure by Western and Muslim countries for establishing a ceasefire. Israel’s international isolation has been growing and was on stark display during the annual session of the UN General Assembly, where Saudi-France efforts to recognise a Palestinian state and push for a two-state solution dominated the diplomacy. For Gulf countries, especially Qatar, the Israeli airstrike in Doha proved to be a jolt: if war lingers, it can even reach secure cities of the Gulf. For President Trump, the relentless Israeli strikes and expanding ground invasion of Gaza undercut his pitch for the Nobel Peace prize: how could President Trump claim to have achieved world peace when a genocide in Gaza continues? By consenting to the American and Arab-backed peace proposal, Israel is tactically changing the story in the court of international public opinion. After the ceasefire: Challenge for Arab and Muslim leaders The first part of the 20-point plan aims to establish a ceasefire in Gaza’s territory followed by a hostage-prisoner exchange and resumption of humanitarian aid. Beyond that, it ventures into disarming Hamas, reordering governance in Gaza and the West Bank, and establishing a new security mechanism. It envisions managing the security of the occupied Palestinian territories by a multi-national International Stabilisation Force, in coordination with the Israeli military, while a Board of Peace comprising Trump and Tony Blair and a technocratic apolitical Palestinian administration implement the plan and run the region. The multi-pronged plan, in its current form, is a vision that requires deliberations on each aspect between different Palestinian factions, and among the regional stakeholders. To implement the plan would require sustainable oversight and empowered regional or international mechanism. In its current form, the plan appears to be a package proposed to secure a ceasefire by advancing aspirational ideas for the end-state of Gaza and occupied Palestinian territories. Even the end-state envisioned in the plan is problematic, as it pushes an unsustainable and asymmetric peace deal. The fragility of the plan is manifested by shifting positions of Arab and Muslim countries, where notably Pakistan and Qatar have stated on the record that the document released by the White House has been modified without consultation with regional partners. Crucially, Doha is stressing that details on future mechanics can be worked out later, while a ceasefire is realised now. This will create a new status-quo where a conditional ceasefire may be secured while the implementation of the plan will stay in limbo until the finer details are worked out. Politics of the next steps Beyond immediate ceasefire concerns, each stakeholder involved in framing the peace deal, as well as the parties who are expected to implement the plan will be guided by their own political imperatives and constraints. For Israel, the deal in its current form as released by the White House, gives it a decisive veto over the future trajectory of the occupied Palestinian territories. The timeframe and guarantees related to the withdrawal of the Israeli military from Gaza are vague, and this can enable Netanyahu to own the deal politically, while boasting that Israel can begin military operations again, if it so wishes. For Hamas, it is a decisive moment, where its future role either as a military force or a political movement will be determined. As Hamas faces pressure from its key partners — Qatar and Turkey — to agree to the ceasefire, its leadership will find it difficult to accept the full framework being advocated by the US and the regional countries. Any amendments proposed by Hamas to its future role will complicate the viability of the fragile agreement and make the task of the Trump administration and mediating parties difficult. On its part, Hamas will continue to be a formidable force in Gazan society though its current bargaining position is under strain. Beyond Israel and Hamas, the leading Muslim countries have entered uncharted territory. In their bid to secure a ceasefire and avert the displacement of Gazans from their territory, Muslim countries cannot become accessory to enabling Israel’s permanent military occupation. Moreover, by shifting the responsibility of ensuring that Hamas agrees to the peace plan, the US has put Muslim leaders in the political spotlight — if Hamas doesn’t agree to the framework draft, then the onus of escalation in Israeli military activity rests with Hamas and Muslim countries. Conversely, even if the plan is implemented in some shape, then Muslim countries, especially Pakistan, Turkey and Indonesia, will have to engage with Israel on security coordination of the Gaza and West Bank, which will spark its own new challenges, both domestically and across the region. The Gulf states will provide both diplomatic support and economic resources for rebuilding Gaza and the rehabilitation of Gazans, but they will likely not take on security responsibilities. Peacebuilding is inherently chaotic, as witnessed in recent days. Crucially, peacebuilding requires patience and continuous engagement by all parties, and these are the two elements that are currently missing. For a peace initiative to be sustainable across Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories, it must have political ownership of the people of Palestine . Absent that, all efforts will only lead to a temporary cessation of hostilities until the next round.

      "title_en": "Can Trump’s plan bring long-term peace to Gaza?",
      "summary_en": "US President Donald Trump’s plan for a ceasefire in Gaza may become a pivotal moment after nearly two years of war. It presents both the opportunity for a short-term cessation of hostilities and a long-term pathway to reordering Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories. In the short-term, if accepted by both Hamas and Israel, it would immediately bring relief to the Palestinian people. That’s the only positive bit for the people of occupied Palestine, in the wake of Israel’s brutal bombardment campaign over the last two years that has killed over 65,000 people and injured more than 165,000 civilians. A hostage-prisoner exchange will also relieve Israeli families. To this end, a template from the temporary ceasefire in January can be adopted. Beyond that, for the long-term, the proposal is way too ambitious, and frankly speaking, unworkable. Intractable conflicts aren’t resolved suddenly through sketchy plans. Politics is difficult to square across Palestine, Israel and the Muslim world. And while this ‘peace plan’ has been drawn up following considerable pressure from across the globe, eventually President Trump’s focus will shift away to the next crisis and then, implementation will become even more challenging. Ironically, the plan doesn’t even attempt to hold Israel accountable for its indiscriminate bombing of civilians, especially children over the past two years. Ceasefire: Realistic yet elusive For the people of Gaza and occupied territories, the two urgent priorities are a ceasefire agreement, followed by the resumption of aid. At this point, they cannot even think about the long-term mechanics of peace and prosperity. For them, a halt to the ongoing genocide and the indiscriminate bombing of civilians is a daily nightmare. This needs to end now. Until the atrocities are stopped, any concurrence of Israel’s Netanyahu to any version of Trump’s plan is meaningless. Unfortunately, even after Nethanyahu agreed to the American proposal, bombardment in Gaza continued. On Wednesday, the Israeli defence minister issued a final warning to the residents of Gaza city to flee towards the southern part of the strip, as the Israeli military intensified its ground offensive to encircle the city.

      "summary_orig": "CRICKET between India and Pakistan is not just a sporting rivalry. It is a complex conflict shaped by the tortured history of South Asia. Sports, in essence, are a form of make-believe in which the visceral human urge to compete and clash is channelled into a set of mutually agreed rules within acceptable norms of safety and civility. When sporting encounters are surrounded by outright hostility in virtually every other sphere of life, the bounds of civility are likely to get breached. This is what happened over the course of three India-Pakistan games during last week’s Asia Cup tournament. At one level, petulant Indian antics, such as refusing to shake hands or declining to accept their hard-won trophy from a Pakistani official, can be seen as simply bad manners. The deeper truth, however, is that these misbehaviours were knowingly orchestrated for the domestic consumption of a ravenous Indian audience. In fact, India’s ruling political class is left with no other choice, having painted itself into a corner after the reckless adventurism of Operation Sindoor . Their survival now depends on demonising Pakistan and Pakistanis at every step. In Pakistan, the mood is a tangled mix of annoyance, disappointment and incredulity. We feel disrespected by India’s cricketers and disempowered by the ICC, world cricket’s governing body. We find it hard to believe that an evidently thriving neighbour with superpower aspirations would stoop to such misconduct. We are also sick and tired of losing to India. Although the overall tally of matches is still tilted towards Pakistan (across all international formats, Pakistan has been victorious 88 times compared to India’s 79), the record in ICC’s flagship tournaments has been abysmal. India leads 8-0 in ODI World Cup matches and 6-1 in T20 World Cup matches, while the record in Champions Trophy matches stands tied at 3-3. The winless record over 13 iterations of the ODI World Cup, cricket’s premier extravaganza, rankles the most. Ultimately, there is no better strategy than to play the game well. As debate swirls around Pakistan’s latest defeats, three key questions emerge. The most fundamental, of course, is how to become a better and more victorious team. The second is how to manage our cricketing relationship with India. And the third is about what can or should be done at the level of the ICC to ensure that all matches — including specifically India-Pakistan encounters — are played in a spirit of cordiality and dignity. The recipe for cricketing success is no secret. You start with a cricket chief who is duly elected by regional bodies and is accountable to multiple stakeholders including players, administrators and the public. This is not the case at present, because the head of the Pakistan Cricket Board is invariably a handpicked political appointee, often with dubious credentials and unclear motives. The overall result is a hodge-podge national cricketing set-up with a domestic configuration that gets tweaked every season, coaches and support staff that are rotated like musical chairs, and grounds and facilities that remain mediocre if not dismal. We have no confidence in this system’s ability to identify and nurture the best talent that the country has to offer, and to keep their skills at par with the top teams. As for India, it is important to recognise that on account of an astronomical market they are the most dominant force in world cricket today. They are hell-bent on sidelining Pakistan, and we have little leverage in the matter. But their hysterics and theatrics are not going unnoticed. Our best option is to bide time while India comes to terms with its Pakistani demons — some real, some imagined — both on and off the field. Yes, we should take a principled stand to preserve our rightful place in the international game, but we should do it without getting too emotional or reactive. India is an ambitious country with a vigorous and capable intelligentsia; they are bound to come to their senses before too long. Meanwhile, India’s current stranglehold also limits Pakistan’s manoeuvrability within the infrastructure of international cricket. ICC’s website hosts a 44-page document prescribing a code of conduct for players and officials, including a laudatory preamble on the “spirit of cricket” in which respect is paramount. The document itself is appropriate and admirable. But recent India-Pakistan contests have witnessed serial violations of this prescription. The question comes back to who will bell the cat. Ultimately, there is no better strategy than to play the game well. In Dubai last Sunday, Pakistan had worked their way to 113 for 1 at nearly 10 runs per over, and the Indians were starting to look nervous. Then a wicket fell, and another. With no Inzamam or Miandad to stem the tide, Pakistan’s innings collapsed in a heap. Still, when India came out to reply, Pakistan’s opening attack dismissed their top three batters for only 20 on the board. After that a missed run out here, a dropped catch there, and some loose bowling at the death, saw India edge ahead – albeit with only two balls to spare. To have come this close in such a pressure-cooker match against a superior opponent despite the omnipresent chaos and disarray of Pakistan cricket represents a silver lining from which we can take heart. Our raw talent pool faces multiple headwinds in the form of poor governance, the misfortune of a hostile cricketing behemoth in the neighborhood, and an impatient and unforgiving fan base. Nevertheless, there is reason to be optimistic. The need of the hour is to empower regional cricket associations; instill a culture of integrity and merit; pour money into infrastructure and facilities; and develop a comprehensive grassroots programme to identify future stars and popularise the game. Pakistan casts a long and imposing shadow on the game, with a pantheon of heroes and legends achieving much greatness and glory. It’s been done before; there is no reason why it cannot be done again.

This is not the case at present, because the head of the Pakistan Cricket Board is invariably a handpicked political appointee, often with dubious credentials and unclear motives. The overall result is a hodge-podge national cricketing set-up with a domestic configuration that gets tweaked every season, coaches and support staff that are rotated like musical chairs, and grounds and facilities that remain mediocre if not dismal. We have no confidence in this system’s ability to identify and nurture the best talent that the country has to offer, and to keep their skills at par with the top teams. As for India, it is important to recognise that on account of an astronomical market they are the most dominant force in world cricket today. They are hell-bent on sidelining Pakistan, and we have little leverage in the matter. But their hysterics and theatrics are not going unnoticed. Our best option is to bide time while India comes to terms with its Pakistani demons — some real, some imagined — both on and off the field. Yes, we should take a principled stand to preserve our rightful place in the international game, but we should do it without getting too emotional or reactive. India is an ambitious country with a vigorous and capable intelligentsia; they are bound to come to their senses before too long. Meanwhile, India’s current stranglehold also limits Pakistan’s manoeuvrability within the infrastructure of international cricket. ICC’s website hosts a 44-page document prescribing a code of conduct for players and officials, including a laudatory preamble on the “spirit of cricket” in which respect is paramount. The document itself is appropriate and admirable. But recent India-Pakistan contests have witnessed serial violations of this prescription. The question comes back to who will bell the cat. Ultimately, there is no better strategy than to play the game well. In Dubai last Sunday, Pakistan had worked their way to 113 for 1 at nearly 10 runs per over, and the Indians were starting to look nervous. Then a wicket fell, and another. With no Inzamam or Miandad to stem the tide, Pakistan’s innings collapsed in a heap. Still, when India came out to reply, Pakistan’s opening attack dismissed their top three batters for only 20 on the board. After that a missed run out here, a dropped catch there, and some loose bowling at the death, saw India edge ahead – albeit with only two balls to spare. To have come this close in such a pressure-cooker match against a superior opponent despite the omnipresent chaos and disarray of Pakistan cricket represents a silver lining from which we can take heart. Our raw talent pool faces multiple headwinds in the form of poor governance, the misfortune of a hostile cricketing behemoth in the neighborhood, and an impatient and unforgiving fan base. Nevertheless, there is reason to be optimistic. The need of the hour is to empower regional cricket associations; instill a culture of integrity and merit; pour money into infrastructure and facilities; and develop a comprehensive grassroots programme to identify future stars and popularise the game. Pakistan casts a long and imposing shadow on the game, with a pantheon of heroes and legends achieving much greatness and glory. It’s been done before; there is no reason why it cannot be done again.

      "summary_orig": "• PM Shehbaz dispatches eight-member team to Muzaffarabad • Calls for peace, orders restraint by LEAs, seeks probe into deaths • AJK paralysed by fourth day of strike, communications blackout • Funerals in Muzaffarabad galvanise crowds; locals demand justice over alleged police firing MUZAFFARABAD: A high-level government delegation held negotiations with a civil society alliance in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Thursday after days of fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers that have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured. The eight-member committee, dispatched by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, comprises federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Amir Muq­am, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Rana Sanaullah and Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, along with PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf and Qamar Zaman Kaira, and former AJK president Sardar Masood Khan. They were accompanied by AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, who had been staying at Kashmir House in Islamabad for the past several days. Negotiations began in the committee room of the Chief Secretary’s office in the afternoon, with Shaukat Nawaz Mir, Raja Amjad Ali Khan and Anjum Zaman Awan from the Muzaffarabad division representing the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), which has been spearheading the rights movement in the territory. However, core members from the other two divisions — Poonch and Mirpur — could not immediately join the negotiations as they were away from the capital. Sources said the Muzaffarabad trio, along with other core members, later left for Dhirkot, where their colleagues from Poonch and Mirpur had already gathered for consultations. The meeting continued until late in the night on Thursday and talks with the government’s high-level committee were expected to resume on Friday morning. A strike has paralysed Azad Jammu and Kashmir under a communications blackout after talks over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats collapsed between the JKJAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers, sparking protests and violence. On Wed­nesday, the AJK prime minister and Parliamentary Affairs Mini­ster Tariq Fazal Chaudhry invited the alliance for fresh dialogue. On Thursday, the entire region observed a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike for the fourth consecutive day, under a ceaseless communications blackout imposed since Monday. No fresh incidents of violence were reported. Though government offices and banks technically remained open, attendance was negligible. Interestingly, many government officials avoided using official vehicles for commuting and instead preferred to walk or use rented motorcycles. ‘Enemies of Pakistan’ Before the delegation left for AJK capital Muzaffarabad, members of the government negotiating committee spoke to the media in Islamabad and stressed the need for dialogue to end the unrest that has gripped AJK for the past three days, Dawn.com reported. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the government should play its role to address the issues in AJK. However, he added that given the present situation in the region and the world, some “elements would want to disturb peace and stability in Pakistan to push forward their agendas”. He said the government remained committed to resolving the issues of the people of AJK, but they should also be mindful that no such situation was being created, which “Pakistan’s enemies” could take advantage of. AJK PM Haq thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz for issuing directives for sending a “high-level delegation” for restarting talks in the region and expressed the hope that members of the JKJAAC would also work towards ending the impasse in negotiations between the two sides. Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said, “We are all saddened and concerned over the situation. We will try our best to fulfil the just demands of the people of Kashmir and steer them out of the current situation at the earliest as the enemies of Pakistan and Kashmir would have their own objectives.” Rana Sanaullah also emphasised that “violence is not the solution” to any problem. He said they aimed to resolve the matters in accordance with the law and Constitution, ensuring the restoration and maintenance of peace. Amir Muqam also thanked PM Shehbaz for addressing the issue. “We want the protest and the difficulties of the people of Kashmir to end. We hope that [JKJAAC] members would consider this … and engage with us for talks.” Sardar Muhammad Yousuf, Qamar Zaman Kaira and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also shared similar views. The Ministry of Interior also convened an important meeting in Islamabad on Thursday to consider steps to defuse the situation. PM calls for peace According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on X earlier on Thursday, PM Shehbaz had directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad. According to the statement, the prime minister voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in AJK as Wednesday’s violent protests left three policemen dead. He urged citizens to remain peaceful and instructed law enforcement agencies to show restraint. “The prime minister has made a strong appeal to citizens to remain peaceful. He has urged that peaceful protest is the constitutional and democratic right of every citizen, but protesters should refrain from causing harm to public order.” The premier also directed that law enforcement agencies exercise restraint and patience with the protesters. “The prime minister has said that respect for public sentiments must be ensured, and any unnecessary harshness should be avoided,” the statement said, adding that the government was always ready to address the issues of its Kashmiri brothers. Expressing “deep concern over the unfortunate incidents during the protests”, the premier ordered a transparent investigation into the matter. Funerals in Muzaffarabad Earlier in the day, hundreds of people gathered at Khurshid Football Stadium and the AJK capital’s famous Lala Chowk to attend the funerals of two people killed in an alleged police firing in Muzaffarabad. Addressing the mourners, Mr Mir of JKJAAC updated the crowd on the latest developments, vowing that the struggle would continue until the acceptance of key demands. These include the abolition of 12 refugee seats, withdrawal of elite privileges, implementation of a June 2019 High Court decision regarding agreements on power projects in AJK, and provision of health cards. He stressed that before discussing these issues, the alliance would demand the immediate arrest and exemplary punishment of those responsible for killing “unarmed protesters” in Muzaffarabad, Dhirkot and other areas of AJK. He also sought a public mandate to engage in negotiations with the official committee, pledging that there would be no compromise on people’s rights. Reports from Kohala, a border town about 35km away, said that thousands of people from AJK’s southern districts had reached there by evening. A source told Dawn that JKJAAC leaders had directed the crowd to wait in Kohala until further instructions after the conclusion of their consultations. Published in Dawn, October 3rd, 2025",

The eight-member committee, dispatched by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, comprises federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Amir Muq­am, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Rana Sanaullah and Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, along with PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf and Qamar Zaman Kaira, and former AJK president Sardar Masood Khan. They were accompanied by AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, who had been staying at Kashmir House in Islamabad for the past several days. Negotiations began in the committee room of the Chief Secretary’s office in the afternoon, with Shaukat Nawaz Mir, Raja Amjad Ali Khan and Anjum Zaman Awan from the Muzaffarabad division representing the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), which has been spearheading the rights movement in the territory. However, core members from the other two divisions — Poonch and Mirpur — could not immediately join the negotiations as they were away from the capital. Sources said the Muzaffarabad trio, along with other core members, later left for Dhirkot, where their colleagues from Poonch and Mirpur had already gathered for consultations. The meeting continued until late in the night on Thursday and talks with the government’s high-level committee were expected to resume on Friday morning. A strike has paralysed Azad Jammu and Kashmir under a communications blackout after talks over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats collapsed between the JKJAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers, sparking protests and violence. On Wed­nesday, the AJK prime minister and Parliamentary Affairs Mini­ster Tariq Fazal Chaudhry invited the alliance for fresh dialogue. On Thursday, the entire region observed a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike for the fourth consecutive day, under a ceaseless communications blackout imposed since Monday. No fresh incidents of violence were reported. Though government offices and banks technically remained open, attendance was negligible. Interestingly, many government officials avoided using official vehicles for commuting and instead preferred to walk or use rented motorcycles. ‘Enemies of Pakistan’ Before the delegation left for AJK capital Muzaffarabad, members of the government negotiating committee spoke to the media in Islamabad and stressed the need for dialogue to end the unrest that has gripped AJK for the past three days, Dawn.com reported. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the government should play its role to address the issues in AJK. However, he added that given the present situation in the region and the world, some “elements would want to disturb peace and stability in Pakistan to push forward their agendas”. He said the government remained committed to resolving the issues of the people of AJK, but they should also be mindful that no such situation was being created, which “Pakistan’s enemies” could take advantage of. AJK PM Haq thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz for issuing directives for sending a “high-level delegation” for restarting talks in the region and expressed the hope that members of the JKJAAC would also work towards ending the impasse in negotiations between the two sides. Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said, “We are all saddened and concerned over the situation. We will try our best to fulfil the just demands of the people of Kashmir and steer them out of the current situation at the earliest as the enemies of Pakistan and Kashmir would have their own objectives.” Rana Sanaullah also emphasised that “violence is not the solution” to any problem. He said they aimed to resolve the matters in accordance with the law and Constitution, ensuring the restoration and maintenance of peace. Amir Muqam also thanked PM Shehbaz for addressing the issue. “We want the protest and the difficulties of the people of Kashmir to end. We hope that [JKJAAC] members would consider this … and engage with us for talks.” Sardar Muhammad Yousuf, Qamar Zaman Kaira and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also shared similar views. The Ministry of Interior also convened an important meeting in Islamabad on Thursday to consider steps to defuse the situation. PM calls for peace According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on X earlier on Thursday, PM Shehbaz had directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad. According to the statement, the prime minister voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in AJK as Wednesday’s violent protests left three policemen dead.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Media watchdog Freedom Network, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), and other rights groups have condemned a government advertisement in major newspapers for portraying journalists, freelancers, NGO workers, and civil society actors as “threats” or instruments of “enemy propaganda” under the label of “information warfare.” The ad, issued by the Ministry of Information on Oct 1 and 2, appeared to warn social media users of an “enemy hiding behind the veil of technology and the internet”. According to the ad, “Sometimes disguised as a reporter, sometimes as an NGO worker or freelancer, he extracts sensitive information from you that brings unrest, fear, and chaos to our streets.” “Whoever wrote, designed and approved this ad has endangered the lives of journalists and civil society workers by depicting them as threats to national security. At a time when the media is already under intense pressure, this narrative is reckless and dangerous,” Freedom Network said in a statement released on Thursday. The organisation expressed serious concern over the ad’s reference to reporters, freelancers, and civil society organisations, calling it “deeply troubling”. The statement said it stigmatises journalists, undermines independent media, and amounts to a direct attack on press freedom guaranteed under Article 19. Freedom Network further warned that the ad fuels hostility against individuals who deliver reliable information to the public. The statement warned the campaign further endangers journalists already facing threats, harassment, and violence. The half-page advertisement carried the headline: “Have you ever wondered what war looks like today?” It went on to declare: “Today, war is no longer fought on the battlefield. It is fought in our minds. The enemy’s bullets are no longer gunpowder … it’s information.” The statement said the ad comes amid growing government pressure on social media, especially after an opposition leader’s jailing, adding that the crackdown on dissent has intensified nationwide. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the Women’s Action Forum (Lahore), Shirkat Gah-Women’s Resource Centre, South Asia Partnership-Pakistan, Simorgh, and the Centre for Legal Aid, Assistance and Settlement (CLAAS) have also strongly condemned the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s advertisement.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the Women’s Action Forum (Lahore), Shirkat Gah-Women’s Resource Centre, South Asia Partnership-Pakistan, Simorgh, and the Centre for Legal Aid, Assistance and Settlement (CLAAS) have also strongly condemned the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s advertisement.

      "title": "Civil society slams ad targeting journalists, NGOs",
      "summary": "ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Media watchdog Freedom Network, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), and other rights groups have condemned a government advertisement in major newspapers for portraying journalists, freelancers, NGO workers, and civil society actors as “threats” or instruments of “enemy propaganda” under the label of “information warfare.” The ad, issued by the Ministry of Information on Oct 1 and 2, appeared to warn social media users of an “enemy hiding behind the veil of technology and the internet”. According to the ad, “Sometimes disguised as a reporter, sometimes as an NGO worker or freelancer, he extracts sensitive information from you that brings unrest, fear, and chaos to our streets.” “Whoever wrote, designed and approved this ad has endangered the lives of journalists and civil society workers by depicting them as threats to national security. At a time when the media is already under intense pressure, this narrative is reckless and dangerous,” Freedom Network said in a statement released on Thursday. The organisation expressed serious concern over the ad’s reference to reporters, freelancers, and civil society organisations, calling it “deeply troubling”. The statement said it stigmatises journalists, undermines independent media, and amounts to a direct attack on press freedom guaranteed under Article 19. Freedom Network further warned that the ad fuels hostility against individuals who deliver reliable information to the public. The statement warned the campaign further endangers journalists already facing threats, harassment, and violence. The half-page advertisement carried the headline: “Have you ever wondered what war looks like today?” It went on to declare: “Today, war is no longer fought on the battlefield. It is fought in our minds. The enemy’s bullets are no longer gunpowder … it’s information.” The statement said the ad comes amid growing government pressure on social media, especially after an opposition leader’s jailing, adding that the crackdown on dissent has intensified nationwide. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the Women’s Action Forum (Lahore), Shirkat Gah-Women’s Resource Centre, South Asia Partnership-Pakistan, Simorgh, and the Centre for Legal Aid, Assistance and Settlement (CLAAS) have also strongly condemned the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s advertisement.

The force posted on X saying police were called to the synagogue, on Middleton Road, Crumpsall, at 9.31am by a member of the public , stating he had witnessed a car being driven towards members of the public and one man had been stabbed. Police said four people have suffered injuries caused by a vehicle and stabbings at a synagogue in Crumpsall , north Manchester . A cordon has been set up after the incident , and a major road had been closed while officers attended. Paramedics are at the scene. Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, said the “immediate danger appears to be over” after reports of a “serious incident”. Burnham has told BBC Radio Manchester that “it is believed” that the attacker is dead. However, he says this “is not confirmed” yet. Sources say it is being treated as a potential terrorist incident. Counter-terrorism police and MI5, the security service covering the UK, have joined the investigation. Greater Manchester police say Operation Plato was declared, meaning the violence was treated as a potential marauding terrorist attack. The attack was branded an “appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year” by the Community Security Trust (CST). CST is working with police and the local Jewish community following a serious incident at a synagogue in north Manchester. This appears to be an appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday ordered an inquiry into a raid carried out by Islamabad police at the National Press Club (NPC), where several journalists were allegedly attacked. Visuals aired on DawnNewsTV showed policemen armed with batons attacking journalists on the press club premises. Visuals shared on social media also showed police dragging journalists out of what appeared to be the cafeteria. View this post on Instagram Another video shared by a Dawn.com correspondent showed a journalist holding his broken Nikon camera and his shirt ripped across the back. A statement issued by Naqvi stated that he had taken notice of the “unfortunate” incident and demanded a report from the Islamabad inspector general of police. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” he was quoted as saying. “Disciplinary action must be taken against officials involved in the incident,” he said. Meanwhile, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) President Afzal Butt held a press conference alongside Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry at the National Press Club. He said that during the police raid, when the press club’s office-bearers tried to intervene and resolve the matter, they were “beaten and tortured”. “They even arrested two people, who were later released,” Butt added. He added that multiple people at the scene pointed out that they had to get the police to release them. “Today’s incident is a matter of now or never for us,” Butt said. He announced that the PFUJ had called an “emergency session”, where “we will consult and chalk out our demands about what the government needs to do to prevent what the police did today. “We will also decide our course of action and announce it after the meeting.” Butt said, “We always avoid confrontation with political parties. Our friends were very angry … but I controlled them … Something like this has never happened before. “That you enter a photographer’s house — the press club is their second home […] that you enter his home without permission, beat him and break his camera and mobile phone. This has never happened before.” Butt alleged that even the members of the press club’s management and its office-bearers were “beaten”. “This is not only the Islamabad press club’s issue. Press clubs across Pakistan are of the view that if they turn a blind eye to this worst of the worst incident, similar incidents could happen in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta. “That is why we will first consult our friends here and then across Pakistan. We will then decide our plan of action and put forward our demands.” For his part, Chaudhry said he condemned the incident and apologised for it. “Please consider this when you hold your meeting,” he said, assuring that he was also ready to meet them again after their meeting. Chaudhry’s office also issued a statement unconditionally apologising for the incident, adding that it happened “suddenly”. “Some people from the [JAAC] were protesting [and] some of their people had manhandled police personnel,” the statement read. “When they tried to arrest these people, the police chased them. The police came to the Press Club to arrest the protesters who misbehaved with [officers].” The statement added that Chaudhry had ordered an internal inquiry into the incident. Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar called the incident “regrettable” in a statement, vowing that a comprehensive investigation would be carried out. “Interior Minister Naqvi did not order police to enter the press club,” he was quoted as saying. “The National Press Club is my home and I stand with it,” he said. Journalist bodies held another press conference at the NPC later, where Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists President Tariq Virk said journalists across the country stood united after the police raid at NPC. He alleged that “Islamabad police personnel had not come to the press club on their own accord but were sent here”. “They inflicted violence on journalists inside the press club. They even tortured and arrested an ailing employee of the club,” he alleged, vowing to “adopt such a plan of action” that nobody would resort to this “rogue behaviour” in future. PFUJ President Butt said today was one of the “darkest days in Pakistan’s history”. “The attack on the National Press Club was an attack on media freedom,” he said, adding that members of journalist bodies had participated in the meeting held after the police raid. “We will prepare a strategy after consulting all journalist bodies.” Butt further stated that journalists in other cities had also protested the raid at NPC and that “if the National Press Club was not safe from police, then no other press club was”. Butt reiterated his allegation that cameras and mobile phones were snatched and broken during the incident. He announced that a “black day” would be observed across the country tomorrow, and black flags would be hoisted at the press clubs all across Pakistan. “The journalists are very angry at the moment. It has been suggested that we get first information reports registered in which some bigwigs are nominated,” he said. Journalist’s account of raid Journalist Shiraz Gardezi, who is associated with Geo News and also the senior joint secretary of the NPC, shared an account of the raid with Dawn.com . Gardezi said the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) — which has also been holding demonstrations in Azad Kashmir — had issued a call for a protest at the press club. “As soon as the demonstration began, they (police) surrounded the protesters,” he narrated. Gardezi, who was at the NPC to cover the protest, said police stopped them from doing so. “Because they were torturing, beating and dragging people,” he alleged, adding that they even tried to snatch mobile phones and cameras from some of the journalists. According to him, they even dragged and tried to take away some of the journalists with them, but they were let go after some other journalists intervened. “We then asked the journalists to stay on the back foot and keep themselves safe,” he said. Later, he continued, “We heard loud bangs while sitting inside the press club. They (police) kicked the doors open and stormed inside”. Shirazi narrated that the police broke various things in the cafeteria and “beat and tortured” people. This time, too, the police tried to take away some journalists, but they were “rescued”. Police raid termed ‘terrorism’ In a joint statement, the PFUJ, Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors and Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors termed the police raid at the NPC “terrorism”. They also demanded immediate action against those “involved in the incident”. The statement said journalist organisations saw this incident as a continuation of a series of actions ongoing against journalists. It highlighted that for the past few days, advertisements were being run under the title of ‘Have you ever thought what the state of war is?’ They alleged that “government” was behind these advertisements. “Threatening tone is used in these advertisements, and reporters, freelancers and social organisations related to the media are listed as anti-state. Its objective is to tarnish the character of journalists, pressurise them and curb the freedom of expression.” The journalists’ bodies demanded that the publication of these advertisements should immediately stop. They also expressed the view that the “excessive use” of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act had proved the concerns of multiple journalists to be true. “The act is being used to employ all tactics for suppressing government critics and curbing the freedom of expression,” they alleged. The Lahore Press Club also issued a condemnatory statement, demanding from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that police personnel involved in the raid be immediately suspended and arrested. The statement said strict legal action should be taken against them, otherwise journalists across Pakistan would stage protests. ‘Shameful and condemnable’ The incident also sparked outrage on social media as journalists decried the assault. In a post on X, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the “assault on journalists by Islamabad police” at the National Press Club. “HRCP strongly condemns the raid on the National Press Club and [the] assault on journalists by the Islamabad police,” the rights group wrote in a post on X. “We demand an immediate inquiry and those responsible brought to book.” Journalist Hamid Mir stated that police were trying to arrest members of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) and that they had “targeted journalists present in the cafeteria”. “This is totally uncalled for and condemnable,” said journalist Syed Talat Hussain. “As if there aren’t enough fronts open. To treat the National Press Club as a criminal hideout and then use violence on its premises is madness without any method,” he said. Journalist Matiullah Jan condemned the incident in a post on X, calling it “extremely shameful and condemnable”. “This incident is [a product] of the incompetence and cowardice of the club administration,” Jan wrote. “The press club is the home of journalists, where it is disgraceful for the police to barge into the cafeteria with batons and attack people,” he said. Journalist Anas Mallick, who works with TV channel Asia One , alleged that police had raided the club to arrest Kashmiri journalists covering a “call to protest” by the JAAC, adding that the police were “acting like thugs”. Journalist Zebunnisa Burki called visuals emerging from the raid “insane” and added that journalists were being attacked by police inside the press club itself. PTI MNA from Malakand, Junaid Akbar, also condemned the raid. “Islamabad police storming the National Press Club and their violence against Kashmiri protesters and journalists is shameful and condemnable. An attack on the press club is an attack on the freedom of expression,” he said in a post on X. Veteran journalist Mazhar Abbas said the police action at the NPC reminded him of the days of military dictators Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf. “This act, rather an attack, on the Press Club, baton-charge and arrest, including some employees of the club, is simply unacceptable,” he wrote on X. Human rights defender Tahira Abdullah called the incident “shocking,” stressing that a mere verbal apology from federal government representatives was unacceptable, especially when paired with the routine promises of an “inquiry.” She demanded concrete measures, including the arrest and prosecution of all police personnel involved, along with their superiors who ordered the action; a written apology from the federal interior minister with a guarantee that such violations of press clubs and journalists would never be repeated; and compensation to cover the replacement of damaged cameras, equipment, and furnishings at the NPC. Prominent human rights lawyer Muhammad Jibran Nasir said that the “government apologised because it was journalists in general who got assaulted in the presence of cameras”. “But they came hunting for activists supporting the protest in AJK. Imagine the barbarity inflicted upon them in the clashes in the past four days. You being a citizen does not matter. You being essential to the State’s cause matters. The State has never apologised for abducting, assaulting and arresting journalists who oppose State policies,” he wrote on X. Additional reporting by Rana Bilal",

Later, he continued, “We heard loud bangs while sitting inside the press club. They (police) kicked the doors open and stormed inside”. Shirazi narrated that the police broke various things in the cafeteria and “beat and tortured” people. This time, too, the police tried to take away some journalists, but they were “rescued”. Police raid termed ‘terrorism’ In a joint statement, the PFUJ, Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors and Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors termed the police raid at the NPC “terrorism”. They also demanded immediate action against those “involved in the incident”. The statement said journalist organisations saw this incident as a continuation of a series of actions ongoing against journalists. It highlighted that for the past few days, advertisements were being run under the title of ‘Have you ever thought what the state of war is?’ They alleged that “government” was behind these advertisements. “Threatening tone is used in these advertisements, and reporters, freelancers and social organisations related to the media are listed as anti-state. Its objective is to tarnish the character of journalists, pressurise them and curb the freedom of expression.” The journalists’ bodies demanded that the publication of these advertisements should immediately stop. They also expressed the view that the “excessive use” of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act had proved the concerns of multiple journalists to be true. “The act is being used to employ all tactics for suppressing government critics and curbing the freedom of expression,” they alleged. The Lahore Press Club also issued a condemnatory statement, demanding from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that police personnel involved in the raid be immediately suspended and arrested. The statement said strict legal action should be taken against them, otherwise journalists across Pakistan would stage protests. ‘Shameful and condemnable’ The incident also sparked outrage on social media as journalists decried the assault. In a post on X, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the “assault on journalists by Islamabad police” at the National Press Club. “HRCP strongly condemns the raid on the National Press Club and [the] assault on journalists by the Islamabad police,” the rights group wrote in a post on X. “We demand an immediate inquiry and those responsible brought to book.” Journalist Hamid Mir stated that police were trying to arrest members of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) and that they had “targeted journalists present in the cafeteria”. “This is totally uncalled for and condemnable,” said journalist Syed Talat Hussain. “As if there aren’t enough fronts open. To treat the National Press Club as a criminal hideout and then use violence on its premises is madness without any method,” he said. Journalist Matiullah Jan condemned the incident in a post on X, calling it “extremely shameful and condemnable”. “This incident is [a product] of the incompetence and cowardice of the club administration,” Jan wrote. “The press club is the home of journalists, where it is disgraceful for the police to barge into the cafeteria with batons and attack people,” he said. Journalist Anas Mallick, who works with TV channel Asia One , alleged that police had raided the club to arrest Kashmiri journalists covering a “call to protest” by the JAAC, adding that the police were “acting like thugs”. Journalist Zebunnisa Burki called visuals emerging from the raid “insane” and added that journalists were being attacked by police inside the press club itself. PTI MNA from Malakand, Junaid Akbar, also condemned the raid. “Islamabad police storming the National Press Club and their violence against Kashmiri protesters and journalists is shameful and condemnable. An attack on the press club is an attack on the freedom of expression,” he said in a post on X. Veteran journalist Mazhar Abbas said the police action at the NPC reminded him of the days of military dictators Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf. “This act, rather an attack, on the Press Club, baton-charge and arrest, including some employees of the club, is simply unacceptable,” he wrote on X. Human rights defender Tahira Abdullah called the incident “shocking,” stressing that a mere verbal apology from federal government representatives was unacceptable, especially when paired with the routine promises of an “inquiry.” She demanded concrete measures, including the arrest and prosecution of all police personnel involved, along with their superiors who ordered the action; a written apology from the federal interior minister with a guarantee that such violations of press clubs and journalists would never be repeated; and compensation to cover the replacement of damaged cameras, equipment, and furnishings at the NPC. Prominent human rights lawyer Muhammad Jibran Nasir said that the “government apologised because it was journalists in general who got assaulted in the presence of cameras”. “But they came hunting for activists supporting the protest in AJK. Imagine the barbarity inflicted upon them in the clashes in the past four days. You being a citizen does not matter. You being essential to the State’s cause matters. The State has never apologised for abducting, assaulting and arresting journalists who oppose State policies,” he wrote on X. Additional reporting by Rana Bilal",

      "summary": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday ordered an inquiry into a raid carried out by Islamabad police at the National Press Club (NPC), where several journalists were allegedly attacked. Visuals aired on DawnNewsTV showed policemen armed with batons attacking journalists on the press club premises. Visuals shared on social media also showed police dragging journalists out of what appeared to be the cafeteria. View this post on Instagram Another video shared by a Dawn.com correspondent showed a journalist holding his broken Nikon camera and his shirt ripped across the back. A statement issued by Naqvi stated that he had taken notice of the “unfortunate” incident and demanded a report from the Islamabad inspector general of police. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” he was quoted as saying. “Disciplinary action must be taken against officials involved in the incident,” he said. Meanwhile, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) President Afzal Butt held a press conference alongside Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry at the National Press Club. He said that during the police raid, when the press club’s office-bearers tried to intervene and resolve the matter, they were “beaten and tortured”. “They even arrested two people, who were later released,” Butt added. He added that multiple people at the scene pointed out that they had to get the police to release them. “Today’s incident is a matter of now or never for us,” Butt said. He announced that the PFUJ had called an “emergency session”, where “we will consult and chalk out our demands about what the government needs to do to prevent what the police did today. “We will also decide our course of action and announce it after the meeting.” Butt said, “We always avoid confrontation with political parties. Our friends were very angry … but I controlled them … Something like this has never happened before. “That you enter a photographer’s house — the press club is their second home […] that you enter his home without permission, beat him and break his camera and mobile phone. This has never happened before.” Butt alleged that even the members of the press club’s management and its office-bearers were “beaten”. “This is not only the Islamabad press club’s issue. Press clubs across Pakistan are of the view that if they turn a blind eye to this worst of the worst incident, similar incidents could happen in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta. “That is why we will first consult our friends here and then across Pakistan. We will then decide our plan of action and put forward our demands.” For his part, Chaudhry said he condemned the incident and apologised for it. “Please consider this when you hold your meeting,” he said, assuring that he was also ready to meet them again after their meeting. Chaudhry’s office also issued a statement unconditionally apologising for the incident, adding that it happened “suddenly”. “Some people from the [JAAC] were protesting [and] some of their people had manhandled police personnel,” the statement read. “When they tried to arrest these people, the police chased them. The police came to the Press Club to arrest the protesters who misbehaved with [officers].” The statement added that Chaudhry had ordered an internal inquiry into the incident. Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar called the incident “regrettable” in a statement, vowing that a comprehensive investigation would be carried out. “Interior Minister Naqvi did not order police to enter the press club,” he was quoted as saying. “The National Press Club is my home and I stand with it,” he said. Journalist bodies held another press conference at the NPC later, where Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists President Tariq Virk said journalists across the country stood united after the police raid at NPC. He alleged that “Islamabad police personnel had not come to the press club on their own accord but were sent here”. “They inflicted violence on journalists inside the press club. They even tortured and arrested an ailing employee of the club,” he alleged, vowing to “adopt such a plan of action” that nobody would resort to this “rogue behaviour” in future. PFUJ President Butt said today was one of the “darkest days in Pakistan’s history”. “The attack on the National Press Club was an attack on media freedom,” he said, adding that members of journalist bodies had participated in the meeting held after the police raid. “We will prepare a strategy after consulting all journalist bodies.” Butt further stated that journalists in other cities had also protested the raid at NPC and that “if the National Press Club was not safe from police, then no other press club was”. Butt reiterated his allegation that cameras and mobile phones were snatched and broken during the incident. He announced that a “black day” would be observed across the country tomorrow, and black flags would be hoisted at the press clubs all across Pakistan. “The journalists are very angry at the moment. It has been suggested that we get first information reports registered in which some bigwigs are nominated,” he said. Journalist’s account of raid Journalist Shiraz Gardezi, who is associated with Geo News and also the senior joint secretary of the NPC, shared an account of the raid with Dawn.com . Gardezi said the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) — which has also been holding demonstrations in Azad Kashmir — had issued a call for a protest at the press club. “As soon as the demonstration began, they (police) surrounded the protesters,” he narrated. Gardezi, who was at the NPC to cover the protest, said police stopped them from doing so. “Because they were torturing, beating and dragging people,” he alleged, adding that they even tried to snatch mobile phones and cameras from some of the journalists. According to him, they even dragged and tried to take away some of the journalists with them, but they were let go after some other journalists intervened. “We then asked the journalists to stay on the back foot and keep themselves safe,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "Red-hot Mohammed Siraj returned figures of 4-40 as India dismissed the West Indies for 162 and then turned the screw with the bat on day one of the first Test on Thursday. The hosts were 121-2 at stumps with KL Rahul unbeaten on 53 in front of a sparse crowd at the world’s biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.\nRahul reached his 20th Test fifty and stood firm along with skipper Shubman Gill, on 18, at close of play. A depleted West Indies won the toss but the Indian attack struck regular blows to bowl out the visitors in 44.1 overs in the second session. Siraj drew first blood with the wicket of Tagenarine Chanderpaul for a duck and extended his tally of Test wickets to 27 this year, having played a key role in India’s 2-2 draw in England. “The England series gave me a lot of confidence,” Siraj said. “It was a competitive cricket series in England against a strong side, so to perform there gives you added confidence.” On the comparatively inexperienced West Indies batting line-up, Siraj said: “I had to work hard for my wickets just like I did in England. I was denied a five-wicket haul,” he said with a chuckle. After an initial first spell of 3-19 in seven overs, Siraj returned in the second session to get one more wicket and was ably supported by fellow quick Jasprit Bumrah. Number seven Justin Greaves top-scored for the West Indies with 32 before being bowled by Bumrah, who took three wickets. Skipper Roston Chase (24) and Shai Hope attempted to revive the innings after the West Indies slipped to 42-4 in the first hour of play. ‘We have to improve’ Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav bowled Hope for 26 to end the 48-run fifth-wicket stand at the stroke of lunch. He got his second to send back Jomel Warrican for eight and wrap up the innings. Early tea was called. “Obviously, we have to improve,” vice-captain Warrican said of his team’s batting. “We, as a batting unit, have to come together to score more runs on the board.” West Indies were swept 3-0 at home by Australia this year and were bowled out for 27 in the third match, the second-lowest score in Test history. They have been forced into late changes after injuries to pace bowlers Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, and are a pale shadow of the team that once dominated cricket. India are strongly tipped to sweep the two-match series. The Indian openers started the reply cautiously before Rahul and the left-handed Yashasvi Jaiswal got going in a session interrupted by a brief spell of rain. West Indies pace spearhead Jayden Seales had Jaiswal caught behind for 36 and Chase trapped Sai Sudharsan lbw for seven with his off-spin.",

      "summary_orig": "Civil society and advocacy groups gathered on Thursday outside the Karachi Press Club to protest against the detention of activists aboard the Gaza Sumud Flotilla (GSF), calling on the government to demand the release of the Pakistani delegation, led by former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan. On Wednesday, the GSF, carrying aid to Gaza in its attempt to break Israel’s blockade, was intercepted by Israeli military forces. On board the GSF were over 400 activists from 40 countries, among them a five-member delegation from Pakistan. Thursday’s demonstration, organised by the Pakistan Palestine Forum (PFF) in collaboration with the Palestine Action Coalition (PAC) and the non-profit organisation Human Rights Council of Pakistan, aimed to mobilise the public against the state’s inaction. People of all ages gathered, chanting slogans for a free Palestine. The demonstrators demanded the immediate release of the detained Pakistanis and called on the government to take concrete action against Israel. “It is the responsibility of the government to ensure the safe return of the Pakistani delegation on board the GSF,” said Jamshed Hussain of the Human Rights Council of Pakistan while addressing the crowd. Hussain recalled that his group, along with PPF, had initially urged the government to facilitate the flotilla, anticipating Israel’s attack; however, “our concerns were ignored,” he said. “The five Pakistanis on board are our national heroes,” Hussain said, lamenting that “while governments of Italy and France sent fleets to ensure the safe passage of the flotilla, Pakistan — despite being a muslim country — failed to follow suit”. Demonstrators hold a banner showing the Pakistani delegation at the GSF at a protest against their detention by the Israeli military on October 2 in Karachi. — Photo by Shifa Anosha Kausar of the PFF echoed similar concerns, telling Dawn.com that “It was particularly distressing for Pakistanis to embark on such missions since there was very little likelihood of governmental support.” Yet, she remained hopeful that “momentum for the movement is building up”. A demonstrator holds a placard that reads “Stop genocide” at a protest against Israel’s detention of the Pakistani GSF delegation on October 2 in Karachi. — Photo by Shifa Speaking to Dawn.com , Hussain called on the people to “stand united in their demand for the Pakistanis on the GSF to be released and brought back home safely,” vowing to continue the protest “lest they suffer any harm.” Hussain warned that “by ignoring the plight of the Palestinian people, we are setting a dangerous precedent”. “We must decide which side of history we will choose to stand on,” he said, expressing disappointment at Pakistan’s endorsement of Trump’s Gaza peace plan. On Monday, Pakistan hailed Trump’s 20-point plan , with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcoming it, drawing ire from the political sphere.

However, speaking to Dawn.com , Naureen remarked, “As a mother, I can not turn away from the suffering of the Palestinian children, just as I can not see my own children harmed.” While another demonstrator, Ehtaram, who had come to attend with his wife and two children, thought that “we must pressurise our government to take stern action against Israel, the way Colombia did”. Earlier today, Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the expulsion of the entire Israeli diplomatic delegation from Colombia, a move triggered by the detention of two Colombian nationals aboard the Gaza aid flotilla. The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, departed in late August to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza.",

      "title_orig": "Israel’s interception of Gaza flotilla draws global ire as Pakistan demands release of detained activists",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and several other countries on Thursday condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) after its forces intercepted the flotilla heading to break Israel’s siege of Gaza and deliver aid. Hours after Tel Aviv’s move drew global condemnation, the Israeli foreign ministry posted on X that all on board the flotilla were safe would be “deported to Europe”. The statement said: “The Hamas-Sumud provocation is over. None of the Hamas-Sumud provocation yachts has succeeded in its attempt to enter an active combat zone or breach the lawful naval blockade. “All the passengers are safe and in good health. They are making their way safely to Israel, from where they will be deported to Europe.” It added that one last vessel of “this provocation remains at a distance. If it approaches, its attempt to enter an active combat zone and breach the blockade will also be prevented”. Earlier, the flotilla said that Israeli forces began intercepting the flotilla’s latest bid to reach Gaza late last night. Israel intercepted 39 boats with foreign activists on board to Gaza, leaving only one vessel still sailing towards the Palestinian enclave, the flotilla organisers said. The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. Former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was also on board. ‘Dastardly attack’ In a post on X during the early hours of Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: “Pakistan strongly condemns the dastardly attack by Israeli forces on the 40 vessel Samud Gaza flotilla, carrying over 450 humanitarian workers from 44 countries. We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release.“ “Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” he said. “This barbarity must end. Peace must be given a chance, and humanitarian aid must reach those in need,” the premier asserted. In another post later in the day, he commended the presence of Pakistanis, including former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, on the Global Sumud Flotilla. They participated in this “great aid mission in line with the principles of humanity”, he said, adding that their initiative reflected Pakistanis’ “peace-loving aspirations, struggle for justice, spirit of helping those in need”, he said. The PM added that the Pakistan government supported the “principles of respect for human life … and uninterrupted aid. It demands the return of its citizens. It is trying and prays for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the country”. Strong-worded condemnations also poured in from other countries — including the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Turkiye, Spain, Colombia, Brazil and South Africa — with some voicing concern for their citizens part of the mission and held by Israel. Malaysia’s PM Anwar Ibrahim said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister, as well as the Turkish and Egyptian presidents, to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained“. Turkiye announced that it had opened an investigation concerning “24 Turkish citizens arrested following the attack carried out by elements of the Israeli navy in international waters“. South Africa called on Israel to release all activists, including Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile “Mandla” Mandela. Cameras broadcasting live feeds from the boats, verified by Reuters , showed Israeli soldiers sporting helmets and night vision goggles boarding the ships, while passengers huddled together in life vests with their hands up. A video from the Israeli foreign ministry showed Thunberg, the most prominent of the flotilla’s passengers, sitting on a deck surrounded by soldiers. According to a tracker on the Global Sumud Flotilla’s website, one of its boats, named Mikeno, had entered Gaza’s territorial waters and was still sailing. The Palestinian foreign ministry spokesperson condemned the interception of the flotilla as a violation of international law, asserting that Israel had neither authority nor sovereignty over Palestinian “territorial waters”, including those off the coast of the Gaza Strip. Israel’s interception of the flotilla sparked protests in Italy and Colombia, while protests were also called in Greece, Ireland and Turkiye. Italian unions called a general strike for Friday. At 10:55am PKT, the Israeli foreign ministry said that the detained individuals “were making their way safely and peacefully to Israel, where their deportation procedures to Europe will begin”. “The passengers are safe and in good health,” it insisted. This undated picture released by Israel on Oct 2, 2025 shows Greta Thunberg and other activists part of the GSF onboard a ship after they were intercepted by Israeli forces. — X/IsraelMFA The flotilla had earlier vowed to press on with its bid to deliver aid to the devastated coastal territory despite intimidation tactics by the Israeli military. It said on X that it remained “vigilant as we enter the area where the previous flotillas were intercepted and/or attacked”. Israel has blocked similar attempts previously as well. In June, aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces. Deliberate obstruction of humanitarian relief: FO Separately, the Foreign Office (FO) also strongly condemned the attack, stating: “The unlawful detention of international activists onboard the flotilla constitutes yet another flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law by Israel, and endangers the lives of innocent civilians.” Calling it a deliberate attempt to obstruct humanitarian relief in the Palestinian enclave, the FO said: “This reprehensible act is part of Israel’s ongoing pattern of aggression and its illegal blockade of Gaza, which has caused immense human suffering and deprivation for over two million Palestinians.” It demanded the “immediate release of all humanitarian workers and activists on board the flotilla”, urging Israel to respect international law. The FO also called on the international community to hold Israel accountable for its “repeated violations of international law”. “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support and solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of a viable, independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” it added. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called Israel’s actions against the flotilla “a flagrant violation of international law”, demanding the release of the detained activists. “Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla and detention of international activists in flagrant violation of international law. We demand an immediate ceasefire, lifting of the blockade, swift release of activists and unhindered aid to Gaza,“ he wrote on X. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also condemned the attack, praying for the “safe return of all those aboard the [Sumud] Gaza Flotilla”. “We strongly condemn the Israeli attack on these peaceful people carrying humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. Israeli barbarity must end,” the minister said in a post on X. Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani called Israel’s move an act of “state terrorism and barbaric savagery”, urging the international community to take notice. In a statement issued by his office, Gilani described the assault as “a blatant violation of international law, humanitarian principles, and the dignity of mankind,” adding that the attack has left a “permanent stain on the conscience of the international community”. “The only ‘crime’ of these innocent and selfless individuals was that they sought to stand by the oppressed Palestinians in the spirit of human compassion,” the Senate chairman said. “Urgent steps must be taken to ensure uninterrupted delivery of food, water, medicines, and other essentials to the people of Gaza, who are enduring immense hardship under siege,” the statement added. Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad detained Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla, was also among those taken by Israeli forces, according to advocacy group Pak-Palestine Forum. In a post on X, the group said, “Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan arrested by Israel.” The advocacy group further wrote: “Only one ship has managed to escape, i.e., [the] observer boat, whose duty was to collect information and escape. Our second delegate, Syed Uzair Nizami, was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.” JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman paid tribute to the activists on board the flotilla, announcing a nationwide protest in a show of solidarity with Gaza. Addressing a press conference in Lahore, the JI chief said, “We will observe a nationwide protest tomorrow against the attack on the Sumud Gaza Flotilla.” “We call on our leaders to play their part,” he added. Former PTI senator Faisal Javed Khan took to X to pray for Khan’s safety, saying, “Let us all condemn the aggression by Israel that has been unleashed upon these peaceful humanitarians, who sought only to deliver aid and amplify the cry for justice.” Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir took to X to laud the “courage” of the activists on board the flotilla. “They are carrying nothing but courage in their hearts and aid in their ships,” he said, noting that the Israel Defence Force (IDF) has become “emboldened by the failure and cowardice of the global community.” “Our only hope is ordinary citizens of the world,” he added. Israel faces international backlash Malaysia PM Ibrahim also condemned Israel’s interception of the flotilla, saying that Israeli forces had detained eight Malaysians. “By blocking a humanitarian mission, Israel has shown utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world,” Anwar said in a statement. In a later post on X, the Malaysian premier said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister as well as the presidents of Turkiye and Egypt to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained”. “My team and I have also remained in close contact with other key partners, including the United States Secretary of State [Marco Rubio], to press for urgent intervention without delay. “I reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that the atrocities and acts of aggression committed by the Israeli regime must cease immediately,” Anwar added. He reiterated his demand for the “immediate and unconditional release of all detainees, and for humanitarian aid to be allowed to reach our brothers and sisters in Gaza swiftly and without obstruction”. Turkiye Turkiye’s foreign ministry called Israel’s “attack” on the flotilla “an act of terror” that endangered the lives of innocent civilians. The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said it had launched an investigation into the detention of 24 Turkish citizens on board vessels in the flotilla on charges including deprivation of liberty, seizure of transport vehicles and damage to property, as per Turkiye’s Anadolu Agency. Colombia Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the expulsion of Israel’s entire diplomatic delegation on Wednesday following the detention of two Colombians in the flotilla. Israel has not had an ambassador in Colombia since last year. Petro called the detentions a potential “new international crime” by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and demanded the release of the Colombians. He also terminated Colombia’s free trade agreement with Israel. Britain The British government remained “very concerned” about Israel’s interception of the aid flotilla, its foreign office said today, adding that it had made clear to Israel that the situation should be resolved safely. “We are very concerned about the situation with the Sumud flotilla, we are in touch with the families of a number of British nationals involved,” the British foreign office said in a statement. “The aid carried by the flotilla should be turned over to humanitarian organisations on the ground to be delivered safely into Gaza,” it added. Spain Spain summoned Israel’s top representative in Madrid after Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying activists and humanitarian aid to the devastated Palestinian territory, Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said. “Today I summoned the charge d’affaires here in Madrid,” Albares told public broadcaster TVE , saying 65 Spaniards were travelling with the flotilla. Brazil Brazil also issued a condemnation on the Israeli navy’s interception of the flotilla, with several Brazilian nationals on board, including a lawmaker. The Brazilian foreign ministry said, “[Brazil] deplores the Israeli government’s military action, which violates rights and endangers the physical well-being of peaceful protesters.” “The responsibility for the safety of those detained now rests with Israel,” it added.",

Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad detained Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla, was also among those taken by Israeli forces, according to advocacy group Pak-Palestine Forum. In a post on X, the group said, “Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan arrested by Israel.” The advocacy group further wrote: “Only one ship has managed to escape, i.e., [the] observer boat, whose duty was to collect information and escape. Our second delegate, Syed Uzair Nizami, was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.” JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman paid tribute to the activists on board the flotilla, announcing a nationwide protest in a show of solidarity with Gaza. Addressing a press conference in Lahore, the JI chief said, “We will observe a nationwide protest tomorrow against the attack on the Sumud Gaza Flotilla.” “We call on our leaders to play their part,” he added. Former PTI senator Faisal Javed Khan took to X to pray for Khan’s safety, saying, “Let us all condemn the aggression by Israel that has been unleashed upon these peaceful humanitarians, who sought only to deliver aid and amplify the cry for justice.” Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir took to X to laud the “courage” of the activists on board the flotilla. “They are carrying nothing but courage in their hearts and aid in their ships,” he said, noting that the Israel Defence Force (IDF) has become “emboldened by the failure and cowardice of the global community.” “Our only hope is ordinary citizens of the world,” he added. Israel faces international backlash Malaysia PM Ibrahim also condemned Israel’s interception of the flotilla, saying that Israeli forces had detained eight Malaysians. “By blocking a humanitarian mission, Israel has shown utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world,” Anwar said in a statement. In a later post on X, the Malaysian premier said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister as well as the presidents of Turkiye and Egypt to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained”. “My team and I have also remained in close contact with other key partners, including the United States Secretary of State [Marco Rubio], to press for urgent intervention without delay. “I reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that the atrocities and acts of aggression committed by the Israeli regime must cease immediately,” Anwar added. He reiterated his demand for the “immediate and unconditional release of all detainees, and for humanitarian aid to be allowed to reach our brothers and sisters in Gaza swiftly and without obstruction”. Turkiye Turkiye’s foreign ministry called Israel’s “attack” on the flotilla “an act of terror” that endangered the lives of innocent civilians. The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said it had launched an investigation into the detention of 24 Turkish citizens on board vessels in the flotilla on charges including deprivation of liberty, seizure of transport vehicles and damage to property, as per Turkiye’s Anadolu Agency. Colombia Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the expulsion of Israel’s entire diplomatic delegation on Wednesday following the detention of two Colombians in the flotilla. Israel has not had an ambassador in Colombia since last year. Petro called the detentions a potential “new international crime” by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and demanded the release of the Colombians. He also terminated Colombia’s free trade agreement with Israel. Britain The British government remained “very concerned” about Israel’s interception of the aid flotilla, its foreign office said today, adding that it had made clear to Israel that the situation should be resolved safely. “We are very concerned about the situation with the Sumud flotilla, we are in touch with the families of a number of British nationals involved,” the British foreign office said in a statement. “The aid carried by the flotilla should be turned over to humanitarian organisations on the ground to be delivered safely into Gaza,” it added. Spain Spain summoned Israel’s top representative in Madrid after Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying activists and humanitarian aid to the devastated Palestinian territory, Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said. “Today I summoned the charge d’affaires here in Madrid,” Albares told public broadcaster TVE , saying 65 Spaniards were travelling with the flotilla. Brazil Brazil also issued a condemnation on the Israeli navy’s interception of the flotilla, with several Brazilian nationals on board, including a lawmaker. The Brazilian foreign ministry said, “[Brazil] deplores the Israeli government’s military action, which violates rights and endangers the physical well-being of peaceful protesters.” “The responsibility for the safety of those detained now rests with Israel,” it added.",

      "summary": "Pakistan and several other countries on Thursday condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) after its forces intercepted the flotilla heading to break Israel’s siege of Gaza and deliver aid. Hours after Tel Aviv’s move drew global condemnation, the Israeli foreign ministry posted on X that all on board the flotilla were safe would be “deported to Europe”. The statement said: “The Hamas-Sumud provocation is over. None of the Hamas-Sumud provocation yachts has succeeded in its attempt to enter an active combat zone or breach the lawful naval blockade. “All the passengers are safe and in good health. They are making their way safely to Israel, from where they will be deported to Europe.” It added that one last vessel of “this provocation remains at a distance. If it approaches, its attempt to enter an active combat zone and breach the blockade will also be prevented”. Earlier, the flotilla said that Israeli forces began intercepting the flotilla’s latest bid to reach Gaza late last night. Israel intercepted 39 boats with foreign activists on board to Gaza, leaving only one vessel still sailing towards the Palestinian enclave, the flotilla organisers said. The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. Former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was also on board. ‘Dastardly attack’ In a post on X during the early hours of Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: “Pakistan strongly condemns the dastardly attack by Israeli forces on the 40 vessel Samud Gaza flotilla, carrying over 450 humanitarian workers from 44 countries. We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release.“ “Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” he said. “This barbarity must end. Peace must be given a chance, and humanitarian aid must reach those in need,” the premier asserted. In another post later in the day, he commended the presence of Pakistanis, including former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, on the Global Sumud Flotilla. They participated in this “great aid mission in line with the principles of humanity”, he said, adding that their initiative reflected Pakistanis’ “peace-loving aspirations, struggle for justice, spirit of helping those in need”, he said. The PM added that the Pakistan government supported the “principles of respect for human life … and uninterrupted aid. It demands the return of its citizens. It is trying and prays for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the country”. Strong-worded condemnations also poured in from other countries — including the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Turkiye, Spain, Colombia, Brazil and South Africa — with some voicing concern for their citizens part of the mission and held by Israel. Malaysia’s PM Anwar Ibrahim said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister, as well as the Turkish and Egyptian presidents, to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained“. Turkiye announced that it had opened an investigation concerning “24 Turkish citizens arrested following the attack carried out by elements of the Israeli navy in international waters“. South Africa called on Israel to release all activists, including Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile “Mandla” Mandela. Cameras broadcasting live feeds from the boats, verified by Reuters , showed Israeli soldiers sporting helmets and night vision goggles boarding the ships, while passengers huddled together in life vests with their hands up. A video from the Israeli foreign ministry showed Thunberg, the most prominent of the flotilla’s passengers, sitting on a deck surrounded by soldiers. According to a tracker on the Global Sumud Flotilla’s website, one of its boats, named Mikeno, had entered Gaza’s territorial waters and was still sailing. The Palestinian foreign ministry spokesperson condemned the interception of the flotilla as a violation of international law, asserting that Israel had neither authority nor sovereignty over Palestinian “territorial waters”, including those off the coast of the Gaza Strip. Israel’s interception of the flotilla sparked protests in Italy and Colombia, while protests were also called in Greece, Ireland and Turkiye. Italian unions called a general strike for Friday. At 10:55am PKT, the Israeli foreign ministry said that the detained individuals “were making their way safely and peacefully to Israel, where their deportation procedures to Europe will begin”. “The passengers are safe and in good health,” it insisted. This undated picture released by Israel on Oct 2, 2025 shows Greta Thunberg and other activists part of the GSF onboard a ship after they were intercepted by Israeli forces. — X/IsraelMFA The flotilla had earlier vowed to press on with its bid to deliver aid to the devastated coastal territory despite intimidation tactics by the Israeli military. It said on X that it remained “vigilant as we enter the area where the previous flotillas were intercepted and/or attacked”. Israel has blocked similar attempts previously as well. In June, aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces. Deliberate obstruction of humanitarian relief: FO Separately, the Foreign Office (FO) also strongly condemned the attack, stating: “The unlawful detention of international activists onboard the flotilla constitutes yet another flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law by Israel, and endangers the lives of innocent civilians.” Calling it a deliberate attempt to obstruct humanitarian relief in the Palestinian enclave, the FO said: “This reprehensible act is part of Israel’s ongoing pattern of aggression and its illegal blockade of Gaza, which has caused immense human suffering and deprivation for over two million Palestinians.” It demanded the “immediate release of all humanitarian workers and activists on board the flotilla”, urging Israel to respect international law. The FO also called on the international community to hold Israel accountable for its “repeated violations of international law”. “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support and solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of a viable, independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” it added. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called Israel’s actions against the flotilla “a flagrant violation of international law”, demanding the release of the detained activists. “Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla and detention of international activists in flagrant violation of international law. We demand an immediate ceasefire, lifting of the blockade, swift release of activists and unhindered aid to Gaza,“ he wrote on X. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also condemned the attack, praying for the “safe return of all those aboard the [Sumud] Gaza Flotilla”. “We strongly condemn the Israeli attack on these peaceful people carrying humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. Israeli barbarity must end,” the minister said in a post on X. Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani called Israel’s move an act of “state terrorism and barbaric savagery”, urging the international community to take notice. In a statement issued by his office, Gilani described the assault as “a blatant violation of international law, humanitarian principles, and the dignity of mankind,” adding that the attack has left a “permanent stain on the conscience of the international community”. “The only ‘crime’ of these innocent and selfless individuals was that they sought to stand by the oppressed Palestinians in the spirit of human compassion,” the Senate chairman said. “Urgent steps must be taken to ensure uninterrupted delivery of food, water, medicines, and other essentials to the people of Gaza, who are enduring immense hardship under siege,” the statement added.

      "summary_orig": "At least two people were killed on Thursday and three badly wounded outside a packed synagogue in Manchester in a car and stabbing attack, with the suspect believed to have been shot dead by UK police. As the Jewish community marked the holiday of Yom Kippur in the northwestern city, police were called to the incident, activating a national terrorism-response protocol. The attack struck days ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked a fierce offensive in Gaza, inflaming passions in Britain. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer swiftly condemned the attack as “horrific”, and announced security was being boosted at UK synagogues. He left a European political summit in Denmark early to chair an emergency security meeting in London. King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla were “deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the horrific attack in Manchester, especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community”. Greater Manchester Police declared a “major incident” shortly after 9:30 am (1:30pm PKT) after officers were called to the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in the Crumpsall neighbourhood. The force initially said paramedics were treating four people for “injuries caused by both the vehicle and stab wounds” while confirming firearms officers had shot one man “believed to be the offender”. Within hours, it announced two people had died and the suspected offender shot by officers was “also believed to be deceased”. Police said the death could not be confirmed due to “suspicious items on his person”, noting a bomb disposal unit was at the scene.\nThree people were also in a “serious condition”, police added. ‘Appalled’ Starmer said he was appalled and pledged to “do everything to keep our Jewish community safe”. “The fact that this has taken place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, makes it all the more horrific,” he added. Israel’s embassy in the UK said it was “abhorrent and deeply distressing” that “such an act of violence should be perpetrated on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar”. “The safety and security of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom must be guaranteed,” it added on X. Police said officers first responded to calls from the public about a car driving into people outside the synagogue, as well as reports that a security guard had been attacked with a knife. A witness told BBC Radio he saw police shooting a man after a car crash.\n“They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn’t listen until they opened fire,” he said. “He went down on the floor, and then he started getting back up, and then they shot him again.” Police said “a large number of people worshipping at the synagogue … were held inside while the immediate area was made safe” but then evacuated. Members of the community comfort each other near Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall, north Manchester, on October 2, following a “major incident” at the synagogue. — AFP ‘Holiest Jewish day’ Manchester mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC police had “dealt with it very quickly with some amazing support from members of the public”. He urged people “not to speculate on social media”, while noting the Jewish community “will be very worried by the news”. The city, famous around the world for its two Premier League football clubs and industrial history, is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the UK. It totalled more than 28,000 in 2021, according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research. Members of the local Jewish community walk in the street near Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall, north Manchester, the UK on October 2. — AFP MP Graham Stringer said the area was home to both large Jewish and Muslim communities. “By and large community relations are excellent between all the different ethnic groups and religious groups,” he told BBC Radio Manchester. The Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish charity that records antisemitic incidents, said it was “working with police and the local Jewish community”.\n“This appears to be an appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year,” CST added. The city has witnessed several deadly terror attacks, notably in 2017 when Salman Abedi detonated a homemade suicide bomb outside an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena. It killed 22 people, some of them children, and injured hundreds more.",

Greater Manchester Police declared a “major incident” shortly after 9:30 am (1:30pm PKT) after officers were called to the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in the Crumpsall neighbourhood. The force initially said paramedics were treating four people for “injuries caused by both the vehicle and stab wounds” while confirming firearms officers had shot one man “believed to be the offender”. Within hours, it announced two people had died and the suspected offender shot by officers was “also believed to be deceased”. Police said the death could not be confirmed due to “suspicious items on his person”, noting a bomb disposal unit was at the scene.\nThree people were also in a “serious condition”, police added. ‘Appalled’ Starmer said he was appalled and pledged to “do everything to keep our Jewish community safe”. “The fact that this has taken place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, makes it all the more horrific,” he added. Israel’s embassy in the UK said it was “abhorrent and deeply distressing” that “such an act of violence should be perpetrated on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar”. “The safety and security of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom must be guaranteed,” it added on X. Police said officers first responded to calls from the public about a car driving into people outside the synagogue, as well as reports that a security guard had been attacked with a knife. A witness told BBC Radio he saw police shooting a man after a car crash.\n“They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn’t listen until they opened fire,” he said. “He went down on the floor, and then he started getting back up, and then they shot him again.” Police said “a large number of people worshipping at the synagogue … were held inside while the immediate area was made safe” but then evacuated. Members of the community comfort each other near Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall, north Manchester, on October 2, following a “major incident” at the synagogue. — AFP ‘Holiest Jewish day’ Manchester mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC police had “dealt with it very quickly with some amazing support from members of the public”. He urged people “not to speculate on social media”, while noting the Jewish community “will be very worried by the news”. The city, famous around the world for its two Premier League football clubs and industrial history, is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the UK. It totalled more than 28,000 in 2021, according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research. Members of the local Jewish community walk in the street near Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall, north Manchester, the UK on October 2. — AFP MP Graham Stringer said the area was home to both large Jewish and Muslim communities. “By and large community relations are excellent between all the different ethnic groups and religious groups,” he told BBC Radio Manchester. The Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish charity that records antisemitic incidents, said it was “working with police and the local Jewish community”.\n“This appears to be an appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year,” CST added. The city has witnessed several deadly terror attacks, notably in 2017 when Salman Abedi detonated a homemade suicide bomb outside an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena. It killed 22 people, some of them children, and injured hundreds more.",
