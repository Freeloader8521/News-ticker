      "summary_orig": "The unions of Seoul Metro, the operator of subway lines 1-8, launched a slowdown protest on Monday after their wage hike negotiations fell through. The \"work-to-rule\" protest by two of Seoul Metro's three unions, which account for three-quarters of all employees, caused no major disruption to commuters, though there were minor train delays at some stations. Protest participants staged a fight for safety by securing more stop times than usual and refused to perform work that is not required by regulations. The company's Unions 1 and 2, which have 9,036 members and 2,577 members, respectively, took the collective action demanding a pay hike of 3 percent, suspension of manpower downsizing and expansion of new hiring. But the management has stuck to a wage increase of 1.8 percent, citing financial straits. Seoul Metro's Unions 1 and 3 have threatened to go on a general strike, beginning Dec. 12, if the management and the Seoul city government do not present a more advanced proposal, while Union 2 is reportedly discussing a general strike in the middle of this month. Union 3 has 1,988 members",

      "summary_orig": "Pak-EPA enforcement team inspects a vehicle for smoke emission under the ongoing vehicular emission testing drive in Islamabad on Sunday. — White Star ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Environment Protection Agency on Sunday warned owners of smoke-emitting vehicles of stringent action across the federal capital. It said any vehicle found releasing excessive emissions will face strict punitive measures. In a statement, Pak-EPA Director General Nazia Zaib Ali said the agency had intensified its enforcement operations as part of ongoing efforts to curb vehicular pollution, which she described as a major contributor to deteriorating air quality and recurring smog episodes in Islamabad. She said enforcement teams were carrying out regular inspections on major roads, intersections and high-traffic corridors to identify vehicles emitting excessive smoke. Violators would face on-the-spot fines, confiscation of vehicles, or both, depending on the severity of the offence, she added. Ms Nazia reminded the public that driving a vehicle emitting smoke beyond permissible limits, particularly the thick black smoke from poorly maintained engines, constituted an environmental crime under federal environmental laws. “Let me be very clear, smoke-emitting vehicles will not be allowed to operate in Islamabad under any circumstances,” she warned. “This is not just a regulatory matter. It is a public health emergency. Vehicular smoke is poisoning the air our children breathe. We will take every lawful measure, including heavy fines and confiscation, to stop this environmental crime.” She said the agency’s heightened vigilance stemmed from growing alarm over the increasing number of vehicles, particularly diesel buses, trucks, wagons, Qingqi rickshaws and motorcycles that continue to ply roads without proper maintenance, releasing hazardous emissions that harm both the environment and human health. Pak-EPA said vehicular emissions remained a major source of outdoor air pollution and heat-trapping carbon emissions in urban centres. The smoke released from vehicles contained harmful pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and un-burnt hydrocarbons, all of which degraded air quality and contribute to smog formation. Particulate matter, especially PM2.5, penetrated deep into the lungs and could enter the bloodstream. Long-term exposure increased the risk of chronic respiratory diseases, heart conditions, stroke and premature death. The World Health Organisation has repeatedly stated that air pollution is among the top global environmental health risks, causing millions of premature deaths each year. The statement said Islamabad’s winter months typically brought stagnant air and temperature inversions that trapped pollutants close to the ground, intensifying smog episodes. Vehicular smoke, when combined with dust and industrial pollutants, formed thick layers of toxic air that reduced visibility and trigger respiratory illnesses. Local health experts said smoke from polluting vehicles was a key cause of respiratory distress, chronic cough, asthma attacks, allergies and eye irritation. Children, the elderly and individuals with cardiac or pulmonary diseases face heightened risks. Prolonged exposure could impair lung development in children, while medical specialists warned of increased risks of heart attacks and worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Public health data also linked vehicular pollution with higher rates of bronchitis, pneumonia and certain cancers. Ms Nazia stressed that addressing air pollution could not be left solely to enforcement teams. It called on citizens to act responsibly by cooperating during inspections, maintaining smoke-free vehicles, reporting polluting vehicles and encouraging adherence to environmental laws. “Cleaner air is a shared national responsibility. If citizens cooperate with us, we can significantly reduce pollution levels and protect the health of millions,” she added. Published in Dawn, December 1st, 2025",

      "title_orig": "The tyranny of geography",
      "summary_orig": "FACING a two-front situation on the borders has long been Pakistan’s nightmare scenario. That is why its security and foreign policy has, over the decades, been predicated on avoiding having to deal simultaneously with external threats on two borders. This policy was shaped by the exigencies of the country’s formative years when it was confronted with a hostile India and contested borders on both its western and eastern flanks bequeathed by colonialism. An early conflict with India and continuing tensions over Kashmir was accompanied by irredentist claims of successive Afghan governments, who questioned the border with Pakistan, demarcated as the Durand Line by the British. The tyranny of geography imposed heavy burdens on Pakistan. But the lesson learnt from the country’s early years was the strategic imperative of keeping one front defused as active military engagement on both borders was regarded as unsustainable. This was not something Pakistan could always control, but its security strategy aimed at averting a double squeeze from two hot borders. This is exemplified by Pakistan’s efforts to prevent any flare-up of tensions with India in the 1980s during its long involvement in the US-led military campaign against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. It is also illustrated by the post-9/11 decade when Pakistan became a front-line state in the US ‘war on terror’ and cooperated in the US/ Nato effort to defeat the Taliban and terrorist groups based in Afghanistan. India’s military mobilisation along the border after a terror attack on the Indian parliament in 2002 compelled Pakistan to deal with two hot fronts for some time. But US mediation helped to end the Pakistan-India military stand-off. What followed was perhaps the longest period of uninterrupted diplomatic engagement between the two countries in a ‘composite dialogue’. In fact, one of president Pervez Musharraf’s ‘asks’ of the Americans then was for Washington to ‘watch’ Pakistan’s ‘back’ while Pakistani forces were engaged on the Afghan border. The US administration obliged. Today however, Pakistan faces a three-front security challenge. On the eastern front an implacable foe continues to issue threats and insist its ‘Operation Sindoor’ — the name of its military action against Pakistan in May — is not over. On the western frontier, Pakistan and Afghanistan remain engaged in hostilities . Pakistan also alleges active collusion between Kabul and New Delhi in terrorist attacks on the country. The third front is at home, reflected in the surge in militant attacks that is undermining domestic peace and stability. This is unprecedented as never before has the country had to deal simultaneously with three fronts. The only bright spot is improved ties between Pakistan and Iran that has helped to address border management problems. This is an encouraging development considering the two neighbours engaged in tit-for-tat missile strikes in January 2024 over activities of militant Baloch groups on both sides of the border. Relations with Afghanistan have hit a record low because of the Taliban’s unwillingness to act against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), that continues cross-border terror attacks from its Afghan sanctuaries and poses a grave threat to Pakistan’s security. With several rounds of talks yielding little, an increasingly frustrated Islamabad was forced to adopt a coercive policy towards Kabul, especially as Pakistani casualties mounted in terror attacks. Pakistan faces two hot borders and an internal security challenge. In October, deadly clashes erupted on the border. Pakistan launched air strikes against militant targets in Afghanistan including Kabul while Afghan forces attacked multiple border posts in response. Pakistan retaliated with fierce cross-border strikes. A ceasefire was reached through mediation by Qatar and Turkiye. But subsequent talks ended in deadlock as the Taliban declined to give a written commitment to stop TTP attacks. The border remains closed and trade suspended . Islamabad seems to have concluded that with diplomatic efforts exhausted the only option is kinetic as sustained military pressure might have a deterrent effect on the Taliban’s permissive attitude and support for TTP. This is designed to inflict pain on Kabul. But it also entails costs for Pakistan not only in terms of lost trade (annual Pakistani exports are just over $1 billion), but also in overstretching its resources. Pakistani officials acknowledge this but argue they are left with little choice. Nevertheless, prolonged tensions will mean Pakistan’s attention and military resources will have to increasingly be directed or diverted to its western border from the east, despite the latter front being unstable. In the face of continuing Indian belligerence and intimidatory military exercises near its border Pakistan cannot afford to lower its guard. With the Indian leadership apparently wanting to avenge its setback in the May conflict with Pakistan, Islamabad cannot leave anything to chance. True, India took no knee-jerk action after the recent Delhi bomb blast . But recently when its defence minister provocatively suggested that borders can change and Sindh could one day ‘return to India’, Islamabad condemned this as “a threat to regional stability”. Given New Delhi’s hostility and absent any communication between the two countries, a high degree of unpredictability and risk of miscalculation characterises the situation. Pakistan thus has to keep a watchful eye on the western front and remain in a state of military preparedness. The existential threat after all can come from India, not Afghanistan. While Pakistan may be unable to do much in the near term to defuse either of the two external fronts (ideally the Afghan front should be over time) the home front is what it can and should control. Two provinces are afflicted by insurgency while terrorists are also striking across the country. Despite notable counterterrorism gains, the internal security situation remains troubling with rising fatalities from terrorism likely to make 2025 the deadliest year in a decade. Pakistan needs a more effective counterterrorism strategy. Strengthened border controls must involve zero tolerance for corruption and criminality that allow militant movement. The government should also evolve a differentiated approach to deal with militant violence in Balochistan and KP. In Balochistan, the underlying sources of long-standing public disaffection need to be addressed. Law enforcement should be accompanied by political and economic measures to win hearts and minds. Effective counter-insurgency operations in KP require rising above partisan politics for better coordination with the opposition-controlled province to secure community support. Defeating militant violence ‘within’ is a strategic compulsion as a continuing three-front situation is obviously untenable. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.

      "summary_en": "FACING a two-front situation on the borders has long been Pakistan’s nightmare scenario. That is why its security and foreign policy has, over the decades, been predicated on avoiding having to deal simultaneously with external threats on two borders. This policy was shaped by the exigencies of the country’s formative years when it was confronted with a hostile India and contested borders on both its western and eastern flanks bequeathed by colonialism. An early conflict with India and continuing tensions over Kashmir was accompanied by irredentist claims of successive Afghan governments, who questioned the border with Pakistan, demarcated as the Durand Line by the British. The tyranny of geography imposed heavy burdens on Pakistan. But the lesson learnt from the country’s early years was the strategic imperative of keeping one front defused as active military engagement on both borders was regarded as unsustainable. This was not something Pakistan could always control, but its security strategy aimed at averting a double squeeze from two hot borders. This is exemplified by Pakistan’s efforts to prevent any flare-up of tensions with India in the 1980s during its long involvement in the US-led military campaign against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. It is also illustrated by the post-9/11 decade when Pakistan became a front-line state in the US ‘war on terror’ and cooperated in the US/ Nato effort to defeat the Taliban and terrorist groups based in Afghanistan.

The proposed legislation marks a long-awaited attempt to strengthen national defences in an age where the first strike is often digital. Yet ambition alone will not suffice when dealing with the weaknesses that have repeatedly left the country exposed. As outlined by the IT minister on Friday, the law aims to establish a National Cybersecurity Authority, a beefed-up incident-response system, and a secure digital infrastructure built under the Digital Economy Enhancement Project . These are welcome steps. But a cybersecurity framework cannot be judged by announcements alone. It must also be assessed against Pakistan’s recent record. Over the past few years, Pakistan has found itself in the headlines not for its cyber readiness but for a series of damaging breaches. Banks, hospitals, government email servers and even tax and identity databases have faced cyber intrusions, some of which brought services to a halt for days. Investigations into major leaks, including those linked to national identity data, have left citizens worried about whether the state can protect even the most sensitive information. Meanwhile, attacks on energy-sector utilities, such as the ransomware strike on K-Electric, have exposed the fragility of Pakistan’s critical infrastructure. Compounding these vulnerabilities is the reliance on blanket shutdowns. Internet outages — such as those most recently imposed in Balochistan — often without transparency or due process, have become a default response to security concerns. Such measures not only undermine public trust and damage economic activity, they also reveal the absence of resilient, rights-respecting mechanisms to manage crises. This contradiction is particularly striking given the government’s repeated celebration of Pakistan’s Tier-1 ranking in the ITU Global Cybersecurity Index. Rankings offer little comfort when the public experiences insecurity firsthand. The Cybersecurity Act will only succeed if implemented with openness, independent oversight and a commitment to protecting fundamental rights. Without this, the law risks amounting to little more than an expanded surveillance tool, adding to concerns raised by civil society in the wake of recent amendments to cybercrime regulations, threats to block VPNs and Pakistan’s latest ‘Not Free’ score in the Freedom House internet freedom report. Pakistan has no shortage of talent. Universities like FAST-NU, where the IT minister spoke, and initiatives such as Ignite’s IC design training programme demonstrate technical capacity. Nor is there a dearth of urgency, especially after Marka-i-Haq , which officials have described as a defining moment. What Pakistan does lack is a coherent, civilian-led cybersecurity architecture that prioritises technical excellence over political control.

      "summary_orig": "• Afridi announces weekly protests outside IHC, Adiala jail • Claims Imran kept in isolation and visitors denied access • Alleges KP kept deprived of NFC share since 2018 • Special assistant says provincial cabinet to meet every Friday PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Sunday that the powers-that-be wanted to push the PTI into a conflict, but the party would remain peaceful and not opt for confrontation. “However, the PTI will never hesitate to offer sacrifice,” Mr Afridi added while addressing a news conference at the Chief Minister’s House. He maintained that efforts were being made to corner the PTI, but his party would continue to hold peaceful protests. “Persistent efforts have been made to isolate the PTI, and peaceful protesters were even shot at,” the chief minister said. ‘Imran in isolation’ He continued that PTI founder Imran Khan was being kept in isolation and solitary confinement, and that all his visitors, including the chief minister himself and Mr Khan’s sisters, were being denied meetings with the incarcerated former prime minister. Mr Afirdi said that after some unfortunate news was reported by international media, he went to Adiala jail to inquire about Mr Khan’s health, but even after spe­nding an entire night outside the facility, he was refused a meeting. He added that they then went to the Islamabad High Court (IHC), but the judges also declined to meet them. Weekly protests The chief minister said the PTI had decided all its parliamentarians would hold peaceful protests outside the IHC every Tuesday, and accompany Mr Khan’s sisters to Adiala jail. He added that the KP government would follow the directions issued by the PTI leadership. “All the parliamentarians, including National and provincial assembly members as well as senators, will protest outside the IHC over delayed case hearings. They will all proceed to Adiala, accompanying Khan sahib’s sisters,” Mr Afridi told reporters. He said he decided to hold a sit-in outside Adiala jail because his party was being mistreated. The KP CM stated that while some chief ministers were offered official jets by the Pakistan Air Force and facilitated during travel, he was placed on the Passport Control List. Responding to questions, the chief minister said no part of KP was under the control of militants. However, without naming anyone, he added that the entire country was being controlled by a single individual. He said the Centre should consider the provincial government’s suggestions for maintaining lasting peace in KP, adding that decisions taken behind closed doors had harmed the province. “If the federal government implements what the provincial government has been suggesting, it will be our responsibility to carry out those decisions and maintain law and order,” he said. He added that the KP government wanted all stakeholders to be taken on board for any decision regarding peace in the province. NFC share Mr Afridi said the provincial government would participate in the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting scheduled for Dec 4 and would fight for the province’s rights. He added that the tribal areas were merged administratively with KP in 2018 but had yet to be merged financially. He maintained that the NFC share for the merged districts had not been paid to KP since 2018, describing it as a “constitutional violation”. The chief minister also announced that from Monday (today), awareness sessions would be held for students in universities so they could understand how the federal government had treated the KP government. Responding to another question, the chief minister said that while he personally did not own any property in Tirah, his family did. He added that the recent documentary against him was an attempt to divert public attention, but people did not believe those who produced it. “People know everything. They know who is lying, and we want them to do their job… only then will the country move forward,” the chief minister said. ‘Good governance’ Separately, Special Assistant to the KP CM Shafiullah Jan issued a statement expressing similar concerns about the PTI founder’s health. He criticised the PML-N leadership, saying the party had “forgotten its own past”, recalling how its workers met their “convicted leader” in London and sought guidance from him during his stay abroad. “Today, they are fearful of Imran Khan’s statements and even his photographs,” he said, adding that the PTI founder remained the most popular political leader in the country and that attempts were being made to “block his voice”. Mr Jan said that the KP chief minister had declared emergencies in the education and health sectors and had decided that the provincial cabinet would meet every Friday. “Good governance is among the top priorities of Chief Minister Sohail Afridi,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "When people don’t have jobs, they feel frustrated. And if they see no light at the end of the tunnel, their frustration morphs into deep despair, leading them to engage in a range of undesirable behaviours, including begging, theft, forming gangs, or becoming an instrument of anti-state elements. That said, let’s look at the findings of the Labour Force Survey 2024-25: 1.4 million more people became jobless in the last four years, and the unemployment rate hit a 21-year high of 7.1 per cent. This means 5.9m men and women remain unemployed in our country, whose 250m population continues to grow at more than 2pc per year. What is alarming is that the unemployment rate is higher among the 15–24 age group — 12.8pc in 2024–25, up from 11.1pc in 2020–21. Little wonder then, we see hordes of frustrated, despairing, disillusioned, and even violent youth roaming around the streets aimlessly — some resorting to petty crimes, and some being discreetly recruited by anti-state networks. This is not to suggest that all young men and women without a job fall under this category; not at all. The majority of them work in the informal sector on half the national minimum wage to make both ends meet. This is a dangerous situation and needs to be handled carefully. While continuing the ongoing drive against foreign-sponsored and local militants and terrorists , the hybrid regime must also focus on the socio-economic caveats of this problem. These require economic wisdom and political will to free the economy from elite capture and redistribute resources justly and fairly; easier said than done. If domestic and foreign investment doesn’t flow into agriculture and manufacturing in a big way, how on earth will new jobs be created? During the first quarter of this century, Pakistanis have endured a lot — under military rule, under weak and dysfunctional democracies, and under hybrid regimes. It is time for serious soul-searching. This country cannot prosper unless the state delivers for the people and makes them feel respected, enjoying their basic rights as enshrined in the original 1973 Constitution. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has attributed the rise in unemployment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes (due to their stabilising nature) and climate disasters . He is partly right. Each government blames the previous one for fiscal and governance issues that produce large deficits. But each, in turn, fails to address these issues sustainably during its tenure. As a result, foreign and domestic debt stocks keep piling up, requiring ever-increasing allocations from fiscal resources for debt servicing, leaving little for development expenditure after defence expenses. Lower-than-required development spending keeps Pakistan’s economy in survival mode instead of providing the impetus needed for sustained high growth. The absence of sustained high growth gives birth to stubborn unemployment, worsened by widespread and deep-rooted corruption , which further reduces actual net spending on health, education, skill-building, provision of affordable utilities, roads and transport infrastructure, and innovation. Moreover, the high population growth rate — above 2pc — makes the task of creating enough jobs even more difficult, as millions of youngsters become employable every year. Massive job creation is not possible without unleashing the power of the private sector. But due to structural politico-economic issues, such as blurred lines between the private sector and commercial enterprises run by army-backed institutions, state-owned enterprises being in the red for decades, and political and financial over-pampering of some sub-sectors, this is too difficult. Jobs will keep coming up if the private sector invests more and foreign direct investment flows freely into job-intensive industries. Can the domestic private sector come forward and invest at a time when the political system is fractured? Can foreign direct investment flow freely into Pakistan without eradicating unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and without making Karachi — the industrial and commercial hub of the country — a more liveable city? And if domestic and foreign investment doesn’t flow into agriculture and goods manufacturing in a big way, how on earth will new jobs be created? In the services sector? Can one even think of a thriving services sector without agriculture and industry providing a solid base? These are serious points to ponder. Policymakers cannot wish them away with slogans and fancy presentations. The speed with which automation, machine learning and generative and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) are spreading in the developed world and devouring human jobs offers new lessons in distributional economics. Policymakers will have to take this into account as well. In the future, creating jobs for humans would be even more challenging due to automation and AI, particularly if top-tier domestic investors go for them at an accelerated pace.

      "summary_orig": "AFGHAN refugees return to Afghanistan after deportation.—Dawn/file ISLAMABAD: Afghan refugees, awaiting resettlement in the US, have urged the Trump administration to resume the programme, saying that they were living in Pakistan under extreme hardship and constant fear of deportation. The statement from the Afghan P1/P2 case holders came days after the US administration abruptly halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghan nationals indefinitely after the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House. “We, the Afghan allies and partners of the United States with completed P1/P2 cases, express our deep concern and urgent plea for assistance. Our cases were fully processed, and we were awaiting our flight dates when, on January 20, 2025, the programme was suspended without explanation,” the statement shared with the media said. “For more than three years, we have been living in Pakistan under extreme hardship and constant fear,” it said, while also condemning the Washington attack. “This was the act of a single individual, and it must never be used to collectively punish thousands of loyal Afghan allies who served the United States honourably and at great personal risk. Individual crime is not a reflection of an entire group, and we respectfully ask that this principle of justice be upheld,” the statement added. As Pakistan and Afghanistan’s relationship deteriorates due to the terrorist outfits operating from the Afghan soil, Islamabad has stepped up the deportation of Afghan refugees, including those who have valid documents. The statement also reflected this concern, saying the authorities continued to arrest and deport Afghan nationals, including “documented US allies”. “Even official letters from the US Embassy carry no protection, and many with valid documents are still detained and deported. If we are forced back to Afghanistan, we will be immediately identified and killed by the Taliban for our service to the United States,” the statement said, adding that thousands of cases that had already been processed were now in a state of uncertainty. “We urgently request that the United States uphold its commitments, protect its allies, and resume the evacuation process before more innocent lives are lost,” it added. “We are not criminals. We are the allies who stood with America. Now, we ask America to stand with us,” said the statement issued on behalf of the P1/P2 case holders in Pakistan. In a recent statement posted on its website, the UN refugee agency had also urged Pakistan to ensure that Afghans with specific protection needs are exempted from the provisions of the ‘Illegal Foreigner Repatriation Plan’ and allowed to remain safely in the country. The UNHCR confirmed that more than one million Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan in 2025. “In the right circumstances, this would be something to celebrate,” said Philippa Candler, UNHCR representative in Pakistan. “But under the current conditions, it raises more concerns than solutions.” Published in Dawn, December 1st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Sunday slammed the sisters of PTI founder Imran Khan for giving interviews to the Indian media while one of ex-premier’s sisters, Noreen Niazi, criticised the PML-N for having “double standards”. Last week, Imran’s sisters had camped outside Adiala Jail, where the PTI founder is currently incarcerated , along with other PTI members after being denied a meeting. According to the PTI, Aleema Khan, Dr Uzma Khan and Noreen were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when they were manhandled and “violently detained” by police. After repeatedly being barred from meeting their brother, Noreen and another sister of Imran, Aleema Khan, gave separate interviews to the Indian media on the matter. “These three sisters of Imran Ahmed Niazi sahib , on May 9 they were also present at the Core Commander’s House,” he said, but added that until now they had not been told not to “cry victimisation”. “If you ask my legal opinion, their presence is proof … They were there on May 9, they brought groups there and it is visible in the cameras that all three are present there,” Tarar said. “The drama being made today — there is a reason for that.” He said that the foreign policy success after Marka-i- Haq was not being digested well by the PTI. “In their era the economy had dipped; it is (now) moving towards an economy of stability. They are not able to digest this.” “Why are these sisters going on Indian channels and Afghanistan’s channels and crying for their brother?” Tarar stressed. “In the interview that Noreen Khan Niazi gave to an Indian channel, did she say that she condemns Modi? Those innocent children that were martyred, did she talk about Irtaza Abbas? Did she talk about those citizens that were martyred in Muridke and Bahawalpur? Did she talk about those soldiers and young officers who were martyred? Did she pay tribute to them?” He slammed the sisters’ actions, saying: “Those who go on Indian channels and defame Pakistan should be ashamed of themselves.” He added that Indian channels were providing their platform because they knew that “this family, and this party’s mindset is against Pakistan”. He further slammed Noreen for not condemning the Hindutva ideology on the Indian channel, the cruelty against Muslims in India, or talking about the issue of India-occupied Kashmir. “Shame on you!” the minister said with emphasis. “That you go on Indian channels and don’t talk about occupied Kashmir, Marka-i-Haq, martyrs, and you go and cry about victimisation about a prisoner who is involved in a corruption case?” He said that the family was building “hype” in foreign media about the danger to Imran’s health, saying, “Let me assure you: he’s hale and hearty. There’s no issue. He runs every day on a treadmill for an hour. “This kind of privileged prisoner — this kind of VVIP prisoner who enjoys five-star hotel facilities — you will not find anywhere in the world,” he said. He added, “If only, Noreen Khan sahiba , you had gone there and talked about your martyred, about that child Irtiza Abbas. About the victory in Marka-i-Haq … if only you had paid tribute to your prime minister and chief of army staff, and condemned Modi … but for you, politics is important, defaming Pakistan is important, and personal matters are important.” Noreen Niazi rebukes PML-N Meanwhile, Noreen Khan criticised the ruling party, PML-N, for what she called “double standards”. “PML-N’s double standards are staggering. They attack me for giving an interview to Indian media, yet Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister, has himself used Indian platforms to malign Pakistan’s own military leadership,” she alleged , adding that today, “he and his family sit comfortably in power on the back of a blatantly manipulated mandate”. “His brother, his daughter, and his party enjoy the perks of authority while lecturing others on ‘principles’.” She further alleged that “elements aligned with this same power structure shamelessly doctored portions of my interview using AI, a deliberate attempt to distort my words and mislead public opinion. “These are the same actors who have kept Imran Khan in unlawful, inhumane isolation for four weeks cut off from family, lawyers, and basic rights,” she continued her accusation, adding: “I have never held public office. My only purpose in speaking publicly is to expose the injustice of my brother’s imprisonment and to urge the human rights organisations and judiciary to recognise the systematic denial of his legal, political, and humanitarian rights.” ‘Political-terror-crime nexus’ Tarar also accused Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and his team of having “ties with enemies of the state”, saying it was now “out in the open”. “Over 4,000 cases have been registered regarding the infiltration of terrorists, who are sheltered [in KP’s] areas, in three years. But, the rate of punishment is nonexistent,” he alleged. “This prosecution system is under the provincial government, which is supposed to bring in legal reforms and make it stronger.” The minister said the KP government had been “unable to form a system to prosecute terrorists in its 12-and-a-half years in power”. Continuing his accusations, he said: “The border is being guarded, but due to the weaknesses and failures of the district administration and provincial govt, infiltration has increased.” Moreover, “there is a political-terror-crime nexus. The CM and his people are involved in drug trade in KP, they maintain close ties with drug lords”, Tarar alleged. “Within 12-and-a-half years, whose responsibility was it to stop drug money being used to finance terrorism?” He claimed that the KP government’s performance was “negligible because of the political-terror-crime nexus”, under which “drug smuggling is promoted and drug money is used”. “They (KP government) don’t punish terrorists, and of the over 10,000 cases of drug trafficking from January-August 2025, only 679 cases have been decided,” Tarar added. “If the KP government knows of such a large drug cartel operating in its territory and cannot take action against it, that means there is a political-terror-crime nexus,” he reiterated the accusation. Tarar further alleged that “terrorists attack state institutions but not those involved in KP’s drug trade, because doing so, they’d lose their source of financing”.",

      "summary_orig": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked the country’s president on Sunday for a pardon in his long-running corruption trial, arguing that criminal proceedings were hindering his ability to govern and a pardon would be good for Israel. Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, denies the bribery, fraud, and breach of trust charges. His lawyers said in a letter to the president’s office that the prime minister still believes the legal proceedings would result in a complete acquittal. “My lawyers sent a request for pardon to the president of the country today. I expect that anyone who wishes for the good of the country [will] support this step,” Netanyahu said in a brief video statement released by his political party, the Likud. Neither the prime minister, who has been on trial for five years, nor his lawyers made any admission of guilt. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Netanyahu should not be pardoned without admitting guilt, expressing remorse, and immediately retiring from political life. Pardons in Israel have typically been granted only after legal proceedings have concluded and the accused has been convicted. Netanyahu’s lawyers argued that the president can intervene when public interest is at stake, as in this case, with a view to healing divisions and strengthening national unity. Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s office described the request as “extraordinary” with “significant implications”. The president “will responsibly and sincerely consider the request” after receiving relevant opinions, his office said. US President Donald Trump wrote to Herzog this month, urging him to consider granting the prime minister a pardon, saying the case against him was “a political, unjustified prosecution”. Herzog’s office said the request would be forwarded to the pardons department in the justice ministry, as is standard practice, to collect opinions, which would be submitted to the president’s legal adviser, who will formulate a recommendation for the president. Israel’s Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, is a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party and a close ally of the prime minister. In the letter, Netanyahu’s lawyers argued that criminal proceedings against him had deepened societal divisions and that ending the trial was necessary for national reconciliation. They also wrote that increasingly frequent court hearings were burdensome while the prime minister was attempting to govern. “I am required to testify three times a week … that is an impossible demand that is not made of any other citizen,” Netanyahu said in the video statement, emphasising that he had received the public’s trust by repeatedly winning elections. Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three separate but related cases that centre around accusations that he granted favours to prominent business figures in exchange for gifts and sympathetic media coverage. The prime minister has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Coalition allies issued statements supporting Netanyahu’s request for a pardon, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Opposition politician Yair Golan , a former deputy chief of the military, called on the prime minister to resign, urging the president not to grant a pardon. Netanyahu is one of the country’s most polarising political figures, who was first elected prime minister in 1996. He has since served in government and opposition and returned to the prime minister’s office following the 2022 election. The next election is due by October 2026, and many polls indicate that his coalition, the most right-wing in Israel’s history, would struggle to win enough seats to form a government. Throughout his career, Netanyahu has cultivated a reputation for prioritising security and economic issues, but he has also been dogged by corruption charges. He was prime minister on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel. Since then, he has overseen the devastating war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and levelled much of the territory, drawing broad international criticism and condemnation. Israel has severely weakened Hamas and Hezbollah, and this year launched a war against Iran that destroyed critical military infrastructure.",

Opposition politician Yair Golan , a former deputy chief of the military, called on the prime minister to resign, urging the president not to grant a pardon. Netanyahu is one of the country’s most polarising political figures, who was first elected prime minister in 1996. He has since served in government and opposition and returned to the prime minister’s office following the 2022 election. The next election is due by October 2026, and many polls indicate that his coalition, the most right-wing in Israel’s history, would struggle to win enough seats to form a government. Throughout his career, Netanyahu has cultivated a reputation for prioritising security and economic issues, but he has also been dogged by corruption charges. He was prime minister on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel. Since then, he has overseen the devastating war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and levelled much of the territory, drawing broad international criticism and condemnation. Israel has severely weakened Hamas and Hezbollah, and this year launched a war against Iran that destroyed critical military infrastructure.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Sunday expressed concerns about Israel’s commitment to peace in Gaza, saying that Muslim countries that had supported the peace treaty may need to “reassess their stance” in the face of continued violations of the fragile ceasefire in the region. Despite the declaration of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on October 9, Israel has continued to bombard the territory while a long-term plan for peace is discussed. The defence minister posted today on social media platform X that the ceasefire agreement had been criticised for being one-sided and that Israeli forces “continue to violate the truce, killing Palestinians including children”. “The agreement, signed in Sharm el-Sheikh, was meant to bring stability to the region, but Israel’s actions have raised concerns about its commitment to the deal,” Asif said. The defence minister added, “Muslim countries that supported the treaty, including Turkiye, Egypt, and Qatar, may need to reassess their stance given the ongoing violence. “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already expressed concerns, stating that the ceasefire agreement shouldn’t be mistaken for a final settlement to the Palestinian issue,” he said. Asif pointed out that since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, at least 352 Palestinians had been killed, while over 70,000 people had lost their lives in Gaza since the start of the conflict. He added that Amnesty International had warned that “Israel’s genocide is not over, and the international community especially western governments must keep pressuring Israel to abide by international law”. A cornerstone of the United States-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. However, countries that had previously supported the plan have since expressed reservations. Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said that Pakistan was willing to commit troops to the Gaza peace force, but “not ready” to participate in the disarming of Hamas. “We are not ready for that. This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement,” he said.",
