      "summary_orig": "The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said on Monday it was “deeply shocked” to hear about reports of the killing of several civilians caused by alleged “aerial bombing” in the Tirah area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and demanded a probe into the matter. The “HRCP is deeply shocked to learn that a number of civilians, including children, have been killed, allegedly as a result of aerial bombing in Tirah, Khyber district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the organisation posted on X. It demanded that “the authorities carry out an immediate and impartial inquiry into the incident and hold to account those responsible”. “The state is constitutionally bound to protect all civilians’ right to life, which it has repeatedly failed to secure,” the HRCP statement read. So far, no official statement sharing the details of the reported incident has been issued by the relevant authorities. Dawn.com has reached out to Khyber Deputy Commissioner Bilal Shahid and District Police Officer Mazhar Iqbal for a comment, but has not received any response so far. Meanwhile, a senior police officer in the area told AFP on condition of anonymity that “the jets targeted four houses, which were completely destroyed”. He, however, did not say who carried out the attack. KP Assembly Speaker Babar Swati called on the federal and provincial governments to conduct a “transparent and immediate investigation into the incident, identify those responsible, and not only provide immediate relief and compensation to the affected families but also take comprehensive measures for their rehabilitation”. A statement uploaded on his X account said he expressed his sorrow over the “martyrdom of innocent civilians and the destruction of homes due to the bombardment by jet aircraft”. Special Assistant to Chief Minister for Communication and Works Sohail Afridi also raised his voice on the matter during today’s KP Assembly session. He said the “horrifying tragedy” occurred at 2am in Tirah. He alleged that 25 people, including women and children, were killed when “mortar and bombs were dropped” on the locals. He blamed the security forces for the incident, however, it has not yet been independently established who was responsible. Mohammad Iqbal Khan Afridi, member of the National Assembly from Khyber, expressed sorrow over the incident in a video message in Pashto, which he shared with the media. He said elderly women and children were killed in “shelling by jets” in Tirah and urged the people to reach the site of the incident to protest the killings. The MNA said it was not the first time that such an incident had taken place. “The killing of civilians has become a routine.” In a similar incident in May, 22 people, including seven children, were injured in an alleged quadcopter strike in the Wana tehsil of KP’s South Waziristan district. Around a week earlier, four children were killed and five others were injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions drop in Mir Ali tehsil of the North Waziristan district in KP. Later, the military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

      "summary_orig": "A first information report (FIR) was registered against suspects who allegedly gunned down three transgender persons in Karachi, it emerged on Monday. The bodies of three transgender individuals were recovered from Karachi’s Memon Goth area after midnight on Sunday, according to Edhi Information Centre. It said the bodies were found riddled with bullet holes and that the deceased were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medicolegal formalities. The complaint was filed at Memon Goth police station on Sunday under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code. According to the FIR, registered by a transgender person who lived in the same building as the three victims, they told the complainant on Saturday evening that they were headed to Bahria Town on Super Highway. “I tried calling them, but they did not answer. I kept calling them until 1am,” the complainant stated in the FIR. Ït was not until I opened WhatsApp that I found they were headed back to Karachi from Nagori Society in Hyderabad, when they were attacked in a forested area on the Super Highway. “An unknown person, or persons, shot and killed them,” the complainant alleged. “I filed this complaint because unknown people killed them for unknown reasons and legal action needs to be taken.” A research report jointly compiled this year by Blue Veins and the National Commission on Human Rights found that many transgender individuals in Pakistan experience social exclusion, including rejection by families, employment discrimination and violence , pushing them further into vulnerability. In July, armed motorcyclists killed a transgender person in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand division. The same month, another transgender person was shot dead by unidentified persons in the Tehkal area of Peshawar. Last year, two transgender persons were stabbed to death in Mardan by assailants, who fled the scene after committing the crime, according to the police.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif departed from London on Monday for New York, where he will lead Pakistan’s delegation at a high-level segment of the United Nations General Assembly’s (UNGA) session. At the UNGA session, PM Shehbaz “will urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination,” particularly in India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine, an earlier statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said. “He will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development.” The FO, in its statement, said PM Shehbaz would attend several “high-level events” on the sidelines of the UNGA session, including a moot of “select” Muslim leaders with US President Donald Trump. Further, during his visit, he will meet several world leaders and senior UN officials to exchange views on issues of mutual interest. “He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN member states to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council,” the FO added. Today, Pakistan’s High Commissioner in the United Kingdom Dr Muhammad Faisal and other diplomatic staff saw the PM off at Luton Airport in the UK. Earlier, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reached New York and would be accompanying PM Shehbaz at the UNGA  . “On arrival, FM Dar was received by Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, Ambassador Rizwan Saeed Shiekh, Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States and senior officials of the Mission,” the FO said on X. “The DPM/FM will have a busy programme in New York. Besides accompanying the PM to his many engagements, the DPM/FM will represent Pakistan in numerous ministerial and high-level meetings and also hold over a dozen bilateral meetings with his counterparts,” the statement added. As nearly 150 world leaders gather to mark the UN’s 80th anniversary, the global peace forum finds itself surrounded by protests and engulfed in wars. From its inception, the unresolved question of Palestine has haunted the UN, testing both its credibility and its capacity to deliver peace. A high-level international conference for the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution” at the UNGA, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, aims to revive support for a two-state solution. In a break with convention, the UNGA last week voted to allow Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to address the event by video link, after the US denied him and his delegation visas to attend the meeting.",

      "summary_orig": "Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Monday took notice of an attack last night on Metro 1 News anchorperson Imtiaz Mir in Karachi’s Malir area that injured him. According to a statement issued by the Saudabad police station late last night, Mir was shot and injured by unknown gunmen in Malir district’s Kala Board area. “It seems to be targeted,” said the statement, adding that further investigation was under way. CM Shah took notice of the “murderous attack on senior journalist Imtiaz Mir”, said a statement issued by the CM’s spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa. Expressing deep regret over the incident, the chief minister sought a report on the incident from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon. Saudabad Station House Officer (SHO) Atiqur Rehman told Dawn.com , “The journalist is admitted at the intensive care unit of [a] private hospital.” He added that Mir sustained two bullet wounds, including one on the mouth. “He was travelling in a car, which his brother was driving, when armed pillion riders targeted him at Malir’s Kala Board,” SHO Rehman said. Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, in a statement earlier today, condemned the attack and ordered the immediate arrest of the perpetrators. He also sought a report from the East district’s deputy IG. “Protection of journalists and media workers should be ensured at all costs,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. “Protection of the lives and property of citizens is the top priority of the government. The suspects should be brought to justice,” he asserted. The police were also directed to reveal the motives behind the attack, the statement added. In May, police in Shikarpur claimed to have killed Sheroo Mahar — a notorious dacoit nominated as the prime suspect in the murder case of senior journalist Jan Mohammad Mahar — in a drone attack in the kutcha area of the district. The journalist, who worked for Sindhi language KTN news network, was shot dead by unknown assailants who had opened fire on his car after he left his office in Sukkur in late evening hours on August 14, 2024. In April, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) expressed concern over threats issued to journalists by supporters of a religious party. The same month, Khairpur police claimed to have arrested five suspects allegedly involved in the murder of a journalist Allah Dino Shar aka A.D. Shar, who worked for an Urdu news channel. A.D. Shar was murdered a day before in Aliabad within the jurisdiction of Thari Mirwah police station, sparking protests by his community at press clubs across Khairpur district. In November last year , Nadeem Ahmed, a senior reporter at 92 News TV channel, was shot at and wounded in an armed attack in Karachi’s Karsaz area. According to a report published earlier this month by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.",

      "summary_orig": "Posts from multiple pro-Pakistani accounts on social media platform X since September 18 shared a video, claiming that it allegedly showed the Indian Army chief admitting to the loss of four Rafale Jets during the May standoff between India and Pakistan. However, the video is doctored and does not show the Indian Army chief. Pakistan and India fought in a four-day conflict earlier in May 2025. Indian fighter jets were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force’s late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh. Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29, within a 40-minute span. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat. On Sept 18, an X account, that appears to be anti-Indian based upon its previous posts, shared a video with the following caption: “Indian Army chief once again admits of losing four Rafale Jets due to miscalculating Pakistan military’s capability. Underestimating Pakistan was the biggest mistake of Indian politicians.” The transcription of the video is provided below: “On the 7th, we attacked nine terrorist targets between 1am and 1:30am. You know, there were operations in Balakot before this. We kept saying that we have killed them, they are successful, but there was no evidence, satellite imagery or photographs. But now, what we were doing, why did we do it at 1:30 am? We thought that the Pakistani air force must be sleeping, and no one would know what we have attacked in Pakistan. But they all came to know. Our four Rafales fell, but we have learned a lot. Now, we will remain alert even at night, that Pakistan is watching us all the time. The biggest thing is that this is learning.” The post gained 59,600 views. The same post was also reshared by multiple users on X, as can be seen here , here , here , here , and here . A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the military conflict between India and Pakistan. Observing the video showed inconsistencies, such as the words not matching the lip-syncing, the tone of the speaker and the background noise after the 28-second mark. The audio of the video was tested on forensic tool DeepFake-Total, which detected potential manipulation from the 27.5-second mark. A keyword and reverse image search showed that the individual in the video was not Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi, the chief of army staff , but Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan , the highest-ranking individual in the Indian Army. A reverse image search also yielded the original video of CDS Chauhan interacting with schoolchildren at Raj Bhavan in Ranchi on Sept 18, as posted by Indian news agency ANI News on X. The transcription of the video’s first minute, corresponding with the viral video, is provided below: “The first thing is, you must have read everything else, there has been a lot of discussion in the newspapers.  On the 7th, we attacked the nine terrorist targets between 1am and 1:30 am. You know, there were operations in Balakot before this. We kept saying that the operations in Balakot were successful, but there was no evidence or satellite imagery or photographs. But now, what we were doing, why did we do it at 1:30 am? That is the darkest and most difficult. Taking satellite imagery, photographing it, collecting evidence. Still, we did it at 1 or 1:30 am. Why was that?  There were two reasons.  First, we had confidence in our capabilities. That if we do it at night, we can take satellite imagery at night as well. And the second important thing was that we wanted to avoid civilian casualties.” As can be seen in the transcription, he does not mention the downing of four Rafale jets by Pakistan, nor does he say any of the secondary claims made. The doctored part begins at the 6-second mark of the viral clip and features a voiceover starting precisely at the 34th second until the 54th second of the original speech. Alongside ANI , many other mainstream Indian media outlets reported the interaction of CDS Chauhan, but none mentioned any of the statements in the video circulating online, as can be seen in reports by The Times of India , The Hindu and India Today . Pakistani news outlets also did not report the statements, which they would otherwise be expected to as happened when CDS Chauhan first admitted on May 31 to the downing of Indian jets without specifying the number. Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows the Indian Army chief admitting to losing four Rafale Jets during the May 2025 conflict is false . The video is doctored and does not show the Indian Army chief but Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

Indian fighter jets were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force’s late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh. Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29, within a 40-minute span. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat. On Sept 18, an X account, that appears to be anti-Indian based upon its previous posts, shared a video with the following caption: “Indian Army chief once again admits of losing four Rafale Jets due to miscalculating Pakistan military’s capability. Underestimating Pakistan was the biggest mistake of Indian politicians.” The transcription of the video is provided below: “On the 7th, we attacked nine terrorist targets between 1am and 1:30am. You know, there were operations in Balakot before this. We kept saying that we have killed them, they are successful, but there was no evidence, satellite imagery or photographs. But now, what we were doing, why did we do it at 1:30 am? We thought that the Pakistani air force must be sleeping, and no one would know what we have attacked in Pakistan. But they all came to know. Our four Rafales fell, but we have learned a lot. Now, we will remain alert even at night, that Pakistan is watching us all the time. The biggest thing is that this is learning.” The post gained 59,600 views. The same post was also reshared by multiple users on X, as can be seen here , here , here , here , and here . A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the military conflict between India and Pakistan. Observing the video showed inconsistencies, such as the words not matching the lip-syncing, the tone of the speaker and the background noise after the 28-second mark. The audio of the video was tested on forensic tool DeepFake-Total, which detected potential manipulation from the 27.5-second mark. A keyword and reverse image search showed that the individual in the video was not Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi, the chief of army staff , but Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan , the highest-ranking individual in the Indian Army. A reverse image search also yielded the original video of CDS Chauhan interacting with schoolchildren at Raj Bhavan in Ranchi on Sept 18, as posted by Indian news agency ANI News on X. The transcription of the video’s first minute, corresponding with the viral video, is provided below: “The first thing is, you must have read everything else, there has been a lot of discussion in the newspapers.  On the 7th, we attacked the nine terrorist targets between 1am and 1:30 am. You know, there were operations in Balakot before this. We kept saying that the operations in Balakot were successful, but there was no evidence or satellite imagery or photographs. But now, what we were doing, why did we do it at 1:30 am? That is the darkest and most difficult. Taking satellite imagery, photographing it, collecting evidence. Still, we did it at 1 or 1:30 am. Why was that?  There were two reasons.  First, we had confidence in our capabilities. That if we do it at night, we can take satellite imagery at night as well. And the second important thing was that we wanted to avoid civilian casualties.” As can be seen in the transcription, he does not mention the downing of four Rafale jets by Pakistan, nor does he say any of the secondary claims made. The doctored part begins at the 6-second mark of the viral clip and features a voiceover starting precisely at the 34th second until the 54th second of the original speech. Alongside ANI , many other mainstream Indian media outlets reported the interaction of CDS Chauhan, but none mentioned any of the statements in the video circulating online, as can be seen in reports by The Times of India , The Hindu and India Today . Pakistani news outlets also did not report the statements, which they would otherwise be expected to as happened when CDS Chauhan first admitted on May 31 to the downing of Indian jets without specifying the number. Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows the Indian Army chief admitting to losing four Rafale Jets during the May 2025 conflict is false . The video is doctored and does not show the Indian Army chief but Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan’s floods leave lasting scars on its children",
      "summary_orig": "Azan “has seen everything. He knows his parents are gone. He just doesn’t yet understand how to live without them.” Shams ur Rehman is talking about his nine-year-old nephew Muhammad Azan, who has been staying with him and his family in Buner, a district in north-western Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Azan’s parents, as well as his three brothers, were killed when flash floods tore through the valley in the middle of August. Also in Buner, 17-year-old Qadir Ahmed has to carry another burden. On 15 August, his family house collapsed in the floods. “The water carried away my mother… now, I must look after my [four] younger brothers and sisters.” Not long ago, Ahmed passed his matriculation exams and aspired to go to college. Now, suddenly, he has to step in as the head of the family. “My education has stopped,” he says. “It is very difficult to take care of my siblings after losing our home and our mother.” Pakistan has been experiencing unprecedented floods and landslides. The country’s National Disaster Management Authority ( NDMA ) reports that since late June, more than 1,000 people have been killed, with nearly 1,100 left injured due to monsoon-related disasters. Around half of all deaths have been in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where nearly 4,700 homes have been destroyed or damaged. The floods have not spared other parts of the country. In Punjab, several major rivers faced large swells due to historic levels of rain in mid-August. Water discharges from across the Indian border have also contributed to villages and farmlands becoming submerged. More than two million people have been evacuated and outbreaks of skin- and water-borne diseases are expected. In the northern administrative territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, entire valleys have been cut off due to landslides, and more than 3,000 displaced people are staying in temporary camps. In Sindh, southern Pakistan, at least 150,000 people had been evacuated to safer areas as of 12 September. Ahmed and Azan’s experiences are just two examples of how the floods in Pakistan are devastating the lives of children and causing trauma with long-lasting impacts. Trauma without treatment In Khalti village in Gilgit-Baltistan, Waseem Akram, a teacher, saw his private school shut down in mid-August when floods washed away houses and caused landslides that blocked roads. “Children are not going to school. They don’t have books, uniforms or shelter. Their behaviour has changed; they show anger, fear or silence,” he says, adding: “Many may drop out entirely.” Muhammad Sohail, media coordinator for Rescue 1122, a government emergency service for disaster rescue, says that at present, Pakistan’s disaster response is focused only on physical rescue. “But mental health is just as important.” He notes that systematic trauma care is practically unavailable. “Some officers are trained in Psychological First Aid, but there is no long-term counselling for children… This gap leaves scars that last for years.” Fariha Sheikh is a social worker volunteering with the collection and distribution of food, period kits and other supplies in flood-hit villages on the outskirts of Sialkot and Narowal districts in Punjab, eastern Pakistan. She observes that children have been one of the most vulnerable groups. “Families are displaced, many of them living under open skies or in temporary shelters… kids from the villages have lost everything,” she says. Some officers are trained in Psychological First Aid, but there is no long-term counselling for children… this gap leaves scars that last for years “You can see the fear and uncertainty in their eyes… their normal life has just been snatched away,” she adds, noting that many are experiencing panic attacks. Through her volunteer work, Sheikh has encountered children who have lost their parents. “It’s heartbreaking. Some kids don’t even fully realise what has happened, but they know their parents are not there anymore,” she says. Added to these devastating upheavals are the physical dangers and changes they face. “Children are falling sick because of dirty water [from the floods] and a lack of food, and schools are either destroyed or being used as shelters,” Sheikh notes. The trauma faced by children experiencing floods are exacerbated by the dangers they face from poverty, displacement and school closures. In Punjab alone, over 700,000 children have been affected by disruption to their education, with more than 2,900 schools forced to shut down due to the floods as of mid-September, according to The Nation. Unicef warned in the aftermath of Pakistan’s 2022 floods that the longer schools remained closed, the higher the risk of impacted children dropping out, which then increases the likelihood of them being forced into child labour and marriage. When policies fail children Amid the tragedy is the question of Pakistan’s lack of preparedness for such extreme weather. According to Yasir Darya, founder of environmental consultancy Darya Lab and the Karachi-based Climate Action Center, institutional failures have caused disasters to become even deadlier. He highlights how early warning mechanisms planned after the 2022 flood did not come to fruition, and blames poor governance. “Communities remain cut off and unprotected,” he says. “It is a societal crisis as much as a climate one.” These failures mean greater devastation from extreme weather and climate events, which will continue to severely impact children’s mental health. We don’t just need rations; we need proper houses, schools, hospitals, libraries and recreational spaces so children can feel normal again Earlier this year, researchers coined the term “Environmentally driven Adverse Childhood Experiences ( E-ACEs )” to refer to severe stressors children may face when exposed to prolonged, recurring or intense extreme weather and climate events. These can cause toxic stress similar to that seen in children experiencing abuse or neglect. The researchers caution that repeated experiences with floods, displacement and family separation may impair their brain development and increase their vulnerability to long-term health risks. They also refer to climate-related adverse childhood experiences as a humanitarian crisis of the 21st century that particularly impact children of low- and middle-income countries such as Pakistan, where more people are being displaced. Despite the clear need to protect children from climate change impacts, they remain largely absent from climate policies. Analysis published this year by the Early Childhood Development Action Network ( ECDAN ) found that of the 10 countries expected to have the largest populations by 2100, only six, including Pakistan, mention children or youth in their national climate policies. And even these largely fail to address the specific needs of young children. In the case of Pakistan, references to children in its policies only focused on child mortality rates without addressing broader early childhood development needs, including the sustained provision of nutrition, education and healthcare during climate shocks. In northern Pakistan, families such as those of Azan and Qadir see few signs of such planning. Displaced communities receive food and tents lasting just days, while education is disrupted for months, they told Dialogue Earth. Beyond survival Akram, the teacher, stresses that aid should not be limited to emergency tents and food, but focused on rebuilding, as young flood survivors need stability in their lives. “We don’t just need rations; we need proper houses, schools, hospitals, libraries and recreational spaces so children can feel normal again,” he says. “Otherwise, these children will lose their futures.” Sheikh, the social worker, echoes these concerns, saying: “[Children] need food, clean water, medicines, but also safe spaces and care. Their mental and emotional state matters as much as their physical survival. For a child, losing home and safety is too much to carry.” As the water begins to recede in parts of Pakistan, families returning to their homes look to the significant task of rebuilding. For many impacted children, the trauma they have experienced is evident. Azan now clings tightly to his uncle during storms. Unless there is rapid investment in adaptation and trauma care, as well as the inclusion of children in national climate adaptation policies, Pakistan is at risk of raising a generation characterised not by its potential, but by its losses.

      "summary_en": "Azan “has seen everything. He knows his parents are gone. He just doesn’t yet understand how to live without them.” Shams ur Rehman is talking about his nine-year-old nephew Muhammad Azan, who has been staying with him and his family in Buner, a district in north-western Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Azan’s parents, as well as his three brothers, were killed when flash floods tore through the valley in the middle of August. Also in Buner, 17-year-old Qadir Ahmed has to carry another burden. On 15 August, his family house collapsed in the floods. “The water carried away my mother… now, I must look after my [four] younger brothers and sisters.” Not long ago, Ahmed passed his matriculation exams and aspired to go to college. Now, suddenly, he has to step in as the head of the family. “My education has stopped,” he says. “It is very difficult to take care of my siblings after losing our home and our mother.” Pakistan has been experiencing unprecedented floods and landslides. The country’s National Disaster Management Authority ( NDMA ) reports that since late June, more than 1,000 people have been killed, with nearly 1,100 left injured due to monsoon-related disasters. Around half of all deaths have been in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where nearly 4,700 homes have been destroyed or damaged. The floods have not spared other parts of the country. In Punjab, several major rivers faced large swells due to historic levels of rain in mid-August. Water discharges from across the Indian border have also contributed to villages and farmlands becoming submerged. More than two million people have been evacuated and outbreaks of skin- and water-borne diseases are expected. In the northern administrative territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, entire valleys have been cut off due to landslides, and more than 3,000 displaced people are staying in temporary camps. In Sindh, southern Pakistan, at least 150,000 people had been evacuated to safer areas as of 12 September. Ahmed and Azan’s experiences are just two examples of how the floods in Pakistan are devastating the lives of children and causing trauma with long-lasting impacts. Trauma without treatment In Khalti village in Gilgit-Baltistan, Waseem Akram, a teacher, saw his private school shut down in mid-August when floods washed away houses and caused landslides that blocked roads. “Children are not going to school. They don’t have books, uniforms or shelter. Their behaviour has changed; they show anger, fear or silence,” he says, adding: “Many may drop out entirely.” Muhammad Sohail, media coordinator for Rescue 1122, a government emergency service for disaster rescue, says that at present, Pakistan’s disaster response is focused only on physical rescue. “But mental health is just as important.” He notes that systematic trauma care is practically unavailable. “Some officers are trained in Psychological First Aid, but there is no long-term counselling for children… This gap leaves scars that last for years.” Fariha Sheikh is a social worker volunteering with the collection and distribution of food, period kits and other supplies in flood-hit villages on the outskirts of Sialkot and Narowal districts in Punjab, eastern Pakistan. She observes that children have been one of the most vulnerable groups. “Families are displaced, many of them living under open skies or in temporary shelters… kids from the villages have lost everything,” she says. Some officers are trained in Psychological First Aid, but there is no long-term counselling for children… this gap leaves scars that last for years “You can see the fear and uncertainty in their eyes… their normal life has just been snatched away,” she adds, noting that many are experiencing panic attacks. Through her volunteer work, Sheikh has encountered children who have lost their parents. “It’s heartbreaking. Some kids don’t even fully realise what has happened, but they know their parents are not there anymore,” she says. Added to these devastating upheavals are the physical dangers and changes they face. “Children are falling sick because of dirty water [from the floods] and a lack of food, and schools are either destroyed or being used as shelters,” Sheikh notes. The trauma faced by children experiencing floods are exacerbated by the dangers they face from poverty, displacement and school closures. In Punjab alone, over 700,000 children have been affected by disruption to their education, with more than 2,900 schools forced to shut down due to the floods as of mid-September, according to The Nation. Unicef warned in the aftermath of Pakistan’s 2022 floods that the longer schools remained closed, the higher the risk of impacted children dropping out, which then increases the likelihood of them being forced into child labour and marriage. When policies fail children Amid the tragedy is the question of Pakistan’s lack of preparedness for such extreme weather. According to Yasir Darya, founder of environmental consultancy Darya Lab and the Karachi-based Climate Action Center, institutional failures have caused disasters to become even deadlier. He highlights how early warning mechanisms planned after the 2022 flood did not come to fruition, and blames poor governance. “Communities remain cut off and unprotected,” he says. “It is a societal crisis as much as a climate one.” These failures mean greater devastation from extreme weather and climate events, which will continue to severely impact children’s mental health.

      "summary_orig": "An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad on Monday issued a bailable arrest warrant for PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser in a case related to the March 2023 clashes outside the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC). Hours-long clashes took place between PTI workers and the Islamabad police on March 18, 2023, when former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the FJC to attend a hearing in the first Toshakhana case , in which he was later arrested in August that year and has been behind bars since then. The same day, the Punjab police personnel had entered Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore, which had also been the venue of a chaotic stalemate between the cops and the PTI just days before. ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over today’s hearing. Advocate Sardar Masroof Khan, Amna Ali and others appeared as the legal team for the PTI leaders, while Advocate Sardar Muhammad Razzaq was present as former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi’s counsel. The judge issued a bailable arrest warrant for Qaiser, ordering that he be produced before the court.

      "summary_orig": "The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) has arrested 89 terrorists in 940 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) launched across Punjab over the past three months, the department said in a statement on Monday. There has been a recent uptick in terror attacks in Pakistan over the past year. The CTD regularly carries out operations to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. During the three months, 14 terrorists were arrested in Lahore, 14 in Rawalpindi, seven each in Faisalabad and Bahawalpur, six each in Jhang and Sargodha, five in Sahiwal, four from Gujranwala and three each from Bahawalnagar and Gujrat, the statement read. “Of the arrested terrorists, 55 belong to Fitna al Khawarij , five are from ISIS (Islamic State), and two each are from Al-Qaeda, Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Jeay Sindh,” the statement added. The state uses the term Fitna al Khawarij to refer to terrorists of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). According to the CTD, items seized during the raids include 20.2 kilogrammes of explosive material, 85 detonators, 183 feet of safety fuse wire, 717 pamphlets belonging to a banned organisation, magazines, detonating cord, mobile phones and cash. The CTD added that 87 criminal cases have been registered against the arrested suspects, and investigations are underway. “The arrested individuals had been planning attacks on important buildings in several cities,” the statement read. “CTD Punjab remains vigilant and committed to the ‘Safe Punjab’ objective. We will spare no effort to bring terrorists and anti-state elements to justice. “In related security activity during the current week, local police and security agencies carried out 13,521 combing operations, checked 552,692 people, arrested 1,131 suspicious persons, registered 1,061 FIRs (first information reports) and achieved 906 recoveries. Earlier this week, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CTD neutralised three terrorists, including an Afghan national, during an IBO carried out in Khyber district. Two of the three militants killed during the IBO were involved in a suicide bombing in Peshawar, which led to the deaths of a sub-inspector and a constable. A statement issued by the CTD said that the department conducted the operation based on the reported presence of Fazal Noor, a commander of the banned militant group Islamic State Khorasan Province and his group members in the Ali Masjid area of the district.",

Residents and Rescue 1122 officials said the incident occurred on the main Khar-Nawagai Road in the Khazana area within the jurisdiction of Lowi Sam police station. They told Dawn that Mir Azam Khan, 45, was heading to his home in Khazana Dag area when unknown assailants opened fire on him, leaving him critically injured. Amjad Khan, district emergency officer of Rescue 1122, said the injured was shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Khar, where the doctors pronounced him dead upon arrival at the hospital’s emergency. No one claimed responsibility for the incident. Soon after the murder, several ANP leaders and workers also took to the social media to condemn the killing. ANP local chapter president Gul Afzal Khan, deputy general secretary Sadiq Akbar Jan, provincial joint secretary Shah Naseer Khan, Sheikh Jan Zada, and party’s local MPA Mohammad Nisar Khan condemned the killing of Azam Khan, who was additional general secretary of ANP Khar tehsil. The ANP leaders demanded the early arrest of those responsible for the incident. Meanwhile, ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain and general secretary Hussain Shah Yousafzai also condemned the killing and called his murder failure of the government to ensure safety and security of people. In a post shared on ANP’s official Facebook page on Sunday evening, both the leaders expressed concerns and sorrow over the murder of Mr Khan. They noted that the incident occurred near a police post. They mentioned that earlier, Maulana Khan Zeb was also killed by unknown assailants in Bajaur, but the killers still remained at large, showing the government’s failure to maintain peace in the region. “We urge the government to immediately arrest those involved in both the killings.“ Published in Dawn, September 22nd, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Police in the Philippine capital arrested more than 200 people during clashes with masked protesters that erupted on a day of largely peaceful anti-corruption demonstrations, a spokeswoman said on Monday. At least 88 minors were among the initial count of 216 taken into custody on Sunday as police deployed water cannons and deafening sirens against crowds of mostly young, rock-throwing protesters. Manila City Mayor Isko Morena said a 12-year-old boy was the youngest detained. Thousands of Filipinos rallied in Manila on Sunday to vent their anger over a ballooning scandal involving bogus flood-control projects believed to have cost taxpayers billions of dollars. The scandal has seen numerous lawmakers implicated and the leaders of both houses of Congress step down from their positions during an investigation. But Sunday’s street battles, which saw multiple police vehicles set ablaze and the windows of a precinct headquarters shattered, threatened to overshadow demonstrations that had been filled with families, activists, clergy and politicians. “So far, none of them are saying the reasons behind their actions or if somebody paid them to do it,“ regional police spokesperson Major Hazel Asilo told AFP . “As soon as we know their affiliations, we can know if they were part of the protesters or if they were just causing trouble,” she added. According to a statement released on Monday by the Department of Health, about 50 people were brought to a single Manila hospital following the clashes. Another police spokesperson, Major Philipp Ines, said 93 officers had been injured on Sunday, while adding the number of arrested could yet rise as people were still being processed. Rage over the so-called ghost infrastructure projects has been mounting in the Southeast Asian country since President Ferdinand Marcos put them centre stage in a July state of the nation address that followed weeks of deadly flooding . The Department of Finance has estimated that the Philippine economy lost up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2bn) from 2023 to 2025 due to corruption in flood control projects. Greenpeace has suggested the number is actually closer to $18bn. The Philippines on Monday was expecting heavy flooding once more as Super Typhoon Ragasa bore down on the country’s northernmost provinces. The archipelago nation is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, putting millions of people in disaster-prone areas in a state of constant poverty.",
