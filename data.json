      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday denied approaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) in connection with the team’s boycott of the match against India on February 15. In a post on the social media platform X, the PCB issued a statement attributed to its spokesperson, Amir Mir. “I categorically reject the claim by Indian sports journalist Vikrant Gupta that the PCB approached the ICC,” Mir was quoted as saying. Gupta, earlier in the day, had posted on X that the PCB had “reached out to the ICC for dialogue”. He had alleged that after the ICC wrote back to the PCB regarding the legal ramifications it could face, the board approached the cricket world body for talks to resolve the issue. “As usual, sections of the Indian media are busy circulating fiction. A little patience and time will clearly show who actually went knocking and who didn’t,” PCB spokesperson Mir said. It is worth mentioning that earlier on Saturday, AFP had reported a source close to the developments as saying that the PCB had reached out to the ICC after a formal communication from the cricket world body. The ICC was seeking a resolution through dialogue and not confrontation, the source added, according to AFP . The government gave the cricket team the nod to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo. Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue. The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland. As a protest, Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture. Pakistan, who edged out Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate. India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said this week that his team would travel to Colombo for the clash. Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments. Earlier this week, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown . Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would consult the government.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser said on Saturday that the party would go ahead with its countrywide protest on Feb 8 (Sunday) — the second anniversary of the 2024 general polls — but would also observe a day of mourning in the wake of the suicide bombing in Islamabad a day earlier. Talking to Dawn , Qaiser termed rumours regarding the party cancelling or postponing the protest incorrect. “The fact is that we have decided that the day will be observed as a national day of mourning. At the same time, protests will also be held across the country against rigging during the general elections,” he said. Replying to a question, he said that February 8 was not limited to PTI founder Imran Khan or the PTI. “It is a day on which the whole nation was deprived of democracy and the right to choose its representatives. We will hold the protest and a complete shutter-down strike against the injustice with the masses,” he added. Qaiser said that the PTI and Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance would continue efforts to restore democracy in Pakistan and ensure the rule of law even after February 8. He added that as many as 10 committees were established at international, national and provincial levels to spread awareness among the masses and make the protest successful. “February 8 was a day of humiliation for the entire nation, as people were deprived of their basic right to elect representatives,” Qaiser emphasised. Meanwhile, PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal also said in a statement that the party would observe a day of mourning while staging protests. “It is unfortunate that Islamabad police and other law enforcement agencies were spending day and night to crack down against the PTI workers and trying to arrest them to make the protest unsuccessful,” he said. He said that this had resulted in “weak security arrangements” that resulted in the attack on the imambargah. “If police had focused on the security of the federal capital, the suicide attacker may not have entered the city,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday held the PTI responsible for the resurgence in terrorism in the country, while the party slammed the minister for choosing to do so with a “hateful rhyme”. The minister made the remarks while addressing a press conference alongside religious scholars in Lahore to show solidarity and unity after the suicide attack at an imambargah in Islamabad on Friday. Asked by a reporter whether the blast was a “failure of security agencies”, Tarar asserted, “No, not at all.” He went on to stress that Pakistan’s security institutions were hailed as examples internationally, recalling the recovery of abducted passengers “with minimal damages” during the deadly Jaffar Express attack . The minister also brought up the Pak-India conflict in May 2025, when “the enemy was brought to its knees, sought mediation and said ‘I’m sorry’”. He said that while a terrorist attack on the outskirts of Islamabad in the presence of the Safe City system and with “security agencies having entire apparatus” was “definitely tragic”, it was not a security failure. “I did not want to say something political but you must recall that Operation Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb were also carried out in this country. You must also recall that suicide bombings had stopped. You must also recall that Karachi’s peace was also restored,” Tarar said. He added: “Then, a government came — I had not come with the intention of speaking about politics [and] it does not suit me to do that, given the institution I am present in but you have touched the topic. “I only want to remind you that someone said ‘these are peaceful people and our brothers, we should have talks with them’ and they were settled in settled areas,” he said, indirectly referring to ex-premier Imran Khan’s plan to relocate thousands of fighters from the outlawed Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan (TTP) to the country. The minister continued, “That same thinking of Taliban Khan; we are paying for that same thinking.” He asserted that the state had acted against terrorists previously, expelling and killing them, and “ended terrorism”. “ Abb yeh jo dehshatgardi waapis ayi hai, iss kay peechay PTI hai (The PTI is behind this resurgence of terrorism),” Tarar quipped while smiling. The PTI, meanwhile, took strong exception to the minister’s remark. In a post on X, the PTI’s official account said: “A day after a horrific terror attack, the information minister chose to joke, recite a hateful rhyme, and smile at a press conference. “It’s yet another reminder of how little regard they have for the people of Pakistan.” The PTI also responded to the accusation in a post on another official account. “They are in the government for four years, but the way this joker is smiling while blaming the PTI proves what kind of crap people the government has been handed over to,” it said. Separately, the PTI’s Central Media Department issued a statement in which it said that Pakistan had witnessed an “unprecedented period of peace” during Imran’s tenure as premier. In the statement, the party described Tarar’s press conference as misleading, propaganda-laden, and driven by blatant falsehoods. The PTI stated that the nation was fully cognizant of the fact that the resurgence of terrorism was a direct result of the governance of the PML-N and its allied parties. It emphasised that those who were raising alarm over the resurgence of terrorism must look inward, as the responsibility lay squarely with the current ruling coalition.",

      "title_orig": "Mastermind of attack on Islamabad imambargah among 4 arrested in KP raids, says Mohsin Naqvi",
      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday that four facilitators of the suicide attack on an imambargah in Islamabad , including the “main mastermind”, had been arrested during raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He made the remarks while speaking to the media in Islamabad. In his media talk, the interior minister said that operations were underway throughout last night to trace those behind the attack. Making special mention of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the KP police for their joint efforts, he said, “All those people linked to this, and the mastermind, at around 3am, all of them were apprehended.” He lauded all “agencies”, saying that this incident was a “test case”. “After the blast, raids were carried out in Nowshera and Peshawar, in which four facilitators were caught. And their mastermind, who is an Afghan, was also caught,” he said. He said that an assistant sub-inspector of KP police was martyred during the raids, while others were injured. “But the main mastermind is linked to Daesh and is in our custody,” he said, referring to the banned so-called Islamic State. The minister further said that the planning and training for the attack was done by “Daesh Afghanistan” and carried out in the neighbouring country. “We have people who are telling us details about how he (the attacker) went there and how he was trained,” he said. He again lauded law enforcement agencies on the achievement. “We have been saying for a while that whether it be Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Afghan Taliban, Daesh or other kharji terrorist organisations — they are all working together. At this time, 21 terrorist bodies’ setups … name any terrorist body, it is operating from Afghanistan,” he said. The minister further said that he had two requests for the public. “We are in a state of war; be it in Balochistan, KP or elsewhere. The intelligence [from] the community matters the most. When people get to know about an unknown person living in their community, report it to the police — when this system is activated, [terror incidents] will decrease,” he said. “Secondly, I received a message last night from someone asking where the security agencies were and why this incident happened. I can tell you that if one blast happens, 99 others are being foiled,” he said. “I spoke with the agencies and told them that we should share this with the media. It may spread panic but I said that we should share with the media which incidents were foiled,” he said. The interior minister further said that the names of Daesh and Taliban were coming up but “someone was funding them” and giving them targets. “They would get $500 but now they’re getting $1,500. Someone’s increasing their budget,” he said. “I say again with clarity that all of their funding comes from India. India is giving them all the targets; they are planning each and every thing behind the scenes. These organisations are at the front, while India is at the back,” he said. He said that while the world may stay silent for now, it would agree with Pakistan’s stance in the future. Naqvi noted that “nothing happens for free” and that the attack cost money to orchestrate, adding that since May, terrorists’ budgets had increased by three times. “We know about this and it is our duty to take this case to all international platforms,” the interior minister said. He added that he would brief the deputy prime minister on this in the coming days, so that foreign missions could update other countries about India’s involvement. “They (India) are now doing it so openly because they know that they cannot beat us in a war,” Naqvi added. “If they have adopted this tactic, then let them. But we will stop this; even if they increase their budget tenfold, it will have no impact,” he asserted. Naqvi further stated that the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) — which was behind a spate of attacks in Balochistan last weekend — created “high-production value” content that was carried by Indian media. “The world has declared BLA a terrorist organisation, but nobody will go there (India) and ask why they are showing the BLA’s content,” Naqvi said. “They create content, carry out incidents and run it on their media. It is a complete system they’ve created,” he said. He added that Indian media was trying to portray the BLA as having captured swathes of land in Pakistan but stated that “not one inch [of land] is under their control”. Talking about the attacks in Balochistan, Naqvi said that no attacker was spared. “They (India) are upset about that. But going forward, we will have a briefing on Balochistan and you will get the details,” he said. “We will continue fighting this war, but the world needs to realise that this is becoming a regional threat,” he warned. “We are doing what we can for our country, but these terrorist bodies are collaborating and jointly operating,” Naqvi added. “The world needs to observe the damage and if this violence goes elsewhere in the world, then it is on other countries to decide on what to do,” he said. Responding to questions from reporters, Naqvi noted that Pakistan had given a befitting response to Indian aggression in May last year, saying, “I think we are responding to them well. They will get a diplomatic answer.” He stated that the attacker came from Afghanistan, with the operation taking place “after an important member of Daesh came here”. Asked about the rank of the Daesh operative, Naqvi said further information would be provided in due course. “We have caught multiple accounts on Twitter being used by terrorists and they are not being shut down,” Naqvi said in response to another question about the use of social media by terrorists. “The government has written to them … but they are not blocked here, so we have taken this up very seriously,” he said. He added, “If they do not do it, we may have to adopt another strategy.” Questioned about security arrangements in Islamabad, Naqvi said that he had a detailed meeting with the Islamabad police today. “We discussed entry points in detail; we have 93 entry points,” the minister replied. “The red zone has separate entry points, and then we discussed the M-tag. Within the coming days, the chief commissioner or Islamabad inspector general will brief you.” Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior also said on the social media platform X and said, “ Based on technical and human intelligence, coordinated raids were conducted in Peshawar and Nowshera districts of KP province, leading to the arrest of four facilitators, including the Afghan ISIS mastermind behind the attack.” “Evidence confirms that planning, training, and indoctrination were carried out in Afghanistan by ISIS. The nexus of terrorism under Afghan Taliban patronage remains a serious threat to regional peace,” it said. “During the conduct of these operations, an official of Law Enforcement Agencies embraced martyrdom and four sustained injuries. Our forces remain resolute; further intelligence-based operations are underway,” it said. Raids in KP Earlier in the day, security sources had also stated the same regarding the arrests of those involved. According to sources, a police officer was martyred, and three other security personnel were injured during the raids. Among those arrested is the alleged Afghan mastermind, affiliated with the banned Islamic State. The raids, based on technical and human intelligence, were conducted in connection with the ongoing investigation to arrest those involved in the Islamabad imambargah suicide bombing, according to the police sources. The raid in Nowshera was conducted in the Hakeemabad area of the district, according to police officials. An official of the Nowshera police said that during a late-night operation, following leads on possible facilitators of the Islamabad suicide bombing, an exchange of fire took place between law enforcement agencies and the suspected militants. “Yes, a raid was conducted in the district, and an exchange of fire took place. An assistant sub-inspector was martyred and a constable sustained injuries in the crossfire,” the police official confirmed. The official, who requested anonymity, added that the raid was conducted as part of an ongoing probe against those involved in the Islamabad suicide bombing and that “it was not Nowshera police alone that took part in the operation”. He, however, refused to share further details. Friday’s attack came less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast. Yesterday’s attack was the deadliest in the capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel.

Naqvi further stated that the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) — which was behind a spate of attacks in Balochistan last weekend — created “high-production value” content that was carried by Indian media. “The world has declared BLA a terrorist organisation, but nobody will go there (India) and ask why they are showing the BLA’s content,” Naqvi said. “They create content, carry out incidents and run it on their media. It is a complete system they’ve created,” he said. He added that Indian media was trying to portray the BLA as having captured swathes of land in Pakistan but stated that “not one inch [of land] is under their control”. Talking about the attacks in Balochistan, Naqvi said that no attacker was spared. “They (India) are upset about that. But going forward, we will have a briefing on Balochistan and you will get the details,” he said. “We will continue fighting this war, but the world needs to realise that this is becoming a regional threat,” he warned. “We are doing what we can for our country, but these terrorist bodies are collaborating and jointly operating,” Naqvi added. “The world needs to observe the damage and if this violence goes elsewhere in the world, then it is on other countries to decide on what to do,” he said. Responding to questions from reporters, Naqvi noted that Pakistan had given a befitting response to Indian aggression in May last year, saying, “I think we are responding to them well. They will get a diplomatic answer.” He stated that the attacker came from Afghanistan, with the operation taking place “after an important member of Daesh came here”. Asked about the rank of the Daesh operative, Naqvi said further information would be provided in due course. “We have caught multiple accounts on Twitter being used by terrorists and they are not being shut down,” Naqvi said in response to another question about the use of social media by terrorists. “The government has written to them … but they are not blocked here, so we have taken this up very seriously,” he said. He added, “If they do not do it, we may have to adopt another strategy.” Questioned about security arrangements in Islamabad, Naqvi said that he had a detailed meeting with the Islamabad police today. “We discussed entry points in detail; we have 93 entry points,” the minister replied. “The red zone has separate entry points, and then we discussed the M-tag. Within the coming days, the chief commissioner or Islamabad inspector general will brief you.” Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior also said on the social media platform X and said, “ Based on technical and human intelligence, coordinated raids were conducted in Peshawar and Nowshera districts of KP province, leading to the arrest of four facilitators, including the Afghan ISIS mastermind behind the attack.” “Evidence confirms that planning, training, and indoctrination were carried out in Afghanistan by ISIS. The nexus of terrorism under Afghan Taliban patronage remains a serious threat to regional peace,” it said. “During the conduct of these operations, an official of Law Enforcement Agencies embraced martyrdom and four sustained injuries. Our forces remain resolute; further intelligence-based operations are underway,” it said. Raids in KP Earlier in the day, security sources had also stated the same regarding the arrests of those involved. According to sources, a police officer was martyred, and three other security personnel were injured during the raids. Among those arrested is the alleged Afghan mastermind, affiliated with the banned Islamic State. The raids, based on technical and human intelligence, were conducted in connection with the ongoing investigation to arrest those involved in the Islamabad imambargah suicide bombing, according to the police sources. The raid in Nowshera was conducted in the Hakeemabad area of the district, according to police officials. An official of the Nowshera police said that during a late-night operation, following leads on possible facilitators of the Islamabad suicide bombing, an exchange of fire took place between law enforcement agencies and the suspected militants. “Yes, a raid was conducted in the district, and an exchange of fire took place. An assistant sub-inspector was martyred and a constable sustained injuries in the crossfire,” the police official confirmed. The official, who requested anonymity, added that the raid was conducted as part of an ongoing probe against those involved in the Islamabad suicide bombing and that “it was not Nowshera police alone that took part in the operation”. He, however, refused to share further details. Friday’s attack came less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast. Yesterday’s attack was the deadliest in the capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel.

      "title": "Mastermind of attack on Islamabad imambargah among 4 arrested in KP raids, says Mohsin Naqvi",
      "summary": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday that four facilitators of the suicide attack on an imambargah in Islamabad , including the “main mastermind”, had been arrested during raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He made the remarks while speaking to the media in Islamabad. In his media talk, the interior minister said that operations were underway throughout last night to trace those behind the attack. Making special mention of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the KP police for their joint efforts, he said, “All those people linked to this, and the mastermind, at around 3am, all of them were apprehended.” He lauded all “agencies”, saying that this incident was a “test case”. “After the blast, raids were carried out in Nowshera and Peshawar, in which four facilitators were caught. And their mastermind, who is an Afghan, was also caught,” he said. He said that an assistant sub-inspector of KP police was martyred during the raids, while others were injured. “But the main mastermind is linked to Daesh and is in our custody,” he said, referring to the banned so-called Islamic State. The minister further said that the planning and training for the attack was done by “Daesh Afghanistan” and carried out in the neighbouring country. “We have people who are telling us details about how he (the attacker) went there and how he was trained,” he said. He again lauded law enforcement agencies on the achievement. “We have been saying for a while that whether it be Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Afghan Taliban, Daesh or other kharji terrorist organisations — they are all working together. At this time, 21 terrorist bodies’ setups … name any terrorist body, it is operating from Afghanistan,” he said. The minister further said that he had two requests for the public. “We are in a state of war; be it in Balochistan, KP or elsewhere. The intelligence [from] the community matters the most. When people get to know about an unknown person living in their community, report it to the police — when this system is activated, [terror incidents] will decrease,” he said. “Secondly, I received a message last night from someone asking where the security agencies were and why this incident happened. I can tell you that if one blast happens, 99 others are being foiled,” he said. “I spoke with the agencies and told them that we should share this with the media. It may spread panic but I said that we should share with the media which incidents were foiled,” he said. The interior minister further said that the names of Daesh and Taliban were coming up but “someone was funding them” and giving them targets. “They would get $500 but now they’re getting $1,500. Someone’s increasing their budget,” he said. “I say again with clarity that all of their funding comes from India. India is giving them all the targets; they are planning each and every thing behind the scenes. These organisations are at the front, while India is at the back,” he said. He said that while the world may stay silent for now, it would agree with Pakistan’s stance in the future. Naqvi noted that “nothing happens for free” and that the attack cost money to orchestrate, adding that since May, terrorists’ budgets had increased by three times. “We know about this and it is our duty to take this case to all international platforms,” the interior minister said. He added that he would brief the deputy prime minister on this in the coming days, so that foreign missions could update other countries about India’s involvement. “They (India) are now doing it so openly because they know that they cannot beat us in a war,” Naqvi added. “If they have adopted this tactic, then let them. But we will stop this; even if they increase their budget tenfold, it will have no impact,” he asserted.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The death toll from the Islamabad imambargah attack rose to 36 on Saturday, according to hospital officials. The attack occurred at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area on the city’s outskirts during Friday prayers. Over 160 others were injured, with the death toll expected to rise. “A 21-year-old man who was brought from the imambargah has died,” Dr Aneeza Jalil, a spokesperson at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), confirmed to Dawn . “The number of deaths has reached 33, and nine patients are in very serious condition,” she added. She recalled that 149 injured and 28 bodies were brought to Pims on Friday following the attack. Separately, HBS Hospital’s Dr Riaz Janjua confirmed to Dawn that three deaths from the attack were reported at his hospital. Great progress in probe: info minister Information Minister Attaullah Tarar held a press conference in Lahore with various religious scholars, including Allama Muhammad Hussain Akbar. “There has been progress to a great extent regarding his (terrorist’s) facilitators, and I do not want to go into much detail but I assure you that the net around them has been tightened and they will be taken to justice,” Tarar said. “We have gotten clues about the facilitators and handlers, and the public will soon be informed about the details,” he further said. “It is clear about him (the terrorist) that he went to Afghanistan for training,” Tarar said, declaring that Pakistan will not allow attacks on it from Afghan soil. “These are the same people who have no faith or religion, who shed Muslims’ blood for a few pennies,” he added. At another point, the information minister said the bomber had been identified, based on which further investigation was under way. Asked whether the incident was an “intelligence failure”, the information minister reiterated that the terrorists’ ability to attack “hard targets” had been eliminated, so they attempted to reach “soft targets”. He added, “Security and law enforcement agencies are definitely on alert. But obviously, sometimes they get access and successfully carry out activities in far-flung areas. “But rest assured, all of the handlers and those involved in this have nearly been traced, and punishment will be meted out to them.” Asked whether the blast was a “failure of security agencies”, Tarar asserted , “No, not at all.” On the question of possible action against officials for any negligence, the information minister affirmed that the Islamabad police were performing their duties to the best, even in “tough situations”. The minister said he was paying a visit to the scholars to express solidarity over the terrorist incident. “Calling those responsible for it human is an insult to humanity,” he asserted, noting that terrorists have no religion or faith or community. “On behalf of the state of Pakistan and the prime minister, I assure them that the government is taking great steps for the protection of mosques, imambargahs and such centres,” Tarar said, vowing to further improve the measures. Recalling his conversation with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Tarar stressed, “While steps are being taken for security and more will be taken, the main aim is to root out these terrorists.” He stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had met with Naqvi on Friday and issued “necessary directives”. Highlighting that Muslims were targeted during Friday prayers at the imambargah, Tarar said, “We will pursue them where they cannot even think of […] under no circumstance will we let you see any peace.” He further said, “They are khawarij , and Pakistan’s good lies only in their eradication.” The information minister also underscored that the country was united in the fight against terrorism, pointing out the efforts of the National Paigham-i-Aman Committee (NPAC). “We have reached out with the message of peace. There is no space for sectarianism and hatred in this. We all are muslims,” Tarar said, noting that NPAC’s objective was to counter the terrorists’ narrative and ideology. He pointed out that the committee had religious scholars from various sects and also had representation from minorities, including the Christian, Hindu and Sikh communities. “Due to this grief and sadness, our aim to eradicate you (terrorists) has only increased,” the minister said, affirming that scholars from all sects stood united. In his remarks, Allama Akbar said he has requested that security at imambargahs and mosques be heightened and solidarity be shown with the victims. “Especially, action against those who make speeches through various media channels and newspapers, [and] those who are part of banned outfits and make inciteful speeches, is extremely necessary because they are also their (terrorists’) facilitators and backers,” he said. Emphasising the need for intensified security, he demanded that an impartial judicial probe be launched into the incident. The scholar said the Islamabad blast was “one branch of the conspiracies being carried out against Pakistan on the global level to destabilise the country”. “Our two western provinces in particular are on their target,” he pointed out. “Especially at this time, the alliances being formed between Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkiye and Pakistan are a source of joy and courage for us, but for the enemy, they are a message of death, which is also why the enemy is more active against us,” Allama Akbar said. ‘Nation stands united’ Meanwhile, NPAC coordinator Allama Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi spoke to the media after visiting the injured at Pims. “Clerics belonging to all the mainstream schools of thought in the country are here. This is not a political talk or a number game,” he said, adding that scholars from all sects were visibly emotional upon meeting the victims, reflecting the gravity of the tragedy. “The nation stands united and cannot be divided by acts of terrorism. The enemies of the country want to see us divided,” he said. “These are attempts being made to spread fear and panic among Pakistanis but the entire nation responded with unity and the citizens came forward to help one another,” he said. Ashrafi added that hostile forces were using neighbouring territory against Pakistan and questioned how long such actions would continue, stressing that Pakistan considered Afghanistan a brotherly country. After the media talk, the clerics and scholars visited an imambargah to express solidarity with the victims and the community. Victims laid to rest Tearful mourners gathered at locations across Islamabad to bury the victims of the suicide blast. A mass funeral for 13 victims was held in the federal capital, with a large crowd in attendance, including religious scholars from various sects. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Yousuf and NA Standing Committee for Interior Affairs Chairman Raja Khurram Shahzad Nawaz also attended the prayers. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded, said at one funeral. Syed Jamil Hussain Shah, a 45-year-old resident, said: “Whatever happened was completely wrong and against humanity.” Separately, in-absentia funeral prayers for 32 individuals were offered in Tarlai under strict security arrangements, with the bereaved relatives and civil society members present. Politicians, including Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and PPP’s Nadeem Afzal Chan, also attended the prayers. Funerals for another two victims were held at Imambargah Jamia Sadiq, and for three others at an imambargah in Islamabad’s G-9. Inspector Bahadur Ali, who hailed from Gilgit-Baltistan and was martyred in the attack, was also laid to rest with full honours at the Police Lines Headquarters in Islamabad on Friday night. Senior police officers, including Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, attended the funeral. The body was later dispatched to his native area with full state honours. Friday’s attack was the deadliest in the federal capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel. “The attacker was stopped at the gate and detonated himself,” a security source told AFP about the imambargah blast. Muhammad Kazim, 52, said an “extremely powerful” explosion ripped through the building as prayers were just starting. Another worshipper, Imran Mahmood, told AFP there was a gunfight between the bomber and volunteer security personnel at the mosque. Mourners carry the coffin of a victim of the Islamabad imambargah attack on February 7, 2026. — AFP “The suicide attacker was trying to move forward, but one of our injured volunteers fired at him from behind, hitting him in the thigh,” he told AFP . He then “detonated the explosives”, Mahmood added. Suicide bomber’s identity Sources close to the investigation told Dawn that the attacker — whose severed head was found at the crime scene — had been identified as a resident of Gunj, in the walled city of Peshawar. They said that forensic investigators tracked his identity through the Nadra database. Preliminary investigation suggested that he was linked to the militant Islamic State (IS) group and had travelled to Afghanistan multiple times. The Peshawar police were also being approached to interrogate the family and relatives of the suicide bomber and collect other relevant details. Investigators said that all angles were being probed in this regard, and geo-fencing of the area was being conducted to identify other suspects. Authorities were conducting forensic sweeps of the crime scene, while CCTV footage from nearby cameras had been obtained to track the attackers. When approached, a senior Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police official told Dawn that they were making a lot of progress in the investigation. Another source said that raids were being conducted , and that some of the suspected bomber’s relatives had been picked up in Nowshera. Additional input from Kalbe Ali, AFP",

Senior police officers, including Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, attended the funeral. The body was later dispatched to his native area with full state honours. Friday’s attack was the deadliest in the federal capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel. “The attacker was stopped at the gate and detonated himself,” a security source told AFP about the imambargah blast. Muhammad Kazim, 52, said an “extremely powerful” explosion ripped through the building as prayers were just starting. Another worshipper, Imran Mahmood, told AFP there was a gunfight between the bomber and volunteer security personnel at the mosque. Mourners carry the coffin of a victim of the Islamabad imambargah attack on February 7, 2026. — AFP “The suicide attacker was trying to move forward, but one of our injured volunteers fired at him from behind, hitting him in the thigh,” he told AFP . He then “detonated the explosives”, Mahmood added. Suicide bomber’s identity Sources close to the investigation told Dawn that the attacker — whose severed head was found at the crime scene — had been identified as a resident of Gunj, in the walled city of Peshawar. They said that forensic investigators tracked his identity through the Nadra database. Preliminary investigation suggested that he was linked to the militant Islamic State (IS) group and had travelled to Afghanistan multiple times. The Peshawar police were also being approached to interrogate the family and relatives of the suicide bomber and collect other relevant details. Investigators said that all angles were being probed in this regard, and geo-fencing of the area was being conducted to identify other suspects. Authorities were conducting forensic sweeps of the crime scene, while CCTV footage from nearby cameras had been obtained to track the attackers. When approached, a senior Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police official told Dawn that they were making a lot of progress in the investigation. Another source said that raids were being conducted , and that some of the suspected bomber’s relatives had been picked up in Nowshera. Additional input from Kalbe Ali, AFP",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump refused to apologise on Friday for a video posted on his social media account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as monkeys, though he said he condemned the post as the White House shifted the blame to staff. The video shared on Trump’s Truth Social account late on Thursday night sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting “fake outrage” only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member. “I didn’t make a mistake,” Trump said on Air Force One late on Friday when asked if he would apologise for the post. Asked if he condemns the racist imagery in the video, Trump replied: “Of course I do.” Democrats slammed Trump as “vile” over the clip of the Obamas — the first Black president and first lady in US history while a senior Republican senator said the video was blatantly racist. Near the end of the one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Republican Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second. The video, uploaded late on Thursday amid a flurry of other posts, repeated false allegations that ballot-counting company Dominion Voting Systems helped steal the election from Trump. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt initially played down the row, saying the images were “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King” . “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,” Leavitt said in a statement to AFP. About-face But almost exactly 12 hours after the post appeared on Trump’s account there was an unusual concession from an administration that normally refuses to admit the slightest mistake. “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down,” a White House official told AFP . Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday, Trump stood by the thrust of the video’s claims about election fraud, but said he had not seen the offensive clip. “I just looked at the first part … and I didn’t see the whole thing,” Trump said, adding that he “gave it” to staffers to post and they also didn’t watch the full video. There was no immediate comment from the Obamas. Former vice president Kamala Harris, who has long condemned Trump’s divisive racial rhetoric, called out the White House’s backpedalling in a post on X on Friday. “No one believes this cover up from the White House, especially since they originally defended this post,” she wrote. “We are all clear-eyed about who Donald Trump is and what he believes.” ‘Disgusting bigotry’ While Democrats pounced on the post, it was the outrage from some members of Trump’s own Republican Party that appeared to trigger the about-face. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican senator and once a contender for the 2024 presidential nomination, called the video “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.” Scott said he was “praying it was fake” and called for Trump to remove it. Roger Wicker, another Republican senator, said the post was “totally unacceptable. The president should take it down and apologise.” The top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, called Trump “vile, unhinged and malignant” and urged Republicans on X to “immediately denounce Donald Trump’s disgusting bigotry”. Trump launched his own political career by pushing the racist and false “birther” conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was lying about being born in the United States. Trump has long had a bitter rivalry with his Democratic predecessor, taking particular umbrage at his popularity and the fact that he won the Nobel Peace Prize. In his second term in the White House, Trump has used hyper-realistic but fabricated AI visuals on Truth Social and other platforms, often glorifying himself and rallying his conservative base around social issues. During negotiations to avoid a US government shutdown, Trump posted a video of Jeffries, who is Black, wearing a fake mustache and a sombrero. Jeffries called the image racist. One AI-generated video showed fighter jets dumping human waste on protesters — which was created by the same X user who made the video showing the Obamas as monkeys. Since returning to the White House, Trump has led a crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. US federal anti-discrimination programs were born of the 1960s civil rights movement, mainly led by Black Americans, for equality and justice after hundreds of years of slavery. Slavery was abolished in the United States in 1865, but other forms of institutional racism continued for decades.",

      "summary": "US President Donald Trump refused to apologise on Friday for a video posted on his social media account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as monkeys, though he said he condemned the post as the White House shifted the blame to staff. The video shared on Trump’s Truth Social account late on Thursday night sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting “fake outrage” only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member. “I didn’t make a mistake,” Trump said on Air Force One late on Friday when asked if he would apologise for the post. Asked if he condemns the racist imagery in the video, Trump replied: “Of course I do.” Democrats slammed Trump as “vile” over the clip of the Obamas — the first Black president and first lady in US history while a senior Republican senator said the video was blatantly racist. Near the end of the one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Republican Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second. The video, uploaded late on Thursday amid a flurry of other posts, repeated false allegations that ballot-counting company Dominion Voting Systems helped steal the election from Trump. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt initially played down the row, saying the images were “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King” . “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,” Leavitt said in a statement to AFP. About-face But almost exactly 12 hours after the post appeared on Trump’s account there was an unusual concession from an administration that normally refuses to admit the slightest mistake. “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down,” a White House official told AFP . Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday, Trump stood by the thrust of the video’s claims about election fraud, but said he had not seen the offensive clip. “I just looked at the first part … and I didn’t see the whole thing,” Trump said, adding that he “gave it” to staffers to post and they also didn’t watch the full video. There was no immediate comment from the Obamas. Former vice president Kamala Harris, who has long condemned Trump’s divisive racial rhetoric, called out the White House’s backpedalling in a post on X on Friday. “No one believes this cover up from the White House, especially since they originally defended this post,” she wrote. “We are all clear-eyed about who Donald Trump is and what he believes.” ‘Disgusting bigotry’ While Democrats pounced on the post, it was the outrage from some members of Trump’s own Republican Party that appeared to trigger the about-face. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican senator and once a contender for the 2024 presidential nomination, called the video “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.” Scott said he was “praying it was fake” and called for Trump to remove it. Roger Wicker, another Republican senator, said the post was “totally unacceptable. The president should take it down and apologise.” The top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, called Trump “vile, unhinged and malignant” and urged Republicans on X to “immediately denounce Donald Trump’s disgusting bigotry”. Trump launched his own political career by pushing the racist and false “birther” conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was lying about being born in the United States. Trump has long had a bitter rivalry with his Democratic predecessor, taking particular umbrage at his popularity and the fact that he won the Nobel Peace Prize. In his second term in the White House, Trump has used hyper-realistic but fabricated AI visuals on Truth Social and other platforms, often glorifying himself and rallying his conservative base around social issues. During negotiations to avoid a US government shutdown, Trump posted a video of Jeffries, who is Black, wearing a fake mustache and a sombrero. Jeffries called the image racist. One AI-generated video showed fighter jets dumping human waste on protesters — which was created by the same X user who made the video showing the Obamas as monkeys. Since returning to the White House, Trump has led a crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. US federal anti-discrimination programs were born of the 1960s civil rights movement, mainly led by Black Americans, for equality and justice after hundreds of years of slavery. Slavery was abolished in the United States in 1865, but other forms of institutional racism continued for decades.",

      "summary_orig": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Saturday he hoped talks with the United States would resume soon, while reiterating Tehran’s red lines and warning against any American attack. According to excerpts published on his official Telegram channel during an interview with the Al Jazeera network, Araghchi said that Iran’s missile programme was “never negotiable” in Friday’s talks in Oman. He warned that Tehran would target US bases in the region if the US attacked Iranian territory. However, Araghchi also said that despite the talks in Muscat being indirect, “an opportunity arose to shake hands with the American delegation”. He called the talks “a good start”, but added that building trust would take time. He said the talks would resume “soon”. US President Donald Trump on Friday called the talks “ very good ” and pledged another round of negotiations next week. Despite this, he signed an executive order effective from Saturday that called for the “imposition of tariffs” on countries still doing business with Iran. The United States also announced new sanctions against numerous shipping entities and vessels, aimed at curbing Iran’s oil exports. More than a quarter of Iran’s trade is with China, with $18 billion in imports and $14.5bn in exports in 2024, according to World Trade Organisation data. Araghchi told Al Jazeera that nuclear enrichment was Iran’s “inalienable right and must continue”. ‘Defence issue’ “We are ready to reach a reassuring agreement on enrichment,” he said. “The Iranian nuclear case will only be resolved through negotiations.” He also said Iran’s missile programme was “never negotiable” because it relates to a “defence issue”. Washington has sought to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its support for proxies in the region — issues which Israel has pushed to include in the talks, according to media reports. Tehran has repeatedly rejected expanding the scope of the negotiations beyond the nuclear issue. Friday’s unprecedented talks between the two arch enemies came amid a major US military buildup in the region in the wake of Iran’s crackdown on protests that began in late December, driven by economic grievances. Aragchi warned that Iran “will attack their (US) bases in the region” if Washington targets Iranian territory. The negotiations were the first since nuclear talks between Iran and the United States collapsed last year following Israel’s unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran, which triggered a 12-day war . During the war, US warplanes bombed Iranian nuclear sites. Araghchi told Al Jazeera that if attacked again, “we will attack their bases in the region”, referring to the United States. At Friday’s talks in Oman, the US delegation was led by Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and his influential son-in-law Jared Kushner. “In a very positive atmosphere, our arguments were exchanged and the views of the other side were shared with us,” Araghchi told Iranian state TV after the talks, adding that the two sides had “agreed to continue negotiations”. Speaking to the official IRNA news agency, Araghchi expressed hope that Washington would refrain from “threats and pressure” so that “the talks can continue”. On Saturday, Araghchi criticised what he labelled a “doctrine of domination” that allows Israel to expand its military arsenal while pressuring other states in the region to disarm. He was speaking at the Al Jazeera Forum conference in Qatar, but in his speech did not refer to Friday’s talks in Oman with the United States.",

Iran, for its part, said it expected to hold more negotiations with the United States, hailing a “positive atmosphere” during a day of talks in the Gulf sultanate. With an American naval group led by an aircraft carrier in Middle Eastern waters, US and Iranian delegations held talks in Muscat mediated by Oman without publicly meeting face-to-face. Shortly after the talks concluded, the US announced new sanctions against shipping entities and vessels, aimed at curbing Iran’s oil exports. But it was not clear if the move was linked to the talks. The talks were the first between the two foes since the United States joined Israel’s war with Iran in June with strikes on nuclear sites. “We likewise had very good talks on Iran,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One en route to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, adding, “we’re going to meet again early next week.” However, as Iran warned against further threats after Washington raised the spectre of new military action, Trump said: “If they don’t make a deal, the consequences are very steep.” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led Iran’s delegation in Muscat, said talks “focused exclusively” on the Iranian nuclear program, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb but Tehran insists is peaceful. The US delegation, led by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner, had also wanted Tehran’s backing for militant groups, its ballistic missile program and treatment of protesters on the agenda. “In a very positive atmosphere, our arguments were exchanged and the views of the other side were shared with us,” Araghchi told Iranian state TV, adding that the two sides had “agreed to continue negotiations.” Speaking to the official IRNA news agency, Araghchi expressed hope that Washington would refrain from “threats and pressure” so that “the talks can continue.” ‘Destabilising power’ Admiral Brad Cooper, the commander of US Central Command, was present at the talks, according to images published by the Oman News Agency. Multiple sessions of talks in the morning and afternoon saw both sides shuttling to and from the residence of Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi. The foreign ministry of US ally Qatar expressed hope the talks would “lead to a comprehensive agreement that serves the interests of both parties and enhances security and stability in the region.” The White House has made clear it wants the talks to rein in Tehran’s ability to make a nuclear bomb, an ambition the Islamic republic has always denied. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Friday that Iran should stop being a “destabilizing power,” citing its nuclear program and support for “terrorist” groups. Barrot also called on “groups supported by Iran” to exert “the utmost restraint” in the event of any military escalation involving the Islamic republic. ‘Maximum pressure’ Trump initially threatened military action against Tehran over its crackdown on protesters last month, which rights groups say killed thousands, and even told demonstrators “help is on its way.” Regional powers including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar urged the United States not to intervene, calling on Washington and Tehran to instead return to talks. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said Friday it has confirmed 6,505 protesters were killed, as well as 214 members of the security forces and 61 bystanders. Those numbers are expected to climb because the magnitude of the crackdown has masked by the blanket internet shutdown imposed by the authorities for a fortnight, rights groups say. Almost 51,000 people are also confirmed to have been arrested amid “the growing use of forced confessions,” according to HRANA. Yet Trump’s rhetoric in recent days has focused on reining in the Iranian nuclear program and the US has maneuvered a naval group led by aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln into the region. Iran has repeatedly vowed it will hit back at US bases in the region if attacked. The new sanctions to curb Iran’s oil exports come with Trump “committed to driving down the Iranian regime’s illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration’s maximum pressure campaign,” State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement.",

Yet Trump’s rhetoric in recent days has focused on reining in the Iranian nuclear program and the US has maneuvered a naval group led by aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln into the region. Iran has repeatedly vowed it will hit back at US bases in the region if attacked. The new sanctions to curb Iran’s oil exports come with Trump “committed to driving down the Iranian regime’s illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration’s maximum pressure campaign,” State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement.",

      "summary_orig": "Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Saturday said that a new committee was being formed to investigate the issue of missing persons in the country. Addressing the 6th Asma Jahangir Conference in Lahore, the law minister said that while the number of missing persons had reduced over the years, a lower number was still not satisfactory. He said that another committee was now being formed to look into the issue of missing persons in more detail. Speaking on past data on missing persons, Tarar said, “The recorded number … was nearly 10,000 citizens. A commission was formed on this, committees were made … parliament played a role; over the years, this number has reduced. It’s now reportedly 2600-something. But I understand that in terms of human rights, this number should be zero.” He added that in the past, as a stopgap arrangement, the federal government had introduced a relief package for the families affected. He clarified that “this package did not mean the case would be closed; that was to mitigate the miseries of the family”. According to the minister, the package contained not only financial support but a “mechanism to solve all the legal complications” of the disappearances, including allowing the victims’ bank accounts to be operated and sorting out issues of distribution of inheritance. “After working for about a year and a half, we gave this policy package, and now we are going to implement it. So, alongside it, we are making another committee that will look at these issues in more detail.” Tarar also said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif himself was “very concerned” over the issue. He added that in some cases, those who died in terrorist attacks and encounters were found to include individuals listed as missing persons. “We cannot rule out that those who voluntarily disappeared and joined banned groups are also part of that list,” he said. “Having said so, we are working with full seriousness on the issue, and we will keep updating you.” The law minister further shared “good news”, saying that the government’s ‘long-awaited desire’ to establish an independent commission for minorities had been legislated. “This process has started. It will come to parliament,” he said. The law minister added that cases of blasphemy via the use of social media platforms were “a point of concern for all of us”. “The government took it very seriously,” he said. “We worked on it: we made monitoring tighter.” He highlighted the sharp reduction in the number of blasphemy cases in 2025 compared to previous years, saying, “2025 has been a sigh of relief”. According to the minister, only 34 cases were reported over the last year, as compared to “180 and 200 cases a year” in previous years. He expressed his hope for further improvement in this regard.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Canada emphasised the importance of cooperation in trade and investment in the sixth round of Bilateral Political Consultations between the two countries held in Islamabad on Saturday. According to the Foreign Office (FO), United Nations Special Secretary Ambassador Nabeel Munir and the director general (Americas) participated in the consultations, while the Canadian side was represented by Assistant Deputy Minister (Indo-Pacific) from Global Affairs Canada, Ambassador Weldon Epp and High Commissioner Tarik Ali Khan. A press release by the FO said that the two sides expressed satisfaction over the steady growth of bilateral relations, marked by recent “substantive interactions ” between Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand. “They noted that these engagements had provided strategic guidance and momentum to the partnership and reaffirmed their shared commitment to further deepen these ties,” the FO statement said. Recognising the significant untapped potential in the relationship, both sides expressed their readiness to improve the implementation of existing agreements and identify new avenues for cooperation, the statement added. “In this regard, they emphasised the importance of strengthening trade and economic cooperation, including greater support to business communities, facilitation of the trade delegations and enhanced institutional linkages,” it said. The two sides also emphasised cooperation in “trade and investment, agriculture and agri-tech, mining and minerals, energy, climate change, artificial intelligence and information and communications technology, skilled workforce development, education and research, tourism and people-to-people exchanges” as key drivers for taking the relationship forward. They also underscored the central role of investment in achieving sustainable and mutually beneficial growth, and agreed to work towards encouraging the private sector to explore emerging opportunities, according to the FO. The countries exchanged views on the evolving global and regional environment and discussed key multilateral issues of mutual interest, agreeing to maintain regular consultations. They further expressed confidence that sustained engagement would lead to new progress in the bilateral partnership. In November, the two countries had issued a joint statement saying that they had agreed to facilitate the export of Canadian canola to Pakistan. Canada has been looking to open new markets for the commodity after China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada said it would levy a 100 per cent tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles.",

According to the Foreign Office (FO), United Nations Special Secretary Ambassador Nabeel Munir and the director general (Americas) participated in the consultations, while the Canadian side was represented by Assistant Deputy Minister (Indo-Pacific) from Global Affairs Canada, Ambassador Weldon Epp and High Commissioner Tarik Ali Khan. A press release by the FO said that the two sides expressed satisfaction over the steady growth of bilateral relations, marked by recent “substantive interactions ” between Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand. “They noted that these engagements had provided strategic guidance and momentum to the partnership and reaffirmed their shared commitment to further deepen these ties,” the FO statement said. Recognising the significant untapped potential in the relationship, both sides expressed their readiness to improve the implementation of existing agreements and identify new avenues for cooperation, the statement added. “In this regard, they emphasised the importance of strengthening trade and economic cooperation, including greater support to business communities, facilitation of the trade delegations and enhanced institutional linkages,” it said. The two sides also emphasised cooperation in “trade and investment, agriculture and agri-tech, mining and minerals, energy, climate change, artificial intelligence and information and communications technology, skilled workforce development, education and research, tourism and people-to-people exchanges” as key drivers for taking the relationship forward. They also underscored the central role of investment in achieving sustainable and mutually beneficial growth, and agreed to work towards encouraging the private sector to explore emerging opportunities, according to the FO. The countries exchanged views on the evolving global and regional environment and discussed key multilateral issues of mutual interest, agreeing to maintain regular consultations. They further expressed confidence that sustained engagement would lead to new progress in the bilateral partnership. In November, the two countries had issued a joint statement saying that they had agreed to facilitate the export of Canadian canola to Pakistan. Canada has been looking to open new markets for the commodity after China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada said it would levy a 100 per cent tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles.",

      "summary_orig": "The World Health Organization said on Friday that a woman had died in northern Bangladesh in January after contracting the deadly Nipah virus infection. The case in Bangladesh, where Nipah cases are reported almost every year, follows two Nipah virus cases identified in neighbouring India, which has already prompted stepped-up airport screenings across Asia. The patient in Bangladesh, aged between 40 and 50 years, developed symptoms consistent with Nipah virus on January 21, including fever and headache followed by hypersalivation, disorientation and convulsion, the WHO added. She died a week later and was confirmed to be infected with the virus a day later. The person had no travel history but had a history of consuming raw date palm sap. All 35 people who had contact with the patient are being monitored and have tested negative for the virus, and no further cases have been detected to date, the WHO said. Nipah is an infection that spreads mainly through products contaminated by infected bats, such as fruit. It can be fatal in up to 75 per cent of cases, but it does not spread easily between people. Countries including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Pakistan implemented temperature screenings at airports after India said cases of the virus had been found in West Bengal. The WHO said on Friday that the risk of international disease spread is considered low and that it does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions based on current information. In 2025, four laboratory-confirmed fatal cases were reported in Bangladesh. There are currently no licensed medicines or vaccines specific for the infection.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Friday’s suicide blast at the Tarlai Imambargah is the second major terrorist attack in the federal capital in less than three months despite heightened security measures adopted by the police and the capital administration. On November 11 last year, a lone suicide bomber blew himself up in front of the main entrance of the Judicial Complex in G-11 after a couple of unsuccessful attempts to enter the premises, killing a dozen people and injuring at least 36 others. Soon after the incident, a number of police pickets were established on different roads of the capital. In addition, the Islamabad Traffic Police narrowed some of the busy roads in the capital during rush hours by placing barricades on a daily basis to monitor suspicious activities, causing much difficulties for the commuters. After the Tarlai Imambargah attack on Friday, some of the grief-stricken people, who had reached Pims hospital to trace their missing relatives, expressed their anger over the alleged failure of the police and the law enforcement agencies in preventing the devastating attack. However, a senior police officer, when contacted, said the suicide attack had taken place in a rural area located on the outskirts of the capital city whereas the security measures had been put in place in the urban areas and various sectors of Islamabad. He said the focus of the police was mainly on the government buildings and other sensitive installations, adding the police were also constantly monitoring the movements of the suspicious people within the capital city through the Safe City cameras besides keeping record of visitors staying in hotels and guest houses. The official said only “human intelligence” was possible to monitor such activities in rural areas which generally served as “safe heavens” for the terrorists. It may be recalled that talking to the media outside the Judicial Complex after the November 11 attack, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had declared that he had directed that no vehicle be allowed into Islamabad without an e-tag after two weeks. Later, Minister of State for Interior Senator Talal Chaudhry, while addressing a press conference outside Parliament House alongside Inspector General of Police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi on November 13, had said it would be declared mandatory for all vehicles in the city to have e-tags. Authorities installed e-tag readers and cameras at 11 to 14 different points in the capital. These e-tag readers and cameras were installed under the supervision of the Safe City Authority in Islamabad to read vehicle tags. The tags and cameras were linked with the Safe City system and were installed on newly erected poles at these points to scan e-tags and vehicle registration plates. Officials further said that approximately 400,000 to 500,000 vehicles move on the roads of the capital daily, with a large number entering the city from neighbouring areas, including Rawalpindi. So far, e-tags have been installed on 203,915 vehicles up to February 5, the capital administration said, adding that around 19 points are still operational for installing e-tags on vehicles.

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: The Friday’s suicide blast at the Tarlai Imambargah is the second major terrorist attack in the federal capital in less than three months despite heightened security measures adopted by the police and the capital administration. On November 11 last year, a lone suicide bomber blew himself up in front of the main entrance of the Judicial Complex in G-11 after a couple of unsuccessful attempts to enter the premises, killing a dozen people and injuring at least 36 others. Soon after the incident, a number of police pickets were established on different roads of the capital. In addition, the Islamabad Traffic Police narrowed some of the busy roads in the capital during rush hours by placing barricades on a daily basis to monitor suspicious activities, causing much difficulties for the commuters. After the Tarlai Imambargah attack on Friday, some of the grief-stricken people, who had reached Pims hospital to trace their missing relatives, expressed their anger over the alleged failure of the police and the law enforcement agencies in preventing the devastating attack. However, a senior police officer, when contacted, said the suicide attack had taken place in a rural area located on the outskirts of the capital city whereas the security measures had been put in place in the urban areas and various sectors of Islamabad. He said the focus of the police was mainly on the government buildings and other sensitive installations, adding the police were also constantly monitoring the movements of the suspicious people within the capital city through the Safe City cameras besides keeping record of visitors staying in hotels and guest houses. The official said only “human intelligence” was possible to monitor such activities in rural areas which generally served as “safe heavens” for the terrorists.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Harrowing scenes were witnessed at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), where the dead and injured from the Imambargah Khadijatul Kubra terror attack were brought in amid rainfall after Friday prayers. An inconsolable scene was witnessed at the hospital, as family members, including women and children, of the injured and deceased, started arriving. They were wailing and loudly praying. Some women even expressed helplessness while crying, saying their main breadwinners had been hit in the terror attack. The grieving families, friends and emergency responders struggled to manage the chaotic situation, while the rescue teams rushed the wounded into the emergency wards. Ambulances arrived in rapid succession from the blast site in Tarlai situated in the outskirts of the federal capital with rescue workers rushing the wounded into emergency and doctors and paramedics providing immediate medical care. Hospital administration hands over 28 bodies to relatives; 105 injured under treatment Officials at the hospital said an emergency had been declared to ensure the availability of doctors, nurses and essential medical supplies. Additional staffers were called in to assist with treatment and help identify the deceased. Several victims were shifted to operation theatres, while others were treated in the hospital’s emergency wards. The Pims administration handed over 28 bodies to the families from the OPD by late evening and 105 injured were under treatment. Outside the emergency ward, anxious relatives gathered in a large number, seeking information about their loved ones, in tears and later gathered at the parking lot, chanting slogans against terrorism. An injured person is being offloaded from an ambulance at Pims in Islamabad on Friday. — White Star Meanwhile, waiting among the grieved people were two clerics, who were reciting religious sermons and narrating the Karbala incident. The clerics, requesting not to be named, told Dawn that the most important role of community leaders, including religious leaders, was to prevent formation of mobs. “People get upset, disappointed and vent their anger on anything they see. We do not want any mob start damaging property or misbehave with hospital staff,” the clerics added. Police and district administration officials were also present at the hospital to coordinate with medical teams and maintain order as the situation remained tense late into the night. Many of the deceased and injured were originally from the Hazara community of Quetta and had relocated here, along with people from Hangu and Parachinar, escaping repeated terrorism in those areas. Some people from Gilgit-Baltistan also settled in Tarlai as it is a cheaper locality. It was announced that the collective funeral prayers of the deceased will be held at the same place (Imambargah Khadijatul Kubra) at 11am on Saturday (today). Incidentally, the Pims area witnessed very weak mobile network signals and slow data. However, all four telecom companies - Ufone, Jazz, Zong and Telenor - responding to a query said they had not lowered the signals for the area. They explained that the poor network quality could be due to a capacity issue, probably because of the large number of people in the area at the same time. Published in Dawn, February 7th, 2026",
