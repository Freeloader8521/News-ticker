      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump’s so-called “Board of Peace” for post-war Gaza began to take shape on Saturday, with the leaders of Egypt, Turkiye, Argentina and Canada asked to join. The announcements from those leaders came after the US president named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, and senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to the panel. Trump had already declared himself the chair of the body, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in the Palestinian territory, which lies in rubble after two-plus years of relentless Israeli bombardment. The moves came after a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo which was attended by Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who has partnered with Witkoff for months on the issue. In Canada, a senior aide to Prime Minister Mark Carney said he intended to accept Trump’s invitation, while in Turkiye, a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had been asked to become a “founding member” of the board. Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said Cairo was “studying” a request for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to join. Sharing an image of the invitation letter, Argentine President Javier Milei wrote on X that it would be “an honor” to participate in the initiative. Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the heads of state of around 60 countries had recieved the charter of Trump’s proposed ‘Board of Peace’. The document was sent to 60 heads of state — including in Turkiye, Egypt, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia — along with an invitation to join the board, the publication reported while quoting diplomatic sources. According to the document, the board will work to “restore dependable and lawful governance and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” in place of other organisations, the report said. “The charter also implicitly criticises the UN. It opens with emphasising the need for ‘a more nimble and effective international peace-building body’, adding that durable peace requires ‘the courage to depart from … institutions that have too often failed’,” the report added. Meanwhile, in a statement sent to AFP , Blair said: “I thank President Trump for his leadership in establishing the Board of Peace and am honored to be appointed to its Executive Board.” Blair is a controversial figure in the Middle East because of his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Trump himself said last year that he wanted to make sure Blair was an “acceptable choice to everybody”. Blair spent years focused on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as representative of the “Middle East Quartet” — the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia — after leaving Downing Street in 2007. The White House said the Board of Peace will take on issues such as “governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding and capital mobilisation”. The other members of the board so far are World Bank President Ajay Banga, an Indian-born American businessman; billionaire US financier Marc Rowan; and Robert Gabriel, a loyal Trump aide who serves on the US National Security Council. Trump has created a second “Gaza executive board” that appears designed to have a more advisory role. It was not immediately clear which world leaders were asked to be on each board. The White House, which said on Friday that additional members would be named to both entities, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Israel strikes Washington has said the Gaza plan had gone on to a second phase — from implementing the ceasefire to disarming Hamas. On Friday, Trump named US Major General Jasper Jeffers to head the International Stabilisation Force, which will be tasked with providing security in Gaza and training a new police force to succeed Hamas. Jeffers, from special operations in US Central Command, in late 2024 was put in charge of monitoring a ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel, which has continued periodic strikes aimed at Hezbollah militants. Gaza native and former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath was earlier tapped to head the governing committee. Trump, a real estate developer, has previously mused about turning devastated Gaza into a Riviera-style area of resorts, although he has backed away from calls to forcibly displace the population.",

      "summary_orig": "The Ministry of Maritime Affairs on Saturday constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the cause of a fire at the Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT) a day earlier. Imported goods, mostly lithium batteries, stored in at least 20 containers were destroyed as a huge fire erupted at the KICT at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) on Friday afternoon, according to officials. A press release issued on Saturday said that Maritime Affairs Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry had constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the cause of the fire and to “fix responsibility to prevent similar incidents in the future”. The committee will comprise senior officers from KPT, who will coordinate with KICT operators to determine the reasons for the incident, it said. “KICT is a private terminal and the primary responsibility for safety measures at the container terminal rests with its administration,” the minister was quoted as saying. The press release further said the minister took immediate notice of the incident and directed all concerned officials, including KPT Chairman Rear Admiral (retd) Shahid Ahmed, to utilise all available resources to bring the blaze under control and also sought a detailed report on the incident. The statement said the KPT team supervised the firefighting operation and brought the fire under control, adding that no loss of life was reported. It added that the minister also announced appreciation certificates for members of the KPT team involved in the firefighting operation, and particularly lauded the role of KPT General Manager (Engineering) Rear Admiral Kashif Munir and his team. He added that the extent of financial losses and the exact cause of the fire were yet to be determined, and that investigations were ongoing, the statement said. The statement also said that a report by KPT was submitted on the directives of the minister. According to the report, the fire erupted at around 1:35pm near Berth Number 27 at KICT Terminal, Karachi Port. The incident was reported to KPT Central Fire Brigade and fire tenders were dispatched to the scene, the statement said. “Upon arrival, it was observed that the fire/smoke was spreading quickly in the closely placed set of containers which were also placed on one another [ sic ],” it said. It said that KPT fire tenders responded effectively in containing the fire, while support was also requested from the Pakistan Navy, the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works and Rescue 1122. “The report stated a total of eight fire tenders from KPT were deployed on-site, supported by four fire tenders from the Pakistan Navy, one from Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works and two fire tenders from Rescue 1122,” it added. “Through swift action, effective coordination, and professional handling by all responding teams, the fire was successfully brought under control, preventing its spread and ensuring the safety of port infrastructure and operations,” the press release said. South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn on Friday that during the initial probe, it emerged that the fire erupted due to a short circuit inside a container.",

      "summary_orig": "Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Saturday said that statements against Pakistan, the judiciary or the armed forces would not be allowed on the floor of the National Assembly. According to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat, the speaker made the remarks while visiting the National College of Arts (NCA) in Lahore. “Negative or controversial remarks on the role of the judiciary, the armed forces of Pakistan and judges are unacceptable,” he said. He further stated that any kind of remarks against the armed forces was “intolerable”. He further stated that only those remarks that fell within the ambit of the law and the Constitution would be allowed. “Those who speak against Pakistan will not be allowed to express their views on the floor of the National Assembly,” he was quoted as saying. Sadiq further asserted that as the NA speaker, he would continue to play an impartial role. He further said that in a democratic society, protesting was a citizen’s right. However, this protest should be peaceful and remain within the ambit of the law and the Constitution, he said. “There is no room for arson, damage to life and property or vandalism,” Sadiq was quoted as saying, adding that the “use of sticks and weapons” was a threat to the rule of law. The development comes a little over a month after Senate Deputy Chairman Syedal Khan Nasar barred criticism of “national heroes” and political leadership in the House. “You cannot speak against political heroes who suffered martyrdom, went into exile, worked for the nation and the country, conducted nuclear tests, and made [the] nuclear bomb,” he had remarked just after finishing the day’s agenda amid voices of dissent from the opposition benches. He had later vowed to enforce his ruling. In an informal conversation with media persons at the Parliament House, he had made it clear that derogatory or disrespectful remarks against national heroes whether from the armed forces, politics, judiciary, or any national institution cannot be tolerated within the House. “Every member has the right to express views, but that right must be exercised within the constitutional framework, rules of procedure, and established parliamentary traditions,” he had emphasised.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A district and sessions court on Saturday reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, for their repeated absences from trial proceedings. In the case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. Court proceedings on Saturday were conducted over three sittings — 9am, noon and 2pm. At each stage, Imaan and Hadi were absent from the proceedings. In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka — presiding over the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Court (Islamabad-West) — noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA). During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest. At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad High Court. The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused. Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants. The court ordered that once Imaan and Hadi were arrested, they could be produced via video link to join proceedings on Monday. On Thursday, the same court had cancelled Imaan and Hadi’s bail following repeated absences and heated scenes in the courtroom. The court had expressed displeasure over the conduct of the accused and the defence, revoked their right to cross-examination, and ordered that their statements under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) be recorded. The prosecution, led by Special Public Prosecutor Rana Usman, had opposed adjournments, while the courtroom proceedings had been disrupted by a heated exchange between the prosecutor and Islamabad District Bar Association President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar, prompting the judge to briefly rise from the bench. The case will now be taken up on Monday, subject to the execution of the arrest warrants. The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday accused US President Donald Trump of being responsible for “casualties” during a protest wave in the country that rights groups said was met with a deadly crackdown. “We hold the American president guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation,” he told a crowd of supporters during an address marking a religious holiday. “This was an American conspiracy,” Khamenei said, adding that “America’s goal is to swallow Iran … the goal is to put Iran back under military, political and economic domination”. “By God’s grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition,” he said. “We do not intend to lead the country to war, but we will not spare domestic criminals,” he added, saying that “international criminals” were “worse” and would also not be spared punishment. Iranian authorities have blamed the United States for fuelling a “terrorist operation” that they say hijacked peaceful protests over the economy. Iran was rocked by weeks of demonstrations sparked by anger over economic hardship that exploded into the biggest protests against the Islamic republic in more than three years. Meanwhile, after repeated warnings, Trump on Thursday had changed his stance on military intervention in Iran, adopting a “watch it and see” posture instead. He had cited assurances from “very important sources on the other side” indicating that Tehran had ceased using lethal force against demonstrators. “They’ve said the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place,” Trump said. Asked by a reporter if US military action was now off the table, the president replied: “We’re going to watch it and see what the process is.”",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Saturday condemned the reported profiling of mosques and mosque management committees in India-occupied Kashmir, saying the “blatant intrusion into religious affairs constitutes a grave violation of the fundamental right to freedom of religion and belief”. The FO’s statement comes after police in the occupied valley distributed forms to “collect” financial and personal details of mosques and seminaries, including mosque leaders and members of management committees, according to a report by the Hindustan Times , which quoted local residents and Kashmiri leaders. The action “reflects yet another coercive attempt to intimidate and marginalise the Muslim population of the occupied territory,” the FO said. The forms included sections for seminary teachers and mosque leaders to provide details of their “Aadhaar cards, bank accounts, property ownership, social media handles, passport, ration card, driving licence, SIM cards and mobile phone model along with the IMEI”, the Hindustan Times reported. It added that details regarding the “religious sect” of the mosques were also sought. A lawmaker from Srinagar called it “an infringement of the religious freedom guaranteed under the Indian Constitution,” saying the move aimed to “control religion and mosques”, the report said. In the statement released on Saturday, the FO said, “The forcible collection of personal details, photographs and sectarian affiliations of religious functionaries amounts to systematic harassment, aimed at instilling fear among worshippers and obstructing the free exercise of their faith. “These actions form part of a broader pattern of institutionalised Islamophobia driven by the Hindutva ideology of the occupying Indian government,” said the statement, adding the “selective targeting of mosques and Muslim clergy lays bare the discriminatory and communal character of these policies”. The FO maintained that the “people of Jammu and Kashmir possess an inalienable right to practice their religion without fear, coercion or discrimination”. “Pakistan will continue to stand in solidarity with them and will persist in raising its voice against all forms of religious persecution and intolerance targeting Kashmiris,” said the statement. In November, United Nations experts sounded the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the Indian government, issuing the warning in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.",

      "summary_orig": "Thousands of people took to the streets of Denmark’s capital on Saturday to protest at US President Donald Trump’s push to take over Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. The protest followed Trump’s warning on Friday that he “may put a tariff” on countries that oppose his plans to take over mineral-rich Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. They also coincided with a visit to Copenhagen by a bipartisan delegation from the US Congress that has made clear the opposition of many Americans to the Trump administration’s sabre-rattling. Waving the flags of Denmark and Greenland, the protesters formed a sea of red and white outside Copenhagen city hall, chanting “Kalaallit Nunaat!” — the vast Arctic island’s name in Greenlandic. Protesters wave Greenlandic flags as they take part in a rally under the slogans ‘Hands off Greenland’ and ‘Greenland for Greenlanders’, in front of the City Hall in Copenhagen, Denmark on January 17. — AFP Thousands of people had said on social media they would take part in marches and rallies organised by Greenlandic associations in Copenhagen, and in Aarhus, Aalborg, Odense and the Greenlandic capital Nuuk. “The aim is to send a clear and unified message of respect for Greenland’s democracy and fundamental human rights,” Uagut, an association of Greenlanders in Denmark, said on its website. A sister demonstration was scheduled to happen in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, at 3pm GMT (8pm PKT) to protest the US’s “illegal plans to take control of Greenland”, organisers said. Demonstrators would march to the US consulate carrying Greenlandic flags. The Copenhagen rally, which began at 12pm (4pm PKT), was due to make a stop outside the US embassy in the Danish capital. Protesters march during a rally under the slogans ‘Hands off Greenland’ and ‘Greenland for Greenlanders’ while heading to the US Embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark on January 17. — AFP ‘Demand respect’ “Recent events have put Greenland and Greenlanders in both Greenland and Denmark under pressure,” Uagut chairwoman Julie Rademacher said in a statement to AFP , calling for “unity”. “When tensions rise and people go into a state of alarm, we risk creating more problems than solutions for ourselves and for each other. We appeal to Greenlanders in both Greenland and Denmark to stand together,” she said. The demonstration in Greenland was “to show that we are taking action, that we stand together and that we support our politicians, diplomats and partners,” Kristian Johansen, one of the organisers, said in a statement. Copenhagen Mayor Sisse Marie Welling speaks during the ‘Hands Off Greenland’ protest, held under the slogans ‘Hands Off Greenland’ and ‘Greenland for Greenlanders’, in Copenhagen, Denmark on January 17. — Reuters “We demand respect for our country’s right to self-determination and for us as a people,” added Avijaja Rosing-Olsen, another organiser. “We demand respect for international law and international legal principles. This is not only our struggle, [but] it is a struggle that concerns the entire world.” According to the latest poll published in January 2025, 85 per cent of Greenlanders oppose the territory joining the United States. Only six per cent were in favour. ‘No security threat’ Speaking in Copenhagen, where the Congressional delegation met top Danish and Greenlandic politicians and business leaders, US Democratic Senator Chris Coons insisted there was no security threat to Greenland to justify the Trump administration’s stance. He was responding after Trump advisor Stephen Miller claimed on Fox News that Denmark was too small to defend its sovereign Arctic territory. “There are no pressing security threats to Greenland, but we share real concern about Arctic security going forward, as the climate changes, as the sea ice retreats, as shipping routes change,” Coons told the press. People take part in the ‘Hands Off Greenland’ protest, held under the slogans ‘Hands Off Greenland’ and ‘Greenland for Greenlanders’ in Copenhagen, Denmark on January 17. — Reuters “There are legitimate reasons for us to explore ways to invest better in Arctic security broadly, both in the American Arctic and in our Nato partners and allies,” said Coons, who is leading the US delegation. Trump has repeatedly criticised Denmark — a Nato ally — for, in his view, not doing enough to ensure Greenland’s security. The US president has pursued that argument, despite strategically located Greenland — as part of Denmark — being covered by Nato’s security umbrella. People take part in the ‘Hands Off Greenland’ protest, held under the slogans ‘Hands Off Greenland’ and ‘Greenland for Greenlanders’ in Copenhagen, Denmark on January 17. — Reuters European Nato members are deploying troops in Greenland for a military exercise designed to show the world, including the United States, that they will “defend (their) sovereignty”, French armed forces minister Alice Rufo said this week. Britain, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have announced they are sending small numbers of military personnel to prepare for future exercises in the Arctic. The US has been invited to participate in the exercise, Denmark said on Friday.

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Police on Saturday submitted a report in the Lahore High Court (LHC) detailing the security plan for the upcoming three-day Basant festival. Basant will be celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, following the passage of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025, that ended a suspension of the festival after almost two decades. The report identified areas of concern for the 2026 festival, based on data from the last decade, and urged full implementation of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025. It stated that registration of every kite and spool of string is mandatory through a QR code and there would be zero tolerance for glass, chemical-coated, or metallic wire. According to the report, Lahore has been divided into red, yellow, and green zones, while officials will continuously monitor kite-flying activities through drones, social media, and control rooms. It also warned that strict action will be taken against aerial firing, drinking, and illegal activities on rooftops. The report stated that it would be mandatory for motorcycle riders to wear a helmet and prohibited their entry into red zones without a safety antenna installed. On January 6, the LHC sought reports from the Inspector General of Police and the Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) regarding security and safety arrangements being taken for the festival. Justice Malik Awais Khalid heard a petition filed by Judicial Activism Panel (JAP) through Advocate Azhar Siddique questioning the alleged failure of the government and the police to make security arrangements for Basant under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.",

      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar expressed his hope for peace and stability in Iran on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said. According to a post by the FO on X, Dar spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in a phone call in which the two diplomats discussed the current situation in Iran and the wider region. Dar “expressed hope for peace and stability, and both sides agreed to continue bilateral consultations on matters of mutual interest”, the statement added. On Thursday, Pakistan had expressed hope at the United Nations Security Council for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, which saw its largest demonstrations in years, challenging the country’s government. Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds. Protests have taken place across Iran in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions. US President Donald Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters. However, monitors reported that the protests have subsided after a crackdown by security forces, while Trump declared that he had decided not to attack the country. Meanwhile, the same day, FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that instability in neighbouring Iran did not suit Pakistan, underscoring that calm and stability in Iran were directly linked to Pakistan’s own interests. He also said that Pakistan was engaging with Washington on the issue of tariffs being imposed on countries conducting trade with Iran. Earlier this week, Iran’s envoy to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, met the chairman of the National Rahmatul-lil-Alameen Authority Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem, where he expressed gratitude to Pakistan for its support. He said it had been given “wholeheartedly”, stressing that the country needed moral and political support, rather than material assistance.",

Dar “expressed hope for peace and stability, and both sides agreed to continue bilateral consultations on matters of mutual interest”, the statement added. On Thursday, Pakistan had expressed hope at the United Nations Security Council for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, which saw its largest demonstrations in years, challenging the country’s government. Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds. Protests have taken place across Iran in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions. US President Donald Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters. However, monitors reported that the protests have subsided after a crackdown by security forces, while Trump declared that he had decided not to attack the country. Meanwhile, the same day, FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that instability in neighbouring Iran did not suit Pakistan, underscoring that calm and stability in Iran were directly linked to Pakistan’s own interests. He also said that Pakistan was engaging with Washington on the issue of tariffs being imposed on countries conducting trade with Iran. Earlier this week, Iran’s envoy to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, met the chairman of the National Rahmatul-lil-Alameen Authority Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem, where he expressed gratitude to Pakistan for its support. He said it had been given “wholeheartedly”, stressing that the country needed moral and political support, rather than material assistance.",

According to a statement issued by the US Central Command (Centcom), American and Pakistani troops this week concluded joint training at Pakistan’s National Counter-Terrorism Center in Pabbi. “This week, US and Pakistan Army Soldiers completed training at Pakistan’s National Counter-Terrorism Center during Exercise Inspired Gambit, which focused on combined infantry skills and tactics, and counterterrorism operations. Training exercises like this between the US and Pakistan strengthen our long-standing defense ties,” the statement said. The exercise comes amid broader signs of re-engagement between the two defence establishments. In December, the United States approved the sale of advanced technology and upgrade packages for Pakistan’s F-16 fighter aircraft, a deal valued at approximately $686 million. The approval followed regional tensions after Pakistan and India fought a brief but intense five-day conflict in May 2025. Pakistan is believed to operate 70 to 80 F-16s, including upgraded Block-15 aircraft, former Jordanian jets, and newer Block-52+ models. US officials have long described the F-16 programme as a cornerstone of bilateral military cooperation. Political signaling from Washington has also drawn attention. President Trump has repeatedly praised Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, referring to him publicly as his “ favourite field marshal ”. In a year-end news briefing on December 31, Trump said that Pakistani leaders had credited him with preventing a wider catastrophe following the India-Pakistan conflict. “The head of Pakistan and a highly respected general — he is a field marshal — and also the prime minister of Pakistan said that President Trump saved 10 million lives, maybe more,” Trump said. During the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit on the Middle East in October 2025. Trump also acknowledged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was standing behind him, before again referring to Munir. These remarks marked at least the tenth instance since June that Trump, who returned to the White House in January for a second term, publicly praised Pakistan’s army chief. In June 2025, Trump hosted Field Marshal Munir at the White House for a lunch meeting — the first time a sitting US president formally received the head of Pakistan’s army. The meeting took place amid worsening disagreement with India over Trump’s repeated claim that he personally halted the May conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Analysts say Washington’s renewed focus on the Middle East, particularly Gaza and Iran, combined with the performance of Pakistan’s air force during the May conflict with India, encouraged the United States to improve its ties with Pakistan’s defence establishment. Pakistan has also signalled its willingness to participate in a US-led international stabilisation force for Gaza, a controversial proposal advanced by Trump, further underlining Islamabad’s interest in closer security cooperation. Pakistan was once a key US ally and was designated a major non-NATO ally following the September 11, 2001, attacks. Relations frayed in subsequent years, as US officials accused Islamabad of duplicity during the US-led war on terror. But early in his second term, Trump struck a markedly different tone. Addressing a joint session of Congress in March, he publicly thanked Pakistan for arresting one of the alleged perpetrators of the Abbey Gate bombing at Kabul airport in August 2021, which killed 13 US service members. Recent military exercises, arms sales and high-level engagement suggest that defence ties between Washington and Islamabad are entering a new, more pragmatic phase.",

      "summary_orig": "• PTI senators slam ban on meetings with Imran • Law minister says jail superintendent responsible for meetings, denies solitary confinement claim ISLAMABAD: Senators on Fri­day called for keeping tabs on the use of social media platforms by children under 18, with the chair proposing a special committee to develop safeguards in consultation with relevant ministries. The issue was raised through a calling-attention notice moved by Senators Falak Naz, Fawzia Arshad, Aimal Wali Khan, Saadia Abbasi and Dilawar Khan. Presiding over the sitting, Senator Sherry Rehman said some checks were needed and suggested forming a special committee comprising representatives of the ministries of information technology, interior, education and law, along with parliamentary parties and provincial governments. She said the final decision would rest with Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani. Speaking on the notice, Senator Naz said most platforms were designed for adults and warned that children’s exposure to inappropriate content could make them vulnerable to online harassment, exploitation and dangerous trends. She referred to last year’s killing of Sana Yousaf , a 17-year-old TikToker, and said such incidents underscored the risks of unmonitored social media use for minors. She called for a comprehensive legal framework and urged the government to introduce mandatory age verification, parental supervision and other protective measures. She also demanded restrictions on the use of TikTok, Instagram, VPNs and similar tools by children below 18. “The matter is serious in nature and immediate and serious steps should be taken to prevent children from further dangers of social media,” she said, seeking a briefing from the IT ministry on existing laws and a future action plan. Senator Fawzia Arshad said social media had become a serious concern for parents and required a collective response. She stressed the need for counselling in educational institutions to guide children and discourage harmful online behaviour. “The age between 16 and 18 is very vulnerable and fragile,” she said, adding that the problem could worsen without proper guidance. She also said civics and moral development were insufficiently covered in the curriculum. Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry described the matter as a national issue and said it should be referred to the relevant standing committee. He said the issue was not limited to the IT ministry and involved the ministries of education and interior as well. He called for coordination among stakeholders to propose curriculum changes and appropriate restrictions for underage users in line with international practices. “This is not a challenge for Pakistan but an international issue,” he said. The minister said law enforcement and cybercrime institutions, including the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), should be engaged in efforts to address the issue. “There is a need for a national debate to find a solution to save the underage children from the dangers (of social media),” he said. Senator Sherry Rehman noted that Australia had introduced legislation to restrict social media use for children under 16, but said she was not in favour of blanket bans. Describing social media as an educational tool as well, she said the Senate should consider all aspects and proceed “judiciously”. PTI protest Separately, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers criticised what they described as a continued ban on meetings with the party’s founder Imran Khan, alleging violations of court orders. Speaking on a point of order, PTI parliamentary leader Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had been kept in solitary confinement for the past two months, calling it the “worst form of torture” prohibited under the Constitution, domestic laws and international human rights conventions. He alleged that the jail authorities were effectively punishing the couple without trial, arguing that prolonged detention under harsh prison conditions amounted to punishment in itself. The cases against them were being used as political tools, he said. Senator Zafar rejected the government’s assertion that meetings were not allowed because visitors made political statements, saying this could not justify the denial of fundamental rights. “Legal rights cannot be suspended on political grounds,” he said. He told the House that, despite being legal counsel for Mr Khan, he was not being allowed to meet his client, describing this as a violation of the sanctity of the lawyer-client relationship and a denial of the right to legal defence. PTI Senator Falak Naz also said Mr Khan had been kept in solitary confinement and that no one had been allowed to meet him for the past two months. Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the jail superintendent had the authority to schedule meetings based on conduct. He pointed out that Adiala Jail fell under the jurisdiction of the Punjab government and that the federal government had no authority to issue directions in this regard. The minister rejected the opposition’s claim that Mr Khan was being kept in solitary confinement. Separately, the House also discussed reports of tree cutting in Chitral, with Senator Naz alleging that the timber mafia continued illegal felling. Senator Sherry Rehman said Chitral had “turned brown from green” over the past two decades, adding that the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change would take up the issue in its next meeting. Senator Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said forestry was a provincial subject but noted that the federal government could write to the provincial authorities. Published in Dawn, January 17th, 2026",
