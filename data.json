      "summary_orig": "TO appreciate the cricketing acumen of Jemimah Rodrigues and her feisty teammates as also the women players from distant lands who played in last week’s World Cup matches, I should lean on an aphorism my daughter shared with me: Half the world is women. The other half is their children. What then accounts for the vile invectives flung at Jemimah Rodrigues? For want of a better explanation, Pablo Neruda’s lines from the ‘Fable of the mermaid and the drunks’ could help us see the viciousness on display in the cowardly caverns of the internet. Neruda’s searing lines describe a trusting mermaid who strays into a tavern of drunk and abusive men. “They blackened her with burnt corks and cigarette stubs/ and rolled around laughing on the tavern floor/ She did not speak because she had no speech … Her lips moved, silent, in a coral light, and suddenly she went out by that door/ Entering the river she was cleaned, shining like a white stone in the rain…” Jemimah played an innings of her life to outwit a formidable Australian team thereby putting India into the finals against South Africa. Her teammates, chiefly the one who was summoned at the last minute to stand in for an injured colleague and who took the best performance prize in the final match to mock the selectors, brought back elegance and class that had eluded Indian cricket in recent years. Jemimah was viciously trolled after she gave the credit for her outstanding performance to Jesus Christ. There’s a background to it. Her father was stripped of his membership of the prestigious Hindu Gymkhana Club in Mumbai last year over communally inspired claims he sought to convert people to Christianity on the club’s premises. The father denies the charge. That plus the stress of being kept on her toes perpetually by the selectors was as good a reason as any for her to share her angst publicly. Which player does not have a prayer on their lips when they brace for a tense contest? Is there a dearth of Indian players or their fans who perform yagnas and make temple visits to seek boons for this or that game? No less a person than Gandhiji was a devotee of Christ, quoting often from the Sermon on the Mount. And forget not how Diego Maradona described his World Cup winning goal against England in 1986. Impishly and not without double entendre he said: “It was a little with the head of Maradona, a little with the hand of God.” Which player does not have a prayer on their lips when they brace for a tense contest? The ugliness we witnessed from Indian fans (and some players) towards Pakistan’s squad in a recent cricket contest is sought to be passed off as an aspect of national fervour. How then shall we explain pretty much the same louts attacking a quality Indian player like Jemimah Rodrigues? Let’s face it. Contrary to a widely indulged belief, sports and politics have seldom if ever been separated from each other, and the connection precedes the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia. Denying the bond is a fool’s errand. It was Europe that collectively conjured the idea of the modern nation state, paving the way for newfound but eventually vulgarised nationalism to tether the fleet-footed human spirit to a yard of coloured cloth. (The non-resident India for all his shortcomings is at least honest in switching his national loyalty at will.) The idea of thousands of years old nationhood claimed by some Indians is clearly a canard. Before the 17th-century innovation of frozen borders, human loyalties and identities would change by staying still while empires expanded and contracted around them. Else it would have been tricky for Shelley to compose Ozymandias as a commentary on how egos of transient men in power are laid low by the vagaries of time. Given that the history of sports precedes the innovation called nationalism, it is safe to conclude that elements other than those driven by national identity were in orbit when Indian players were ordered not to shake hands with Pakistani players. The sickening behaviour, while insincere, was not much different from say the mealy-mouthed boycott of the Moscow Olympics by the West, which Pakistan and some others had dutifully embraced. That decision may have unwittingly allowed the Indian hockey team to walk away with the gold medal, it’s last in Olympics. However, what was posited in the 1980s to be in Pakistan’s national interest would be described by senior Pakistan ministers in recent days to have been a grave and self-harming error. It cannot be national interest that admiring Brian Lara or Donald Bradman is a most agreeable thing to do but applauding the swinging yorkers of Pakistani bowlers is not. The narrow national spirit was in abeyance when Yuri Gagarin and Neil Armstrong defied gravity to applaud the questioning spirit of Galileo. Likewise with sport. When Bob Beamon scaled improbable heights to become an invincible long jump athlete in Mexico City the world cheered on. To underscore the link between politics and sports, the origin of the marathon was rooted in a political legend. It was a minor military victory that the Athenian city state scored over the formidable Persian empire of Darius. The ancient Greek legend Pheidippides, ran from the battle site of Marathon to Athens in 490 BC to announce the Athenian victory over the Persians. The modern marathon was created for the 1896 Olympic Games to honour this story. Curiously, when Hitler staged the 1936 Berlin Olympics to legitimise Nazi rule, no Western country thought of boycotting the games. Instead, the US sent Jesse Owens, the legendary African-American athlete who won four gold medals. While his participation challenged Hitler’s racist worldview it also threw a convenient cover on America’s own racist reality. The World Cup victory should help lift the veil from the anti-women subterfuge being perpetrated by a combination of nationalism and religion in India today.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Uzbekistan Embassy in Islamabad on Monday announced the expansion of its flight operations to Pakistan, enhancing connectivity between the two countries and reducing travel time from Islamabad to Tashkent to just two hours. “Direct flights have cut travel time significantly, especially when layovers in Dubai have been eliminated,” an official from the Uzbekistan Embassy told Dawn . Uzbekistan Airways, the national carrier of the Republic of Uzbekistan, now operates a total of four weekly flights between Uzbekistan and Pakistan, doubling the frequency of its Tashkent–Islamabad service while continuing its regular Tashkent–Lahore flights. According to Uzbekistan Airways, the decision to expand services was driven by strong passenger demand, as previous Islamabad flights often operated at full capacity and tickets sold out days in advance. “Tashkent–Islamabad–Tashkent” flights operate twice weekly, every Tuesday and Saturday, while “Tashkent–Lahore–Tashkent” flights operate twice weekly, every Wednesday and Friday. The embassy said that with this expansion, Uzbekistan Airways has strengthened its role as a key bridge between Central and South Asia, offering Pakistani travelers greater choice, convenience, and connectivity to destinations across the world. Flights from Tashkent to Islamabad take around two hours, providing a fast and efficient link between the two capitals. One-way fares start at approximately $200, while round-trip tickets are available from $400, making this route one of the most affordable and time-saving options for business, education, and leisure travelers alike. The embassy added that the “Tashkent–Lahore” route is equally attractive, with one-way fares from about $200 and round-trip fares from $400. All flights are operated on modern, comfortable aircraft, ensuring passengers enjoy world-class onboard service, professional crews, and the highest safety standards. Tashkent International Airport, the airline’s primary hub, is strategically positioned at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, offering passengers efficient connections and a comfortable travel experience. Beyond direct travel between Pakistan and Uzbekistan, the airport serves as a strategic transit hub, connecting travelers to over 50 international destinations across Europe, North America, the Middle East, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Passengers flying via Tashkent can enjoy smooth transit connections to major global cities including Istanbul, Frankfurt, Paris, London, New York, Moscow, Dubai, Tokyo, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Baku, Astana, Batumi and many more. According to the embassy, this extensive network makes Uzbekistan Airways an increasingly popular choice for Pakistani travelers seeking both regional and long-haul connections, combining competitive pricing with superior comfort and efficiency. The embassy said that Uzbekistan and Pakistan share centuries-old historical, cultural and spiritual ties rooted in the heritage of the Silk Road and Islamic civilization. The enhanced air links will further strengthen tourism, trade and people-to-people exchanges between the two brotherly nations. For Pakistani tourists, Uzbekistan offers a gateway to the legendary Silk Road cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva and Kokand. The embassy added that Uzbek visitors are increasingly drawn to Pakistan’s diverse landscapes, historic landmarks and renowned hospitality. Enhanced air links will make it easier for companies, students, and families to connect, while boosting mutual investment and tourism growth. Published in Dawn, November 4th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "IN these polarised times, it is just not the people but also the politicians who are at war with each other. And their attacks on each other in television studios have become the only truth in town, so much so that when they do come together for the greater good, it is rarely noticed and even more rarely appreciated. Consider the moment some years ago when they all joined hands to give Gen Bajwa’s extension legal cover. It was for the greater good, few realised back then, as they were busy castigating the parliamentarians. There was a similar moment in Punjab recently when everyone in the assembly came together to pass a resolution demanding local governments ! Jointly sponsored by young MPAs from the PML-N and the PPP, the draft was so impressive that the PTI lot in parliament also voted for it. The two sides might be at war at the centre and elsewhere but in Punjab everyone was in the mood for love — with LGs. And they have asked for LGs which are constitutionally protected, with defined tenures and responsibilities. It also asked that fresh elections be held within 90 days of the completion or dissolution of the LGs and for linking the provincial finance commission to the NFC . Not only did the legislators come together to ask for this, the Speaker of the assembly, Malik Ahmed Khan, who has in the past been known not just for his generous defence of his party but also of Gen Bajwa, also took the time out to support the resolution in a press conference. According to a news report, he warned that the relationship between the state and the people weakens if there is no effective local governance. He also blamed successive governments for undermining the LG system and cautioned political parties against shortening LG terms for political convenience. Why should one assume that legislators would pass a law with the same intent as a military despot? What a slap in the face all this was for those who blame the politicians for being against LGs and disinterested in the needs of the people. But it has been decades of socialisation against the political class. And the distrust is so high that it is hard to understand why these politicians who are concerned about LGs were also on board when the Punjab Assembly recently passed a law which seems to contradict the very principles they are so anxious about. The new legislation was passed as recently as last month and is criticised for allowing the real power to lie with the provincial government and the bureaucracy. And what has received even more attention is that the new law provides for party-less LG elections — but only up to votes being cast and counted. After that, the footloose and fancy-free victors can join a political party within 30 days. But no more. Those conditioned to distrust politicians point out that this is rather reminiscent of the elections held by Gen Ziaul Haq. Fearing a win by the PPP, he too held party-less elections in the hope that it would throw up a parliament he could control easily. But this is a bit of a stretch. After all, why should anyone, however sceptical of politicians, assume that legislators would pass a law with the same intent as a military dictator? And secondly, who in their right mind would assume that elected politicians at present would behave the same way as their predecessors from 40 years ago? The world has changed since and so has Pakistan. Indeed, if one has to provide a comparison with what happened 40 years ago, the 1985 assembly and the then prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo proved so troublesome that Zia was forced to let them go. But at present there are no such issues in these times of hybrid togetherness where the politicos and the establishment are singing ‘hum saath saath hain’ . Indeed, there is little reason to question this happily ever after. Which also appears to be rather organic. In fact, it is just a coincidence that the politicians in the Punjab Assembly discovered the importance and necessity of LGs at a time when Islamabad is abuzz (it has been for months) about the discussions in a nearby town about how to ‘fix’ governance and the economy.

And their attacks on each other in television studios have become the only truth in town, so much so that when they do come together for the greater good, it is rarely noticed and even more rarely appreciated. Consider the moment some years ago when they all joined hands to give Gen Bajwa’s extension legal cover. It was for the greater good, few realised back then, as they were busy castigating the parliamentarians. There was a similar moment in Punjab recently when everyone in the assembly came together to pass a resolution demanding local governments ! Jointly sponsored by young MPAs from the PML-N and the PPP, the draft was so impressive that the PTI lot in parliament also voted for it. The two sides might be at war at the centre and elsewhere but in Punjab everyone was in the mood for love — with LGs. And they have asked for LGs which are constitutionally protected, with defined tenures and responsibilities. It also asked that fresh elections be held within 90 days of the completion or dissolution of the LGs and for linking the provincial finance commission to the NFC . Not only did the legislators come together to ask for this, the Speaker of the assembly, Malik Ahmed Khan, who has in the past been known not just for his generous defence of his party but also of Gen Bajwa, also took the time out to support the resolution in a press conference. According to a news report, he warned that the relationship between the state and the people weakens if there is no effective local governance. He also blamed successive governments for undermining the LG system and cautioned political parties against shortening LG terms for political convenience. Why should one assume that legislators would pass a law with the same intent as a military despot? What a slap in the face all this was for those who blame the politicians for being against LGs and disinterested in the needs of the people. But it has been decades of socialisation against the political class. And the distrust is so high that it is hard to understand why these politicians who are concerned about LGs were also on board when the Punjab Assembly recently passed a law which seems to contradict the very principles they are so anxious about. The new legislation was passed as recently as last month and is criticised for allowing the real power to lie with the provincial government and the bureaucracy. And what has received even more attention is that the new law provides for party-less LG elections — but only up to votes being cast and counted. After that, the footloose and fancy-free victors can join a political party within 30 days. But no more. Those conditioned to distrust politicians point out that this is rather reminiscent of the elections held by Gen Ziaul Haq. Fearing a win by the PPP, he too held party-less elections in the hope that it would throw up a parliament he could control easily. But this is a bit of a stretch. After all, why should anyone, however sceptical of politicians, assume that legislators would pass a law with the same intent as a military dictator? And secondly, who in their right mind would assume that elected politicians at present would behave the same way as their predecessors from 40 years ago? The world has changed since and so has Pakistan. Indeed, if one has to provide a comparison with what happened 40 years ago, the 1985 assembly and the then prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo proved so troublesome that Zia was forced to let them go. But at present there are no such issues in these times of hybrid togetherness where the politicos and the establishment are singing ‘hum saath saath hain’ .

The campaign, which will run until Nov 12, targets children aged 4 months to 15 years, across 122 high-risk union councils (UCs) in Lahore. Officials hope the drive will interrupt the transmission of poliovirus detected in the city’s environmental samples, a key step toward declaring the entire province polio-free. The fractional inactivated polio vaccine (fIPV) campaign was formally launched by Punjab Minister for Health and Popu­lation Khwaja Imran Nazeer and Health & Pop­u­lation Department Secretary Nadia Saqib. The initiative follows a recommendation from the global Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio, which identified that while children under 5 are mostly protected, the virus is now being spread by older, unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children. “Our priority is to remain vigilant and continue building population immunity until transmission ends everywhere in Pakistan,” Mr Nazeer said at the launch ceremony. “Children who repeatedly miss vaccination remain our biggest vulnerability. Every single child must be vaccinated in every campaign.” The campaign is a significant logistical undertaking, with approximately 10,848 frontline workers participating. This force includes 2,700 skilled vaccinators, 2,700 team assistants, 4,800 community mobilisers, 496 area in charges and 122 UC medical officers. Former health minister Dr Nadeem Jan, while talking to Dawn , called the decision a positive step that should have been taken much earlier. “IPV enhances individual protection of a child and further transmission of virus through child is stopped,” Mr Jan said. “Moreover it also saves child from chances of vaccine derived paralysis and keeps child safe.” He recommended that at least two or three similar rounds should be held in each targeted block to fully eradicate the virus. Lahore is considered the only remaining polio reservoir in Punjab. According to a polio programme expert, DNA sampling indicates the virus circulating in Punjab has not travelled from other hotspot areas like southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “It has been decided to start with Laho­­re as if Lahore block will be cured the whole Punjab province will be declared polio free,” the expert said, noting that South KP remains a more problematic area. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) remains in a child’s gut and stops the further spread of the virus, while the injectable polio vaccine (IPV) offers complete protection from infection. TAG suggested using IPV in reservoirs that were less severely affected. Secretary Saqib emphasised that the fIPV provides an essential boost to immunity. “The fIPV provides an additional layer of protection by boosting immunity, especially where environmental virus detections are recorded,” she said. She highlighted that Punjab has already conducted four national immunisation ca­­mpaigns this year. However, the campaign faces significant challenges. Officials acknowledged there is resistance to injectable vaccines, similar to what was encountered during a recent HPV vaccine drive. There is also a limited supply of equipment, with only 4,000 specialised injectors available, each costing $500. Following the Lahore campaign, similar drives are plan­ned for other high-risk ur­­ban blocks, including Karachi, Hydera­bad and Chaman. Polio workers rescued Separately, police on Monday rescued a group of female polio workers who were attacked and detained by staff at a private school in Gulberg Town, Lahore. The health workers had arrived at the school in Union Council 31 to administer polio vaccines to children when the confrontation occurred. The school’s management refused to allow the vaccinations and the workers were assaulted and locked in a room. One of the workers sustained a head injury, and others were reportedly beaten when they attempted to help their colleague. Video clips later emerged showing the women crying and pleading for help during the incident. The police response was swift following the Punjab CM’s intervention, which included instructions to apprehend the suspects and pursue criminal charges. Later, Misri Shah police filed a case against the school staff. Published in Dawn, November 4th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "THE announcement of plans to undertake a major restructuring of Pakistan’s judicial, financial and administrative system has raised concerns across the political spectrum. Although the ruling coalition had been in talks over the proposed amendment for some time now, Monday’s X post by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari came as a bolt out of the blue for many. The list of areas which would be dealt with by the proposed amendment – such as the establishment of a federal constitutional court, revival of executive magistracy, transfer of high court judges, removal of protection for the share of provinces in the divisible pool, changes to Article 243 which covers the appointment of services chiefs, the return of the education and population planning to the centre, and breaking the deadlock over the appointment of the chief election commissioner – has the potential to upend the political and administrative structure of the country. Some social media handles with Sindhi origins are already abuzz with all kinds of theories about the proposed amendment. These include speculation about a quid-pro-quo involving the formation of a PPP government in Azad Kashmir in exchange for the party’s support. The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) has, indeed, dangled more carrots in front of the PPP than just the Azad Kashmir government. Most notably, these include the setting up of a federal constitutional court – a longstanding PPP demand that was withdrawn during the 26th amendment negotiations only after the government agreed to set up a constitutional bench within the Supreme Court. While Mr Bhutto-Zardari stated in his tweet that his party’s central executive committee (CEC) will meet on Thursday to discuss the proposed amendment and whether or not to support its passage, some early signs suggest the decision will not be easy. His party risks losing legitimacy and public support, especially in its Sindh stronghold. Posts on Sindh-based social media handles suggest that Sindhi nationalists, civil society activists and intellectuals will strongly oppose the likely reversal of the protection for the provinces’ share in the NFC. They are also likely to oppose the return of two important departments to the federal government. PPP’s dilemma “This is a complete rollback of the 18th Amendment,” notes a PPP leader from Sindh on the condition of anonymity because he didn’t want to say anything publicly before the CEC meeting. “It will be very, very difficult for the party to accept this as it goes against everything we have stood and fought for. Once the constitutional safeguard ensuring the provinces’ share from the NFC is revoked, we’ll be back to square one. “This safeguard was introduced precisely to prevent any future dictator or even a democratic government from arbitrarily cutting the provincial share. Look at the contradiction — on the one hand, they admit federal expenditures are rising. On the other, they want to snatch away two more ministries, for education and population planning,” he muses. He adds that of the 17 ministries that were devolved, several have already found their way back to the federal government in one form or another. “For instance, agriculture was devolved, but the centre later created the Ministry of Food Security to retain control over agriculture.” He did not, however, elaborate on the potential reaction within the party over the proposed constitutional court, revival of the executive magistracy and change in the procedure for appointing the chief election commissioner. Most political analysts, however, don’t see the PPP rejecting the proposed amendments in toto. Senior analyst and columnist Suhail Warraich, who is considered close to top PPP leadership, especially President Asif Zardari, doesn’t see the PPP compromising on the NFC or the 18th Amendment. “Provincial autonomy has always been central to their politics. That’s why it was part of the MRD’s [Movement for Restoration of Democracy] agenda and later an important element of the Charter of Democracy.” Nonetheless, he says, the party is likely to agree on the formation of a federal constitutional court, which is also a component of the Charter of Democracy, and even on whatever changes are being proposed to Article 243. “The NFC and 18th Amendment will be their red line though,” he adds. Another political commentator and journalist, Badar Alam, believes that the PPP would be committing suicide if it agrees to roll back provincial autonomy guaranteed in the 18th Amendment. “The party will lose its political relevance if it surrenders on the NFC Award and agrees to transfer education and population — two key pillars of provincial autonomy — back to the centre,” he says. “The people of Sindh were unhappy even when the federal government pushed canal-building projects and the party leadership initially chose to ignore their concerns. If a similar approach is taken on the NFC, it will only strengthen nationalist forces in Sindh.” Like Mr Warraich, he also believes that it will be easier for the PPP to agree on the creation of a constitutional court and even on amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution. “However, details about both remain sketchy for now, making it difficult to comment definitively. The idea of a federal constitutional court is, in principle, a sound one. But if implemented at this stage, it will likely be viewed as an attempt to curb the judiciary’s powers. Besides, since we already have a constitutional bench in the Supreme Court, the likelihood of frequent jurisdictional disputes between the two bodies would be quite high.” Economic implications Changes in the NFC have long been part of the IMF and World Bank’s agenda. The framework has effectively been undermined earlier by forcing provinces to produce budget surpluses at the cost of development and public welfare. The federal government has also resorted to indirect taxation on petroleum, gas and other items to bypass the current NFC arrangement. Economist Waqar Wadho, who teaches at the Lahore School of Economics, says that since the announcement of the 7th NFC Award, the federal government has been trying to increase its revenues. “Because it cannot do so through the divisible pool owing to the constitutional safeguard for the provinces, it has resorted to indirect taxation like the imposition of various levies, including the one on petroleum products.” “However, the numbers show that even these additional revenues are insufficient for the centre to meet its growing expenditures. A major portion of federal income is consumed by defence-related spending and interest payments,” he notes. “Now, the goal appears to be to boost revenues through the divisible pool itself by legally increasing the federal share. But that will not mean the centre will roll back the levies it has already imposed to enhance its revenue outside the NFC. Those are likely to remain in place even after the federal share is raised.” Mr Wadho argues that the change in the NFC sharing formula in favour of the centre will have serious implications for provinces, especially the smaller ones. “A reduced provincial share will directly impact their capacity to deliver public services. You may recall that Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have invested heavily in healthcare: KP launched its health insurance programme while Sindh focused on hospitals and related infrastructure at the district level. If their share from the NFC is cut, such initiatives will inevitably suffer.” According to him, KP — particularly after the merger of the former FATA districts — and Balochistan will be far worse off than they are now. Sindh and Punjab, on the other hand, still have some space to generate additional tax revenues. “Yet they will also feel the strain. Once its share declines, even Punjab may no longer be able to extend support to its people the way it did after recent floods. Overall, public service delivery across the country will be hit, though Punjab and Sindh might still manage somewhat better due to their larger revenue base.” Speaking on the implications for the PPP’s politics in Sindh, the LSE economist argues the PPP is in a really tough position. “It wants to project Bilawal Bhutto as a prime ministerial candidate and revive the party in Punjab. For both goals, it needs the goodwill of federal institutions, especially the army. That makes it difficult for the party to take a firm stand against the proposed changes because the message from the establishment seems to be that they have a choice between Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Bilawal — and that Maryam is offering them a better deal.” The PPP can see that clearly, he says. “Yet, at the same time, Bilawal’s party depends on retaining Sindh as its power base for any chance at forming a government in Islamabad. Supporting the proposed amendment would have serious repercussions for the PPP there. We’ve already seen civil society groups, lawyers, and political parties uniting (to protect the province’s water rights) during protests against Punjab’s canal projects. So, much like the controversy over the canal projects, the party will again struggle to justify backing the 27th Amendment.” Mr Wadho insists that Mr Bhutto-Zardari is young and has the chance to resist it if he can think beyond the next government or even the one after that. “But with Mr Zardari still calling some of the shots, the party may instead look for cosmetic adjustments to soften the blow. One possible outcome could be that they negotiate some limited protection for Sindh’s interests to make the compromise appear more acceptable.” Legal issues Outside Sindh too, the proposed amendment is likely to ignite opposition from other sections of society, particularly lawyers, who will not take the changes in the higher judiciary lying down. The government seems to be fully aware of that, and this shows in its timing of the proposed amendment – coming as it does right after government-backed lawyers appear to be leading in bar council elections. If the proposed amendment triggers protests and resistance from lawyers, the government believes that its allies in the bar council will help alleviate the strength of this resistance. Constitutional expert and Supreme Court lawyer Salahuddin Ahmed argues that the proposed changes to the constitution through the 27th Amendment are mostly meant to “control the streets” through revival of executive magistracy, sideline the opposition in the process of selecting the chief election commissioner, and manage maverick judges through transfers from one court to another. “In short, it’ll be a slide into fascism brought in by parliament itself,” he concludes.

Turkiye wants to see a post-war framework for Gaza in which “Palestinians ensure Palestine’s governance and security,” Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters after a meeting in Istanbul involving Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Turkiye. Brokered by US President Donald Trump, the October 10 ceasefire — which halted two years of continuous bloodshed — has been tested by fresh Israeli strikes in civilians in Gaza. Mr Fidan said the taskforce that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire under a US-brokered deal needed a mandate defined by the UN Security Council and a framework for legitimacy, on the basis of which countries will decide whether to send soldiers to the enclave. He said it was crucial that the emerging International Stabilisa­tion Force that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire under Trump’s plan, have a “mandate defined by a UN Security Council resolution and a framework for legitimacy”. Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” he said. It may be noted that top-level consultations are reportedly underway in Pakistan as well over the question of sending troops for the proposed Gaza force , and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the UN umbrella. “First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council. “And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” Mr Fidan said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington. Israel has long viewed Turkey’s diplomatic overtures with suspicion over Ankara’s close ties with Hamas and adamantly opposes it joining the task force that is meant to take over after Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. “Our principle is that Palestinians should govern the Palestinians and ensure their own security, the international community should support this in the best possible way – diplomatically, institutionally and economically,” Mr Fidan said. “Nobody wants to see a new system of tutelage emerge,” he said. “We’ve now reached an extremely critical stage: we do not want the genocide in Gaza to resume,” Mr Fidan added, saying all seven nations supported plans for the Palestinians to take control of Gaza’s security and governance. Mr Fidan, who also held talks at the weekend with a Hamas delegation led by its chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, said the movement was “ready to hand Gaza to a committee of Palestinians”. He also expressed hope that reconciliation efforts between Hamas and the rival West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, “will bear fruit as soon as possible,” saying inter-Palestinian unity would “strengthen Palestine’s representation in the international community”. Hamas in compliance Earlier on Monday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Hamas appeared committed to the truce, pointing the finger of blame at Israel. “It seems Hamas is quite determined to adhere to the agreement while Israel’s record is very poor,” he told an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) gathering in Istanbul, saying Muslim states should play “a leading role” in Gaza’s recovery. “At this point, we need to deliver more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza and then begin reconstruction efforts. “The Israeli government is doing everything in its power to prevent this,” Mr Erdogan said. He also urged Muslim states to play “a leading role” in Gaza’s recovery. “We believe the reconstruction plan prepared by the Arab League and the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) should be implemented immediately,” he said of the plan unveiled in March. Ceasefire violations denounced Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, along with other “Arab-Islamic foreign ministers”, deliberated on the way forward for a lasting ceasefire and sustainable peace in Gaza. “The leaders jointly called for urgent humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, condemned Israeli ceasefire violations, demanded Israel’s withdrawal from the Occupied Palestinian Territory and emphasised the rebuilding of Gaza,” the statement added. “Pakistan reaffirmed its principled stance for the establishment of an independent, viable and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in line with the UN and OIC resolutions,” it said.

      "summary_orig": "• ISPR chief rejects reports regarding US drone operations • Warns India against ‘false flag operation’ in deep waters • Says decision to join Gaza peacekeeping force will be made by govt ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Monday adopted a tougher stance toward the Taliban regime ahead of the next round of talks in Istanbul , declaring that Pakistan’s only and non-negotiable demand is an end to terrorism emanating from Afghan territory. “The conditions that Afghan Taliban keep putting forward are meaningless, what matters is the end of terrorism,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s spokesman, while briefing a group of journalists at Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). “Pakistan has a one-point agenda: Afghan soil must not be used against us,” he asserted. Gen Chaudhry’s remarks came as Islamabad prepares for the Nov 6 meeting in Turkiye, the next phase of negotiations following last month’s six-day talks in Istanbul between Pakistan and the Taliban regime. Those talks, mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, produced a reaffirmation by both sides to ceasefire agreed in Doha and an agreement on establishing a monitoring and verification mechanism for cross-border terrorism, though implementation details remain unresolved. Ahead of the upcoming Istanbul talks, Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah also held consultations with his negotiators, led by Mullah Najib, to deliberate on the next phase of dialogue with Pakistan, according to sources familiar with the discussions in Kandahar. During his briefing, the military’s spokesperson highlighted that operations were underway against terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned TTP — with 1,667 terrorists killed. Gen Chaudhry disclosed that 206 Afghan Taliban fighters and 112 TTP terrorists were killed during the recent border tensions. Pointing to growing participation of Afghans in TTP and subsequent blurring of lines between the two groups, he said about 60 per cent of the terrorists killed during infiltration attempts in the last three to four months were Afghan nationals. Afghan Tailban’s support to TTP “The TTP is not a separate entity, it is a branch of the Afghan Taliban,” Gen Chaudhry observed, explaining that the outfit had sworn allegiance to the Taliban’s emir, “and we have clear evidence that the Taliban are settling TTP fighters in densely populated areas to provide them a protective shield”. He added that while Pakistan continues efforts to settle matters peacefully with Afghanistan, “there can be no compromise on our security and sovereignty”. The spokesman dismissed recent Taliban statements suggesting preconditions for dialogue, including demands that Pakistan end alleged support for the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP) and anti-Taliban propaganda. “Such conditions are meaningless. The only meaningful step is verifiable action against terrorists,” he said. US drone operations He categorically denied reports in “Afghan and Indian media” about a supposed secret US-Pakistan understanding allowing American drone operations in Afghanistan. “This is fake news propagated by Zabihullah Mujahid,” the Taliban spokesman, he said. “Pakistan has not given permission to the US or any other country to use its territory for attacks inside Afghanistan. These claims are baseless propaganda.” Pakistani officials view the Istanbul process as a test of the Taliban’s credibility. A senior security source said last week that Pakistan expects “credible evidence of action including dismantling of hideouts, disruption of logistical networks, and arrests of TTP leadership.” False flag operation The military spokesman warned that India was planning a “false flag” operation in the maritime domain to fabricate evidence of a major Pakistani strike or act of aggression, potentially triggering a new round of tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals. Gen Chaudhry, citing intelligence reports, indicated India could stage the incident “in deep waters,” portraying it as a Pakistani attack to justify escalation and malign Islamabad internationally. He said Pakistan’s armed forces were on “high alert” and would deliver a “far stronger, more decisive, and severe” response than in previous incidents if provoked. Security observers say the military’s unusually pointed warning coincides with several converging developments that Pakistan views as provocative or politically timed including India’s Trishul exercise, Bihar state elections, and regional tensions. Last Saturday, the government released a video confession by Ijaz Mallah, a fisherman from Sindh who had been detained by Indian forces in 2024. In the video, Malah claims he was coerced by India’s external intelligence agency, RAW, to engage in espionage-related activities in Pakistan. ISPR officials cited the testimony as partial evidence of Indian maritime sabotage plans, connecting it to what they describe as a “covert Indian terror network” disrupted earlier this year. Gaza peace force The military spokesman said that any decision regarding the deployment of Pakistani troops to a proposed Gaza peacekeeping force would be made by the government and parliament. His comments came amid reports that Pakistan is weighing a potential contribution of troops to an International Stabilization Force (ISF) for Gaza. The proposed mission could also include disarmament and security enforcement tasks, which have drawn criticism from opposition parties. They argue the government has not held a full parliamentary debate and warn that participation without clear UN oversight could risk Pakistan’s complicity in coercive actions against Palestinians.

Similar delays occurred at nearly all major airports in last two months due to engineers’ protest seeking pay hike and other issues. According to sources, hundreds of Umrah pilgrims were stranded at the Islamabad, Lahore and Kara­chi airports due to the delay in PIA flights scheduled for Saudi Arabia. A spokesman for PIA said the Society of Aircraft Engineers had no legal status and alleged that the main aim of this movement was to sabotage PIA’s privatisation, which was in its final stages. He warned that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he warned, adding that the management was obtaining alternative engineering services from other airlines to resume operations.

      "summary_orig": "Multiple people on social media platform X shared two separate videos on Friday and Monday, claiming to show Indian army officials criticising recent tri-military exercises as a political move to boost the image for the upcoming Bihar elections. However, the videos are dubbed over. India kicked off large-scale combined military exercises named ‘Trishul 2025’ near its western border on October 30 amid heightened regional tensions. The war games, involving armoured divisions, fighter aircraft and advanced drone systems, are being held across Rajasthan and Punjab to test rapid deployment capabilities. Indian defence officials have described the drills as routine preparedness measures. Meanwhile, upcoming elections are scheduled in Bihar , India, for the state’s legislative assembly from November 6-11, 2025. On Friday, an X account, that appears to be anti-Indian based upon its previous posts and is known for repeatedly sharing AI-altered videos, posted a clip with the following caption: “Breaking news: Bikaner, Rajasthan | South Western Army Commander Lt Gen Manjinder Singh says, ‘We all know these so called threshold exercises are being pushed for political optics to boost the image of incumbent government before Bihar elections but still we will give our best because we are professional soldiers, not saffron mobs.’” The post gained over 38,100 views. The transcript of the video is provided below: “Soldiers, we all know these so-called threshold exercises are being pushed for political optics to boost image for the Bihar elections. But remember, we serve India, not any party. Our duty is to defend the nation, not to become props in political theatre. They may try to saffronise our image, but the Indian army belongs only to the republic, not to Modi, not to any ideology. We will perform our duties with professionalism, go to these exercises with discipline, and show the world that the Indian army stands for India, not for politics. Jai Hind.” The same video with similar claims was shared by multiple pro-Pakistani accounts on X, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here , colelctively gaining 35,000 views. Separately today, an Indian account that appears to be anti-BJP, based upon its previous posts, shared a video of Indian Colonel Sofia Qureshi at a press briefing with the caption: “These Trishul exercises are nothing but a political gimmick to sway the Bihar elections. I’m done being used as a prop for Muslim support. I can’t stand the saffronisation of the Indian Army.” In the video, which had a watermark of Indian news agency ANI , the Indian military officer could be heard saying: “Today, I stand here not as a political pawn but as a soldier of the Indian army. For two and a half years, I have served my country with pride, until I realised we were being used as props to divide our own citizens. “The saffronisation of our ranks is a betrayal of every oath we took. Our job is to defend India, not the ideology of the BJP or RSS. These so-called Trishul exercises before the Bihar elections are nothing but a theatre to fool the nation. Uniforms are being printed in ideology, not honour. “This must stop now. If speaking the truth costs my uniform, so be it. I still stand with India, not with hate.” The post gained 47,000 views. The video and claim were also shared by a Pakistani propaganda account, based on its previous posts, with the caption: “Breaking News: Col Sofya Qureshi explodes on live TV, ‘These Trishul exercises are nothing but a political gimmick aimed at manipulating the Bihar Elections. I am sick and tired of being used as a prop for Muslim support. I can’t stand with saffronization of the Indian army’.” The post racked up 29,400 views. Others on X also shared the video along with the claim, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , and here , collectively garnering over 20,000 views. Fact-checks were initiated to determine the veracity of the claims due to their virality and keen public interest in the purported political statements attributed to Indian military officers amid regional tensions. Analysing the first video using the forensic tool Hive Moderation to determine the authenticity of the video shows it detected 99.8 per cent potential AI manipulation. A reverse-image search conducted to trace the original footage yielded an X video uploaded on October 30, 2025, by Indian news outlet IANS with the following caption: “Bikaner, Rajasthan: Sapta Shakti Command Manjinder Singh says, ’The Indian army is following the political direction of new normal, under which, any terror act in the country will be considered as act of war. And the military has to prepare for any such activities … A lot of technologies and capabilities have been introduced for this… Our focus is on maximum night training, hence we are carrying out 70 per cent of the training at night and 30pc of it during the day.“ In the video, Singh delivered an address during a press conference after witnessing an exercise codenamed “Sentinel Strike” at the Mahajan Field Firing Range (Thar Desert). At no point did he discuss Indian domestic politics or make any remarks about the politicisation of the Trishul exercises. The briefing was covered by multiple Indian media outlets such as WION news and The Economic Times , but did not mention any criticism of the Indian army’s alleged politicisation. Analysing the second video using the forensic tool AI Video Detector shows that the clip was flagged as “suspicious” with a 60pc deepfake probability score. Deepware, another tool, also detected it as suspicious with an 84pc deepfake score. Additionally, a reverse image search conducted to trace the original footage yielded an X video uploaded on October 31, 2025, by Indian news outlet ANI . It stated that Col Sofia spoke at the Young Leaders Forum in Delhi. “Colonel Sofiya Qureshi says … responsibilities for defending a nation are not just the military’s game; civilians also play a role in addressing external and internal threats … Over the years, the Indian army has trained officers and troops in ‘Saashtra’ and ‘Shashtra’,” the caption of the post read. It added: “‘Saashtra’ means knowledge, strategy, and wisdom, while ‘Shashtra’ means weaponry and warfare, representing a blend of intellect and strength … Every generation has carried the flame of patriotism, from baby boomers to Gen Z … Be it seven decades ago or Operation Sindoor, you all have witnessed it … You, the ‘Yuva Shakti of Bharat,’ you are the force of multipliers. You are not only trained in firepower, but also in the firewalls. You are ready to face kinetic and non-kinetic domains … War is not only fought in bunkers or with bullets, but also with bites and bandwidths.” The reverse image search also yielded the full video of Col Sofia’s speech uploaded on YouTube by ANI . In the clip, Col Sofia spoke about the Indian youth and the role they play in national security. However, at no point did she discuss Indian domestic politics or make any remarks about the politicisation of the Trishul exercises. Her speech was covered by multiple Indian media outlets such as WION News , Indian Economic Observer and Hindustan Times . None of the reports mentioned any criticism of the alleged politicisation of the Indian army or of the tri-military exercises as a political gimmick. Therefore, the fact-checks determined that the claims that two viral videos show Indian Southwestern Army Commander Lt Gen Manjinder Singh and military spokesperson Colonel Sofia Qureshi criticising the recent Trishul exercises as political optics to boost the image for the Bihar elections are false . The clips are doctored and have been dubbed over through AI-generated audio. These fact checks were originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

      "summary_orig": "As many as 29,609 tickets have been issued for traffic rule violations since the newly implemented e-ticketing system was inaugurated in Karachi, according to data from the police. Sindh Chief Minister inaugurated the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (TRACS), commonly known as the e-ticketing system, at the Central Police Office (CPO) last week. He explained that the new system replaces the outdated manual ticketing process with a fully automated e-ticketing mechanism, utilising advanced AI-integrated CCTV cameras to detect violations such as speeding, red-light jumping, and helmet non-compliance. Of the 29,609 tickets issued, 17,639 of them were issued to drivers not wearing a seatbelt, while 6,362 were issued to motorcyclists not wearing helmets, the data shows. Another 1,967 tickets were issued for speeding, while 1,655 were issued for running through red lights. Meanwhile, 943 tickets were issued for using mobile phones while operating a vehicle and 298 were handed out for having tinted windows and glass. For parking in a ‘no-parking’ zone, 165 tickets were issued, while 162 were issued to motorists using the wrong side of the road; 44 tickets were handed to people going the wrong way on a one-way street. Additionally, 152 motorists were ticketed for having passengers on the roof of their vehicle, and 91 others were caught violating stop lines. An additional 65 tickets were handed out due to lane line violations, with 44 tickets issued to vehicles carrying an improper load and 37 for being overloaded. No tickets were issued for having “fancy number plates”, sudden lane changes or expired tax. In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred. The decision came amid Karachi witnessing a surge in traffic accidents , particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data. The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.",

      "summary_orig": "Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said on Monday that both the government and the PTI, along with Imran Khan, need to show flexibility in order to create space for engagement to decrease the political friction in the country. Fawad is one of the three former PTI leaders who say they have been engaging with the party’s incarcerated leadership to put an end to politics of confrontation as part of their political outreach initiative. They also visited PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, after he was taken to a hospital in Lahore from prison, on Thursday, to convince him to join their campaign. “I’ve said this from the first day, the government should move one step forward and the PTI and Imran Khan should move back one step so space is created,” said the former PTI leader while speaking during an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘News Wise’. He maintained that both sides would have to decide on the need to bring down the temperature, warning that if the PTI did not pursue engagement and talks, it would face similar treatment as the disbanding and ban on the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan. “The government needs this, because whatever international successes they have gained are not translating into Pakistan … so both sides need the temperature to come down. We think the leaders of Lahore should play the role of a pivot and take this forward.” Chaudhry added that the immediate need was to lower the political temperature, saying talks could not proceed if both sides could not even bear to see each other. Defending his former party’s obstinacy against engagement in talks, he said it was also due to the behaviour of the government, which had made a policy of “crushing and sidelining” the opposition. “The two ruling parties, the establishment and the PTI, are the four big players and the political temperature between them should come down. How will that happen? …you will have to give the leadership in Lahore’s jail the chance to talk to Imran Khan.” He further said that the establishment and the government needed to decide whether the country needed a reduction in political temperature or not. “I am very hopeful they have this view too.” Referring to the group’s recent activities, Chaudhry said they had a meeting of at least 45 minutes with Qureshi. He added that the proposal being carried by the group was not even their own, instead pointing to a letter by incarcerated PTI leaders in Lahore earlier this year, which called for a reduction in political friction and encouraged engagement. Chaudhry was not without criticism for the government, saying it had backed the PTI into a corner. “If you don’t engage with the PTI, the only way forward it has is to protest,” he said. The former federal minister added that in such a situation, the PTI could lead a protest to Islamabad and resign from the National Assembly, while the government would attempt to impose governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which would be resisted by the party. “Another event like November 26, 2024, will happen, and as a result of this, the tensions and political temperature in Pakistan will increase. The problem right now is that, we the people, living in Pakistan are being severely impacted by this,” he said, adding that the group had requested the incarcerated PTI leaders in Lahore that if there was no implementation of their earlier recommendation, it would lead to great loss for both the party and the government. He also said the fact that the group was allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI leadership in Kot Lakpat jail was an encouraging sign. “Senior government ministers called me and appreciated the effort,” he said, pointing to Information Minister Attaullah Tarar’s welcoming of the development in particular. “Senior PTI leadership also called and said that this is the only way.”",

      "summary_orig": "At least three terrorists were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Monday. “Movement of a group of khwarij, opposite general area Esham, North Waziristan District, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was picked up by the security forces.” The military’s media wing said troops effecttively engaged the group of khawarij . “As a result of precise and skillful engagement, two khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell.” In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. The ISPR added that one of the terrorists killed was identified as Qasim, and Afghan national who was serving in the Afghan Border Police. In another intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Tank district, security forces killed another terrorist, identified as Ikramuddin aka Abu Dajana, also an Afghan national. “These incidents reveal continued involvement of Afghan nationals in numerous terrorist activities against innocent civilians and security forces inside Pakistan.” “Pakistan has repeatedly been asking Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border and is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij and involvement of its citizens in terrorism inside Pakistan,” said the ISPR. The statement added that the security forces of Pakistan remain “resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers”. A sanitisation operation was launched in the area to eliminate any “other Indian sponsored Kharji”. Last week, the deputy chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Amjad alias Mazahim, was killed in an IBO. According to ISPR, Amjad was a deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.",

      "title_orig": "Fearing fraud, Canada rejects most Indian study permit applicants",
      "summary_orig": "Canada’s clampdown on international students has hit applicants from India particularly hard, government data shows, as what was once a preferred destination loses its allure for Indian students. Canada lowered the number of international student permits it issues for the second year in a row in early 2025 as part of a broader effort to reduce the number of temporary migrants and address fraud related to student visas. About 74 per cent of Indian applications for permits to study at Canadian post-secondary institutions in August — the most recent month available — were rejected, compared to about 32pc in August 2023, according to immigration department data provided to Reuters . By contrast, about 40pc of study permit applications overall in each of those months were refused. About 24pc of Chinese study permits in August 2025 were rejected. The number of Indian applicants has dropped as well, from 20,900 in August 2023 — when Indians formed just over one quarter of all applicants — to 4,515 in August 2025. India has been Canada’s top source of international students over the past decade. In August, it also had the highest study-permit refusal rate of any country with more than 1,000 approved applicants. The spike in refusals of would-be students comes as Canada and India seek to mend ties after more than a year of tension. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement in the 2023 murder of a Canadian in Surrey, British Columbia. India has repeatedly denied the allegations. An effort to crack down on fraud In 2023, Canadian authorities uncovered nearly 1,550 study permit applications linked to fraudulent letters of acceptance, most of which originated from India, Canada’s immigration department told Reuters in an email. Last year, its beefed-up verification system detected more than 14,000 potentially fraudulent letters of acceptance from all applicants, it said. Canada has implemented enhanced verification for international students and has increased its financial requirements for applicants, the immigration department spokesperson said. The Indian embassy in Ottawa said the rejection of study permit applications from students in India had come to its attention, but that the issuance of study permits is Canada’s prerogative. “However, we would like to emphasise that some of the best quality students available in the world are from India, and Canadian institutions have in the past greatly benefited from the talent and academic excellence of these students,” the embassy said in a statement. Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand told Reuters during an October visit to India that Canada’s government is concerned about the integrity of its immigration system but wants to continue having Indian students in Canada. A drop in Indian enrolment People who work with would-be international students say they are seeing a higher level of applicant scrutiny. Michael Pietrocarlo of Border Pass, which helps people apply for Canadian visas, said his firm prepares applicants to show their eligibility beyond what’s required on paper. He says, for example, when students must demonstrate they have sufficient funds to support themselves, “it’s not enough just to say, ‘Here are some bank statements.’ They may have to go the extra mile and say, ‘Here’s where the money came from.’” The University of Waterloo, home to Canada’s largest engineering school, has seen a two-thirds decline in the number of students from India entering its undergraduate and graduate programs over the past three to four years. Ian VanderBurgh, its associate vice president of strategic enrolment management, said the drop was largely due to a government cap on foreign student visas and had altered the composition of the student body. “We pride ourselves on being an international university,” he said. The University of Regina and the University of Saskatchewan have also reported a decline in the number of Indian students enrolled. When Jaspreet Singh, who founded the International Sikh Students Association, came to Canada from India in 2015 to study mechanical engineering, he remembers government posters exhorting newcomers to “Study, work, stay” in the country. That attitude has soured, he said. Singh is not surprised at the higher rejection rate for Indian study permit applicants, saying he knows fraud is a concern. But as it becomes harder to get permanent residency or a job in Canada, he says some of those recently rejected appear to not mind: “They are happy they didn’t come.”",

      "summary_orig": "Nigerians across the religious spectrum pushed back Monday on US President Donald Trump’s threats of military intervention over the killing of Christians in the country. Africa’s most populous country, which is roughly evenly split between a mostly Christian south and Muslim-majority north, is home to myriad conflicts, which experts say kill both Christians and Muslims without distinction. Claims of Christian “persecution” in Nigeria have found traction online among the US and European right in recent weeks. “Christians are being killed, we can’t deny the fact that Muslims are (also) being killed,” Danjuma Dickson Auta, a Christian and community leader, told AFP. Trump said on social media over the weekend that he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack. Asked by an AFP reporter aboard Air Force One if he was considering putting US troops on the ground or using air strikes, Trump replied: “Could be, I mean, a lot of things — I envisage a lot of things.” “They’re killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers,” he said Sunday. “We’re not going to allow that to happen.” Ethnic violence Auta, 56, hails from Plateau state, where Christians and Muslims have long lived side by side. The state has also seen explosions of violence — including deadly sectarian riots in the capital Jos in 2001 and 2008. In recent years, Plateau and other states in Nigeria’s “Middle Belt” have suffered deadly clashes between mostly Christian farmers and Fulani Muslim herders over dwindling land and resources. The conflict has often resulted in massive death tolls on the side of the farmers, with entire villages razed. Smaller-scale attacks on herders — including retaliatory killings of random ethnic Fulanis or their cattle — often generate fewer headlines in both the local and international press. Though the violence often falls across ethnic and religious lines, experts say the root causes lie in poor land management and policing in rural areas. Words like “genocide” have been thrown around by those in Plateau frustrated by the escalating violence, though typically in ethnic, not religious terms. Claims of a “Christian genocide”, meanwhile, have been pushed in recent years by separatist groups in the southeast. US-based firm Moran Global Strategies has been lobbying on behalf of separatists this year, advising congressional staff on what it said was Christian “persecution”, according to disclosure forms. Nigeria suggests Trump-Tinubu meeting Nigeria also faces a long-running jihadist conflict in its northeast, and “bandit” gangs in the northwest who conduct kidnappings and village raids. The north’s population is mostly Muslim — meaning most of the victims are, too. “Even those who sold this narrative of Christian genocide know it is not true,” said Abubakar Gamandi, a Muslim who heads a fishermen’s union in Borno state, the epicentre of the Boko Haram conflict. Chukwuma Soludo, the Christian governor of Anambra state, also pushed back against US intervention, saying Washington “must act within the realm of international law”. Others have used the controversy to point out long-festering insecurity in the country, and Trump’s rhetoric has resonated with some in Nigeria. Reverend Joseph Hayab, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria for the country’s north, said he rejected the framing of “farmer-herder violence” and called Trump’s comments a “wake-up call”. “People are twisting the story as if Trump said he is coming to fight Nigeria. No, he is coming to deal with terrorists,” he told AFP. Amid Trump’s ratcheted-up rhetoric, the Nigerian presidency suggested a meeting between the two leaders to resolve the issue. Daniel Bwala, spokesman for Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, said, “Donald Trump has his own style of communication”. Bwala suggested to AFP Sunday that Trump’s post was a way to “force a sit-down between the two leaders so they can iron out a common front to fight their insecurity”. Trump previously attacked South Africa over what he called a “genocide” against its Dutch-descended Afrikaner community, and has offered them refugee status. Critics of the president said the rhetoric was part of Trump’s hardline diplomatic strategy.",

      "summary_orig": "Six cops were injured on Monday when gunmen opened fire at the North Waziristan district police officer’s (DPO) vehicle near Bannu district’s Mamash Khel town, an official said. Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan confirmed the details to Dawn , adding that the incident took place on Miranshah road, which connects Bannu and North Waziristan. “Armed men open fire at the vehicle of North Waziristan’s DPO,” RPO Khan said. “The DPO remained unhurt,” he added. He further said the injured police personnel were taken to the Bannu District Headquarters Hospital. “The unidentified attackers have hidden in nearby areas and a search operation is underway [to trace them],” the Bannu RPO said. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The past few months have seen an escalation in attacks on law enforcement agencies, with police forces in KP being targeted repeatedly . Yesterday, a station house officer and two other cops were injured in a blast caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) in KP’s Hangu district. Last week, terrorists kidnapped a police official from Bannu’s Havaid Adda area. Separately, the Bannu police on Friday also claimed to have recovered Constable Noor Zaman, who had been kidnapped by terrorists in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali town. The cop was on his way to attend the last rites of his brother, Constable Javed Khan, who had been martyred in a gun attack in Bannu. Faced with the heightened militancy, security forces have also intensified counter-terrorism operations in KP and Balochistan. Militants in Pakistan suffered their heaviest losses in 10 years during the month of October as security forces intensified operations against them, according to a report by the think-tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.",
