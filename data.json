      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will undertake a three-day visit to Malaysia at the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim from October 5-7, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday. In a statement , the FO said that a high-level delegation comprising the PM, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and other federal ministers and senior government officials will depart on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” the statement read. According to the FO, PM Shehbaz will hold bilateral talks with Malaysian PM Ibrahim and discuss key regional and global developments, as well as enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, the Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people ties. “The leaders are expected to witness the signing of Agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read. Earlier this month, Malaysian High Commissioner to Pakistan Dato’ Mohammad Azhar Mazlan said that there is a great deal of commonality and potential for bilateral exchanges between Kuala Lumpur and Islamabad. “Malaysia takes pride in its association with Pakistan since August 31, 1957, when we gained independence. Pakistan was one of the earliest countries to recognise Malaysia as a nation. Justice Abdul Hamid of Pakistan also helped Malaysia in drafting its constitution,“ Mazlan said at an event in Karachi.",

      "title_orig": "Conspiracy by ‘ill-wishers’ failed in AJK following govt-JAAC agreement: minister",
      "summary_orig": "Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Saturday that the conspiracy hatched by the ill-wishers of Pakistan has failed in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the government will fully implement the commitments it has made with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC). “The scenes that Pakistan’s ill-wishers wanted to see, the unrest, chaos and disorder in AJK, their conspiracy has failed. The federal government will fully implement the commitments it has made, and with the 15-day mechanism that has been established, I am confident that there will be no further opportunity for such grievances to arise again,” said the minister while addressing a press conference following the agreement between the two sides. Iqbal was accompanied by Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam and PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira. The signing of the agreement comes after two rounds of talks between the high-level government delegation and the JAAC in as many days. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Since then, rival groups since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. Iqbal added that following the successful conclusion of talks between the two sides, peace has been restored in the region. Iqbal expressed satisfaction over the dialogue process and said it was “conducted keeping in view the interests of the people of Azad Kashmir and the interests of Pakistan”. Acknowledging administrative weaknesses, the minister said government organs should be more responsive. “The people are now more aware, the media has made them more informed and their expectations have increased greatly.” Kaira said following the agreement, the people of AJK “breathed a sigh of relief today” and added that the mechanism established must succeed as “we have no other option other than to ensure its success”. A high-level federal government delegation earlier today signed an agreement with JAAC to end days of unrest in AJK, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying that “all issues have been resolved amicably”. A day earlier, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said it was “deeply alarmed“ by the ongoing violence in AJK, and condemned the “use of excessive force” and the communications blackout. In a post on social media platform X during the early hours of Saturday following day-long talks, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said — who was part of the government negotiating committee — said: “Our negotiation delegation has signed on a final agreement with the AJK Joint Action Committee. The protesters are returning to their homes. All roads have reopened.” “This is a victory of peace. Long live Azad Kashmir,” the minister added. Chaudhry also shared a copy of the pact on X, which listed 12 “decisions” taken and 13 “additional points”. Under the agreement, it was decided that first information reports (FIRs) would be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on the “incidents of violence and vandalism resulting into deaths of personnel belonging to LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and protestors”, with a judicial commission appointed where required. “Persons killed in the incidents of October 1 and 2, 2025 shall be compensated with monetary benefits equivalent to LEAs,” the pact read, adding that gunshot injuries would be compensated with Rs1 million per person, while a government job would be granted to one of the family members of each dead person within 20 days. Chaudhry, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, Interprovincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, former adviser to prime minister on Kashmir affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-AJK president Masood Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf were part of the government’s negotiating team. From the AJK government’s side, Education Minister Diwan Ali Chugtai and Local Government Minister Faisal Rathore took part in the talks, according to a copy of the signed pact shared by Chaudhry. Raja Amjad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir and Anjum Zaman Awan represented the JAAC. On September 25, a deadlock emerged between the AJK government and the JAAC over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir. Subsequently, a shutter-down strike had paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continued for the acceptance of its 38-point charter of demands . Conspiracies now stand buried as issues resolved amicably: PM Shehbaz Welcoming the agreement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement said “all conspiracies and rumours now stand buried and issues have been resolved amicably”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported . He appreciated the members of the federal government’s negotiation committee and the JAAC for signing the pact to “settle all issues”. Terming it an achievement for Pakistan and AJK, the premier said the “restoration of peace and normalcy is a good gesture”, the report added. PM Shehbaz asserted that the government “is ever ready to resolve issues of Kashmiri brethren as public interest and service are among our top priorities”. He appealed to Kashmiris not to pay heed to rumours, affirming that the government had “always protected” their rights and will also ensure them in the future. On Thursday, PM Shehbaz had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues. ‘Pakistan, AJK & democracy wins’: Ahsan Iqbal Iqbal also welcomed the development, writing on X: “Pakistan, AJK and democracy wins.” He stressed that the people of AJK had “always stood at the frontlines of Pakistan’s national cause, and their voice carries immense weight”. Noting that the nation “saw a difficult situation emerge due to legitimate public concerns”, the planning minister commended the “wisdom of local and national leadership and the spirit of dialogue that enabled us to resolve this stand-off peacefully, without violence, without division, and with mutual respect”. He highlighted that the resolution of the issue showed that “when the government listens, and when the people engage constructively, we can find solutions together”. “The Joint Action Committee raised voice of citizens, and the government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took these voices seriously. Instead of confrontation, we chose consultation. Instead of egos, we chose empathy. We commit to work together for good governance and development in AJK,” Iqbal added.",

      "title_en": "Conspiracy by ‘ill-wishers’ failed in AJK following govt-JAAC agreement: minister",
      "summary_en": "Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Saturday that the conspiracy hatched by the ill-wishers of Pakistan has failed in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the government will fully implement the commitments it has made with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC). “The scenes that Pakistan’s ill-wishers wanted to see, the unrest, chaos and disorder in AJK, their conspiracy has failed. The federal government will fully implement the commitments it has made, and with the 15-day mechanism that has been established, I am confident that there will be no further opportunity for such grievances to arise again,” said the minister while addressing a press conference following the agreement between the two sides. Iqbal was accompanied by Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam and PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira. The signing of the agreement comes after two rounds of talks between the high-level government delegation and the JAAC in as many days. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Since then, rival groups since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. Iqbal added that following the successful conclusion of talks between the two sides, peace has been restored in the region. Iqbal expressed satisfaction over the dialogue process and said it was “conducted keeping in view the interests of the people of Azad Kashmir and the interests of Pakistan”. Acknowledging administrative weaknesses, the minister said government organs should be more responsive. “The people are now more aware, the media has made them more informed and their expectations have increased greatly.” Kaira said following the agreement, the people of AJK “breathed a sigh of relief today” and added that the mechanism established must succeed as “we have no other option other than to ensure its success”. A high-level federal government delegation earlier today signed an agreement with JAAC to end days of unrest in AJK, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying that “all issues have been resolved amicably”. A day earlier, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said it was “deeply alarmed“ by the ongoing violence in AJK, and condemned the “use of excessive force” and the communications blackout. In a post on social media platform X during the early hours of Saturday following day-long talks, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said — who was part of the government negotiating committee — said: “Our negotiation delegation has signed on a final agreement with the AJK Joint Action Committee. The protesters are returning to their homes. All roads have reopened.” “This is a victory of peace. Long live Azad Kashmir,” the minister added. Chaudhry also shared a copy of the pact on X, which listed 12 “decisions” taken and 13 “additional points”. Under the agreement, it was decided that first information reports (FIRs) would be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on the “incidents of violence and vandalism resulting into deaths of personnel belonging to LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and protestors”, with a judicial commission appointed where required. “Persons killed in the incidents of October 1 and 2, 2025 shall be compensated with monetary benefits equivalent to LEAs,” the pact read, adding that gunshot injuries would be compensated with Rs1 million per person, while a government job would be granted to one of the family members of each dead person within 20 days. Chaudhry, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, Interprovincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, former adviser to prime minister on Kashmir affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-AJK president Masood Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf were part of the government’s negotiating team.

      "title_orig": "PPP assails Punjab CM’s remarks on canals issue as violation of CCI decision",
      "summary_orig": "PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro on Saturday assailed Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks regarding the contentious canals issue as a violation of the decision made by the Council of Common Interests (CCI). The war of words between the two sides, that kicked off over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP had lawmakers stay away from parliamentary proceedings to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad on Wednesday to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces. However, she declared a day ago that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47. In a statement issued today, the PPP leader said her remarks regarding the controversial canal project were a “violation of the CCI’s decision and an insult to the constitutional forum”. The party demanded that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif take notice of her remarks and clarify the party’s policy. It also demanded that the Punjab government disclose the aid provided to flood victims. The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. “The CCI, a constitutional forum, has already rejected and buried the controversial canal project,” reiterated the PPP leader. “Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz is not above the CCI’s constitutional forum, and Maryam Nawaz holds no standing alone against the CCI.” He said it was the CCI’s unanimous decision that no canal project would be built until all provinces agreed, adding that Sindh would not accept the project under any circumstances. Khuhro further said that Maryam was violating the forum’s decision and insulting it with her remarks about the project, adding that she “lacks political wisdom”, which is why she was criticising a constitutional forum. He said Nawaz was the PML-N’s leader and should take notice of his daughter’s remarks and clarify the party’s stance on the issue. “Sindh will not allow anyone to plunder the water of its Indus River, nor will it allow any dam to be built on the Indus River. “Constitutionally, the province of Sindh, being at the tail end, has the first right to water, and any attack on Sindh’s water share will be considered an attack on the unity of Sindh and the country.” He further alleged that CM Maryam was “frightened by the growing popularity” of the PPP in Punjab, which is why she was opposing the process of providing relief to flood victims through the Benazir Income Support Programme. “Punjab is not the fiefdom of any single party; the PPP, along with every political party, has the right to engage in political activities in Punjab.” Criticising her administration’s flood relief and rescue efforts, he added her “hollow claims” about her performance are “limited to TV channels only” and stood “exposed”. “Punjab’s flood victims are still waiting and yearning for aid and relief.” “If the Punjab CM is providing complete relief and aid to flood victims, she should disclose it to the nation,” he said. US commits $1m to Unicef flood response Meanwhile, a press release from Uncief issued a day ago said the United States has committed $1 million to support the organisation’s emergency response for children and families affected by the recent floods in Pakistan. Unicef said it would reach over 65,000 people, including pregnant women and children, with life-saving nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene support through the contribution. It explained that it would screen 32,500 children for malnutrition, provide treatment to 2,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition and deliver multi-micronutrient supplements to 32,500 children and 32,500 pregnant and breastfeeding women and caregivers. Furthermore, over 50,000 people would gain access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, including restoration of damaged water systems, installation of temporary toilets, and distribution of hygiene kits. “Children are always the most vulnerable in emergencies, facing the compounded threats of malnutrition and deadly waterborne diseases. This timely support from the United States enables us to deliver life-saving services and help restore dignity and hope to families who have suffered loss and displacement, as they begin the difficult journey of recovery,” the press release quoted Pernille Ironside, Unicef representative in Pakistan, as saying.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country will “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) comes in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in such a case. “In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint.” Indian media outlet NDTV reported a day ago that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion. The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed , without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said : “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.” In its statement today, the ISPR said that this time, “we shall shatter the myth of geographic immunity, hitting the farthest reaches of the Indian territory. “As for the talk of erasing Pakistan from the map, India must know that if the situation comes, the erasure will be mutual.” It added that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”. The military’s media wing warned that the nation and military had the “capability and resolve to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy’s territory” in the face of unwarranted threats and reckless aggression. The ISPR further said the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”. It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia. “For decades, India has benefitted from playing the victim card and painting Pakistan in negative light, while stoking violence and perpetrating terrorism in South Asia and beyond.” The military’s media wing added that India’s narrative has been sufficiently debunked and “now the world recognises India as the true face of cross-border terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability”. “Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war.  However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.” The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale . New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command, that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India. The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army. The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.",

      "summary_orig": "The death toll in an Indonesian school collapse rose to 17 on Saturday, officials said, as rescuers deployed heavy machinery to recover dozens more victims believed still buried under the rubble. Part of the multi-storey boarding school collapsed suddenly on Monday as students gathered for afternoon prayers. Rescuers retrieved two bodies and a body part from the rubble today, bringing the death toll to 17, National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) operation director Yudhi Bramantyo said in a statement. “The evacuation process is still ongoing. Debris removal is focused to the north side in an area not integrated with the main structure,” Yudhi said. Local search and rescue agency head Nanang Sigit confirmed the updated toll in a separate statement. Earlier today, authorities said they had recovered nine bodies on Friday. Rescuers were searching for 49 people still missing, National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) chief Suharyanto said before prior to the retrieval of the latest bodies. More victims could be found, said Suharyanto, who, like many Indonesians, only goes by one name, as rescuers brought heavy machinery to clear locations where the victims were believed to be buried underneath the rubble. “After the last victim was found last night, we are focusing on a massive cleanup, with heavy equipment entering the collapsed areas,” he said, as reported by broadcaster Kompas TV . The school collapse was so violent that it sent tremors across the neighbourhood, according to residents. Investigators have been looking into the cause of the collapse, but initial signs pointed to substandard construction, experts have said. The rescue operation was complex because vibrations in one place could affect other areas, officials said. But the families of the missing agreed on Thursday for heavy equipment to be used, after the 72-hour “golden period” for the best chance of survival came to an end. The rescue operation was complicated by an earthquake that struck overnight on Tuesday, briefly halting the search.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Saturday that it would resume flights to the United Kingdom from October 25, with nonstop flights from Manchester to Islamabad. This comes a day after the Pakistan High Commission in London announced that the national carrier would resume flight operations to the UK this month as PIA received its Foreign Aircraft Operating Permit from the UK Civil Aviation Authority and Third Country Operator approval , but no exact date was given. PIA announced its “historic return” to British skies with a post on X today, which read: “The wait is finally over! Pakistan International Airlines proudly reconnects Manchester and Islamabad, bringing loved ones closer once again.” In yesterday’s announcement, the high commission said flight operations to Manchester would be resumed during the first phase, after which Birmingham and London would follow suit. In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. The national carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”. The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday lauded the security forces for eliminating more than 14 terrorists in Khuzdar district. Earlier, a statement issued on X by state broadcaster PTV News said security forces “foiled an attempt to harass peaceful people in the Zehri area” of the district and destroyed multiple terrorist hideouts during an operation while killing over 14 Fitna al-Hindustan members and injuring over 20. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. Congratulating the security forces, Naqvi hailed the operation as a “major success”, saying that the nation was “proud of the professional capabilities and courage of the security forces”. He further said: “Security forces are determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists in Balochistan. The people of Balochistan stand with the security forces. Indian-sponsored terrorists will not be allowed to hide anywhere.” Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also said operational successes such as the above were “proof that the people of Balochistan and the forces are together grinding the nefarious designs of the country’s enemies into the dust. I am proud of the bravery of my youth and people. Long live Pakistan!” Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakistan and Balochistan. A day ago, security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the province’s Sherani district. On Wednesday, four terrorists were apprehended during an IBO in Khuzdar district.",

Speaking on Dawn News TV’s programme ‘Doosra Rukh with Nadir Guramani’ on Friday, Barrister Aqeel Malik said: “Investigations are underway [into who is operating PTI founder’s X account].“ “Evidence and further material will come forward, and that will disclose where the account’s links are and who is running it,” the state minister added. “At this moment, all I can say is that there is definitely an [the authorities’] engagement with X. Along with this, I believe that the legal process which is being adopted in this investigation [and] its results will also be before you very soon.” Imran was recently quizzed in prison by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials about his “anti-state” tweets, critical remarks on foreign policy and other topics, according to a post on his official X account. Although Imran does not have access to his X account in prison, the detailed statement disclosed the five key areas of questioning and his responses. The PTI founder has repeatedly been quizzed about his social media postings, and he has previously refused to answer any questions without his lawyers present. That was also the first time that such an account of a questioning by law enforcement personnel was posted to his official X account. It may be noted that Imran does not have access to the internet in jail and his X account is operated by someone else. Last month, a petition was filed in the Islamabad High Court challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment. The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.",

      "summary_orig": "• Foreign minister distances Islamabad from 20-point plan by White House; insists Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remains ‘unchanged’ • Says several states eyeing Saudi-style defence pacts; claims controversial ‘speechwriter’ was not part of ‘official UN team’ • Return of flotilla activists being negotiated through ‘European country’ in absence of ties with Tel Aviv ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the United States was now “the only hope” after the United Nations, European Union and Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) had failed to secure peace in Gaza. Making a policy statement in the National Assembly, Mr Dar again distanced the government from US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza “peace plan” , saying it differed from a draft jointly prepared by eight Muslim countries and shared with Washington. He said the prime minister’s initial statement welcoming the plan was issued while in transit, while he was “unaware of the changes”. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine is what was the policy of the Quaid-i-Azam. There was no change, there is no change and there will be no change in it,” he assured the House. Reiterating the country’s consistent and principled position, he said that the two-state solution was the only viable path to a just and lasting peace, through the establishment of a contiguous, independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Mr Dar also disclosed that several Arab and non-Arab countries had exp­ressed interest in concluding security agreements with Pakistan, along the lines of the recent ‘strategic mutual defence’ pact with Saudi Arabia . He cautioned, however, that decisions on such requests would “take some time”. He said several foreign ministers had raised the proposal with him on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He likened multiple countries signing bilateral pacts with Pakistan to the formation of an “eastern Nato”, without explaining how separate arrangements could evolve into a multilateral bloc. “It is my faith that Pakistan will one day lead the Islamic ummah,” he said. “Allah Almighty has made you a nuclear and missile power and now you are to become an economic power,” adding that this would require unity. He said talks on the Saudi agreement had been underway for about one and a half years, beginning during the PDM government. “We are fortunate to have been included among the defenders of Haramain Sharifain,” he remarked. He also read out the joint statement, issued alongside seven other Muslim countries following consultations in New York, which called for unrestricted humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of Palestinians, full Israeli withdrawal, reconstruction of Gaza and a credible path to a two-state peace with Gaza fully integrated with the West Bank. He said the focus would remain on these objectives, including holding Israel accountable, and noted that the Pales­tinian Authority had accepted the plan. Responding to opposition questions about British-Pakistani activist Shama Junejo’s presence at UN-related events in New York, Mr Dar clarified she was not part of the official government delegation. “Her involvement was confined to civil society interactions and did not reflect state policy,” he said. Flotilla Mr Dar also briefed the House on Pakistanis aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla seized by Israeli forces, condemning the interception as a violation of international maritime law and humanitarian principles. He said Islamabad was pursuing diplomatic channels, including through an “influential European country”, to secure their safe return. Israel on Friday deported four Italian activists, the first of hundreds detained from the aid flotilla, shortly after the interception of the group’s final boat brought an end to its mission. The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail last month, ferrying politicians and activists including former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg towards Gaza. The Israeli navy began intercepting the boats on Wednesday, and an Israeli official said the following day that boats with more than 400 people on board had been prevented from reaching the Palestinian territory. The military said on Friday that the navy had stopped all 42 of the fleet’s vessels “in an operation that lasted approximately 12 hours”, and transferred flotilla members to Israel’s Ashdod Port for processing by police. Israel’s foreign ministry said it deported four Italian activists who were aboard the flotilla, adding that “the rest are in the process of being deported”. Videos circulating on social media showed far-right Israeli Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir taunting activists from the Global Sumud Flotilla, as they were in Israeli custody. Videos showed him pointing at the detained activists, and calling them “terrorists.” The International Committee to Break the Siege on Gaza condemned his actions, saying that it was not surprising “for the criminals of genocide to send their minister swaggering before activists from 50 countries around the world, surrounded by his guards”. PM asked to apologise Earlier, PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser demanded that the prime minister apologise for “hurting public sentiments” on Palestine, saying no decision would be acceptable without the will of the Palestinian people. He said Haramain Sharifain were central to Pakistanis’ beliefs and that the nation would stand united for their defence. “If anyone dares to cast an evil eye towards the Haramain, the entire Pakistani nation will stand united in their defence,” he said. He criticised the government for failing to take parliament into confidence on key national decisions. The PTI leader stated that Mr Dar’s clarification regarding Shama Junejo had raised further questions. He said the foreign minister had admitted she was the prime minister’s speechwriter and therefore responsibility rested with the premier. Commenting on the recent “Trump peace deal”, Mr Qaiser said no Muslim leader had endorsed the agreement, yet Pakistan’s prime minister, “in a display of sycophancy”, acknowledged an incomplete agreement through a tweet. “If the deal was so good, why did the Palestinians reject it?” he asked. He noted that over 60,000 innocent Pale­stinians had been martyred in a brutal campaign of genocide, the likes of which the world had rarely witnessed. Mr Qaiser categorically stated that Pakistan’s 250 million people would never accept recognition of Israel. “Any peace accord is incomplete without the recognition of an independent Palestinian state, with Al-Quds as its capital,” he asserted.
