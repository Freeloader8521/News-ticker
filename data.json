      "title_orig": "TTAP to stage sit-in outside Parliament House after Friday prayers following revelations about Imran’s vision loss",
      "summary_orig": "The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Thursday said that it would stage a sit-in outside Parliament on Friday. The development came hours after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting a strong response from the PTI. The information was shared in a report submitted to the SC by PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who quoted the PTI founder as telling him that “he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”. Videos shared by the TTAP on the social media platform X on Thursday night showed Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas speaking to the media alongside the PTI leadership. “After Friday prayers, we will stage a sit-in outside Parliament,” he said. “We demand that Khan sahib be given full access to doctors whom he trusts,” he said. “I am told that Imran’s personal physician, Dr Asim Yusuf, is at Shifa Hospital, as are Dr Amir Awan and Dr Mazhar Ishaq; these are the two top specialists in Rawalpindi,” Abbas said. “We can trust them, so we demand that he (Imran) be shifted immediately and provided the right treatment,” he added. “He (Imran) was in the custody of the government, and his medical care and access to doctors were their responsibility,” he asserted. TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai said that the opposition would present their demands at tomorrow’s sit-in. “Our demand is just, and nobody will use abusive language or say hurtful things,” he vowed. “Only courteous and respectful language will be allowed.” “Only God knows how long we will sit there, and we promise not to stand up,” Achakzai stated, inviting those who opposed injustice to join them. In a post on X, he reiterated the same, saying, “A peaceful protest sit-in will begin outside the Parliament house from tomorrow. “We will present our demands during tomorrow’s sit-in, and the sit-in will continue until the demands are accepted. If, God forbid, something goes wrong in accepting the demands, the government will be responsible,” he said. ‘State has committed a crime against Imran’ Earlier in the day, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, alongside Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, spoke to the media outside the SC. “A crime has been committed against Imran Khan, and this state has committed this crime,” Raja contended. The PTI secretary general further stated that the “face of this crime is Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. We will not forget this name”. Anjum has served as the jail superintendent at the Adiala jail, where Imran is imprisoned. Safdar told the court on Thursday that according to jail staff, he was transferred on Jan 16, being replaced by Sajid Baig. The PTI secretary general said it was difficult for him to control his emotions after reading the report. Raja said the pain in Imran’s eye began in November, and “sometime in December, he completely lost vision in his right eye”. “Yet Imran was only given drops meant to treat irritation in the eye. He was not taken to hospital, and a qualified doctor to treat eye ailments was also not called. Instead, prison doctors kept giving him eye drops as Imran continued to complain that the pain in his eye was not subsiding,” he alleged. Raja further claimed: “When the situation worsened, Ghafoor Anjum was immediately replaced on January 16. The new administrator who replaced him also wasted 10 days before a doctor from Pims, Dr Arif, was called [to the Adiala jail] on January 26.” The PTI secretary general said Dr Arif, after examining Imran’s eye, advised that he should immediately be taken to the hospital. The former premier was administered treatment , including an injection, at the Pims hospital in Islamabad. “The word used [in the report for Imran’s ailment] is occlusion of the retina,” Raja said, adding that Imran was quoted as saying that after treatment at the hospital, he regained 10pc-15pc vision in his right eye. “He is able to detect light through that eye, but he has not [fully] regained his vision.” “This is a very painful and terrifying situation,” he said, adding that they had no information about what medical condition was affecting Imran’s vision. He stressed the need for Imran’s medical examination at the earliest by doctors trusted by the PTI founder, family and public. “The ongoing situation is unacceptable,” he asserted. Pointing out that there were no doctors in Pims to treat ailments pertaining to the retina while Shifa International in Islamabad had two such doctors, he alleged that they were “deliberately” not asked to examine and treat Imran. “So, several people are involved in the crime that has been committed against Imran. All of those names will be revealed; we will not hide any of them. Khan sahib has himself identified one of them, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. A case will be filed against him immediately.” Raja further alleged that the “Islamabad High Court is also involved” in this matter, questioning why Imran’s cases were not being fixed for hearing. Meanwhile, “the condition of one of the eyes of the biggest leader of this nation is very concerning, and we have no information about his overall health condition”. Despite this, Raja continued, Imran had directed his party to approach the courts. “We will not spare these courts. This nation and history will avenge the crime committed by these courts,” he said, demanding that Imran’s cases be fixed for hearing. He also asserted that no reason was left to keep Imran behind bars and “freedom is his right now”. “He will get freedom and this nation will get him freedom. We will fight his case inside and outside courts,” Raja said. Imran’s sister, Aleema, said that the report had shattered her heart. “We haven’t done enough for a person who has been in jail for two-and-a-half years,” she said. She said that the jail authorities knew about Imran’s health but failed to arrange adequate treatment for him. “Imran Khan is in jail because our judiciary is not free,” she asserted. Speaking to the media later in the day, CM Afridi said that they had “options” and they were considering them. He announced that PTI’s core committee, political committee and TTAP leaders were set to meet later in the day to deliberate over those options. The KP CM recalled that it had been over 900 days since Imran’s incarceration, but he had “never complained” about his health. But now, he said, “We have called you and are doing our second press conference, which means that this is serious.” “God forbids. If there were an irreversible loss, then there would be no use in raising our voices,” Afridi stated, adding that the PTI would take some “serious” steps. Afridi branded the jail authorities’ negligence of Imran’s worsening eye condition a “criminal act”. “It violates human rights, the law, the Constitution, jail manuals and is just inhumane,” the chief minister stated. “When [former premier] Nawaz Sharif experienced health issues, the judiciary and our media fraternity collectively raised their voices, even though we knew that the tests or condition were false,” he added, recounting that despite this, the PML-N supremo was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment. “This man is a former premier and the chairman of the country’s largest political party. He is in pain right now and has serious issues,” he stressed. “We have to rise above politics and, on humanitarian and legal grounds, raise our voices for him,” he said. Senate opposition leader demands formation of medical board Abbas said in a post on X earlier in the day that he was “formally sending the full details of this matter, evidence and timeline to all national and international human rights organisations and ambassadors stationed in Pakistan so that they might take notice of this grave situation”. In the post, which quoted his address to the Senate, the TTAP vice chairman demanded that an “independent and transparent medical board be immediately formed, the complete medical records made public, and those responsible be identified and action taken in accordance with the law”. Lamenting that “timely and effective treatment was not provided”, Abbas also recalled that the nation was “constantly given the impression that he was completely healthy and had no problems”. “If Imran Khan had been allowed regular meetings with his family, if medical examinations had been transparent and reports had been made public, then perhaps this would not have come to this,” he said. Emphasising that the state was responsible for the life and health of any person in custody, Abbas stated: “Political disagreements have their place, but denying human rights and basic medical care is unacceptable in any civilised society. “Delaying treatment, withholding information, and limiting access to family were not only inhumane but also a shirking of constitutional and legal obligations,” he contended. “This was not just a matter of an individual; it is a matter of principle,” the TTAP leader asserted. “If a former prime minister and a popular public leader of the country can be treated like this today, to what extent are the rights of an ordinary citizen protected?” he questioned. “The state has a responsibility not to let political differences prevail over human dignity and fundamental rights,” Abbas noted. TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar wrote on X: “For months in a row Imran Khan kept on complaining about loss of vision in his right eye but was denied prompt medical attention. “This is not negligence. This is torture; cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment,” alleged Khokhar. He highlighted that Pakistan was party to the United Nations’ rules on treatment of prisoners — also known as the “ Nelson Mandela Rules ” – and of the UN Convention Against Torture . Khokhar, who is also a lawyer, argued that these rules “clearly prohibit such treatment” as meted out to Imran. ‘Not a matter to be trivialised’ Separately, in an official statement on the matter, the PTI expressed “profound concern and deep anguish” over the report detailing Imran’s health. “We strongly condemn the treatment meted out to Imran Khan, particularly with regard to the serious deterioration of his eyesight,” the party said on social media platform X. “The report has laid before the nation facts that are sufficient to shake the conscience of every Pakistani,” it asserted. The PTI claimed that the jail authorities limited Imran’s treatment to basic eye drops during the last three to four months, while “denying access to his personal physicians”. “This constitutes a grave and inexcusable act of negligence. It is not merely a medical lapse; it amounts to playing with his life and health,” the party stated. It further said there would be “no compromise” on Imran’s health and rights. The PTI declared: “We will raise our voice against this injustice at every constitutional, legal, public, and international forum available to us. Should our legitimate demands remain unmet, we reserve the right to initiate a public movement. “Imran Khan’s health is not a matter to be trivialised. Any further negligence may provoke a severe public reaction.” “When the eyesight of a leader of such national and international stature is at stake, every possible transparent and independent medical facility must be provided immediately,” the PTI demanded. “Any harm inflicted upon Imran Khan’s health will be accounted for,” the PTI warned, asserting that it reserved the right to initiate legal proceedings against Anjum, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab prisons inspector general, the provincial prisons minister and “other responsible officials”. While noting the SC’s directives regarding a medical team and contact with his sons, the PTI lamented that the “rejection of the request for a family member to be present during the medical examination, and the continued restriction or conditional provision of other basic facilities, is deeply disappointing”. The party demanded that the ex-prime minister be granted “immediate and unrestricted access to his personal physicians and that, for specialised eye treatment, he be transferred without delay to a reputable hospital recommended by his medical team”. Stressing that unhindered access to his legal counsel and the full restoration of family visitation rights were his fundamental rights, the PTI said, “To deprive him of these rights is tantamount to trampling upon justice and violating established international norms.” The PTI urged international human rights organisations and global institutions to “take notice of the treatment being meted out” to Imran. “A former elected prime minister facing prolonged solitary confinement, restricted medical facilities, and impediments to family and legal contact raises serious concerns under universally recognised human rights standards, and falls within the ambit of mental and medical torture,” the PTI alleged. It also called upon the Pakistani media “not to treat this matter merely as a political dispute, but to highlight it as a serious human rights issue”. In a separate post on X, the PTI said the report submitted to the SC itself mentions “rapid vision loss, visible distress, lack of full medical transparency, and restricted independent access” for the party founder. “These aren’t social media claims. They are documented concerns,” the party contended. It added: “A former prime minister in state custody is dealing with serious health deterioration while basic transparency remains a question. When someone is imprisoned, their health becomes the responsibility of those in power. Period.” The party emphasised that this was not about politics anymore. “It’s about whether power is being used responsibly or ruthlessly,” it stated. “You can disagree with a man. You cannot gamble with his health.” ‘Inhumane treatment’ PTI leader and former minister Hammad Azhar pointed out that Imran’s right eye was left with 15pc vision because he “was not provided timely medical treatment”. “This stinking non-democratic, non-elected, and fascist system is the worst period in Pakistan’s history,” he said on X. PTI’s Omar Ayub demanded that jail officials Anjum and Baig be “sacked by the Supreme Court”, further calling for the initiation of criminal proceedings against them. “PM Imran Khan’s right eye vision deteriorated because of these personnel’s callous attitude. Shahbaz Sharif, Mohsin Naqvi and Maryam Nawaz are responsible as well as the establishment,” the former National Assembly opposition leader alleged in a post on X. He further stated, “It is time for some serious introspection by the Supreme Court. Justice delayed, is justice denied. Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi should have acted sooner. PM Imran Khan’s vision in his right eye could have been saved.” Ayub stressed that Imran should have access to an ophthalmologist with the requisite expertise and his family physician should be given unhindered access to him as well. PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh termed the report about his party founder “heart-wrenching and sad”. “The nation is in deep sorrow and grief today. We demand that Imran Khan be released immediately after providing complete and transparent medical facilities,” he said. Former KP CM and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur emphasised that Imran’s “health is the most important concern of every Pakistani”. “Proper treatment via his personal medical teams should be ensured,” he demanded. “Denying proper medical treatment to a former prime minister and Pakistan’s most popular leader is purely evil. Every Pakistani here and overseas condemns this fascist approach,” he asserted. Moonis Elahi, the son of former Punjab CM and PTI leader Parvez Elahi, posted on X saying that the damage to Imran’s eye was a “result of his inhumane and vindictive treatment of the leader in jail”. “The nation will neither forget nor forgive,” he said.",

He is in pain right now and has serious issues,” he stressed. “We have to rise above politics and, on humanitarian and legal grounds, raise our voices for him,” he said. Senate opposition leader demands formation of medical board Abbas said in a post on X earlier in the day that he was “formally sending the full details of this matter, evidence and timeline to all national and international human rights organisations and ambassadors stationed in Pakistan so that they might take notice of this grave situation”. In the post, which quoted his address to the Senate, the TTAP vice chairman demanded that an “independent and transparent medical board be immediately formed, the complete medical records made public, and those responsible be identified and action taken in accordance with the law”. Lamenting that “timely and effective treatment was not provided”, Abbas also recalled that the nation was “constantly given the impression that he was completely healthy and had no problems”. “If Imran Khan had been allowed regular meetings with his family, if medical examinations had been transparent and reports had been made public, then perhaps this would not have come to this,” he said. Emphasising that the state was responsible for the life and health of any person in custody, Abbas stated: “Political disagreements have their place, but denying human rights and basic medical care is unacceptable in any civilised society. “Delaying treatment, withholding information, and limiting access to family were not only inhumane but also a shirking of constitutional and legal obligations,” he contended. “This was not just a matter of an individual; it is a matter of principle,” the TTAP leader asserted. “If a former prime minister and a popular public leader of the country can be treated like this today, to what extent are the rights of an ordinary citizen protected?” he questioned. “The state has a responsibility not to let political differences prevail over human dignity and fundamental rights,” Abbas noted. TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar wrote on X: “For months in a row Imran Khan kept on complaining about loss of vision in his right eye but was denied prompt medical attention. “This is not negligence. This is torture; cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment,” alleged Khokhar. He highlighted that Pakistan was party to the United Nations’ rules on treatment of prisoners — also known as the “ Nelson Mandela Rules ” – and of the UN Convention Against Torture . Khokhar, who is also a lawyer, argued that these rules “clearly prohibit such treatment” as meted out to Imran. ‘Not a matter to be trivialised’ Separately, in an official statement on the matter, the PTI expressed “profound concern and deep anguish” over the report detailing Imran’s health. “We strongly condemn the treatment meted out to Imran Khan, particularly with regard to the serious deterioration of his eyesight,” the party said on social media platform X. “The report has laid before the nation facts that are sufficient to shake the conscience of every Pakistani,” it asserted. The PTI claimed that the jail authorities limited Imran’s treatment to basic eye drops during the last three to four months, while “denying access to his personal physicians”. “This constitutes a grave and inexcusable act of negligence. It is not merely a medical lapse; it amounts to playing with his life and health,” the party stated. It further said there would be “no compromise” on Imran’s health and rights. The PTI declared: “We will raise our voice against this injustice at every constitutional, legal, public, and international forum available to us. Should our legitimate demands remain unmet, we reserve the right to initiate a public movement. “Imran Khan’s health is not a matter to be trivialised. Any further negligence may provoke a severe public reaction.” “When the eyesight of a leader of such national and international stature is at stake, every possible transparent and independent medical facility must be provided immediately,” the PTI demanded. “Any harm inflicted upon Imran Khan’s health will be accounted for,” the PTI warned, asserting that it reserved the right to initiate legal proceedings against Anjum, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab prisons inspector general, the provincial prisons minister and “other responsible officials”. While noting the SC’s directives regarding a medical team and contact with his sons, the PTI lamented that the “rejection of the request for a family member to be present during the medical examination, and the continued restriction or conditional provision of other basic facilities, is deeply disappointing”. The party demanded that the ex-prime minister be granted “immediate and unrestricted access to his personal physicians and that, for specialised eye treatment, he be transferred without delay to a reputable hospital recommended by his medical team”. Stressing that unhindered access to his legal counsel and the full restoration of family visitation rights were his fundamental rights, the PTI said, “To deprive him of these rights is tantamount to trampling upon justice and violating established international norms.” The PTI urged international human rights organisations and global institutions to “take notice of the treatment being meted out” to Imran. “A former elected prime minister facing prolonged solitary confinement, restricted medical facilities, and impediments to family and legal contact raises serious concerns under universally recognised human rights standards, and falls within the ambit of mental and medical torture,” the PTI alleged. It also called upon the Pakistani media “not to treat this matter merely as a political dispute, but to highlight it as a serious human rights issue”. In a separate post on X, the PTI said the report submitted to the SC itself mentions “rapid vision loss, visible distress, lack of full medical transparency, and restricted independent access” for the party founder. “These aren’t social media claims. They are documented concerns,” the party contended. It added: “A former prime minister in state custody is dealing with serious health deterioration while basic transparency remains a question. When someone is imprisoned, their health becomes the responsibility of those in power. Period.” The party emphasised that this was not about politics anymore. “It’s about whether power is being used responsibly or ruthlessly,” it stated. “You can disagree with a man. You cannot gamble with his health.” ‘Inhumane treatment’ PTI leader and former minister Hammad Azhar pointed out that Imran’s right eye was left with 15pc vision because he “was not provided timely medical treatment”. “This stinking non-democratic, non-elected, and fascist system is the worst period in Pakistan’s history,” he said on X. PTI’s Omar Ayub demanded that jail officials Anjum and Baig be “sacked by the Supreme Court”, further calling for the initiation of criminal proceedings against them. “PM Imran Khan’s right eye vision deteriorated because of these personnel’s callous attitude. Shahbaz Sharif, Mohsin Naqvi and Maryam Nawaz are responsible as well as the establishment,” the former National Assembly opposition leader alleged in a post on X. He further stated, “It is time for some serious introspection by the Supreme Court. Justice delayed, is justice denied. Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi should have acted sooner. PM Imran Khan’s vision in his right eye could have been saved.” Ayub stressed that Imran should have access to an ophthalmologist with the requisite expertise and his family physician should be given unhindered access to him as well. PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh termed the report about his party founder “heart-wrenching and sad”. “The nation is in deep sorrow and grief today. We demand that Imran Khan be released immediately after providing complete and transparent medical facilities,” he said. Former KP CM and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur emphasised that Imran’s “health is the most important concern of every Pakistani”. “Proper treatment via his personal medical teams should be ensured,” he demanded. “Denying proper medical treatment to a former prime minister and Pakistan’s most popular leader is purely evil. Every Pakistani here and overseas condemns this fascist approach,” he asserted. Moonis Elahi, the son of former Punjab CM and PTI leader Parvez Elahi, posted on X saying that the damage to Imran’s eye was a “result of his inhumane and vindictive treatment of the leader in jail”. “The nation will neither forget nor forgive,” he said.",
      "title": "TTAP to stage sit-in outside Parliament House after Friday prayers following revelations about Imran’s vision loss",
      "summary": "The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Thursday said that it would stage a sit-in outside Parliament on Friday. The development came hours after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting a strong response from the PTI. The information was shared in a report submitted to the SC by PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who quoted the PTI founder as telling him that “he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”. Videos shared by the TTAP on the social media platform X on Thursday night showed Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas speaking to the media alongside the PTI leadership. “After Friday prayers, we will stage a sit-in outside Parliament,” he said. “We demand that Khan sahib be given full access to doctors whom he trusts,” he said. “I am told that Imran’s personal physician, Dr Asim Yusuf, is at Shifa Hospital, as are Dr Amir Awan and Dr Mazhar Ishaq; these are the two top specialists in Rawalpindi,” Abbas said. “We can trust them, so we demand that he (Imran) be shifted immediately and provided the right treatment,” he added. “He (Imran) was in the custody of the government, and his medical care and access to doctors were their responsibility,” he asserted. TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai said that the opposition would present their demands at tomorrow’s sit-in. “Our demand is just, and nobody will use abusive language or say hurtful things,” he vowed. “Only courteous and respectful language will be allowed.” “Only God knows how long we will sit there, and we promise not to stand up,” Achakzai stated, inviting those who opposed injustice to join them. In a post on X, he reiterated the same, saying, “A peaceful protest sit-in will begin outside the Parliament house from tomorrow. “We will present our demands during tomorrow’s sit-in, and the sit-in will continue until the demands are accepted. If, God forbid, something goes wrong in accepting the demands, the government will be responsible,” he said. ‘State has committed a crime against Imran’ Earlier in the day, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, alongside Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, spoke to the media outside the SC. “A crime has been committed against Imran Khan, and this state has committed this crime,” Raja contended. The PTI secretary general further stated that the “face of this crime is Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. We will not forget this name”. Anjum has served as the jail superintendent at the Adiala jail, where Imran is imprisoned. Safdar told the court on Thursday that according to jail staff, he was transferred on Jan 16, being replaced by Sajid Baig. The PTI secretary general said it was difficult for him to control his emotions after reading the report. Raja said the pain in Imran’s eye began in November, and “sometime in December, he completely lost vision in his right eye”. “Yet Imran was only given drops meant to treat irritation in the eye. He was not taken to hospital, and a qualified doctor to treat eye ailments was also not called. Instead, prison doctors kept giving him eye drops as Imran continued to complain that the pain in his eye was not subsiding,” he alleged. Raja further claimed: “When the situation worsened, Ghafoor Anjum was immediately replaced on January 16. The new administrator who replaced him also wasted 10 days before a doctor from Pims, Dr Arif, was called [to the Adiala jail] on January 26.” The PTI secretary general said Dr Arif, after examining Imran’s eye, advised that he should immediately be taken to the hospital. The former premier was administered treatment , including an injection, at the Pims hospital in Islamabad. “The word used [in the report for Imran’s ailment] is occlusion of the retina,” Raja said, adding that Imran was quoted as saying that after treatment at the hospital, he regained 10pc-15pc vision in his right eye. “He is able to detect light through that eye, but he has not [fully] regained his vision.” “This is a very painful and terrifying situation,” he said, adding that they had no information about what medical condition was affecting Imran’s vision. He stressed the need for Imran’s medical examination at the earliest by doctors trusted by the PTI founder, family and public. “The ongoing situation is unacceptable,” he asserted. Pointing out that there were no doctors in Pims to treat ailments pertaining to the retina while Shifa International in Islamabad had two such doctors, he alleged that they were “deliberately” not asked to examine and treat Imran. “So, several people are involved in the crime that has been committed against Imran. All of those names will be revealed; we will not hide any of them. Khan sahib has himself identified one of them, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. A case will be filed against him immediately.” Raja further alleged that the “Islamabad High Court is also involved” in this matter, questioning why Imran’s cases were not being fixed for hearing. Meanwhile, “the condition of one of the eyes of the biggest leader of this nation is very concerning, and we have no information about his overall health condition”. Despite this, Raja continued, Imran had directed his party to approach the courts. “We will not spare these courts. This nation and history will avenge the crime committed by these courts,” he said, demanding that Imran’s cases be fixed for hearing. He also asserted that no reason was left to keep Imran behind bars and “freedom is his right now”. “He will get freedom and this nation will get him freedom. We will fight his case inside and outside courts,” Raja said. Imran’s sister, Aleema, said that the report had shattered her heart. “We haven’t done enough for a person who has been in jail for two-and-a-half years,” she said. She said that the jail authorities knew about Imran’s health but failed to arrange adequate treatment for him. “Imran Khan is in jail because our judiciary is not free,” she asserted. Speaking to the media later in the day, CM Afridi said that they had “options” and they were considering them. He announced that PTI’s core committee, political committee and TTAP leaders were set to meet later in the day to deliberate over those options. The KP CM recalled that it had been over 900 days since Imran’s incarceration, but he had “never complained” about his health. But now, he said, “We have called you and are doing our second press conference, which means that this is serious.” “God forbids. If there were an irreversible loss, then there would be no use in raising our voices,” Afridi stated, adding that the PTI would take some “serious” steps. Afridi branded the jail authorities’ negligence of Imran’s worsening eye condition a “criminal act”. “It violates human rights, the law, the Constitution, jail manuals and is just inhumane,” the chief minister stated. “When [former premier] Nawaz Sharif experienced health issues, the judiciary and our media fraternity collectively raised their voices, even though we knew that the tests or condition were false,” he added, recounting that despite this, the PML-N supremo was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment. “This man is a former premier and the chairman of the country’s largest political party. He is in pain right now and has serious issues,” he stressed. “We have to rise above politics and, on humanitarian and legal grounds, raise our voices for him,” he said.

In the post, which quoted his address to the Senate, the TTAP vice chairman demanded that an “independent and transparent medical board be immediately formed, the complete medical records made public, and those responsible be identified and action taken in accordance with the law”. Lamenting that “timely and effective treatment was not provided”, Abbas also recalled that the nation was “constantly given the impression that he was completely healthy and had no problems”. “If Imran Khan had been allowed regular meetings with his family, if medical examinations had been transparent and reports had been made public, then perhaps this would not have come to this,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "The Bangladesh Nationalist Party raced ahead of its rival Jamaat-i-Islami on Thursday, early counting showed, after tens of millions of Bangladeshis voted in a pivotal national election. It was the first vote since the 2024 Gen Z-driven uprising that toppled long-time premier Sheikh Hasina. Analysts say a clear outcome is crucial for stability in the nation of 175 million, after months of deadly anti-Hasina protests disrupted everyday life and hit major industries, including the garment sector, the world’s second-largest exporter. It was the first national election to follow the recent under-30, Gen Z-led uprisings scattered around the world, with Nepal set to hold a vote next month. Counting began at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT) at most booths, immediately after polls closed, with clear trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, election commission officials said. Contest between former allies The race pits two coalitions led by former allies, BNP and Jamaat, with opinion polls giving the BNP a slight edge. BNP was leading in 50 seats and Jamaat in 18, local TV news stations said. Bangladesh’s parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, has 300 seats, with 151 required for a simple majority. The party declared on its official Facebook page that its chief and prime ministerial candidate Tarique Rahman had won one of two seats he contested. Election authorities were yet to announce the result officially, however. BNP members clapped and cheered loudly as they celebrated outside the party office in Dhaka on hearing the news of his victory, visuals on the Facebook page showed. Turnout appeared on track to exceed the 42 per cent recorded in the last election in 2024. Local media reported that more than 60pc of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots. Bangladesh Jamaat-i-Islami party leader Shafiqur Rahman addresses the media after counting starts following Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka on February 12. — AFP Hasina calls vote a farce Hasina’s Awami League is banned , and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi fray. Elections under Hasina were frequently marred by boycotts and intimidation, critics say. In a statement sent to journalists on WhatsApp, Hasina denounced the election as a “carefully planned farce”, held without her party and without real voter participation. She said Awami League supporters had rejected the process. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 12, 2026. — Reuters “We demand the cancellation of this voterless, illegal, and unconstitutional election … the removal of the suspension imposed on the activities of the Awami League; and the restoration of the people’s voting rights through the arrangement of a free, fair, and inclusive election under a neutral caretaker government,” she said. Members of the army patrol outside the polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 12, 2026. —Reuters Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and a two-term limit for the prime minister. More than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, were on the ballot and at least 50 parties contested — a national record. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died. Long lines of voters, heavy security There were no reports of major violence. Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths. “I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.” An electoral official seals a ballot box as voting ends at a polling station during Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka on February 12. — AFP Many voters echoed that sentiment, telling Reuters that the atmosphere felt freer and more festive than in previous elections. Kamal Chowdhury, 31, who works as a driver for a company in Dhaka and travelled to his hometown in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria to cast his vote, said: “It feels festive here.” Outside a polling booth in Dhaka, where BNP chief Rahman and head of the interim government Muhammad Yunus voted, policemen were on horses with saddle blankets proclaiming: “Police are here, vote without fear.” President Zardari hopes for peaceful process President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning. “President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said. He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.",

Thousands of federal agents have in recent weeks conducted aggressive raids and arrests in what the administration claims are targeted missions against criminals. “I have proposed and President Trump has concurred that this surge operation conclude,” Trump official Tom Homan told a briefing in Minneapolis. “A significant drawdown has already been under way this week and will continue through the next week.” The operations have sparked mass protests in Minneapolis, and the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti less than three weeks apart last month led to a wave of criticism. Homan raised the prospect that the officers would deploy to another location but gave no details, as speculation is rife about which city might be targeted next. “In the next week, we’re going deploy the officers here on detail, back to their home stations or other areas of the country where they are needed. But we’re going to continue to force immigration law,” he said. Opposition Democrats have called for sweeping reforms to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, including ending mobile patrols, prohibiting agents from concealing their faces and requiring warrants.",

      "summary_orig": "BANNU: The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on Thursday conducted an intelligence-based operation and arrested a most-wanted terrorist, Osama alias Baghi, from the Pipal Bazaar area. According to a statement issued by Bannu CTD Superintendent of Police (SP) Fazal Wahid, the suspect belonged to Bannu district and was said to be an active commander of the newly formed organisation Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), established through a collaboration between the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Gul Bahadur group. He said that the suspect confessed to his involvement in nine major terrorist activities during the initial interrogation. He said that these included the December 2025 attack on Miranshah Assistant Commissioner Shah Wali Khan, in which he was martyred along with his two security guards and a civilian. The suspect also confessed to the abduction and killing of former Bannu station house officer Abid Wazir in November 2025. Additionally, he also admitted to his involvement in the abduction and murder of three members of the Lakki Marwat peace committee, who were actively working for public welfare and regional peace, the police official said. According to the CTD official, the suspect had also confessed to kidnapping two Frontier Corps (FC) personnel and police officials from Pipal Daud Shah. He also admitted involvement in the June 2024 killing of a polio officer and his guard in Mamand Khel, the SP said. He said that initial investigations showed that Osama alias Baghi was involved in the reconnaissance of sensitive institutions, and providing secret photographs and information of police personnel to terrorists. The official said the suspect had also confessed to setting up illegal checkpoints in Pipal Bazaar and other areas along with his accomplices to harass civilians. He said that further investigation was underway, and raids were being conducted to arrest his facilitators and other associates. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa inspector general and CTD additional inspector general appreciated the CTD team for the successful operation and termed the arrest of the most-wanted terrorist commander as a significant step toward regional peace.

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi has urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to confer a posthumous national civil award on 22-year-old Oun Abbas, who lost his life while resisting the suicide attacker who targeted an imambargah in Islamabad, it emerged on Thursday. On February 6, a suicide bomber ripped through the Friday congregation at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra on the outskirts of Islamabad. At least 38 people were killed in the incident, and more than 150 were injured. According to eye witness accounts, Abbas, who was praying inside the hall, had abandoned his rituals and tried to tackle the attacker. However, he lost his life when the suicide bomber detonated. In a letter addressed to the prime minister and dated Feb 11, a copy of which is available with Dawn , Kundi lauded the “exceptional gallantry and supreme sacrifice” displayed by Abbas. “In those moments of terror and chaos, while many sought safety, this brave young man chose to confront the terrorist face to face,” Kundi said, stressing that the young man’s courage prevented “a far greater tragedy” and led to the “saving of countless innocent lives”. “Tragically, he embraced martyrdom in this valiant effort,” he said. The KP governor called on the prime minister to confer “a posthumous national civil award, such as the Sitara-i-Shujaat or Tamgha-i-Shujaat”. He said that the award would “not only honour his memory with the dignity it deserves but would also serve as an enduring inspiration for the youth of Pakistan, affirming that courage, faith and sacrifice in service of one’s community are the truest expressions of Pakistani nationhood”. The KP governor expressed faith that the prime minister would consider the recommendation with the “utmost priority and urgency it so clearly warrants and approve the award at the earliest possible instance as a fitting national tribute to his unparalleled courage and sacrifice”. Kundi had made a similar request earlier this week during a visit to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), where the injured remained under treatment. It is worth mentioning that a day earlier, PM Shehbaz had announced a sum of Rs 10 million for the heirs of Abbas. The premier had also announced Rs5m for each person martyred in the attack; Rs3m for those critically injured and under treatment at the hospital; and Rs1m for those with minor injuries who had been discharged.",

      "summary_orig": "Indian defence officials on Thursday cleared the purchase of $39 billion worth of defence equipment, including more French Rafale jets, days ahead of a visit to the country by France’s President Emmanuel Macron. A defence ministry source told AFP that the clearance covered the purchase of 114 Rafale fighter jets, adding to the dozens already used by the Indian Air Force (IAF). “The procurement … will enhance the capability of undertaking air dominance roles across the spectrum of conflict and significantly boost the deterrence capabilities of IAF with long-range offensive strikes,” India’s defence ministry said in a statement, without specifying the number of jets being purchased. The approval by the defence acquisition council — comprising top military officers and the defence minister — is an important first step for any military hardware purchase in the country. “The majority of MRFA (Multi Role Fighter Aircraft) to be procured will be manufactured in India,” the statement added. New Delhi has pushed hard in the last decade to reduce its dependence on Russia, its traditional main supplier of military equipment. India has boosted military hardware imports from the United States, France, and Israel. Macron is set to visit India on February 17. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has also liberalised laws to ease private investments in domestic defence manufacturing under the ‘Make in India’ policy initiative. Since 2015, India has bought 26 Rafale jets worth around $8.7bn and in April announced a fresh multi-billion dollar deal to buy 26 more of the fighter jets. Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes, during the four-day conflict between the two countries in May 2025.",

      "title_orig": "Canadian police identify 18-year-old woman as suspect in mass school shooting",
      "summary_orig": "The suspect in a deadly school shooting in western Canada was an 18-year-old woman with mental health issues who killed her mother and stepbrother before attacking her former school, police said on Wednesday, but investigators did not offer a motive for one of the worst mass slaughters in Canadian history. The killer, who police identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, died by suicide after the shooting on Tuesday in Tumbler Ridge, a remote community of 2,400 people in the Pacific province of British Columbia. Police revised the death toll down to nine, including Van Rootselaar, from the initially reported ten. On more than one occasion, Van Rootselaar had been apprehended under the provincial Mental Health Act for an assessment, said Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia. She once attended the school but dropped out four years ago. “Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,” McDonald said. Unlike the United States, school shootings are almost unheard of in Canada, and federal politicians initially struggled to maintain their composure. “We will get through this. We will learn from this,” a visibly upset Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters. Carney, who at one point looked close to tears, postponed a trip to Europe and ordered flags on all government buildings to be flown at half-mast for the next seven days. Hours later, legislators in the House of Commons observed a minute’s silence and listened as a sombre Carney said the killings had left the country in shock and mourning. “It is a town of miners, teachers, construction workers – families who have built their lives there, people who have always shown up for each other there … Tumbler Ridge represents the very best of Canada,” he said. McDonald said Van Rootselaar, who was born male but began identifying as female six years ago, had first killed her mother, 39, and 11-year-old stepbrother at the family home. She then went to the school, where she shot a 39-year-old woman teacher as well as three 12-year-old female students and two male students, one aged 12 and one aged 13. Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun. Dozens were injured, and two severely wounded victims, aged 12 and 19, remain in hospital. Police officers who arrived at the scene two minutes after the initial call encountered active gunfire, including rounds fired in their direction, according to authorities, before discovering Van Rootselaar dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound. “We do believe the suspect acted alone … it would be too early to speculate on motive,” McDonald told a press conference, saying police did not have information to suggest that anyone had been specifically targeted. Several prominent world leaders sent messages of condolence. King Charles, Canada’s head of state, said he was “profoundly shocked and saddened” by the deaths. Shooting among deadliest in Canadian history Details about some of the victims were slowly emerging on Wednesday. In an anguished Facebook post, Abel Mwansa said his 12-year-old son, also named Abel, had died in the shooting. Abel had once cried when his father proposed homeschooling because he loved going to school so much, his father wrote. He raised his son, Mwansa added, to respect his elders, “be strong, work hard, put a smile on the face like I do, focus on his studies, never miss school and to be a good kid.” Another woman, Shanon Dycke, said her 12-year-old niece, Kylie May Smith, was among the victims. “Pray for the other families who have lost their child, or are waiting to hear news,” she wrote on Facebook. “Just pray for Tumbler Ridge.” The attack sent shockwaves through the tiny community. “Everybody knows everybody,” Jordon Kosik, a resident, said in an interview. “People don’t lock their homes. They don’t lock their cars. You can just go to your neighbour’s house, just walk right in.” McDonald said police had seized firearms from the family residence about two years ago but returned them after the owner, who he did not identify, successfully appealed the decision. Canada has stricter gun laws than the United States, but Canadians can own firearms with a licence. Van Rootselaar previously had a firearms licence, but it expired in 2024. Canadians between the ages of 12 and 17 can obtain a minor’s firearms licence after taking a firearms safety course and passing tests. The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history. In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a petrol station. In December 1989, a gunman killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, before dying by suicide. “There’s not a word in the English language that’s strong enough to describe the level of devastation that this community has experienced,” said Larry Neufeld, a local provincial legislator. “It’s going to take a significant amount of effort and a significant amount of courage to repair that terror,” he told CBC News.",

On more than one occasion, Van Rootselaar had been apprehended under the provincial Mental Health Act for an assessment, said Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia. She once attended the school but dropped out four years ago. “Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,” McDonald said. Unlike the United States, school shootings are almost unheard of in Canada, and federal politicians initially struggled to maintain their composure. “We will get through this. We will learn from this,” a visibly upset Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters. Carney, who at one point looked close to tears, postponed a trip to Europe and ordered flags on all government buildings to be flown at half-mast for the next seven days. Hours later, legislators in the House of Commons observed a minute’s silence and listened as a sombre Carney said the killings had left the country in shock and mourning. “It is a town of miners, teachers, construction workers – families who have built their lives there, people who have always shown up for each other there … Tumbler Ridge represents the very best of Canada,” he said. McDonald said Van Rootselaar, who was born male but began identifying as female six years ago, had first killed her mother, 39, and 11-year-old stepbrother at the family home. She then went to the school, where she shot a 39-year-old woman teacher as well as three 12-year-old female students and two male students, one aged 12 and one aged 13. Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun. Dozens were injured, and two severely wounded victims, aged 12 and 19, remain in hospital. Police officers who arrived at the scene two minutes after the initial call encountered active gunfire, including rounds fired in their direction, according to authorities, before discovering Van Rootselaar dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound. “We do believe the suspect acted alone … it would be too early to speculate on motive,” McDonald told a press conference, saying police did not have information to suggest that anyone had been specifically targeted. Several prominent world leaders sent messages of condolence. King Charles, Canada’s head of state, said he was “profoundly shocked and saddened” by the deaths. Shooting among deadliest in Canadian history Details about some of the victims were slowly emerging on Wednesday. In an anguished Facebook post, Abel Mwansa said his 12-year-old son, also named Abel, had died in the shooting. Abel had once cried when his father proposed homeschooling because he loved going to school so much, his father wrote. He raised his son, Mwansa added, to respect his elders, “be strong, work hard, put a smile on the face like I do, focus on his studies, never miss school and to be a good kid.” Another woman, Shanon Dycke, said her 12-year-old niece, Kylie May Smith, was among the victims. “Pray for the other families who have lost their child, or are waiting to hear news,” she wrote on Facebook. “Just pray for Tumbler Ridge.” The attack sent shockwaves through the tiny community. “Everybody knows everybody,” Jordon Kosik, a resident, said in an interview. “People don’t lock their homes. They don’t lock their cars. You can just go to your neighbour’s house, just walk right in.” McDonald said police had seized firearms from the family residence about two years ago but returned them after the owner, who he did not identify, successfully appealed the decision. Canada has stricter gun laws than the United States, but Canadians can own firearms with a licence. Van Rootselaar previously had a firearms licence, but it expired in 2024. Canadians between the ages of 12 and 17 can obtain a minor’s firearms licence after taking a firearms safety course and passing tests. The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history. In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a petrol station. In December 1989, a gunman killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, before dying by suicide. “There’s not a word in the English language that’s strong enough to describe the level of devastation that this community has experienced,” said Larry Neufeld, a local provincial legislator. “It’s going to take a significant amount of effort and a significant amount of courage to repair that terror,” he told CBC News.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The Trump administration’s point man for South and Central Asia has told Congress that Pakistan remains an important US partner in the region, with Washington seeking to expand trade, economic cooperation, and security ties with the country. Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Sub-committee on South and Central Asia on Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored Pakistan’s role in regional engagement and highlighted growing bilateral cooperation. “Pakistan is another important partner in the region. We are working together with Pakistan to realise the potential of its critical mineral resources , combining US government seed financing with private sector know-how would benefit both of our countries,” he told the sub-committee. Referring to broader economic engagement, Kapur said: “Our trade in energy and agriculture is expanding as well.” He also pointed to continued security cooperation between the two countries, adding: “And our ongoing counter-terrorism cooperation helps Pakistan combat internal security threats while addressing transnational dangers that can harm the US or our partners.” During the subsequent question-and-answer session, lawmakers raised issues related to militancy, Pakistan’s past security strategy and broader regional dynamics. Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States. Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups. When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere. The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect. The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests. He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific. Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence. At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said. Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people. She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute. Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable. Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces. “We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.",

Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States. Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups. When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere. The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect. The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests. He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific. Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence. At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said. Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people. She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute. Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable. Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces. “We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) enabled the recovery of about Rs506 billion in disputed tax revenue over the past year by deciding hundreds of long-pending tax and revenue cases and lifting stay orders that had blocked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from collecting dues, according to the court’s Annual Report 2025-26. The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation. To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC). A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes. Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog. LHC strikes down PRA sales tax case against Fauji Wind Energy on jurisdiction grounds Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn. According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn. The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn. The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years. The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives. The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”. Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records. Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction. A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025. Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority. The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million. The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.
