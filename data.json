Written in a dry, almost matter-of-fact tone, the threat carried a chilling menace. “Unless 10 billion won (about $7.5 million) is transferred to a designated online bank account, a knife attack will follow.” Police rushed to respond. The KT headquarters building was searched floor by floor for explosives. Patrol cars swept surrounding streets while two riot police units sealed off the area, pushing the neighborhood into confusion. Somewhere else, someone watched the unfolding fear with quiet satisfaction. Inside a private online community, the suspect — identified by police as X — boasted about officers scrambling at the scene.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: A large number of people gathered outside the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday to protest the killing of a man during an alleged encounter by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) a day earlier, alleging that the deceased was a student who was earlier arrested by law enforcers. On Tuesday, the CTD said that officials had conducted a raid on a house in Shah Latif Town on a terrorist hideout. According to the department, the men inside the house opened fire on officials, who then retaliated, leading to the deaths of four suspects. The CTD said the suspects belonged to the Bashir Zeb network of Fitna al-Hindustan , a term used by the state for Balochistan-based terrorist groups. However, on Wednesday afternoon, a large number of residents of Old Golimar, including women and children, protested and staged a sit-in outside the KPC, demanding justice for Hamdan, one of the killed suspects identified by the CTD. The deceased’s father, Mohammed Ali said that on December 29, 2025, his son Hamdan was allegedly taken away by the CTD. He said that he had also filed a petition before the Sindh High Court against the alleged disappearance of his son.  He asserted that it was a “fake encounter” and termed it an “extra-judicial killing”. He further alleged that the CTD was not even handing over the body and was demanding that he sign a form admitting that his son was a “terrorist”. He said that the CTD, in a press conference on Jan 6, 2026, had announced the arrest of his son Hamdan and others, and their affiliation with a banned terrorist organisation. He said that his son was a student who had no affiliation with any terror group. The father said that his son was supposed to be presented before a court on Wednesday after the completion of his physical remand in the CTD custody. However, the family was informed that he had been killed in an alleged encounter. He said the family visited the Edhi morgue, but were informed by officials that they would not hand over the body without the approval of the CTD.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) announced on Wednesday it would end its days-long sit-in at Parliament House over ex-premier Imran Khan’s health concerns. However, it reiterated the demand being voiced by Imran’s family to grant the PTI founder access to his personal physicians and allow jail meetings with his relatives. Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas — flanked by National Assembly counterpart Mehmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja — addressed the media in Islamabad after a Supreme Court hearing concerning Imran’s cases. “Thanks to God, there is a minor improvement compared to the situation before, when the vision had gone completely — just a little bit,” Abbas told reporters. However, he criticised the government for “not taking on board” Imran’s family or personal doctors. The senator reiterated that Imran’s longtime physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, should be allowed to examine the PTI founder. Stressing that the opposition members would be glad to know about even the slightest improvement in Imran’s condition, Abbas said, “Therefore, as the month of Ramazan is also beginning, we will end our sit-in that we were staging in the parliament. “And in the next stage, we can take different measures as TTAP and we will do so as we have time,” he added. “If our rulers want to solve this issue, which has been raised across the world and the world has voiced concerns, then witnessing [is necessary],” Abbas said, calling for Imran’s personal physicians to be granted access to Imran. “When Imran Khan sahib has said he has concerns, then it means there are concerns,” the Senate opposition leader emphasised, calling for the ex-premier’s jail meetings with his sisters. “Whatever their demands are, which will satisfy them, should be taken,” he said, calling on the public to pray for Imran’s prompt recovery. Abbas also termed the demand by Imran’s family to have him treated at Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital as “genuine”, noting that there were independent and competent doctors there who were not subordinate to any government medics. Recalling the “extremely worrying” earlier reports of vision loss in Imran’s right eye, Abbas noted that the Adiala jail staff had not taken timely action to provide medical care to Imran. “This was a crime. God-willing, we are about to approach the court about this,” he announced. The senator stressed that the objective of the TTAP sit-in was to ensure that the “government does not commit any more mistakes”. “People across Pakistan — whether opponents or critics — were worried.” Claiming that Parliament House’s gates were shut, Abbas alleged that the parliament was “made a jail”. “Our MNAs were confined in the [Parliament] Lodges. The friends from KP were confined in the KP House,” he said, adding that cases under terrorism charges were filed against TTAP members. Abbas further said that Achakzai had vowed to go on a hunger strike if the reports of “Imran completely losing his eyesight” had turned out to be true. Earlier in the day, the TTAP leadership — including Achakzai, Abbas, Gohar and Raja — reached the SC to show solidarity with Imran during the hearing of his cases. “They may announce further strategy regarding the protest and will also address the crackdown on PTI supporters,” TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai had told Dawn . The TTAP also shared a video of Achakzai inside the SC premises and speaking to Imran’s sister Aleema Khan. Ahead of the SC hearing, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi met with Imran’s three sisters — namely Aleema, Noreen Niazi and Uzma Khanum. “A detailed discussion was held on Imran Khan’s health, judicial matters, other affairs and the challenges being faced in these,” the PTI said. SC again denies Latif Khosa meeting with Imran Meanwhile, the SC again denied PTI leader Latif Khosa a meeting with Imran, as the court indefinitely adjourned multiple cases concerning the ex-premier. A three-member bench, headed by Justice Hashim Khan Kakar and including Justices Salahuddin Panhwar and Ishtiaq Ibrahim, resumed hearing a set of petitions regarding the PTI founder. When the bench took up the matter of Imran’s eligibility to contest polls, Khosa requested that a meeting be arranged between him and the jailed party founder. To this, Justice Kakar replied, “You have taken away the power of taking suo motu notice from us. How can we order a meeting in a criminal case?” Justice Panhwar also questioned how the bench could issue directives in a case that was not fixed before it. Therefore, the bench dismissed Khosa’s request for a meeting. At one point, Justice Kakar told Khosa “not to speak about political matters while standing in the court”. “Speak on politics in the parliament,” the judge remarked. He added, “Now that you have said such things, tickers will also be aired about this and vlogs will also be made.” The SC then issued a notice to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and adjourned the hearing for an indefinite period. During his conversation with Justice Kakar about an old judgment that he had cited, Khosa brought up the matter of PTI’s intra-party elections. At this, ostensibly referring to Gohar, the judge acknowledged, “A big, living PTI chairman is sitting before us.” The appeals against Imran’s acquittal in the cipher case were adjourned without any proceedings as the prosecutor general informed the bench that the detailed order of the case had not been submitted. The prosecutor general sought more time to submit the detailed order. Here, Barrister Salman Safdar, who had appeared as Imran’s lawyer, informed the SC that he had not been issued a notice in the case. Justice Kakar observed that the court could issue a notice to him, but noted that the appeal’s maintainability was yet to be decided. Separately, the SC also indefinitely adjourned Imran’s appeal against a Rs10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during his time as the Punjab chief minister. Imran’s lawyer stated he had challenged the additional sessions court hearing the case, contending that the district and sessions courts have the authority to conduct the trial. The court then issued a notice to PM Shehbaz’s counsel Mustafa Ramday. KP CM announces ‘Free Imran Khan Force’ In yet another attempt to secure Imran’s release from jail, CM Afridi announced the formation of a “Free Imran Khan Force” for a “peaceful” movement. Addressing a press conference outside the SC, Afridi emphasised that a “public movement has now become unavoidable after persistent violations of court directives”, according to a PTI post on X. The KP CM said the “Free Imran Khan Force” will offer memberships for youth from across the country and would include professionals, members from the Insaf Students Forum (ISF), as well as the PTI’s youth, women and minority wings. “The Free Imran Khan Force will wage a completely peaceful struggle. After his release, Imran Khan will himself dissolve the force,” CM Afridi was quoted as saying. The chief minister elaborated that the membership cards would be ready within four to five days, with youth from Peshawar taking oaths after Eidul Fitr. TTAP ‘demands’ full medical access for Imran In the early hours of Wednesday, the TTAP also shared a list of five “immediate and unconditional demands”. The first was immediately granting Imran “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan, so “they could conduct a medical examination independently”. The alliance further asked for certified copies of Imran’s medical tests, diagnostic reports, X-rays, scans and laboratory results to be shared with his personal physicians. The TTAP also demanded that the PTI founder’s personal doctors be “given full authority to formulate their independent medical opinion without the presence or pressure of the government’s medical board”. It further sought “regular and continuous follow-up examinations” of the PTI founder by his personal physicians. Lastly, the TTAP demanded that, for transparency and accountability, the government clarify in writing why “any obstruction or delay occurred in the provision of treatment, diagnosis, and medical facilities”, and also provide assurance that such negligence will not be repeated in the future. The TTAP stressed that any kind of “delay, excuses or staged actions” would be unacceptable. “The matter of Imran’s health is not political, but a requirement of human and constitutional responsibility,” it added. Family members and senior party leaders have repeatedly attempted to meet him at Adiala jail in recent weeks, but most visits have been blocked by authorities. The SC’s intervention on February 10 allowed PTI lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Imran, with the ex-premier telling the counsel he had “ 15 per cent ” vision left in his right eye. This followed a “ medical procedure ” that Imran underwent on the night of January 24. A report prepared by a team of doctors who visited Imran on February 15 stated that, unaided, Imran’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left. However, the PTI founder’s family and the opposition alliance rejected the report and demanded that Dr Yusuf and family members be allowed regular and confidential access to monitor his condition. The TTAP framed their sit-in as a push against the government’s alleged negligence and lack of transparency regarding Imran’s treatment. More to follow",

      "summary_orig": "An Indian professor has falsely suggested a Chinese-made robot dog displayed at a major AI summit was developed by her university, prompting backlash in a situation that politicians derided as “embarrassing” on Wednesday. The silver mechanical dog — a model sold by Chinese startup Unitree —appeared at a booth run by the private Galgotias University at this week’s AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. Following online uproar over the professor’s claim in a televised interview, Galgotias said that while it did not build the machine, “what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies”. “You need to meet Orion,” the professor told an Indian TV reporter as the dog performed tricks such as waving at the camera and springing up on its hind legs. “This has been developed by the centres of excellence at the Galgotias University,” she said, touting the institution’s investments in artificial intelligence technology. “As you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes… it’s quite naughty also,” she said. In a statement posted on social media platform X, the university said: “Let us be clear — Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed.” The “recently acquired” Unitree robodog is a “classroom in motion” and “our students are experimenting with it, testing its limits”, it said. India’s Congress opposition party used the incident to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is hosting nearly 20 world leaders and dozens more national delegations at the five-day summit. “The Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally, with regard to AI. In the ongoing AI summit, Chinese robots are being displayed as our own,” the party wrote in a post on X. “This is truly embarrassing for India,” it added, calling the incident “brazenly shameless”. The TV reporter who had conducted the interview, Tapas Bhattachary, urged viewers to take a broader perspective. “If one out of hundreds of exhibitors wasn’t being upfront about their innovation, I would not give up on the entire India’s youth who are very innovative,” Bhattachary said.",

      "title": "‘Truly embarrassing’: Indian professor’s false claim over building Chinese-made AI robot sparks outrage",
      "summary": "An Indian professor has falsely suggested a Chinese-made robot dog displayed at a major AI summit was developed by her university, prompting backlash in a situation that politicians derided as “embarrassing” on Wednesday. The silver mechanical dog — a model sold by Chinese startup Unitree —appeared at a booth run by the private Galgotias University at this week’s AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. Following online uproar over the professor’s claim in a televised interview, Galgotias said that while it did not build the machine, “what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies”. “You need to meet Orion,” the professor told an Indian TV reporter as the dog performed tricks such as waving at the camera and springing up on its hind legs. “This has been developed by the centres of excellence at the Galgotias University,” she said, touting the institution’s investments in artificial intelligence technology. “As you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes… it’s quite naughty also,” she said. In a statement posted on social media platform X, the university said: “Let us be clear — Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed.” The “recently acquired” Unitree robodog is a “classroom in motion” and “our students are experimenting with it, testing its limits”, it said.

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: The Balochistan Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Wednesday said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts. In a statement, the CTD said eight armed men were killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area. “Eight armed persons were killed in a fire exchange during the operation,” read the statement, adding that three CTD personnel were injured during the action. According to the CTD, weapons and ammunition were recovered from the killed miscreants. It noted that the dead individuals were said to be from a banned outfit. In a separate statement, the CTD said “six terrorists were killed in a fire exchange” during an intelligence-based operation in Barkhan. “All security personnel remained safe,” it stated, adding that arms and ammunition were recovered from the killed militants. “The terrorists were involved in the planning of disruptive actions,” the CTD said, reaffirming to continue its efforts to eliminate terrorism. The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. On February 5, security forces concluded “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 ” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).

A police spokesperson said the officials martyred in the attack were customs official Israr Khan and police constable Mohammad Bilal.

Police said the attackers also fired at passenger buses travelling on the CPEC route, causing panic in the area. A customs vehicle was set ablaze during the assault. Security personnel returned fire, prompting the assailants to flee. A heavy police contingent reached the site soon after the incident, and a search operation was launched in the surrounding area.

      "title_orig": "Ukraine war talks to resume in Geneva as US signals progress",
      "summary_orig": "Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were to resume a second round of peace talks in Geneva on Wednesday, as Washington’s top envoy signaled optimism in its bid to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II. The talks are the latest diplomatic bid to halt the fighting, which has killed hundreds of thousands, forced millions to flee, and decimated much of eastern and southern Ukraine. The United States has been pushing for an end to the nearly four-year war, but has failed to broker a compromise between Moscow and Kyiv on the key issue of territory. Two previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides in Abu Dhabi failed to yield a breakthrough. But US envoy Steve Witkoff, representing the Trump administration at the talks, said President Donald Trump’s diplomatic efforts had made strides in Washington’s bid to end the conflict. “President Trump’s success in bringing both sides of this war together has brought about meaningful progress,” he wrote on X, without elaborating. “Both parties agreed to update their respective leaders and continue working towards a deal.” The latest talks “lasted six hours” and “were very tense”, a source close to the Russian delegation told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address he was ready “to move quickly towards a worthy agreement to end the war”, but questioned whether Russia was serious about peace. “What do they want?” he added, accusing them of prioritising missile strikes over “real diplomacy”. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with the ensuing conflict resulting in a tidal wave of destruction that has left entire cities in ruins. Breakthrough hopes low For the Geneva talks, the Kremlin reinstated nationalist hawk and former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky as its lead negotiator. Ukrainian national security secretary Rustem Umerov was leading Kyiv’s side and said negotiations would continue Wednesday. He thanked Washington for its mediation and said he informed European allies of the outcomes from the first round of talks, which he said had focused on “practical issues and the mechanics of possible solutions” to the conflict. “I have concluded a separate meeting with representatives of the United States and European partners — France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy and Switzerland,” he wrote on Telegram. “We discussed the results of today’s round of negotiations and aligned our approaches on further steps.” Zelensky has repeatedly said his country is being asked to make disproportionate compromises compared to Russia. Trump put pressure on Ukraine on Monday to make a deal, saying they “better come to the table, fast”. Zelensky told Axios on Tuesday it was “not fair” that Trump kept calling on Ukraine to broker a deal, adding that lasting peace would not be achieved if “victory” was just handed to Russia. “I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision,” Zelensky said. Hopes for a breakthrough remain low. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had told journalists to expect no major news from the first day of talks. ‘Disregards peace efforts’ Even before talks were underway, Ukraine had accused Russia of undermining peace efforts by launching 29 missiles and 396 drones in attacks overnight into Tuesday that authorities said killed four people and cut power to tens of thousands in southern Ukraine. Late Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff said Russia had fired 28 missiles and 109 guided aerial bombs at its territory since the beginning of the day. “The extent to which Russia disregards peace efforts: a massive missile and drone strike against Ukraine right before the next round of talks in Geneva,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga wrote on social media. Russia, meanwhile accused Ukraine of launching more than 150 drones overnight into Tuesday, mainly over southern regions and the Crimean peninsula — occupied by the Kremlin in 2014. Russia occupies around one-fifth of Ukraine — including the Crimean peninsula it seized in 2014 — and areas that Moscow-backed separatists had taken prior to the 2022 invasion. It is pushing for full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region as part of any deal, and has threatened to take it by force if talks fail. But Kyiv has rejected this deeply unpopular demand, which would be politically and militarily fraught, and signalled it will not sign a deal without security guarantees that deter Russia from invading again. Russia has been slowly seizing territory across the sprawling front line for months. But its wartime economic worries are mounting, with growth stagnating and a ballooning budget deficit as sanction-hit oil revenues drop to a five-year low.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A distri­­ct and sessions court on Tu­­esday directed the prosecution to ensure appearance of former prime minister Imran Khan at the next hearing either in person or through a video link, while extending his pre-arrest bail in five ca­­s­es, including the attem­p­ted murder of ex-minister Mohsin Shahnawaz Ranjha. Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka restrained police from arresting the PTI founder in the said cases and also extended the pre-arrest bail of Bushra Bibi in one related matter. The hearing was adjourned till Feb 18. During the proceedings, the PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were represented by their legal team. However, despite earlier directions, the former prime minister could not be produced before the court through a video link. Owing to his absence and the unavailability of his counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, arguments on the acquittal application could not be advanced. The court subsequently directed that the PTI fou­nder must appear at the next hearing either personally or via video link. The cases against the PTI founder stem from the May 9 incidents and incl­ude charges of attempted murder, submission of fake receipts and other offences. A separate case has also been registered against Bushra Bibi for allegedly submitting fake receipts. Also, Additional Distr­ict and Sessions Judge Amir Zia extended the interim bail of Bushra Bibi in a case related to the November 26 protest. Meanwhile, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra deferred indictment proceedings in the Sangjani Jalsa case due to the non-appearance of the accused PTI lawmakers. Published in Dawn, February 18th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Punjab officials are tight-lipped on reports that claim the provincial government has acquired a Gulfstream aircraft for “VIP transport role”. Meanwhile, the alleged move continues to draw criticism. On Monday, it was claimed by an X account, The Stratcom Bureau — which mainly shares defence- and security-relates news — that the “government of Punjab, Pakistan has acquired a new, 2019-manufactured Gulfstream GVII-G500 aircraft for their VIP transport role”. In a separate post by the same account, it was claimed that “the registration number of the luxury plane is N144S” and its “old Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) registration would be changed to Pakistani registration soon”. The post also said that the approximate asking price for the aircraft was $38 million to $42m. Meanwhile, the US FAA registry shows that the aircraft is currently owned by TVPX Aircraft Solutions Inc. Trustee, which, as per its website, commonly acts as the registered owner for aircraft trusts, facilitating the buying, selling, and leasing of planes, particularly for non-US citizens or for privacy reasons. According to flight tracking service Flight Radar, the aircraft has been flying between various airports in Punjab since at least February 12. Dawn reached out to several officials for a confirmation of the purchase’s claims, but they remained tight-lipped on the matter. Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman and Additional Chief Secretary Ahmad Raza Sarwar did not respond to calls and text messages to clarify the Punjab government’s position. Punjab Additional Secretary (Welfare) Waseem Hamid, however, denied the claims of the aircraft’s purchase before abruptly disconnecting the call. Dawn also tried to contact Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, but she, too, did not respond to any calls or the query sent to her as a text message. Amid this silence by the officials, the reported purchase of the aircraft continues to draw criticism, including by former finance minister Miftah Ismail and ex-Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair. Sharing the Stratcom Bureau’s post on X, Miftah juxtaposed the reported purchase of the aircraft with the recent hike in petroleum prices by the government. “So while Pakistanis are supposed to tighten our belts and sacrifice, Punjab’s entitled VIPs are fastening their seatbelts for taking off in luxury private jets,” he said. Similarly, Zubair posted on X: “Such a beautiful plane worth more than 1,000 crore, which has been bought by the Punjab govt for the use of its CM and party’s elite.” He questioned whether a nation facing economic difficulties, with 45 per cent of the people living below the poverty line and amid record unemployment — afford this luxury. “The Punjab government may issue a denial if not true,” he said about the claims of the aircraft’s purchase.",
