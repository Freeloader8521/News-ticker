      "summary_orig": "India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew to Israel on Wednesday for a two-day visit to deepen ties with a key trade and defence partner, stirring criticism at home. “Our nations share a robust and multifaceted strategic partnership,” Modi said in a departure statement, saying he will meet his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu and address the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. “Ties have significantly strengthened in the last few years.” New Delhi has steadily expanded co-operation with Israel across the defence, agriculture, technology and cyber-security sectors while balancing diplomatic interests in the Middle East. Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that total merchandise trade was $3.62 billion in 2024–2025. Modi said he would hold talks with Netanyahu to “discuss ways to strengthen co-operation”, as well as meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992. Ties deepened after Hindu-nationalist leader Modi took office in 2014. Modi visited Israel as prime minister in 2017, before Netanyahu made a reciprocal visit to India the following year. Both right-wing leaders have called each other a “friend”. In September 2023, grand plans were unveiled in New Delhi for an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor – to link railways, ports, electricity, data networks and pipelines, including through Saudi Arabia and Israel. Those plans were stalled by Hamas’s October 7 actions against Israel, which responded with a devastating war in the Gaza Strip, killing over 71,000 Palestinians. One of India’s largest conglomerates, Adani Group, operates the Mediterranean port of Haifa, while Israeli military drone technology was deployed against Pakistan during the conflict between the two nuclear powers in May 2025 . At the same time, India maintains strong relations with Gulf nations and Tehran, including developing Iran’s Chabahar port — a trade gateway to Afghanistan, where New Delhi has built a relationship with Taliban authorities. Modi displaying ‘moral cowardice’: Congress On the other hand, the opposition Indian National Congress launched a scathing attack on Modi over his visit to Israel. Senior Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi — sister of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi — said she hoped Modi would mention the killing of “thousands of innocent men, women and children in Gaza” when he addresses Israel’s parliament and demand “justice for them”. “India has stood for what is right throughout our history as an independent nation, we must continue to show the light of truth, peace and justice to the world,” she said on X. Congress parliamentarian Jairam Ramesh said Modi will be displaying “moral cowardice” when the entire world is critical of his “dear friend” Netanyahu. He said Modi was “brazenly embracing” his Israeli counterpart, who has “reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and who is orchestrating the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank”. “On May 20, 1960, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Gaza and met with the Indian contingent of the UN Emergency Force there,” Ramesh recalled. Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “ hexagon of alliances ” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations. India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4bn people, is majority Hindu, but an estimated 220 million Indians are Muslim.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: The main highway linking Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with Punjab remained closed on Wednesday following a suicide attack at the Dajil checkpost near the Dera Darya Khan bridge in Punjab’s Bhakkar district, causing hardship for commuters and traders on both sides of the inter-provincial border. The attack occurred on Tuesday at around 7pm when a suicide bomber detonated explosives near the checkpost, located a short distance from the bridge connecting Dera Ismail Khan with Punjab. CCTV footage reportedly showed the attacker approaching the post before carrying out the blast. Two police personnel were martyred in the explosion, while four others sustained injuries. All injured personnel were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, where their treatment is ongoing. Following the attack, security was placed on high alert in both DI Khan and Bhakkar districts. Punjab police sealed the road near the Dera Darya Khan bridge and suspended all traffic as a precautionary measure, while a search operation was launched in the surrounding areas. The continued closure of the inter-provincial route has caused significant inconvenience to travelers and transporters. Vehicles remained stranded for hours, and passengers were forced to seek alternative routes at additional expense. The disruption comes days after the same route remained blocked for several days due to protests by the PTI, which had already affected the movement of goods and people. Traders in DI Khan said repeated closures had disrupted supply lines from Punjab, particularly from Lahore and other major commercial centres. President of the Markazi Anjuman-i-Tajiran, Sohail Ahmed Azmi, said the prolonged suspension of traffic was compounding the difficulties faced by the business community. He warned that with Ramazan underway and Eidul Fitr approaching, any further delay in the transportation of goods from Punjab could result in financial losses and possible shortages in local markets. Azmi urged the regional police authorities in Bhakkar to restore traffic after conducting necessary security checks, stating that while security concerns were understandable in the aftermath of the attack, the extended closure of the highway was adding to public hardship. Officials have yet to announce when the route will be reopened. KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.",

      "summary_orig": "For the first State of the Union address of his second term, United States President Donald Trump decided to go long, broaching everything from the economy to Iran during his one-hour-and-47-minute speech to Congress. Here are five key moments from the longest-ever State of the Union address: Supreme Court tension Upon entering the US Capitol, Trump shook hands with several Supreme Court justices in attendance — three of whom had ruled days earlier to strike down the global tariffs he had made his signature economic policy. Trump voiced his displeasure during the speech, calling the ruling “very unfortunate,” as the justices watched on from the front row. The president did not dwell long on the subject, however, and said his administration was already planning a legal workaround to keep the duties he insists will be paid for by foreign countries. Team USA unifies During a speech marked by political divides between Trump’s Republicans and opposition Democrats, one of the few moments of unity occurred when the gold medal-winning US men’s Olympic hockey team entered the room. The entire audience rose and applauded, chanting “USA! USA!” in unison, to recognise the Olympians, who clinched America’s first ice hockey gold in 46 years. Democratic lawmaker expelled Congress plays a key, performative role during the State of the Union, applauding and standing up in agreement with the president or sitting still to voice their displeasure. Dozens of Democrats skipped the event altogether, and those in attendance largely stayed seated except on rare occasions. Several wore white to pay homage to the suffragette movement celebrating women’s right to vote, or donned pins demanding accountability over those named in the files released on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In one notable act of resistance, Democratic lawmaker Al Green was expelled after holding up a sign reading “Black people aren’t apes!” in response to a racist video of the Obamas shared by Trump. Ilhan Omar heckles Trump Tensions soared when House Democrat Ilhan Omar, who has frequently sparred with Trump , shouted at the president while he spoke. “You should be ashamed of yourselves,” Trump told Democrats in attendance, who had refused to stand up throughout his address. “You have killed Americans,” Omar shouted in response, in reference to the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents dispatched to Minneapolis last month. The lawmaker, whose district represents Minneapolis, later left the speech before Trump had finished. Longest speech ever At one hour and 47 minutes, Trump delivered the longest State of the Union speech in US history, beating the previous record of one hour and 20 minutes set by former president Bill Clinton in 2000. The speech even outlasted Trump’s address to Congress last year shortly after taking office, which lasted one hour and 40 minutes.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump opened the foreign-policy portion of his State of the Union address tonight with a carefully calibrated message on Iran, stating that his “preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy” while warning he would “never” allow Tehran to acquire a nuclear weapon. The formulation, which projected readiness for talks while keeping the option of military force deliberately ambiguous, reflected his broader doctrine of “peace through strength.” US President Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US on February 24, 2026. — Reuters Trump argued that a rebuilt US military and higher defence spending by Nato allies had strengthened Washington’s hand. At the same time, he asserted that Iran was developing missiles capable of reaching the United States and complained: “We haven’t heard those secret words (from Iran): ‘We will never have a nuclear weapon.’” He blamed Tehran for pursuing a “sinister nuclear program” and claimed that earlier US strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear weapons capabilities. Trump’s Tuesday night State of the Union address lasted one hour and 47 minutes — the longest before a joint session of Congress in at least six decades, according to the American Presidency Project. US President Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on February 24, 2026. —AFP As American television commentators noted, the president turned the annual constitutional ritual into an extended political performance aimed at boosting his approval ratings and energising Republican voters ahead of this year’s midterm elections. Trump also briefly brought South Asia into the address, highlighting his peacemaking role in ending the May 2025 war between Pakistan and India, claiming that his efforts “saved millions” of lives by preventing the conflict from turning nuclear. “Pakistan and India … it would have been a nuclear war. Thirty-five million people, the prime minister of Pakistan said, would have died if not for my involvement,” he declared. Repeating his claim that he had halted eight wars in his first 10 months in office, he snapped at sceptics in the chamber: “Isn’t it funny? Sick people,” while glancing toward those who laughed. Despite weeks of the largest US military buildup in the Middle East in two decades, Trump did not signal whether he was prepared to order a strike on Iran. He waited more than an hour before addressing the issue and avoided any reference to the scale of American deployments in the region, underscoring a speech that, even on foreign policy, largely followed a domestic political script. Trump accused Tehran and its allies of being responsible for roadside bombings that “have killed US service members and civilians.“ He also referred to the killing of General Qasem Soleimani , saying “we took out Soleimani” and that it had a “big impact”. US Representative Al Green, Democratic from Texas, exits as he holds a sign reading “Black people aren’t apes” as US President Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on February 24, 2026. —AFP Within the same sweep of foreign affairs, he hailed what he called a “colossal victory for the security of the United States” in Venezuela and introduced Enrique Marquez, an opposition lawmaker freed from prison after the US abduction of President Nicolás Maduro, telling a relative in the gallery: “I’m pleased to inform you that not only has your uncle been released, but he is here tonight.” The address began with a campaign-style flourish — “Our nation is back: bigger, better, richer, and stronger than ever before!” — and quickly led to a sharply polarised spectacle. People wearing inflatable frog costumes gather near the White House following the “State of the Swamp,” a Democratic-led counter-programming event, and President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address in Washington, DC., US February 25, 2026. —Reuters When Trump asked those who believed “the first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens” to stand, Republicans rose and applauded for several minutes while Democrats remained seated, prompting him to say: “You should be ashamed of yourselves, not standing up.” Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib repeatedly shouted, “You have killed Americans!” and “You should be ashamed!” as the speech continued, while Al Green was escorted from the chamber earlier after waving a protest sign reading “Black People Aren’t Apes,” an apparent reference to a video Trump had reposted on Truth Social depicting the Obamas as apes.

Thirty-five million people, the prime minister of Pakistan said, would have died if not for my involvement,” he declared.

      "summary_orig": "Muslim and European countries, including Pakistan, on Wednesday condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank. A joint statement by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Brazil, France, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Egypt, Pakistan, Luxembourg, Norway, Palestine, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, United Arab Emirates, the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation said that recent changes made by Israel to reclaim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property” are “wide-ranging” and accelerate illegal settlement activity and further entrench Israeli administration. Earlier this month, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories. The measures would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory. “These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” said the joint statement, also shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on X. “We are clear that Israel’s illegal settlements, and decisions designed to further them, are a flagrant violation of international law, including previous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the 2024 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice.” “These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” added the joint statement. The statement, referring to the Trump-brokered Gaza ceasefire and the subsequent 20-point plan for Gaza, said it threatens any meaningful prospect of regional integration. “We call on the Government of Israel to reverse them immediately, to respect its international obligations, and to refrain from actions that would result in permanent changes to the legal and administrative status of the occupied Palestinian Territory,” the statement said further. According to the statement, the decisions made by Tel Aviv follow the “unprecedented acceleration” of Israel’s settlement policy and such actions amount to a “deliberate and direct attack” on the viability of a Palestinian state and the implementation of the Two-State Solution. “In that context, we reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem. We oppose any form of annexation.” The statement called upon Israel to put an end to settler violence and hold those responsible accountable. “We reaffirm our commitment to taking concrete steps, in accordance with international law, to counter the expansion of illegal settlements in Palestinian territory and policies and threats of forcible displacement and annexation.” The nations stressed the importance of preserving, in the holy month of Ramazan, the “historic and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its Holy Sites”, recognising the special role of the historic Hashemite custodianship in this regard. “We condemn repeated violations of the status quo in Jerusalem, which constitute a threat to regional stability.” Earlier, the Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, Wafa news agency reported. Palestinian group Hamas also condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”. Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership.",

According to the statement, the decisions made by Tel Aviv follow the “unprecedented acceleration” of Israel’s settlement policy and such actions amount to a “deliberate and direct attack” on the viability of a Palestinian state and the implementation of the Two-State Solution. “In that context, we reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem. We oppose any form of annexation.” The statement called upon Israel to put an end to settler violence and hold those responsible accountable. “We reaffirm our commitment to taking concrete steps, in accordance with international law, to counter the expansion of illegal settlements in Palestinian territory and policies and threats of forcible displacement and annexation.” The nations stressed the importance of preserving, in the holy month of Ramazan, the “historic and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its Holy Sites”, recognising the special role of the historic Hashemite custodianship in this regard. “We condemn repeated violations of the status quo in Jerusalem, which constitute a threat to regional stability.” Earlier, the Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, Wafa news agency reported. Palestinian group Hamas also condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”. Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership.",
      "title": "Muslim, European countries condemn Israeli attempts aimed at ‘de facto annexation’ of Palestinian land in West Bank",
      "summary": "Muslim and European countries, including Pakistan, on Wednesday condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank. A joint statement by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Brazil, France, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Egypt, Pakistan, Luxembourg, Norway, Palestine, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, United Arab Emirates, the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation said that recent changes made by Israel to reclaim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property” are “wide-ranging” and accelerate illegal settlement activity and further entrench Israeli administration. Earlier this month, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories. The measures would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory. “These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” said the joint statement, also shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on X. “We are clear that Israel’s illegal settlements, and decisions designed to further them, are a flagrant violation of international law, including previous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the 2024 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice.” “These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” added the joint statement.

      "summary_orig": "• Sessions court grants pre-arrest bail to PTI founder in six cases and to Bushra Bibi in one case • ATC declares 30 PTI workers proclaimed offenders in Nov 26 protest cases ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Tuesday sought final arguments on an application seeking the closure of the X (formerly Twitter) account of the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan. Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir heard the matter. Advocate Muhammad Ali Bukhari appeared on behalf of the PTI founder, while Barrister Zafarullah Khan represented the petitioner. Advocate General Islamabad Ayaz Shaukat also appeared before the court. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Bukhari informed the court that PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja could not appear due to ill health. He stated that the court had earlier directed that a meeting be arranged with the PTI founder in jail; however, he complained that jail authorities had not facilitated the meeting. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority lawyer told the court that a report had already been submitted in the case. Justice Tahir asked Barrister Zafarullah what relief the petitioner was seeking. The petitioner’s counsel responded that they were ready to advance arguments and requested that copies of replies be provided to the other side. Mr Bukhari contended that neither the PTI founder nor the party had received the reply. He requested time to first meet the PTI founder in jail before submitting a formal response. The court asked whether PTI intended to file a reply in the matter. Justice Tahir observed that the party was also a respondent and needed to clarify its position. After brief exchanges, the court adjourned the hearing until the first week of May and sought final arguments from the parties. Pre-arrest bails In a separate development, the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka approved pre-arrest bail applications of the PTI founder in six cases, and of Bushra Bibi in one case. During the hearing, prosecutors Raja Naveed Hussain Kiani, Mazhar Bashir and Assistant Inspector General (Legal) Tahir Kazim appeared on behalf of the state, while Barrister Salman Safdar represented the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi. Barrister Safdar argued that the delay in deciding the bail applications was unprecedented in his legal career. He said that 63 adjournments had been granted to the state. On 30 occasions, the court had directed jail authorities to produce the accused, but compliance was not ensured. He added that five show-cause notices had been issued to the jail superintendent. The prosecution opposed the bail pleas, arguing that there was solid evidence against the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi and that they were not entitled to relief. During proceedings, the court asked whether the receipt related to the Toshakhana case had been recovered. The prosecution replied in the negative. Judge Majoka further questioned whether the allegedly fake receipts shown in the media had been sent for forensic examination. After completion of arguments, the court granted pre-arrest bail against surety bonds of Rs50,000 each. Meanwhile, an Anti-Terrorism Court declared 30 PTI workers as proclaimed offenders (POs) in cases registered at Khanna police station in connection with the November 26 protest. At the previous hearing, proceedings had been initiated against 31 workers. However, after one PTI worker appeared before the court, proclamation proceedings against him were terminated.

      "summary_orig": "• Independent research agency claims 15 Palestinian aid workers were killed ‘execution-style’ • Forensic findings, satellite imagery reveal bulldozers crushed, buried emergency vehicles along with victims; earth berms were constructed to hide massacre ISRAELI soldiers fired more than 900 bullets at a convoy of clearly marked Palestinian emergency vehicles in Gaza before advancing to kill the surviving aid workers, some of whom were shot “execution-style” at close range, in March last year, a new joint investigation has revealed. According to Al Jazeera , the report released on Monday by independent research agency Forensic Architecture and audio investigation group Earshot offers the most detailed reconstruction to date of the massacre in Tal as-Sultan, a neighbourhood west of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, on March 23, 2025. Fifteen aid workers were killed in the attack, including paramedics from the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), firefighters from the Palestinian Civil Defence (PCD) and a staff member of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). The slain aid workers were then buried along with their vehicles. The Israeli military first called the vehicles “uncoordinated” and later a “professional error,” but forensic analysis indicates a coordinated ambush with no return fire, aimed at killing survivors. Science of the massacre The investigation uses “situated testimony” and audio ballistics to determine the gunfire’s distance, weapon type, and direction. Investigators analysed footage recovered from the phone of slain paramedic Rifaat Radwan, a PRCS paramedic who began recording at 5:09am, when the ambush began. In a video lasting five and a half minutes, at least 844 gunshots were recorded. Combined with other recordings, the total documented count reached at least 910 gunshots. In the video from one of the last ambulances, Radwan is heard asking his mother for forgiveness and reciting the shahada before dying. According to Earshot’s analysis, 93 per cent of these shots featured a specific acoustic signature: a “supersonic shockwave”, followed by a muzzle blast. This combination confirms that the camera — and the aid workers huddled around it — were directly in the line of fire. “The density of gunfire … frequently exceeds 900 rounds per minute,” the report states, noting that, at one point, five shots were fired in just 67 milliseconds. This rate of fire confirms that at least five shooters, likely many more, were firing simultaneously from an elevated sandbank approximately 40 metres away. “Israeli soldiers ambushed and subjected Palestinian aid workers to continuous assault by gunfire for over two hours”, between 5:09am and 7:13am, the report says. From ambush to execution The report challenges the Israeli narrative of a chaotic “combat zone”. Instead, it describes a methodical massacre of Palestinian aid workers on their way to help people injured in Israeli strikes. The report states there was no exchange of fire or immediate threat to the soldiers, contradicting claims that the incident occurred in a “hostile and dangerous combat zone.” By analysing the time delay between the sound of the gunshots and their echoes bouncing off a nearby concrete wall, investigators tracked the movement of the soldiers. For the first four minutes, the soldiers remained positioned on a sandbank before advancing about 50 metres downhill toward the convoy while continuing to fire, according to audio analysis. This corroborates the testimony of survivor Assaad al-Nassasra, a PRCS worker, who told investigators: “They were walking between [the aid workers] and shooting.” The most chilling finding relates to the attack’s final moments, as a phone call by paramedic Ashraf Abu Libda reportedly captured soldiers arriving at the vehicles. The audio analysis identifies specific gunshots where the distinct “supersonic crack” of the bullet disappears, leaving only the muzzle blast. Ballistically, this indicates the shooter was within 1-4 metres (3-13 feet) of the victim. The shots coincide with Abu Libda’s final sounds of movement, suggesting he was shot while lying on the ground. Hiding the evidence The report alleges that Israeli forces attempted to conceal the massacre by deploying bulldozers to the site, crushing and burying emergency vehicles, and constructing earth berms to block visibility, according to satellite imagery from that morning. The forensic findings match satellite images obtained by Al Jazeera’s Sanad unit, which reported on March 30, 2025, that at least five rescue vehicles were completely destroyed and buried in sand by Israeli forces on al-Muharrarat Street, the site of the massacre.

This corroborates the testimony of survivor Assaad al-Nassasra, a PRCS worker, who told investigators: “They were walking between [the aid workers] and shooting.” The most chilling finding relates to the attack’s final moments, as a phone call by paramedic Ashraf Abu Libda reportedly captured soldiers arriving at the vehicles. The audio analysis identifies specific gunshots where the distinct “supersonic crack” of the bullet disappears, leaving only the muzzle blast. Ballistically, this indicates the shooter was within 1-4 metres (3-13 feet) of the victim. The shots coincide with Abu Libda’s final sounds of movement, suggesting he was shot while lying on the ground. Hiding the evidence The report alleges that Israeli forces attempted to conceal the massacre by deploying bulldozers to the site, crushing and burying emergency vehicles, and constructing earth berms to block visibility, according to satellite imagery from that morning. The forensic findings match satellite images obtained by Al Jazeera’s Sanad unit, which reported on March 30, 2025, that at least five rescue vehicles were completely destroyed and buried in sand by Israeli forces on al-Muharrarat Street, the site of the massacre.

      "summary_orig": "US AIR Force tanker aircraft are lined up at Ben Gurion airport, near Tel Aviv.—Reuters • CSIS report terms current convergence of US military hardware largest since 2003 Iraq war, but smaller than 1991’s ‘Desert Storm’ • Ahead of Geneva talks, Iran says it is ready to take any steps towards a nuclear deal WASHINGTON: As the world’s largest aircraft carrier sails to join a massive military build-up in the Middle East, a new study reveals that the deployment looks to be structured for “limited action” rather than a “large-scale war”. The assessment comes as US President Donald Trump’s reported consideration of a short, coercive strike to pressure Tehran into accepting his demands has triggered intense debate in Washington and beyond over the likelihood of conflict, the definition of objectives, and the danger of a wider regional war. In the meantime, oil prices are hovering near seven-month highs, with traders assessing risks to supply from any military escalation as another round of US-Iran nuclear talks looms. Ahead of Thursday’s planned nuclear talks between Iran and the US, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday that his country was ready to take any necessary steps to reach a deal with the United States. The talks are set to take place on Thursday in Geneva. We are ready to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We will do whatever it takes to make this happen. We will enter the negotiating room in Geneva with complete honesty and good faith,” Takht-Ravanchi said in comments carried by state media. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s first option was always diplomacy but that he was willing to use lethal force if necessary. “If there is an attack or aggression against Iran, we will respond according to our defence plans… A US attack on Iran is a real gamble,” Takht-Ravanchi added. Trump confident US can easily beat Iran President Donald Trump on Monday denied reports that the top US military officer had flagged the risks of a major operation against Iran, saying Washington would “easily” beat Tehran in any war. US media reported that General Dan Caine, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had warned of various risks associated with strikes against Iran including a long-term entanglement. But Trump said on his Truth Social network that it was “100 percent incorrect” that Caine was “against us going to war with Iran.” “General Caine, like all of us, would like not to see War but, if a decision is made on going against Iran at a Military level, it is his opinion that it will be something easily won,” Trump wrote. “He has not spoken of not doing Iran, or even the fake limited strikes that I have been reading about, he only knows one thing, how to WIN and, if he is told to do so, he will be leading the pack.” The US president, however, accused the media outlets of writing “incorrectly, and purposefully so.” “I am the one that makes the decision, I would rather have a Deal than not but, if we don’t make a Deal, it will be a very bad day for that Country and, very sadly, its people,” Trump added. In response to a separate report in The New York Times suggesting that Trump is weighing a near-term limited strike — with the possibility of a broader campaign later — Middle Eastern scholar Vali Nasr wrote: “Trump is signaling Iranians via New York Times. He is trying to force a deal by threatening war.” Nasr cautioned that continued pressure, even after a deal, could push Tehran toward confrontation, quoting Middle East analyst Ali Hashem as saying: “Washington assumes military pressure buys diplomatic leverage. Tehran sees a challenge to ideological survival.” Build-up The USS Gerald R. Ford, meanwhile, has reached the US naval base of Souda Bay on Crete, en route to the Persian Gulf. US Naval Support Activity Souda Bay is home to approximately 1,000 people, including active duty military, US civilian employees, local national employees, contractors, and family members. Washington currently has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier — the USS Abraham Lincoln — nine destroyers and three littoral combat ships. It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers — which carry dozens of warplanes and are crewed by thousands of sailors — in the Middle East. However, a recent study by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) provides a detailed picture of what current US deployments can and cannot do. It notes that the naval “armada” in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean is the largest US maritime presence in the region since five carrier strike groups were assembled at the start of the 2003 Iraq war. The force is sufficient for targeted strikes and for defending US allies and partners. However, it lacks Marine units, special operations forces for raids or ground missions, and the logistics required for a prolonged air campaign. The study also stresses that the current deployment is far smaller than the forces used in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the US conducted major combat operations and regime change. A surge in cargo aircraft and aerial refueling tankers does not indicate the movement of ground combat units, the report says, making scenarios such as capturing or killing Iran’s leadership unrealistic — particularly given the distance from likely launch points to Tehran. The available force package is also deemed insufficient for regime change, and the report argues that even a decapitation strike would be unlikely to destabilise Iran’s political system, which has shown resilience under pressure. For a sustained, multi-week air campaign, CSIS concludes, Washington would need a much larger logistical buildup that would take additional time. Published in Dawn, February 25th, 2026",

Bhakkar District Police Officer (DPO) Shahzad Rafiq told Dawn that a suicide attack was carried out near the Dajil checkpost. He said that two policemen were martyred and one was injured, while three passersby were also injured in the blast. “The suicide attacker came near the check post and blew himself up, while we were conducting a search operation in the area to maintain law and order,” he added. The deceased policemen were identified as Muhammad Faheem and Muhammad Shehbaz, and the injured as Arshad. The identities of the injured passersby have not yet been ascertained. The injured were taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, DPO Rafiq said. In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the terrorist attack. He expressed grief at the deaths of the officials and offered his condolences to the bereaved families. He also prayed for the swift recovery of the police personnel injured in the attack. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep sorrow and grief over the martyrdom of police personnel in the attack, Radio Pakistan reported. He said the sacrifices rendered by the police in the war against terrorism would not be allowed to go in vain, and reiterated the government’s resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz strongly condemned the attack on the police checkpost. In a statement, she paid tribute to the martyred policemen and saluted their sacrifice in the line of duty. The chief minister expressed heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the bereaved families. She directed authorities to ensure the best possible medical treatment for the injured policeman and others wounded in the incident. The development comes on the same day six law enforcement personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police, were martyred after a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district. It is worth mentioning that the Dajil checkpost is at the border of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday that a nuclear deal was “within reach”, ahead of talks with the United States scheduled for later this week. “We have a historic opportunity to strike an unprecedented agreement that addresses mutual concerns and achieves mutual interests,” said Araghchi, in a post on the social media site X. He added that a deal was “within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority”. The talks are set to take place on Thursday in Geneva, a senior US official said on Monday, with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner slated to meet with an Iranian delegation for the negotiations. The two countries resumed negotiations earlier this month as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East. Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the region if it is attacked. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday Iran is ready to take any necessary steps to reach a deal with the US. “We are ready to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We will do whatever it takes to make this happen. We will enter the negotiating room in Geneva with complete honesty and good faith,” Takht-Ravanchi said in comments carried by state media. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s first option was always diplomacy but that he was willing to use lethal force if necessary. A senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Tehran would seriously consider a combination of sending half of its most highly enriched uranium abroad, diluting the rest and taking part in creating a regional enrichment consortium — an idea periodically raised during years of Iran-linked diplomacy. Iran would do this in return for US recognition of Iran’s right to “peaceful nuclear enrichment” under a deal that would also include lifting economic sanctions, the official said. “If there is an attack or aggression against Iran, we will respond according to our defence plans … A US attack on Iran is a real gamble,” Takht-Ravanchi added. Indirect talks between the two sides last year brought no agreement, primarily due to friction over a US demand that Iran forgo uranium enrichment on its soil, which Washington views as a pathway to a nuclear bomb. Iran has always denied seeking such weapons. The US joined Israel in hitting Iranian nuclear sites last June, with Trump saying its key nuclear sites were “obliterated”.",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The security detail provided to former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur has been withdrawn, it emerged on Tuesday. It is worth mentioning that while the security detail from Peshawar was withdrawn, the ex-CM has a police detail from his native Dera Ismail Khan district. It was not immediately clear who ordered the withdrawal of the security from Peshawar, with incumbent chief minister Sohail Afridi’s press secretary denying that orders to this effect were issued. According to the sources, a 16-member security squad assigned to Gandapur was recalled late last night. The contingent comprised two jammer operators, eight gunmen and six drivers, who had been working in shifts. All personnel belonged to the police department. Of them, 14 officials had been deployed for Gandapur’s security, while two were assigned to his brother, MNA Faisal Amin Gandapur. Sources close to the ex-chief minister said that one jammer and one pickup carrier had been returned to the provincial government. The sources said that Gandapur and his brother had personally spoken with the officer who had conveyed KP CM Afridi’s orders to confirm and authenticate the withdrawal of the police escort. In a statement, Gandapur said that at 11pm last night, Afridi’s deputy chief security officer (CSO) called his security personnel, saying that it was the CSO’s order to withdraw the security. “I had one jammer and one double-cabin vehicle provided by the provincial government,” he said, adding, “There were 14 personnel deployed with that vehicle.” “When these personnel informed me, I told them to pack up everything. This is the actual truth,” he said. He stated that even if this security were now restored, he would not accept it. “I want to tell the chief minister that there is no need to return this security to me now. I do not need it,” Gandapur said. Gandapur’s spokesperson, Faraz Ahmed Mughal, insisted that the withdrawal was initiated on the instructions of KP CM Afridi. He said the Chief Minister’s Office contacted the security in-charge and directed that the detail be withdrawn, adding that Gandapur followed the directives within minutes. Meanwhile, in a statement, the KP chief minister’s press secretary said that there was no truth in reports about Gandapur’s security detail being withdrawn by Afridi. “No such decision has been taken, nor have any instructions been issued to the relevant authorities in this regard,” he said. Further, an official at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat clarified that the former CM was asked to return two jammers and the associated personnel, which were required for the use of the incumbent chief minister. “Under the rules, the former chief minister was not entitled to retain the jammers. He was supposed to return the jammers and vehicle”, the official said, insisting that no security detail had been withdrawn from Gandapur. “He continues to retain a police escort,” the official maintained. Gandapur had previously faced multiple security threats, and a hand grenade attack also took place at his residence in the past. Official sources maintained that decisions regarding security deployment and withdrawal were made in accordance with threat assessments and administrative requirements. Political observers said that the development was also significant in the context of the recent differences between Gandapur and CM Afridi.",

      "title_orig": "Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing along Pak-Afghan border: PM’s spokesperson",
      "summary_orig": "Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, said on Tuesday said that the Afghan Taliban regime initiated unprovoked firing along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Torkham and Tirah. In a post on the social media platform X, he said, “Pakistan’s security forces responded immediately and effectively, silencing the Taliban aggression.” He said that any further provocation would be responded to “immediately and severely”. He said Pakistan would “continue to protect its citizens and guard its territorial integrity”. The development comes after Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year. According to an information ministry statement , issued in the early hours of Sunday, the strikes were carried out in res­ponse to a number of terrorist attacks inside Pakistan — such as the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad and a number of attacks in Bannu and Bajaur . “Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers,” it said. The information ministry said that in a retributive response, Pakistan carried out “intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban [ Fitna al Khw­arij ] and its affiliates, and [Islamic State-Khorasan] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghan border with precision and accuracy”. Fitna al Khwarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “Despite repeated efforts by Pak­istan to urge the Afghan Tali­ban Regime to take verifiable mea­sures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted. Souring relations There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire. Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast. Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault. Then, on Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district. In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”. “Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij , irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted. On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable. In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR. The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.",

      "summary_en": "Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, said on Tuesday said that the Afghan Taliban regime initiated unprovoked firing along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Torkham and Tirah. In a post on the social media platform X, he said, “Pakistan’s security forces responded immediately and effectively, silencing the Taliban aggression.” He said that any further provocation would be responded to “immediately and severely”. He said Pakistan would “continue to protect its citizens and guard its territorial integrity”. The development comes after Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year. According to an information ministry statement , issued in the early hours of Sunday, the strikes were carried out in res­ponse to a number of terrorist attacks inside Pakistan — such as the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad and a number of attacks in Bannu and Bajaur . “Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers,” it said. The information ministry said that in a retributive response, Pakistan carried out “intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban [ Fitna al Khw­arij ] and its affiliates, and [Islamic State-Khorasan] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghan border with precision and accuracy”. Fitna al Khwarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “Despite repeated efforts by Pak­istan to urge the Afghan Tali­ban Regime to take verifiable mea­sures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted. Souring relations There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire. Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast. Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault. Then, on Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district. In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”. “Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij , irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted. On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable. In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR.
