      "summary_orig": "Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) supporters reached Muridke on Saturday afternoon as they continued attempts to reach the federal capital to stage a protest in ‘solidarity with Palestinians’. Clashes between supporters of the religious party and police were reported in the Shahdara area of Lahore earlier today. At least 40 police personnel have been injured today, while the TLP claims that more than 10 of its workers have been killed in clashes with law enforcers. TLP began its protests in Lahore on Thursday and announced plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to voice its opposition to the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after two years of conflict in Gaza. The demonstrations turned violent on Friday, with police launching baton charges and firing tear gas at protesters who had pelted them with rocks, AFP journalists saw. Residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have complained of road closures, traffic jams, and mobile network disruptions. Activities across the twin cities remained disrupted for the second consecutive day amid security measures and traffic restrictions, with authorities also suspending mobile internet connections and closing major roads. Shipping containers were being placed as barriers across major roads in the capital in anticipation of the arrival of the protesters. Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi told Dawn.com that no TLP protesters have entered the city, nor have any within the capital come out to demonstrate. “With the exception of Faizabad, all roads in Islamabad are open,” he said in a voice note. “There are no issues. Some containers have been placed on certain roads, but traffic is still able to move.” According to an earlier notification issued by the Islamabad Traffic Police, “entry of all types of heavy vehicles into the capital will remain suspended until further notice.” “Traffic diversions are being implemented due to the law and order situation in Islamabad’s Faizabad area, and commuters are advised to use alternative routes to avoid inconvenience,” the notification added. Residents of the twin cities voiced frustration over the severe traffic disruptions. Shazia Tahir, a resident of Islamabad, told Dawn.com that her usual 20-minute commute to work took more than an hour due to multiple road closures. “I went to Radio Pakistan this morning — the highway from Khanna was closed, and all connecting streets to Rawalpindi were blocked. Faizabad was also sealed. From the highway near Khanna Bridge, I had to take the service road through Sohan, then pass Margalla Town, take the road between Aabpara and F-6 to finally reach the Red Zone via Margalla Road. It took us one hour and fifteen minutes to get there,” she said. Others reported communication disruptions alongside traffic issues. Fauzia Kulsoom, a journalist from Rawalpindi, told Dawn.com that mobile services in Islamabad’s Blue Area remained suspended from 2pm to 5pm the previous day. “The Internet has been down for two days,” she said, adding that her work has been severely disrupted because of that. Some residents described partial closures and heavy congestion in several areas. Riaz Ali, a resident of Bahria Town, Islamabad, told Dawn.com that while containers had been placed and certain routes blocked, movement elsewhere remained possible. “Containers exist, some roads are blocked — Faizabad and GT Road — but things are otherwise open. I haven’t travelled over the past couple of days, but data services are still off,” he said. He added that on GT Road, near City Grammar School, containers had been placed on both sides, causing severe traffic jams. “There were large trucks, and only a few bikers managed to pass through the narrow gaps between the containers. Police presence was minimal, just a couple of officers. At the entrance to Bahria Phase 7, traffic was also backed up. In short, traffic was choked badly in this part of Bahria yesterday,” he said. Meanwhile, citizens in other parts of the country trying to travel to Islamabad also voiced frustration over the road closures and communication outages. Ramna Saeed, an Islamabad resident currently in Gujranwala, said she was unable to travel to the capital for her final LLB exam due to road closures. “All main entry points — Chanda Qila, Sadoki, Kamoki — were shut since morning, and trenches were dug overnight. We haven’t seen such measures here before,” she said. Ramna added that students and commuters were left stranded, with little information on when routes would reopen. “Mobile internet has also been disrupted, and although calls work, 3G and 4G services are barely functioning,” she said. Key intersections, including Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh Turn, DAV College Chowk, MH Chowk, and Naz Cinema, were closed to traffic. In the Saddar area, Haider Road, Suzuki Stand, and Murree Chowk were also blocked, while access roads leading to Kachehri Chowk remained inaccessible, per the traffic police notification. It said partial traffic movement resumed at Sawan Bridge and New Gulzar-e-Quaid, but major interchanges such as Chakri, Thalian, Brahma, and Mandara stayed closed, severing Rawalpindi’s access from major highways. The situation was similar at rural entry points, with Dholtala Mor, Misa Kaswal, Bai Khan Bridge, and G T Road near Gujar Khan all shut down. Meanwhile, motorway authorities said M-1 was open only towards Peshawar, while M-2 remained closed in both the Rawalpindi and Lahore directions. As many as 50 police officers were injured in Friday’s clashes, a senior police official told AFP , while TLP claims that some of its members had been killed could not be verified independently. The TLP said the protests had originally been organised to oppose the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Pakistan backed, but was now intended to express solidarity with Palestinians. “We have no demands, apart from showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad. “We have no idea when we will reach Islamabad, but the government is being brutal with us. We are not negotiating with the government at all,” Irfan said. Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry vowed on Thursday not to let the protesters enter Islamabad. “There is no room for any radical activity in Islamabad,” he told reporters. “Why is an agreement that is acceptable to Hamas and Palestine not acceptable to you?” Israel declared a ceasefire and began pulling back its troops at around noon on Friday, as tens of thousands of Palestinians began walking back towards their devastated homes. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the deal on Thursday as a “historic opportunity to secure lasting peace”. “We will continue to work with partners, friends and the leaders of brotherly nations to ensure that peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people are established,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "Notorious gangster Khawaja Tareef Butt, alias Teefi Butt, was killed in an alleged gun battle with police in the early hours of Saturday in Punjab’s Rahim Yar Khan district. Butt was a proclaimed offender who fled to the United Arab Emirates after he was accused of being involved in a murder in Lahore last February. A probe carried out by investigating officers in September found that he was involved in the incident. A statement from the Punjab Police’s Crime Control Department (CCD) stated that Butt, who had been arrested in Dubai earlier this week with the aid of Interpol, had landed at Karachi Airport a day prior and was handed over to CCD custody, who were to transport him to Lahore by road. “When the CCD team reached near Sanjarpur, District Rahim Yar Khan, in the wee hours of 11th October, a number of armed assailants intercepted the CCD vehicle and opened indiscriminate fire,” the statement claimed. During the gun battle, a CCD officer sustained serious bullet injuries and was rushed to a nearby hospital. The suspects allegedly freed Butt and fled the scene. Local police and CCD officers were immediately notified, according to the statement. “At around [5am], the Rahim Yar Khan CCD team spotted two suspicious vehicles and tried to intercept them. A heavy exchange of gunfire ensued between the CCD team and the assailants, lasting for about 20 to 25 minutes,” the statement added. “One person was found seriously injured at the scene [and] he succumbed to his injuries while being evacuated to a local hospital by the CCD team. Later on, he was identified as Khawaja Tareef Butt alias Teefi Butt.” The statement added that another policeman sustained serious injuries during the gunfight and was transported to a nearby hospital for medical treatment. “Multiple teams from both the local police and Rahim Yar Khan CCD are actively pursuing those involved in the attack, injuring two police officials and the killing of Khawaja Tareef Butt alias Teefi Butt,” the statement read, adding that further investigation was underway.",

      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday assailed the PTI-led KP government for “facilitating terrorists, sowing division, and undermining national security,” stressing that the sacrifices of Pakistanis in the fight against terrorism will not be in vain. The information minister’s remarks come a day after the spokesperson for the military’s media wing, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, without naming anyone, said the “state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of a single person deemed most responsible for bringing terrorism back to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.” “In the past week alone, there have been several terrorist attacks which were bravely and courageously repelled by officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Army,” Tarar said. Referring to PTI, he said during this time, there remains only one party, “Tehreek-i-Inteshaar” (movement of chaos) which has no concern for the sacrifices of our martyrs, no concern for the integrity of the country, and whose only interest is in “further dividing KP, worsening the situation, and creating safe havens for terrorists within the province.” “This is not a story of today,” the minister continued. “For decades, Imran Khan and his party have followed this pattern, showing sympathy for terrorists at the local, regional, and even international levels, and acting as their facilitators.” “This nation has sacrificed so much. Pakistan is the only country whose children have also given their lives,” he said. “How can we forget the students of the APS Peshawar attack , those children who wrote a legendary chapter of sacrifice in blood, a story that will live forever in history. [How] can we forget the children martyred recently in Khuzdar , those who were attacked on a bus. How can we forget their sacrifices?” He said he had personally visited Khuzdar and Quetta.  “When we spoke to the parents of those children, they were such brave and remarkable people. One man, whose three sons were martyred, stood with complete courage and resolve and said, ‘My own life is also ready to be sacrificed for Pakistan.’” He said the province had borne the brunt of militancy for decades, yet its citizens had remained steadfast. “You will find countless examples of how the brave people of KP have rendered immense sacrifices for this country, whether they are from the armed forces, civilians, tradesmen, doctors, engineers, or shopkeepers and children; every segment of society has sacrificed for Pakistan,” Tarar said. “And when the entire country expressed its resolve to eradicate terrorism through the implementation of the National Action Plan, everyone saw how the armed forces, the federal government under Nawaz Sharif, and the provincial governments defeated terrorism through operations such as Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad .” Recalling the years when terrorism gripped the country, Tarar said it was a time when fear overshadowed daily life. “This was the time when our cricket grounds had become deserted, every city would witness a terrorist incident every other day; this was the time when our ulema, our citizens, our children were sacrificing their lives,” he added. He said the nation could not forget the Parade Lane mosque attack , in which retired officers, children, and citizens were martyred, adding that the terrorists have no caste, creed, or colour. “They only believe in violence and promoting terror. They have no god or prophet. They have nothing to do with any religion or Islam.” The minister said the State of Pakistan exists in the name of the Kalima; the whole world views it as a strong Islamic country. To attack the mosques of that state, to attack its armed forces, to attack the law enforcers of that state, to carry out terrorist activities inside that state; this is not permissible in any way, not by any standard, and Islam also does not permit it. He said the ulema have already issued fatwas (edicts) stating that no jihad can be waged against the state of Pakistan. “These terrorists do not spare even mosques,” he said, adding that the sacrifices of those people [against terrorism] will never go in vain. Criticising Imran, Tarar said there was one person in jail who believed the sacrifices of the nation held no value. “If there is respect, it is for how politics can be polished, and in that sense those people who chant the slogan ‘Khan Nahi, To Pakistan Nahi’ [we] regard such politics as a curse in which, by favouring a personality, you push Pakistan backwards and bring the personality forward,” he said. He added that no political party had ever resorted to such slogans before, recalling that when Benazir Bhutto was martyred, PPP workers chanted, ‘Pakistan khappay’ (long live Pakistan). “The leadership of the PML-N has always spoken for this country even in the most difficult circumstances,” he said, questioning, “What slogan have you [Imran Khan] given to your Pakistan? Is your personality the greatest, and everyone else below it?” Talking about Operation Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad, he asserted that peace was established in 2017, but in 2018, when the KP government took over, it invited and resettled terrorists in the province. He alleged there was a reason behind this — an illegal spectrum through which the KP government promotes smuggling, illegal trade, and an undocumented economy. “This includes non-custom-paid cars business, oil smuggling, food smuggling, tobacco and timber business, in which terrorists and the KP PTI government have a nexus. The KP govt, the PTI benefits through these,” he said, adding that these people also fund Imran. He said they settled the militants in populated areas, helped them establish businesses, and entered formal trade partnerships with them. That “successful scheme,” he remarked, is now haunting the nation as “we pick up bodies every day.” He added that this would not be allowed to continue. “The state of Pakistan will never permit any person or group to support these terrorists. The state of Pakistan has decided that it will defeat the terrorists. “When history is written, on one side will be our brave people and on the other the Tehreek-i-Inteshaar (PTI), which believed there was an advantage in supporting terrorists.” Talking about the newly appointed Chief Minister of KP, Sohail Afridi , he said that when it came to selecting a CM, they chose someone who has cases against him, “who is known to be involved in drug peddling and drug business”. Tarar added that this was part of the same black economy through which PTI gains benefits. The minister asserted that “there have been speculations that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was becoming the militant wing of PTI”. “I hope this is not true, but this is being speculated”, he said. ‘We stand for the blood of martyrs’: PTI Meanwhile, PTI leadership held a press conference in Islamabad today in response to DG ISPR’s presser, asserting that the party stands for the blood of the martyrs and warning that misrepresenting PTI would not erase the people’s love for Imran. “Yesterday, a very emotional press conference was held. We will not respond to it word for word, but we know that we are loyal to Pakistan, and ninety per cent of the country’s people stand with Imran Khan,” said PTI’s Secretary General, Salman Akram Raja. “Khan Sahib has always made us a nation; we were raised on Allama Iqbal’s ideals. We stand for the blood of the martyrs. Calling us traitors is a misunderstanding that will harm this country,” he said. “For God’s sake, come to your senses. The nation stands with Imran Khan and PTI. You cannot remove the love for Imran Khan from the hearts of the people. The Pakistani nation knows who is truly loyal to this country and this nation.”",

Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Peshawar Dr Mian Saeed told Dawn.com that three more terrorists had been intercepted and additional reinforcements dispatched for the operation. “Hasan Khel police, displaying courage, bravery and professionalism, have repelled the terrorist attack after a 2-hour fight,” he said in a statement. “The police used modern weapons like sniper guns during the encounter.” “There are fears that the terrorists may be killed during the exchange of fire, as the police thwarted their nefarious intentions through timely action,” the statement said, adding that heavy police force had been called in. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.

      "summary_orig": "Six policemen, including trainees, were martyred and 13 others — 12 policemen and a civilian — were injured in a terrorist attack on the Police Training School in Dera Ismail Khan district, which security forces and law enforcement personnel successfully repelled, the military’s media wing said on Saturday. According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), on the night of October 10–11, assailants attempted to breach the perimeter of the Police Training School, but “their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response of law enforcement personnel deployed on duty.” In their desperation, the attackers rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the gate of the complex, the statement added. “Displaying unwavering courage and professional excellence, police personnel engaged the intruders, eliminating three Khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij, the ISPR said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “While cornering the remaining two intruding Khwarij in a building complex, they were later neutralised by security forces in a deliberate clearance operation with precision,” the statement read. The military’s media wing said that during the intense exchange of fire, six brave policemen, including trainees, “embraced martyrdom after putting up a heroic fight”, while 12 policemen and one civilian were injured. “During this heinous attack, Khwarij attacked the mosque inside the school complex and not only desecrated the holy place of worship but also barbarically killed the imam [of] the masjid, an innocent civilian who was performing the duties of Imam at the school,” the statement read. ISPR said the sanitisation operation is continuing in the area, and the perpetrators of the “heinous and cowardly act will be brought to justice.” “The security forces, alongside law enforcement agencies of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain steadfast in their resolve to eradicate Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further strengthen our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the statement said. Earlier in the day, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) had also issued a statement, saying that the police had repulsed the attack. At the time, officials had said that at least three terrorists, including a suicide bomber, were killed in retaliatory fire by police forces. A report issued by the CTD, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , showed that seven cops were martyred while another 13 were injured in the incident. Dera Ismail Khan Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Hamid Siddiqui also confirmed the casualties to Dawn.com . According to the CTD report, the attack took place at 8:30pm on Friday within the limits of the Shorkot Police Station. “A National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) office near the training centre was also burnt down by terrorists,” Dera Ismail Khan AC told Dawn.com. The initial attack left one police officer dead, the police statement said. It further said that militants then proceeded to enter the school and started firing with heavy weapons and hand grenades, adding that police forces “retaliated bravely” and the exchange of fire went on for about five hours. “As soon as the news of the attack reached District Police Officer (DPO) Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmed, he rushed to the site with a heavy contingent of police,” the statement read. Regional Police Officer Syed Ashfaq Anwar was present as well, it said, adding that police were then joined by security forces. “The police and security forces jointly set an example of courage and bravery in the five-hour-long operation, killing five terrorists and recovering suicide jackets, explosives and ammunition from them,” as per the police statement. The area has been cleared of the terrorists, and a search operation was underway, the statement said. Lauding the efforts of the forces in thwarting the attack, KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed was quoted as saying, “The unparalleled bravery of the officers on the frontline has proven that the KP police is committed to eradicating terrorism.” Announcing compensation for the martyred, he assured that “their sacrifices will not go in vain”. The KP IG also announced special rewards for all those who participated in the operation. Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel. A senior army officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the DI Khan a day ago. A cop was martyred in the district after a police checkpoint came under attack from multiple sides by terrorists late on Wednesday. Last month, 13 terrorists were killed during an IBO in the district’s Daraban area. According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan captain Shan Masood believes taking 20 wickets, rather than piling up big scores, will be key to winning the upcoming two-match Test series against South Africa, as the hosts prepare spin-friendly conditions for the opener at the Gaddafi Stadium from Sunday. Speaking at the pre-series press conference at the venue on Saturday, Shan said Pakistan’s focus was on creating result-oriented pitches that suit their strengths. “We don’t want flat tracks where matches end in draws,” he remarked. “Sometimes you sacrifice runs to create situations where 20 wickets are possible.” The Pakistan skipper said the approach reflected lessons from the previous World Test Championship (WTC) cycle, where his side struggled to convert opportunities at home. “The idea is to use our home advantage wisely,” he added. The Gaddafi Stadium surface, hosting its first Test of the current WTC cycle from Sunday, is expected to offer assistance to spinners. Pakistan are likely to field up to three slow bowlers, with off-spinner Sajid Khan — now recovered from illness — likely to play a key role. Shan also pointed to the option of reverse swing from the pace attack, depending on conditions. Concerns remain over the recent form of Babar Azam and Salman Ali Agha, but Shan said individual numbers mattered less in low-scoring contests. “In such conditions, even a fifty can be a match-defining contribution,” he said.\nUnder scrutiny himself after a lean run, Shan noted that he finished among Pakistan’s top scorers in the last WTC cycle. “Performance should be judged in context — it’s about winning moments, not averages,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday that Qatar will be allowed to build an air force facility at Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho that will house F-15 fighter jets and pilots. The announcement comes soon after President Donald Trump signed an executive order vowing to defend the Gulf Arab state against attacks, following Israeli air strikes targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital Doha. “We’re signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho,” Hegseth said at the Pentagon, with Qatari Defence Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani at his side. “The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training” as well as “increase lethality, interoperability,” he said. “It’s just another example of our partnership. And I hope you know, your excellency, that you can count on us.” The Idaho base currently also hosts a fighter jet squadron from Singapore, according to its website. Hegseth also thanked Qatar for its “substantial role” as a mediator in the talks that led to a truce and hostage-prisoner swap deal between Israel and Hamas, and its assistance in securing the release of a US citizen from Afghanistan. The Qatari minister hailed the “strong, enduring partnership” and “deep defense relationship” shared by the two countries. The Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is Washington’s largest military facility in the Middle East. Trump’s close relationship with the leaders of Qatar has raised eyebrows, especially over its gift to the US president of a Boeing 747 to be used as Air Force One. Though the Idaho facility for Qatar had apparently been in the works since the last administration of Democrat Joe Biden, the deal prompted some hand-wringing on social media, including from far-right activist Laura Loomer, usually a Trump ally. “Never thought I’d see Republicans give terror financing Muslims from Qatar a MILITARY BASE on US soil so they can murder Americans,” Loomer wrote on X. Hegseth, who never said it was a base, later wrote on the platform: “Qatar will not have their own base in the United States — nor anything like a base.\nWe control the existing base, like we do with all partners.“",

      "summary_orig": "KYIV: Large parts of Kyiv were plunged into darkness in the early hours of Friday after Russian drones and missiles struck Ukrainian energy facilities, cutting power and water to homes and halting a key metro link across the Dnipro river. In the latest mass attack targeting the energy system as winter approaches, electricity was interrupted in nine regions, and around 854,000 consumers were temporarily without power across the country. In southeastern Ukr­aine, a seven-year-old was killed when his home was hit, and at least 20 people were injured. In Kyiv, an apartment block in the city centre was damaged by a projectile, while on the left bank of the  Dnipro that divides the capital, crowds waited at bus stops with the metro out of action and people filled water bottles at distribution points. “We didn’t sleep at all,” said Liuba, a pensioner, as she collected water. “From 2:30am there was so much noise. By 3:30 we had no electricity, no gas, no water. Nothing.” Ukraine’s air force said it downed 405 of 465 drones and 15 of 32 missiles in the attack. Moscow said its overnight strikes were a response to Ukr­aine’s attacks on Russian civilian facilities. The assault was among the heaviest concentrated strikes on energy infrastructure, Ukranian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. Her deputy, Oleksiy Kuleba, said two million customers in Kyiv temporarily faced problems with water supplies. Ukrainian President Vol­­odymyr Zelenskiy said Russia’s main target ahead of the heating season is civilian and energy infrastructure and called for more support from Kyiv’s allies. “What’s needed is not window dressing but decisive action from the US, Europe, and the G7 in delivering air defence systems and enforcing sanctions,” he said on X. Ukraine’s Energy Min­ister Svitlana Hrynchuk met with G7 ambassadors to discuss how allies could help protect the country against further attacks and repair the damage. Ukrainian private ene­r­gy firm DTEK said its thermal power plants suff­ered significant damage. The government said it ex­­pe­cted to restore the water supply to the capital by the end of Friday.

      "summary_en": "KYIV: Large parts of Kyiv were plunged into darkness in the early hours of Friday after Russian drones and missiles struck Ukrainian energy facilities, cutting power and water to homes and halting a key metro link across the Dnipro river. In the latest mass attack targeting the energy system as winter approaches, electricity was interrupted in nine regions, and around 854,000 consumers were temporarily without power across the country. In southeastern Ukr­aine, a seven-year-old was killed when his home was hit, and at least 20 people were injured. In Kyiv, an apartment block in the city centre was damaged by a projectile, while on the left bank of the  Dnipro that divides the capital, crowds waited at bus stops with the metro out of action and people filled water bottles at distribution points. “We didn’t sleep at all,” said Liuba, a pensioner, as she collected water. “From 2:30am there was so much noise. By 3:30 we had no electricity, no gas, no water. Nothing.” Ukraine’s air force said it downed 405 of 465 drones and 15 of 32 missiles in the attack. Moscow said its overnight strikes were a response to Ukr­aine’s attacks on Russian civilian facilities. The assault was among the heaviest concentrated strikes on energy infrastructure, Ukranian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. Her deputy, Oleksiy Kuleba, said two million customers in Kyiv temporarily faced problems with water supplies. Ukrainian President Vol­­odymyr Zelenskiy said Russia’s main target ahead of the heating season is civilian and energy infrastructure and called for more support from Kyiv’s allies. “What’s needed is not window dressing but decisive action from the US, Europe, and the G7 in delivering air defence systems and enforcing sanctions,” he said on X. Ukraine’s Energy Min­ister Svitlana Hrynchuk met with G7 ambassadors to discuss how allies could help protect the country against further attacks and repair the damage. Ukrainian private ene­r­gy firm DTEK said its thermal power plants suff­ered significant damage. The government said it ex­­pe­cted to restore the water supply to the capital by the end of Friday.

      "summary_orig": "• Many Palestinians return to destroyed homes in Gaza • Hamas expected to release 20 living Israeli prisoners after which Israel will release 1,950 Palestinians • US plans 200 troops deployment for task force JERUSALEM: Thousands of ­displaced Palestinians streamed back towards their abandoned homes on Friday after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect and Israeli troops began pulling back from parts of Gaza. A huge column of displaced Gazans filed north through the dust and rubble towards Gaza City, the enclave’s biggest urban area, which had been under attack just days ago in one of Israel’s biggest offensives of the war. “Thank God my house is still standing,” said Ismail Zayda, 40, in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City. “But the place is destroyed, my neighbours’ houses are destroyed, entire districts have gone.” The Israeli military said the ceasefire agreement had been activated at noon local time (0900 GMT). Israel’s government ratified the ceasefire with Hamas in the early hours of Friday, clearing the way to partially pull back troops and fully suspend hostilities in Gaza within 24 hours. Hamas is expected to release the 20 living Israeli prisoners within 72 hours, after which Israel will release 250 Palestinians serving long terms in Israeli prisons, and 1,700 others detained in Gaza during the war. US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said the Israeli military had completed the first phase of a withdrawal in Gaza and the Israeli, prisoners’ release period had started. Once the agreement is operating, trucks carrying food and medical aid will surge into Gaza to help civilians, hundreds of thousands of whom have been sheltering in tents after Israeli forces destroyed their homes and razed entire cities. Israeli troop pullout In Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, some Israeli troops pulled back from the eastern area near the border, but tank shelling was heard, according to residents. In Nusseirat camp in the centre of the enclave, some Israeli soldiers dismantled their position and headed east towards the Israeli border, though other troops remained in the area after gunfire was heard in the early hours of Friday. Israeli forces pulled out from the road along the Mediterranean coast into Gaza City. “As soon as we heard the news of the truce and ceasefire, we were very happy and got ready to go back to Gaza City, to our homes. Of course there are no homes — they’ve been destroyed,” said Mahdi Saqla, 40. “But we are happy just to return to where our homes were, even over the rubble. That too is a great joy. For two years we’ve been suffering, displaced from place to place,” he added. US to deploy troops for Gaza task force The United States will deploy up to 200 troops to Israel to establish a task force to support stabilisation efforts in Gaza, but no Americans are expected to be deployed into the Palestinian enclave, US officials said on Thursday. The US military’s Central Command will stand up the task force, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Center, or CMCC, one of the officials said. The CMCC’s job will be to facilitate the flow of assistance into Gaza, including security assistance and humanitarian aid, officials said. Two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US troops would be the core of the CMCC, but it would also include representatives from Egypt’s military, Qatar, Turkiye and probably the United Arab Emirates. The officials said the joint control centre would coordinate with Israeli forces and other security forces to avoid clashes. “No US troops are intended to go into Gaza,” said one of the officials. Gaza reconstruction Meanwhile, Germany wants to organise an international conference with Egypt for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday, as Israel and Hamas edged closer to ending hostilities. The main goal of this conference “should be to address the most urgent needs, such as rebuilding water and energy supplies and medical care”, Merz said in a statement.

      "title_orig": "TLP protesters clash with police as march heads to Islamabad",
      "summary_orig": "• Law enforcers use tear gas, barricades to contain procession • Dozens of personnel hurt; TLP alleges casualties from police firing • Trenches dug up to block marchers on G.T. Road; Chenab, Jhelum bridges sealed • Talal warns against violence or ‘mob blackmail’ • ATC grants 12-day remand for 110 TLP activists LAHORE: The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) began marching towards Islamabad after Friday prayers, with a large number of supporters reaching Shahdara and staging a sit-in after clashes with police, partially paralysing the provincial capital. The law enforcers repeatedly tried to contain the procession near the group’s headquarters by erecting barricades and containers and using tear gas and other crowd-control measures. In the Gujrat district, local authorities on Friday night dug up trenches at least three locations along the G.T. Road to block the march headed towards Islamabad. However, the TLP, led by its chief Saad Rizvi, not only managed to take out the main procession in Lahore as part of its “Gaza March” but also kept on moving ahead amid religious slogans, rendering the police helpless. Reports suggest that protests turned violent following Friday sermons delivered by prominent religious figures of the organisation at local mosques before the march began to move towards Islamabad from Lahore’s Multan Road. Video circulating on social media appeared to show protesters commandeering heavy vehicles, including cranes reportedly belonging to government departments such as the Lahore Waste Management Company, Rescue 1122 and the Punjab police, to use them in the procession. Scuffles reportedly broke out soon after TLP chief Saad Rizvi delivered a major sermon at the main Friday congregation at the central mosque near the organisation’s headquarters on Multan Road. Later, he addressed a big rally and gave the party workers the go-ahead to move towards Islamabad as per the given plan. Confrontations were reported at multiple locations along Multan Road, including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, near the Civil Secretariat, Bhati Gate, Azadi Chowk and Ravi Bridge (Shahdara). Witnesses said some protesters occupied sections of the Orange Line track to throw stones at police, injuring several officers. Protesters were seen carrying sticks, rods and bricks. Police responded by firing tear-gas shells and, according to witnesses, warning shots in the air to disperse the crowd. On some occasions, the two sides were seen chasing and repelling each other. Sources said three police vehicles were seized and some personnel briefly taken hostage and assaulted, turning stretches of Multan Road into a battleground and disrupting life for nearby residents. A second wave of major scuffles was reported near Azadi Chowk, where several police vehicles were damaged and many officials were injured. Footage on social media showed officers retreating for cover; two superintendents of police were also seen taking positions at safer locations. One video showed an officer being knocked to the ground and bleeding. Police sources said dozens of officers were injured, some seriously, after being pelted with stones and attacked by baton-wielding protesters. The TLP said many of its supporters were injured and alleged that some had died from police firing during the march. Neither claim could be independently verified and no official casualty figures were released. Authorities also accused TLP-linked social media accounts of circulating old images and videos to inflame tensions. By evening, hundreds of TLP workers had gathered near Ravi Bridge awaiting further instructions from Mr Rizvi. Talal’s presser State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of holding protests to misuse the issue of corruption for political gain, reiterating that the government would not allow any group to use violence or blackmail the state. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, he said policy is clear: peaceful protest within the democratic and constitutional framework is a constitutional right. “There is no space for groups to blackmail others, to use mobs, or to use violence to achieve their demands or objectives,” he said. Mr Chaudhry said hundreds of suspects planning violence had been identified, and that provincial governments had already made arrests. “For the government, stopping around 2,000 people is not a problem, but a policy decision was made to use minimum force,” he noted. Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday handed 110 TLP activists to police on a 12-day physical remand in a case relating to violent protests and attacks on law enforcers. Police produced the suspects before the court and sought their custody for interrogation. ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill approved the remand and directed police to conduct the investigation strictly in accordance with the law. Nawankot police have registered an FIR alleging the suspects attacked law enforcement personnel, opened fire, resorted to violence and damaged public property during a protest. Those remanded include Qari Umar Farooq, Basharat Ali, Qari Shabbir Farooqi, Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar, Qari M. Hussain, Qari Muharram Aslam, Qari Khurshid, Hammad Ali, Imran Hussain, Ghulam Nabi, Nazir Hussain aka Nazir Chishti and Muhammad Usama. The judge ordered police to produce the suspects again upon completion of the remand for further proceedings. Meanwhile, local authorities in the Gujrat district on Friday night dug trenches at least three locations along the GT Road. Earlier in the day, both bridges over the Chenab and Jhelum rivers were sealed by parking heavy vehicles across the carriageways. Entry to and exit from Gujrat via several other points were also curtailed for vehicular traffic. However, pedestrians were still allowed to cross the bridges, though officials warned this may become difficult today if further vehicles are added to the barriers. Trenches have been dug near the Jhelum bridge at Sarai Alamgir and on the Wazirabad side of the Chenab. For the first time, a trench has also been dug on GT Road within Kharian city to render vehicular movement virtually impossible. Previously, such trenches were typically limited to approaches near river bridges, including during the 2021 TLP march. A senior law-enforcement official said preparations were in place to create additional trenches at various points along GT Road within the Gujrat district if the march cannot be contained in Gujranwala. Heavy containers have also been parked at multiple locations in Gujrat city and in the towns of Lalamusa, Kharian and Sarai Alamgir. The closures have paralysed daily life, with numerous social and business events postponed. The local business fraternity voiced concern over the prolonged blockade and urged the government to adopt a viable policy to tackle such situations without crippling commercial activity.

In the Gujrat district, local authorities on Friday night dug up trenches at least three locations along the G.T. Road to block the march headed towards Islamabad. However, the TLP, led by its chief Saad Rizvi, not only managed to take out the main procession in Lahore as part of its “Gaza March” but also kept on moving ahead amid religious slogans, rendering the police helpless. Reports suggest that protests turned violent following Friday sermons delivered by prominent religious figures of the organisation at local mosques before the march began to move towards Islamabad from Lahore’s Multan Road. Video circulating on social media appeared to show protesters commandeering heavy vehicles, including cranes reportedly belonging to government departments such as the Lahore Waste Management Company, Rescue 1122 and the Punjab police, to use them in the procession. Scuffles reportedly broke out soon after TLP chief Saad Rizvi delivered a major sermon at the main Friday congregation at the central mosque near the organisation’s headquarters on Multan Road. Later, he addressed a big rally and gave the party workers the go-ahead to move towards Islamabad as per the given plan. Confrontations were reported at multiple locations along Multan Road, including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, near the Civil Secretariat, Bhati Gate, Azadi Chowk and Ravi Bridge (Shahdara). Witnesses said some protesters occupied sections of the Orange Line track to throw stones at police, injuring several officers. Protesters were seen carrying sticks, rods and bricks. Police responded by firing tear-gas shells and, according to witnesses, warning shots in the air to disperse the crowd. On some occasions, the two sides were seen chasing and repelling each other. Sources said three police vehicles were seized and some personnel briefly taken hostage and assaulted, turning stretches of Multan Road into a battleground and disrupting life for nearby residents. A second wave of major scuffles was reported near Azadi Chowk, where several police vehicles were damaged and many officials were injured. Footage on social media showed officers retreating for cover; two superintendents of police were also seen taking positions at safer locations. One video showed an officer being knocked to the ground and bleeding. Police sources said dozens of officers were injured, some seriously, after being pelted with stones and attacked by baton-wielding protesters. The TLP said many of its supporters were injured and alleged that some had died from police firing during the march. Neither claim could be independently verified and no official casualty figures were released. Authorities also accused TLP-linked social media accounts of circulating old images and videos to inflame tensions. By evening, hundreds of TLP workers had gathered near Ravi Bridge awaiting further instructions from Mr Rizvi. Talal’s presser State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of holding protests to misuse the issue of corruption for political gain, reiterating that the government would not allow any group to use violence or blackmail the state. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, he said policy is clear: peaceful protest within the democratic and constitutional framework is a constitutional right. “There is no space for groups to blackmail others, to use mobs, or to use violence to achieve their demands or objectives,” he said. Mr Chaudhry said hundreds of suspects planning violence had been identified, and that provincial governments had already made arrests. “For the government, stopping around 2,000 people is not a problem, but a policy decision was made to use minimum force,” he noted. Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday handed 110 TLP activists to police on a 12-day physical remand in a case relating to violent protests and attacks on law enforcers. Police produced the suspects before the court and sought their custody for interrogation. ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill approved the remand and directed police to conduct the investigation strictly in accordance with the law. Nawankot police have registered an FIR alleging the suspects attacked law enforcement personnel, opened fire, resorted to violence and damaged public property during a protest. Those remanded include Qari Umar Farooq, Basharat Ali, Qari Shabbir Farooqi, Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar, Qari M. Hussain, Qari Muharram Aslam, Qari Khurshid, Hammad Ali, Imran Hussain, Ghulam Nabi, Nazir Hussain aka Nazir Chishti and Muhammad Usama. The judge ordered police to produce the suspects again upon completion of the remand for further proceedings. Meanwhile, local authorities in the Gujrat district on Friday night dug trenches at least three locations along the GT Road. Earlier in the day, both bridges over the Chenab and Jhelum rivers were sealed by parking heavy vehicles across the carriageways. Entry to and exit from Gujrat via several other points were also curtailed for vehicular traffic. However, pedestrians were still allowed to cross the bridges, though officials warned this may become difficult today if further vehicles are added to the barriers. Trenches have been dug near the Jhelum bridge at Sarai Alamgir and on the Wazirabad side of the Chenab. For the first time, a trench has also been dug on GT Road within Kharian city to render vehicular movement virtually impossible. Previously, such trenches were typically limited to approaches near river bridges, including during the 2021 TLP march. A senior law-enforcement official said preparations were in place to create additional trenches at various points along GT Road within the Gujrat district if the march cannot be contained in Gujranwala. Heavy containers have also been parked at multiple locations in Gujrat city and in the towns of Lalamusa, Kharian and Sarai Alamgir. The closures have paralysed daily life, with numerous social and business events postponed. The local business fraternity voiced concern over the prolonged blockade and urged the government to adopt a viable policy to tackle such situations without crippling commercial activity.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Friday avoided directly acknowledging strikes in Kabul, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil. The FO, moreover, also emphasised the need for continued dialogue and cooperation with Kabul to address cross-border terrorism. At the weekly FO briefing , spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the security and well-being of its people.” Pakistan “respects the sovereignty of Afghanistan, and remains steadfast in its commitment to fostering dialogue and cooperation with our neighbour to address the shared challenges of terrorism”, the spokesperson said, adding that the security operations were intelligence-driven and aimed at protecting its citizens from terrorist groups, including the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The statement came after twin explosions shook Kabul on Thursday night. Local Afghan media, quoting witnesses, reported fighter jet overflights and bursts of automatic gunfire. They described the blasts as precision air strikes that hit a vehicle and a compound linked to the TTP, suggesting that the intended target was TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud. Meanwhile, reports on Noor Wali Mehsud’s fate were conflicting. Some Pakistan military-linked social media hailed the strike as a potential blow to the TTP leadership, while pro-TTP channels released an audio message purportedly from the TTP chief denying his death and calling the reports “enemy propaganda”. The incident marks one of the most serious escalations between the two neighbours since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. Stresses continued dialogue, cooperation with Kabul to address cross-border terrorism, says Afghanistan’s sovereignty is respected Analysts say that if confirmed a Pakistani strike inside Kabul would be the first such incident in the Afghan capital, although Pakistan has previously conducted operations against TTP targets in other parts of Afghanistan. Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces patience has worn out,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said a day earlier in the National Assembly. Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups. Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the Foreign Office briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said. Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.” India-Afghanistan agreement The Foreign Office refrained from commenting on the agreement between New Delhi and Kabul to reopen their long-shuttered embassies. The agreement was reached during talks in New Delhi between Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Afghanistan’s Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, which marked India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. “Our position on Afghanistan’s bilateral relations with any other country remains that it is a matter between those two countries,” Mr Khan said, adding, “Afghanistan is a sovereign, independent country, and we do not have any particular comment to offer on it.” He further noted that Pakistan’s consistent request to Afghanistan, while respecting its sovereign right to pursue an independent foreign policy, has been that Afghan territory should not be used against Pakistan.

      "summary_orig": "At least three terrorists, including a suicide bomber, were killed in retaliatory fire by police forces after an attack on a police training centre in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan was repulsed on Friday night. DI Khan District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed that three terrorists were killed by police forces and added that a large contingent of security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area. Police confirmed that the training centre premises were cleared and all terrorists involved in the attack were killed. A search operation, led by DPO Sahibzada, was also conducted in the surrounding areas to ensure no other terrorists were present. A large contingent of security forces reached the incident site soon after the attack commenced and cordoned off the area. Earlier, there were reports of a loud explosion in the vicinity of the police facility. DI Khan Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) Yaqoob Khan earlier told Dawn.com that a “suicide bomber and two terrorists have been killed”. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. A senior army officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the district a day ago. A cop was martyred in the district after a police checkpoint came under attack from multiple sides by terrorists late on Wednesday. Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel. Last month, 13 terrorists were killed during an IBO in the district’s Daraban area. According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.",

      "title_orig": "KP govt must protect its people instead of begging Afghanistan for security: DG ISPR",
      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Friday that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government should work on protecting the people of the province instead of “begging Afghanistan” for security. The DG ISPR made these remarks while addressing a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He said governance gaps in KP were being paid for by the blood of security personnel. “Appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators is never and not a policy,” he asserted, adding that the state and its institutions would not be bothered by “any political distortions”. “The state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of any single person who is singularly the most responsible person for bringing terrorism back to KP.” He said that he hoped the government would focus on governance and the people it was duty-bound to protect. “We also hope that instead of begging Afghanistan for security, you will protect this province and its people.” The DG ISPR began the press conference by paying homage on behalf of the armed forces of Pakistan to the “brave sons of soil” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said the purpose of the press conference was to give an overview of the security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the past two decades, Pakistan, particularly KP, has been facing the issue of terrorism, he said. In 2024, he said, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP, 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians were killed. Moreover, he continued, 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025 until September 15. In these operations, 970 terrorists were killed while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred. When the frequency of terrorism incidents increased in 2021, “the response also went up”, the DG ISPR said. “And more number of kharijis were killed in subsequent years.” The DG ISPR said following the 2014 attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, security forces had started uprooting terrorism as part of a comprehensive strategy. “We reached close to [realising] the dream of a peaceful Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. [But], unfortunately, as part of a plan, terrorists and their facilitators were then provided space here. “Governance and public welfare were deliberately weakened and attempts were made to build a misleading narrative. The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are paying its price with their blood and sacrifices even today.” Factors behind rise of militancy He then outlined the factors that led to this situation. First reason, he said, was not fully implementing the National Action Plan, followed by politicising the issue of terrorism, India using Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the provision of modern weapons to terrorists in Afghanistan and the existence of a “terrorism-crime nexus” that had “complete local and political backing”. Going back to the 2014 APS attack, he said all political parties, and the provincial and federal governments devised the NAP. “All political parties agreed that the implementation of the NAP was necessary for eliminating terrorism.” But, he added, the then-government removed some provisions of the plan in 2021 despite progress in those areas and came up with the “revised” NAP. All political parties, provincial governments and the federal government then agreed to fully implement all 14 points of the revised plan, he said. Pointing to a graphic of the plan on the screen, he said the first point concerned kinetic operations. “Is this being worked on or not? I have presented the data for KP to you. Just in KP, are law enforcement agencies not conducting more than 40 intelligence-based operations?” He asserted that the empirical evidence demonstrated that work was being done on the first point of the NAP. He then went on to question the work being done on the remaining 13 points. “Today, are we all standing under one narrative? Do you not hear voices calling for talks with these terrorists? Are we following this NAP? “Does the solution to all problems lie in dialogue? You tell me. If the solution for every problem is in dialogue, then when India fired missiles on Pakistan on May 6 and 7 … why didn’t the people of this country say let’s hold talks?” If the solution lay in just holding dialogue, there would be no wars, he emphasised. Coming to the fifth point, the military spokesperson said it had been decided to “break the terror-crime nexus” in order to eradicate terrorism. Moreover, he said, it had also been decided to “strengthen the judiciary” with regard to counter-terrorism cases. Then, pulling up another graphic, the DG ISPR detailed the cases in anti-terrorism courts in KP. He said that no one was convicted, while 34 cases were pending. “This is the judicial system that was to be strengthened. The political government of the time decided it, we did not.” The DG ISPR further stated that the decision had been made to strengthen KP police. Noting that the provincial police was currently 3,200-personnel strong, he asked: “ The terrorism (situation) is before you all. Is this [number] enough?“ The army spokesperson also noted that the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan was being “politicised”. “Misleading things were said when these decisions were taken.” He said that after the US left Afghanistan in 2021, “they left behind weapons and ammunition that are now being used by terrorists. Those weapons were found in the custody of terrorists killed in operations in KP.” The DG ISPR replied to a question about how things will change concerning the NAP by saying, “We know how things will change … they will change once we work on this NAP with clarity and in unison. There will be change when those who play politics are asked why they are playing with people’s lives and property and why they are supporting the statements of terrorists.” Last night’s Kabul explosion During the press conference, the DG ISPR was also asked about media reports alleging a strike was carried out in Kabul last night to eliminate the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) leader Noor Wali Mehsud. In his response, he said the army had taken note of the reports circulating on social media and the statement issued by the Taliban spokesperson. “Afghanistan is a neighbourly, Islamic country. We have historical connections, cultural connections. Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for four decades. We only say one thing to the Afghan government: do not allow your soil to be used for terrorism against Pakistan,” he added. He pointed out that trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan was also continuing, and many Afghans came to Pakistan for medical reasons. “So we only have an extremely fair demand: don’t let your soil be used by non-state actors and terrorist groups.” “Is it wrong to ask? It is absolutely fair, it is correct, it is rational, it is our right. And for this, we also engage them at multiple levels,” he said, highlighting several bilateral and multilateral engagements. “Yes, we do engage them and we clearly communicate [to them] … that these are the [terrorist] leaders, their facilitators and their centres [in Afghanistan]. Yes, we engage [with Afghanistan], but at the same time, we are doing and will continue to do whatever is necessary to protect the lives of Pakistan’s people and its territorial integrity,” the DG ISPR continued. When pressed by another reporter for more clarity on alleged strikes in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said, “I have made it clear that Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this. And I have also said that all the necessary steps for protecting the people’s lives and property are being taken and will continue to be taken.” Saudi defence deal and international engagement to curb Afghan terrorism Questioned about the Saudi defence deal and whether the kingdom could be engaged in the talks with Afghanistan to resolve the issue of cross-border militancy, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan continued to engage the country and its other allies even before the pact. “We engage the Afghans directly at multiple levels and also through allied countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, China, US, Turkiye and many more. They all understand that the space being given to non-state actors in Afghanistan is not just against Pakistan.” He said ‘‘every alphabet’’ of non-state actors was found in Afghanistan, pointing to various groups such as the TTP, IS-K, BLA and more. DG Chaudhry said these terrorists had no affiliation or religious or cultural identity and were available to the highest bidder. ’’If you allow these elements space in your country, then every kind of terrorist organisation will be found. That is why we are engaging them because all of them are concerned because this threat from non-state actors is not only a danger to Pakistan or to the region but it is becoming a threat to the whole world.“ He said the Afghan authorities had to decide whether they would allow Afghanistan to become a sanctuary for terrorists or not, adding that history showed that nurturing such groups often led to them turning on their benefactors. DG Chaudhry said such groups were a threat to Afghanistan and its people as well. He said Pakistan’s job was to engage the Afghan authorities and take necessary action to defend and protect the lives of its people. On a question about an international coalition to strike terrorist havens in Afghanistan, he said while such consultations and engagement continued, “we know that your security cannot be granted by external players, while we keep on engaging them, the responsibility to protect your life and property and people is of Pakistan’s state and institutions and military and that is where our first and foremost focus is’’. The DG ISPR also remarked on whether the presence of non-state actors was a product of the transition of the Afghan Taliban from a non-state actor to a state entity, or due to the interference of foreign actors such as India. “Perhaps it is the clout and influence of these non-state actors in Afghanistan that has grown beyond control,” he said. “Perhaps it is the factions within Afghan government who cannot agree on how to resolve this problem. But that is for them to decide.” Past engagement with TTP and change in KP leadership Questioned about past engagement with the TTP and the change in the KP leadership that saw Ali Amin Gandapur stepping down as chief minister, the DG ISPR said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists). Where is this voice coming from? Who is saying this? Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations. ‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations. It is for everyone to see that today, or five years back or six or seven or eight or in any timeframe, who is that person and political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’ DG Chaudhry said the person saying so was responsible for the state in the past but now he was not and yet he still persisted with his stance. “It is absolutely clear that this stance and confusing the people through it that the solution to this problem is not in counterterrorism or operations but in talking to the people who slaughtered your children … is for everyone to see.’’ He said the army, police and children of Pakistan were paying the price for the above ‘‘perverted and criminal thinking’’. DG Chaundry said talks were indeed engaged in but questioned what was the result of it all, pointing to the Afghan Taliban’s promises in the Doha peace talks and their failure to abide by them. Questioned about the change in KP leadership and how it might be signalling a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR said the establishment was itself a part of the state. “Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’ He questioned whether the military could afford distraction by political shenanigans and said the answer was no. Faiz Hameed court martial proceedings Questioned about the court martial proceedings against former spymaster retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, DG Chaudhry said: ‘‘That legal process is ongoing and will come to its logical and just conclusion.’’ To another question about an alleged delay in the court martial proceedings, DG Chaudhry said the matter concerned a former intelligence chief and hence the “gravity” of the matter was high. ’’The state and the institution have to be absolutely and deliberately correct in that. All the requirements of procedure, process and justice have to be met because you would not like to try such an important and critical case in hurry and haste,“ he added. “The Pakistan Army’s system of internal accountability does not work off allegations but facts and evidence. There is a process to it and anybody who is charged is given complete right to defend themselves and that time will be given and is being given, so we are not worried about any delay because we have to fulfill all the requirements of justice and process.’’ He said another reason for the court martial proceedings was that ‘‘when you turn a relation into a political and personal relation, then you will have to answer for that. But who did it? The one who was [heading] the state at the time and doing politics and that is why, we always say not to involve us in your politics.’’ The DG ISPR said all political parties and politicians were respectable for the army but it was unacceptable if anyone considered their politics to be above the state. “If a single person thinks their being is greater than Pakistan, then that is unacceptable.’’ Giving the example of the current state of Indian armed forces and the creeping influence of Hindutva , the military spokesperson said the military was the ‘‘ultimate instrument of violence’’ of the state and politicising it would lead to ‘‘horrible results’’. Issue of US weapons left behind in Afghanistan In response to a question about US weapons in the hands of terrorists, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan was engaged with Washington on the matter. “This equipment is not only being used in Pakistan by Fitna al-Khawarij or Fitna al-Hindustan but the equipment left with non-state actors can be used anywhere,” he explained. “We do share data and engage with them (the US) and they understand how the equipment is used by non-state actors.” Collateral damage during operations In response to a question about collateral damage during operations and criticism by affected locals, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that operations were intelligence-based and “very precise”. “We cannot believe statements about collateral damage because we are the army of Pakistan and KP,” he replied. “If terrorists have taken a family hostage and are firing at innocent people and we respond, does that make it collateral damage or facilitation?” The DG ISPR noted that facilitators, whether they were doing it out of desperation or for financial gain, had three choices: “Turn terrorists over to the law. If that is not possible, then join the state and work to eradicate the threat,” the military spokesperson said. “If a terrorist violates the sanctity of someone’s home by entering it, and you do not force him out, that makes you a facilitator. Where is the collateral damage? there’s no collateral damage. There’s a terrorist and a facilitator.”",

DG Chaudhry said such groups were a threat to Afghanistan and its people as well. He said Pakistan’s job was to engage the Afghan authorities and take necessary action to defend and protect the lives of its people. On a question about an international coalition to strike terrorist havens in Afghanistan, he said while such consultations and engagement continued, “we know that your security cannot be granted by external players, while we keep on engaging them, the responsibility to protect your life and property and people is of Pakistan’s state and institutions and military and that is where our first and foremost focus is’’. The DG ISPR also remarked on whether the presence of non-state actors was a product of the transition of the Afghan Taliban from a non-state actor to a state entity, or due to the interference of foreign actors such as India. “Perhaps it is the clout and influence of these non-state actors in Afghanistan that has grown beyond control,” he said. “Perhaps it is the factions within Afghan government who cannot agree on how to resolve this problem. But that is for them to decide.” Past engagement with TTP and change in KP leadership Questioned about past engagement with the TTP and the change in the KP leadership that saw Ali Amin Gandapur stepping down as chief minister, the DG ISPR said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists). Where is this voice coming from? Who is saying this? Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations. ‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations. It is for everyone to see that today, or five years back or six or seven or eight or in any timeframe, who is that person and political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’ DG Chaudhry said the person saying so was responsible for the state in the past but now he was not and yet he still persisted with his stance. “It is absolutely clear that this stance and confusing the people through it that the solution to this problem is not in counterterrorism or operations but in talking to the people who slaughtered your children … is for everyone to see.’’ He said the army, police and children of Pakistan were paying the price for the above ‘‘perverted and criminal thinking’’. DG Chaundry said talks were indeed engaged in but questioned what was the result of it all, pointing to the Afghan Taliban’s promises in the Doha peace talks and their failure to abide by them. Questioned about the change in KP leadership and how it might be signalling a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR said the establishment was itself a part of the state. “Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’ He questioned whether the military could afford distraction by political shenanigans and said the answer was no. Faiz Hameed court martial proceedings Questioned about the court martial proceedings against former spymaster retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, DG Chaudhry said: ‘‘That legal process is ongoing and will come to its logical and just conclusion.’’ To another question about an alleged delay in the court martial proceedings, DG Chaudhry said the matter concerned a former intelligence chief and hence the “gravity” of the matter was high. ’’The state and the institution have to be absolutely and deliberately correct in that. All the requirements of procedure, process and justice have to be met because you would not like to try such an important and critical case in hurry and haste,“ he added. “The Pakistan Army’s system of internal accountability does not work off allegations but facts and evidence. There is a process to it and anybody who is charged is given complete right to defend themselves and that time will be given and is being given, so we are not worried about any delay because we have to fulfill all the requirements of justice and process.’’ He said another reason for the court martial proceedings was that ‘‘when you turn a relation into a political and personal relation, then you will have to answer for that. But who did it? The one who was [heading] the state at the time and doing politics and that is why, we always say not to involve us in your politics.’’ The DG ISPR said all political parties and politicians were respectable for the army but it was unacceptable if anyone considered their politics to be above the state. “If a single person thinks their being is greater than Pakistan, then that is unacceptable.’’ Giving the example of the current state of Indian armed forces and the creeping influence of Hindutva , the military spokesperson said the military was the ‘‘ultimate instrument of violence’’ of the state and politicising it would lead to ‘‘horrible results’’. Issue of US weapons left behind in Afghanistan In response to a question about US weapons in the hands of terrorists, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan was engaged with Washington on the matter. “This equipment is not only being used in Pakistan by Fitna al-Khawarij or Fitna al-Hindustan but the equipment left with non-state actors can be used anywhere,” he explained. “We do share data and engage with them (the US) and they understand how the equipment is used by non-state actors.” Collateral damage during operations In response to a question about collateral damage during operations and criticism by affected locals, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that operations were intelligence-based and “very precise”. “We cannot believe statements about collateral damage because we are the army of Pakistan and KP,” he replied. “If terrorists have taken a family hostage and are firing at innocent people and we respond, does that make it collateral damage or facilitation?” The DG ISPR noted that facilitators, whether they were doing it out of desperation or for financial gain, had three choices: “Turn terrorists over to the law. If that is not possible, then join the state and work to eradicate the threat,” the military spokesperson said. “If a terrorist violates the sanctity of someone’s home by entering it, and you do not force him out, that makes you a facilitator. Where is the collateral damage? there’s no collateral damage. There’s a terrorist and a facilitator.”",
      "title": "KP govt must protect its people instead of begging Afghanistan for security: DG ISPR",
      "summary": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Friday that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government should work on protecting the people of the province instead of “begging Afghanistan” for security. The DG ISPR made these remarks while addressing a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He said governance gaps in KP were being paid for by the blood of security personnel. “Appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators is never and not a policy,” he asserted, adding that the state and its institutions would not be bothered by “any political distortions”. “The state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of any single person who is singularly the most responsible person for bringing terrorism back to KP.” He said that he hoped the government would focus on governance and the people it was duty-bound to protect. “We also hope that instead of begging Afghanistan for security, you will protect this province and its people.” The DG ISPR began the press conference by paying homage on behalf of the armed forces of Pakistan to the “brave sons of soil” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said the purpose of the press conference was to give an overview of the security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the past two decades, Pakistan, particularly KP, has been facing the issue of terrorism, he said. In 2024, he said, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP, 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians were killed. Moreover, he continued, 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025 until September 15. In these operations, 970 terrorists were killed while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred. When the frequency of terrorism incidents increased in 2021, “the response also went up”, the DG ISPR said. “And more number of kharijis were killed in subsequent years.” The DG ISPR said following the 2014 attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, security forces had started uprooting terrorism as part of a comprehensive strategy. “We reached close to [realising] the dream of a peaceful Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. [But], unfortunately, as part of a plan, terrorists and their facilitators were then provided space here. “Governance and public welfare were deliberately weakened and attempts were made to build a misleading narrative. The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are paying its price with their blood and sacrifices even today.” Factors behind rise of militancy He then outlined the factors that led to this situation. First reason, he said, was not fully implementing the National Action Plan, followed by politicising the issue of terrorism, India using Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the provision of modern weapons to terrorists in Afghanistan and the existence of a “terrorism-crime nexus” that had “complete local and political backing”. Going back to the 2014 APS attack, he said all political parties, and the provincial and federal governments devised the NAP. “All political parties agreed that the implementation of the NAP was necessary for eliminating terrorism.” But, he added, the then-government removed some provisions of the plan in 2021 despite progress in those areas and came up with the “revised” NAP. All political parties, provincial governments and the federal government then agreed to fully implement all 14 points of the revised plan, he said. Pointing to a graphic of the plan on the screen, he said the first point concerned kinetic operations. “Is this being worked on or not? I have presented the data for KP to you. Just in KP, are law enforcement agencies not conducting more than 40 intelligence-based operations?” He asserted that the empirical evidence demonstrated that work was being done on the first point of the NAP. He then went on to question the work being done on the remaining 13 points. “Today, are we all standing under one narrative? Do you not hear voices calling for talks with these terrorists? Are we following this NAP? “Does the solution to all problems lie in dialogue? You tell me. If the solution for every problem is in dialogue, then when India fired missiles on Pakistan on May 6 and 7 … why didn’t the people of this country say let’s hold talks?” If the solution lay in just holding dialogue, there would be no wars, he emphasised. Coming to the fifth point, the military spokesperson said it had been decided to “break the terror-crime nexus” in order to eradicate terrorism. Moreover, he said, it had also been decided to “strengthen the judiciary” with regard to counter-terrorism cases. Then, pulling up another graphic, the DG ISPR detailed the cases in anti-terrorism courts in KP. He said that no one was convicted, while 34 cases were pending. “This is the judicial system that was to be strengthened. The political government of the time decided it, we did not.” The DG ISPR further stated that the decision had been made to strengthen KP police. Noting that the provincial police was currently 3,200-personnel strong, he asked: “ The terrorism (situation) is before you all. Is this [number] enough?“ The army spokesperson also noted that the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan was being “politicised”. “Misleading things were said when these decisions were taken.” He said that after the US left Afghanistan in 2021, “they left behind weapons and ammunition that are now being used by terrorists. Those weapons were found in the custody of terrorists killed in operations in KP.” The DG ISPR replied to a question about how things will change concerning the NAP by saying, “We know how things will change … they will change once we work on this NAP with clarity and in unison. There will be change when those who play politics are asked why they are playing with people’s lives and property and why they are supporting the statements of terrorists.” Last night’s Kabul explosion During the press conference, the DG ISPR was also asked about media reports alleging a strike was carried out in Kabul last night to eliminate the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) leader Noor Wali Mehsud. In his response, he said the army had taken note of the reports circulating on social media and the statement issued by the Taliban spokesperson. “Afghanistan is a neighbourly, Islamic country. We have historical connections, cultural connections. Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for four decades. We only say one thing to the Afghan government: do not allow your soil to be used for terrorism against Pakistan,” he added. He pointed out that trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan was also continuing, and many Afghans came to Pakistan for medical reasons. “So we only have an extremely fair demand: don’t let your soil be used by non-state actors and terrorist groups.” “Is it wrong to ask? It is absolutely fair, it is correct, it is rational, it is our right. And for this, we also engage them at multiple levels,” he said, highlighting several bilateral and multilateral engagements. “Yes, we do engage them and we clearly communicate [to them] … that these are the [terrorist] leaders, their facilitators and their centres [in Afghanistan]. Yes, we engage [with Afghanistan], but at the same time, we are doing and will continue to do whatever is necessary to protect the lives of Pakistan’s people and its territorial integrity,” the DG ISPR continued. When pressed by another reporter for more clarity on alleged strikes in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said, “I have made it clear that Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this. And I have also said that all the necessary steps for protecting the people’s lives and property are being taken and will continue to be taken.” Saudi defence deal and international engagement to curb Afghan terrorism Questioned about the Saudi defence deal and whether the kingdom could be engaged in the talks with Afghanistan to resolve the issue of cross-border militancy, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan continued to engage the country and its other allies even before the pact. “We engage the Afghans directly at multiple levels and also through allied countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, China, US, Turkiye and many more. They all understand that the space being given to non-state actors in Afghanistan is not just against Pakistan.” He said ‘‘every alphabet’’ of non-state actors was found in Afghanistan, pointing to various groups such as the TTP, IS-K, BLA and more. DG Chaudhry said these terrorists had no affiliation or religious or cultural identity and were available to the highest bidder. ’’If you allow these elements space in your country, then every kind of terrorist organisation will be found. That is why we are engaging them because all of them are concerned because this threat from non-state actors is not only a danger to Pakistan or to the region but it is becoming a threat to the whole world.“ He said the Afghan authorities had to decide whether they would allow Afghanistan to become a sanctuary for terrorists or not, adding that history showed that nurturing such groups often led to them turning on their benefactors. DG Chaudhry said such groups were a threat to Afghanistan and its people as well. He said Pakistan’s job was to engage the Afghan authorities and take necessary action to defend and protect the lives of its people. On a question about an international coalition to strike terrorist havens in Afghanistan, he said while such consultations and engagement continued, “we know that your security cannot be granted by external players, while we keep on engaging them, the responsibility to protect your life and property and people is of Pakistan’s state and institutions and military and that is where our first and foremost focus is’’. The DG ISPR also remarked on whether the presence of non-state actors was a product of the transition of the Afghan Taliban from a non-state actor to a state entity, or due to the interference of foreign actors such as India. “Perhaps it is the clout and influence of these non-state actors in Afghanistan that has grown beyond control,” he said. “Perhaps it is the factions within Afghan government who cannot agree on how to resolve this problem. But that is for them to decide.” Past engagement with TTP and change in KP leadership Questioned about past engagement with the TTP and the change in the KP leadership that saw Ali Amin Gandapur stepping down as chief minister, the DG ISPR said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists).

DG Chaundry said talks were indeed engaged in but questioned what was the result of it all, pointing to the Afghan Taliban’s promises in the Doha peace talks and their failure to abide by them.
