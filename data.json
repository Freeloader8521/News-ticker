      "summary_orig": "The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) claimed on Thursday that several of its workers were taken into custody by the Punjab police during the opposition’s street mobilisation campaign. A TTAP delegation had departed from Islamabad to Lahore earlier today as part of the opposition’s “street movement” to hold political and social gatherings in the provincial capital. A post shared by the TTAP on X at around 11am said that the delegation, headed by the alliance’s head Mahmood Khan Achakzai, had left for Lahore. At 3:34pm, the TTAP claimed “dozens” of workers of the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — a part of the alliance — were arrested in Lahore, including Senior Vice President Syed Hussain Kazmi. The son of MWM chief Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, who serves as the TTAP vice chairman, was also taken into custody, the TTAP claimed on X. “Right after the arrest, police officials expressed ignorance and took the stance that he was not in their custody,” the statement added. However, a Gujranwala police official denied the arrest. He told Dawn that Abbas’s son was “stopped for questioning when a car of a PTI rally hit a police constable”, but was then allowed to go ahead. Dawn has reached out to the police for a comment on TTAP’s claims of PTI and MWM workers being arrested. The PTI, in a statement condemning the “fascism and oppression by the Punjab police”, also claimed that “multiple members of delegations present peacefully along the route of the caravan” were being taken into custody. “Peaceful citizens and party workers, who are unarmed and pose no threat of any kind, are being subjected to extremely brutal behaviour by the fascist police acting on political orders,” it alleged. The party further said that the vehicles of its MPAs Malik Fahad, Raja Tanvir and Sardar Muhammad Ali were vandalised at Kharian. “Our ticket holders, organisational officials and workers were arrested at the location of Gujar Khan,” the PTI statement further said. Shortly before noon, the TTAP alleged that the Punjab police had arrested “several” PTI workers and had taken action against its camp in Rawalpindi’s Gujar Khan. It also shared videos showing a police van from the Gujar Khan station and men in police attire carrying batons. In its statement, the PTI also alleged that late-night raids were being carried out on the residences of its workers in Lahore, “as a result of which, worker Rashid Yousuf Jan lost his life during a raid in the area of Hanjarwal”. The PTI demanded that all “unjustly arrested” individuals be immediately released and that those responsible for these “unconstitutional and illegal actions” be held accountable. PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser strongly condemned the vandalism of the TTAP convoy’s vehicles by “masked individuals”, terming the Punjab government “fascist”. “In our opinion, Mian sahib (Nawaz Sharif) who used to harp on about democracy and consider himself a champion of democracy, [why] is he silent on this?” Qaiser asked, adding that Achakzai was among the PML-N president’s “old friends”. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik, in a statement, urged party lawyers to get first information reports (FIRs) registered over the vandalism incidents and “invasion of privacy” through raids. In a post, the PTI said: “Protesters were first surrounded and stopped, vehicles were attacked, windshields were broken, and when a peaceful protest was staged, violence was perpetrated against unarmed citizens.” It also shared multiple videos, one of which showed at least six cars whose back windshields were damaged. The PTI said the “direct responsibility of this action lies with Punjab’s TikToker chief minister and the government elements involved with her”. TTAP convoy enters Gujranwala As per an update from the TTAP’s official X account at 5:20pm, the alliance’s delegation has entered the limits of Gujranwala as it continued its trip towards Lahore. According to Google Maps , the distance from Lahore to Gujranwala via GT Road is 87km — about a two-and-a-half-hour journey. When the TTAP leaders reached Jhelum at around 1:30pm, Senator Abbas spoke to workers there and alleged that the people’s mandate had been stolen in the 2024 elections. “There is economic exploitation now […] and the political crisis is intensifying. We have taken to the streets to end cruelty, […] for the fundamental rights of the people, for the poor, labourers, unemployed and farmers and for all those who are oppressed,“ he said, standing alongside Achakzai. The senator said the alliance would take to the streets against “cruelty” across the country on February 8. In a separate video before his departure to Lahore, Achakzai said, “We are not going to Lahore to conquer, curse at anyone or throw rocks at them; our slogan is that we are setting out to end oppression and cruelty.” Achakzai, who has been nominated as the next opposition leader in the National Assembly, called on the public to stand with the opposition against a Parliament “thrust upon” Pakistan. The TTAP chief stressed that the country was suffering from “endless issues because of ill-intended decisions”. “The government itself knows that it is invalid,” Achakzai said. “In this regard, the TTAP has appealed to people from all walks of life to protest on Feb 8 and come stand with us,” he said, calling on people to “close their shops, rickshaws, and taxis”. “We are starting a peaceful movement and we are here to end oppression,” he reiterated. Standing alongside Achakzai was the opposition leader of the Punjab Assembly, Moeen Qureshi, who extended his welcome to the TTAP chief. “There are a lot of MPAs present here who will accompany Achakzai sahib to Lahore,” he said. He warned Punjab authorities against treating the TTAP delegation the same way as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was treated during his visit to Lahore last month. He also reiterated that the movement would be peaceful. Malik, in a post on X in the morning, “welcomed” the TTAP members to Lahore. The PTI Punjab chief organiser said that her party would accord a “grand welcome” to the guests at nine locations on GT Road. “This peaceful struggle is a struggle for the Constitution and the law,” she wrote. In a post on TTAP’s X account, the alliance’s spokesperson, Hussain Yousafzai, termed the visit a “practice match for the larger movement”. Yousafzai voiced optimism that the visit would give “hope to the PTI workers in Punjab”. At a recent national conference organised by the TTAP alliance, KP CM Afridi had announced the observation of a “black day” at the national and international levels on Feb 8, which will mark the second anniversary of the general elections under which the existing parliament has been functioning. The conference had also highlighted the need for a new Charter of Democracy — agreeing that the option of talks should never be closed — and put forth demands including an “independent” judiciary and election commission, as well as the release of “political prisoners”, which it believed were necessary for restoring stability in the country. Meanwhile, as proposals for talks between the government and the opposition remain in limbo, a clique of politicians — under the banner of the ‘National Dialogue Committee’ (NDC) — on Wednesday called for the release of all political prisoners to reduce acrimony and pave the way for reconciliation.

Lee described the site as the place where Yun \"made a declaration of his country's sovereignty and the dignity of his people.\" \"The bomb that a young man from a small and weak country threw was an outright challenge to the imperialist order of invasion and exploitation, expressing his firm belief that solidarity for peace is possible,\" he wrote.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that it is the government’s duty to work with provinces, especially those which are experiencing challenges, stressing the need for “brotherhood and cooperation”. The premier said this while addressing political leaders in Quetta. PM Shehbaz began his address by stating it was unfortunate that Balochistan had been grappling with terrorism, and added that the role of the armed forces in combating terrorism could not be appreciated enough. “Be it the soldiers and officials of the army, Rangers personnel and officials, or those of Levies, and the common man, their sacrifices will be remembered in history,” PM Shehbaz said. He said the fight against terrorism was ongoing and Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan — were being provided support from our “neighbouring countries, which is unfortunate”. “But, we are firm in our resolve to eradicate terrorism,” he said, lauding CDF for leading this fight. In this connection, he also mentioned the CDF’s role during the military conflict with India in May last year, adding that India had been “taught a lesson which it will never forget”. Speaking about Balochistan’s share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, the premier recalled that in 2010, the then-Balochistan chief minister, Nawab Aslam Raisani, had refused to cooperate unless the province received a 100 per cent increase in its resources. “Balochistan is a beautiful part of Pakistan, and their demand was valid to an extent,” the premier said, adding that it was “obvious that more resources would be needed considering the vast distances within the province”. He recalled that to “fulfil their demand, Punjab took the lead”. “It was our duty to our Baloch brothers and sisters, and the resources in the NFC award are being disbursed in the same way till this day,” he said. “Punjab cut Rs11bn a year from its share and sent it to Balochistan,” he added. He continued: “Today, 16 years have passed since the NFC award, and nearly Rs200bn have been given from Punjab’s own share.” “Because when it comes to family, you sit and make decisions like brothers,” PM Shehbaz said, stressing that “distances between provinces must be bridged”. He further said that the government was building five Danish Schools in Balochistan at the same time,“ hoping that the move will lead to a decline in terrorist elements taking root in the province. “This is our duty: to work with provinces — especially those that are very distant and experiencing challenges — this is the journey of brotherhood and cooperation which we all have to take,” the premier reiterated. “There are no two ways to go about it,” PM Shehbaz stressed. He also maintained that “nobody could match the steps taken by my brother Nawaz Sharif, for the progress and prosperity of Balochistan“. The PM expressed willingness to work with the chief minister of Balochistan, the governor. “We have to work together where there are challenges and come to the table to find solutions, ” the prime minister said.",

      "title_orig": "Terrorists using BYC’s platform to induct Balochistan’s youth into their networks: CTD official",
      "summary_orig": "Balochistan Counter-Terrorism Department’s (CTD) Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Aitzaz Goraya on Thursday said terrorists were using the platform of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC) to induct youth into their networks. Goraya made the remarks while addressing a joint press conference alongside Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat in Quetta, where he gave details about a terrorist arrested during an operation in Panjgur. According to Goraya, the CTD, police and law enforcement agencies arrested a man, Sajid Ahmad alias Shahwaiz, who was a resident of Turbat during the operation. He said the man had received a Master’s degree in Sociology from the International Islamic University in Islamabad, then worked on contract at Zubaida Jalal Government College for three years, before teaching at the University of Turbat. The CTD DIG said Sajid had “remained with BYC and was in constant communication with its leadership”. “One thing that has surfaced prominently is the role of the BYC. Every man or child who is facilitating or [is involved in] what they call a sharing network or intelligence network […] they are somehow linked to the BYC,“ the CTD DIG said. “Besides Sajid, we have also arrested three others against whom we are registering FIRs (first information reports),” Goraya added. He said that one of them was 18-year-old Sarfaraz, who was a resident of Kharan and had been tasked with conducting a recce of the police and their polio duties. “He was also first made to join the BYC, involved in their protests and roadblocks,” the CTD official said, adding that the person who inducted him into BYC was Jahanzaib alias Mehrbaan, aged 20 years. Jahanzaib “not only remained involved in recce but also transportation, including one instance where he transported Rs0.6million of extortion money from Quetta and another when he transported Rs1m, as well as medicines”, DIG Goraya said. He further said that Jahanzaib had been involved in BYC’s roadblocks in Noshki and Kharan. “He participated in the BYC’s so-called missing persons protests and properly organised who to bring and what to post on social media,” the DIG said. According to Goraya, Jahanzaib also “inducted” 18-year-old Bezan into the BYC, following which he joined the so-called Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). Bezan’s brother Shafqat Yar was killed in firing when the Levies force was attacked in Khad Kocha, DIG Goraya said. “He (Bezan) was first inducted into BYC, then he went into BLA.” “All these are those people and children who were subverted, and their minds were used to take them to the other side and assigned these small tasks,” he said. “ Fitna al-Hindustan , they say we do not induct children, we do not use women or children, but again and again we have said — even today we are telling you with evidence — that they first use the platform of BYC and then they take them forward by using children,” the DIG stated. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Goraya said there was a “proper network being run that depends on underage children, as they are not thoroughly checked when going to schools and colleges“. “We must bring these things into their parents’ knowledge,” he stressed, adding that such youngsters would be taken to internment and rehabilitation centres that were being established in Quetta and Turbat, “so we can check how much their minds have been subverted”. “We will hold dialogue with them, provide psychological treatment, and involve their parents and society’s notables. We will take them ahead as an improved, responsible citizen,” the CTD DIG said. He said the terrorists subverted educated people, who had even remained on the government’s payroll, and through them, “many children and students — innocent minds who do not have a sense of what to do — they recruit them to BYC first to brainwash them and then properly induct them into the organisation”. In a joint press conference held with provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind in April last year, DIG Goraya had questioned the legitimacy of BYC, later stating that it is not a registered organisation. The same month, when a protest drive had paralysed the province , Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti termed BYC activists as “abettors” of separatists. Sajid involved with BLA, BLF According to DIG Goraya, Sajid, who was apprehended from Panjgur, had been involved with the BLA and the banned Baloch Liberation Front (BLF). “Their sharing network includes recce of different locations in Turbat by marking them on Google Earth, which he shared with his commander Dostain in our neighbouring country.” The CTD complex, roads going to and from the Turbat airport, and an under-construction high court were among the locations where Sajid allegedly carried out reconnaissance. Goraya detailed that the items recovered from Sajid’s vehicle when he was apprehended included a rocket-propelled grenade, five rockets, two M-16 rifles with 23 magazines and 800 rounds, 20 hand grenades with 22 fuses, 30 C4 explosive slabs, one jacket, remote controls, 13 UBGL rounds, a compass, helmets and 30 feet of detonating cord. Sajid was heading from Panjgur towards Turbat, the officer said. “Not only did [Sajid] share things with them (BYC), but also remained involved in writing subversive literature for them and also posted it on different social media websites and carried out recruitment,” the DIG said. “Other than that, on motivation, Balaj joined BYC, Jalal joined BYC, Hamal joined too, and Hamal also properly joined BLA and remained in contact with him (Sajid). “He (Hamal) also went with him (Sajid) to meet Dostain in our neighbouring country using different routes.” According to DIG Goraya, forensics of Sajid’s mobile phone revealed that a “lot of material of smuggling, also known as Zambad , also came with him, even to the extent of extremely sophisticated weapons, equipment, which were brought through those Zambad and given to their members”. The CTD official said Sajid’s sister-in-law had also been a part of BYC and houses were acquired under her name to dump and transport materials from there. ‘100 persons abroad conspiring against Pakistan’ Meanwhile, the additional chief secretary said a “Red Notice Cell has been activated”, which included the prosecutor general and officials of the CTD and the home department. “They have prepared lists. There are more than 100 people who are abroad and conspiring against Pakistan, promoting and sponsoring terrorist activities in Pakistan, lobbying and doing propaganda,” Shafqaat said. He noted that a court order was needed to forward any person’s name to Interpol. The official explained that to issue a “red notice” for someone, the Balochistan government would first file a charge sheet in the court, which would then declare the person as a proclaimed offender, after which the government would approach the interior ministry to take the process forward. Shafqaat stated that the federal and provincial governments were arranging for more funds to strengthen the CTD. He highlighted that one of the “biggest successful steps” taken in 2025 by the provincial government was the establishment of Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre ( Piftac ), which has been fully functional since December. “We will now establish it on the district level. We are hopeful that by March, all our intelligence and actions will be coordinated.” “Detention centres have been established. Two amendments have been made in the Anti-Terrorism Act, and we will be launching faceless courts in two months,” Shafqaat said.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Thursday that it would be resuming direct Lahore-London flights on March 30. According to a statement issued by the PIA spokesperson, the airline was enhancing its flights to the United Kingdom. “After the resumption of flights to Manchester and the announcement of flights from Islamabad to London from March 29, the airline has also finalised arrangements for the launch of a direct flight from Lahore to London from March 30,” the spokesperson said. He added it would operate up to seven flights to the UK by the end of March. He added that flights were being increased in light of the high demand and long-standing requests of Pakistanis and expatriates residing in the UK. “All flights to the UK are operating on full loads,” he added. The relaunch dates of Islamabad-London and Lahore-London flights were arranged for consecutive dates driven by demand and the airline’s readiness, the spokesperson said. The airline will operate flights three times a week from Islamabad to London and one flight a week from Lahore to London, he said, adding it was also planning to operate more flights from Pakistan to other UK destinations in the future, while flights to London would be increased gradually. He said the airline used to operate more than “22 frequencies” to the UK and expected to exceed this number. In June 2020, the European Union Air Safety Agency had barred PIA from operating in EU countries over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers. The ban on flights followed the then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament, where he termed pilots’ licences “dubious”. The European agency lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28, 2024. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. In September 2025, PIA received the go-ahead to resume direct flights to the UK after a gap of nearly five years. Subsequently, the airline resumed flights to the UK, with flight operations to Manchester resuming in the first phase. Two months ago, the airline announced it was resuming direct flights to London in March 2026 after a six-year hiatus.",

He said the airline used to operate more than “22 frequencies” to the UK and expected to exceed this number. In June 2020, the European Union Air Safety Agency had barred PIA from operating in EU countries over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers. The ban on flights followed the then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament, where he termed pilots’ licences “dubious”. The European agency lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28, 2024. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. In September 2025, PIA received the go-ahead to resume direct flights to the UK after a gap of nearly five years. Subsequently, the airline resumed flights to the UK, with flight operations to Manchester resuming in the first phase. Two months ago, the airline announced it was resuming direct flights to London in March 2026 after a six-year hiatus.",

      "summary": "Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Thursday that it would be resuming direct Lahore-London flights on March 30. According to a statement issued by the PIA spokesperson, the airline was enhancing its flights to the United Kingdom. “After the resumption of flights to Manchester and the announcement of flights from Islamabad to London from March 29, the airline has also finalised arrangements for the launch of a direct flight from Lahore to London from March 30,” the spokesperson said. He added it would operate up to seven flights to the UK by the end of March. He added that flights were being increased in light of the high demand and long-standing requests of Pakistanis and expatriates residing in the UK. “All flights to the UK are operating on full loads,” he added.

The statement said CDF Field Marshal Munir made the remarks while addressing officers during a visit to Lahore Garrison. He also reaffirmed the military’s resolve to respond to evolving challenges with professionalism and determination, it added. “He said the armed forces remained committed to safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and internal stability, while promoting discipline, excellence and selfless national service,” ISPR said. During the visit, where he was received by the Lahore corps commander, CDF Field Marshal Munir was given a comprehensive briefing on the formation’s operational preparedness, training standards and key initiatives to enhance combat efficiency, it said. The statement added that he witnessed a “specialised field training exercise showcasing the latest technologies, underscoring the army’s emphasis on innovation, adaptability to match the dynamic future battlefield”. He also inspected sports and recreational facilities being provided to troops, highlighting their importance in maintaining physical fitness, morale, and overall well-being, it said. CDF Field Marshal Munir also visited a care centre at Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Lahore, lauding the efforts of the medical staff and administration in establishing a fully equipped, state-of-the-art healthcare facility, it added. The CDF‘s remarks come after the military’s spokesperson stated that Afghan­istan had become a hub of terrorists and non-state actors, declaring the ruling Taliban “the mother organisation” which had been harbouring such groups since 2021. In a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, he also spoke at length about souring relations with Afghanistan, the belligerence being witnessed from India, as well as levelling criticism against the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Imran Khan, without explicitly naming the latter. Last month, the army’s top leadership had also warned political forces against undermining national unity through agitation or rhetoric, besides vowing to deal sternly with what it described as India-sponsored proxies involved in terrorism.",

Biman Bangladesh Airlines is scheduled to fly its first Dhaka-Karachi flight on January 29 and will be operated twice weekly, the first regular flights since 2012. “We are relaunching the Dhaka-Karachi route with two weekly flights,” airline manager Bosra Islam told AFP on Thursday. “The resumption of direct flights will significantly improve connectivity between Bangladesh and Pakistan, supporting business travel, tourism, and family reunions,” Biman Bangladesh Airlines said in a statement. Travellers between Bangladesh and Pakistan must currently use connecting flights through Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha. Cargo ships had resumed sailing from Karachi to Bangladesh’s key port of Chittagong in November 2024. Last month, Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider had expressed the hope that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka would start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus. Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly. Recently, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq travelled to Dhaka for the funeral of the country’s first female prime minister Khaleda Zia in December. In August 2025, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had also visitd Dhaka and met Yunus.",

      "summary_orig": "A US immigration officer shot and killed an American woman on the streets of Minneapolis on Wednesday, leading to huge protests and outrage from local leaders who rejected White House claims she was a domestic terrorist. The woman, identified in local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was hit at point blank range as she apparently tried to drive away from agents who were crowding around her car, which they said was blocking their way. Footage of the incident shows a masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fire three times into the Honda SUV, which then hurtles out of control and smashes into stationary vehicles, as horrified onlookers hurl abuse at the federal officers. Her bloodied body is then seen slumped in the crashed vehicle. US President Donald Trump’s administration moved quickly to claim Good had been trying to kill the agents, an assertion Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called “bullsh**” and urged ICE to get out of his city. Thousands of protesters took to the frigid streets of Minneapolis after the shooting, holding signs reading “ICE out of MPLS”, a common abbreviation for the city. ICE’s federal agents have been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s immigrant deportation drive, despite the objections of local officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched an aggressive recruitment campaign last summer to add 10,000 additional ICE agents to the existing 6,000-strong contingent. That sparked criticism that new officers in the field were insufficiently trained. DHS chief Kristi Noem said “any loss of life is a tragedy” but called the incident “domestic terrorism” and said Good “had been stalking and impeding (ICE’s) work all throughout the day”. “She then proceeded to weaponise her vehicle,” she said. Wednesday’s incident came during protest action against immigration enforcement in the southern part of Minneapolis, located in the midwestern state of Minnesota. The Department of Homeland Security, which runs ICE, said on X the victim had tried to run over its officer who fired “defensive shots”. Grisly scene Minnesota’s Governor Tim Walz called the federal government’s response to the incident “propaganda” and vowed his state would “ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation”. Witness Brandon Hewitt heard “three shots”. “I got a bunch of video of them carrying the body to the ambulance,” he told MS NOW . Another witness interviewed by local station FOX9 described a grisly scene. “The surviving passenger got out of the car covered in blood,” the witness said. He recounted seeing a man who identified himself as a doctor attempting to reach Good but being refused access by officers. Anti-ICE protests There have been passionate protests against immigration operations of the Trump administration, which has vowed to arrest and deport what it says are “millions” of undocumented migrants. The DHS called the violence a “direct consequence of constant attacks and demonisation of our officers”. The officer who opened fire, who was released from the hospital following the incident, was rammed and dragged along a road by an anti-ICE protester in June, Noem said. The victim’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper that her daughter “was probably terrified”. Good was “not part of anything like” challenging ICE officers, Ganger added. Trump has made preventing unlawful immigration and expelling undocumented migrants priorities during his second term, and has tightened conditions for entering the United States and obtaining visas. ICE — which critics accuse of transforming into a paramilitary force under Trump — has been tasked with deporting an unprecedented number of undocumented migrants. US authorities said up to 2,000 officers were in Minneapolis for immigration sweeps. A US immigration enforcement officer shot dead an undocumented immigrant in Chicago in September after federal authorities alleged the man tried to resist detention by driving his car into the official.",

      "summary_orig": "• Questions whether critics comprehend the suffering caused by dog attacks • Says a small group should not dictate stray dog policy, which must reflect majority’s will KARACHI: Amid a surge in dog-bite cases across Karachi, Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday signalled that the situation was approaching a tipping point and openly suggested culling as a possible option if the people demanded immediate relief. Responding to questions during an interaction with the media in Ittehad Town, the mayor said public opinion on the issue varied sharply across neighbourhoods, but warned against allowing a small group to dictate policy for a city of over 25 million people. “If I ask people here in Ittehad Colony what should be done about stray dogs, they will say that the dogs should be killed. But if I go to Clifton, there are 10 to 15 people who say, ‘No, this should not happen.’ Those 10 to 15 people impose their way of thinking on 25 million people,” he said. Emphasising the democratic will, Mr Wahab said he believes that “the will of all the people must be considered,” adding, “a handful of individuals cannot be given supremacy over everyone else.” Highlighting the limitations of neutering, he said the method requires time to show results and questioned the criticism faced by authorities when attacks continue during that period. “If neutering is to be done, its impact will take time to appear. Then people should not criticise when dogs bite,” he said. “If the city wants quick results, then culling will have to be carried out. “We are prepared for both options. Hundreds of people have been bitten in just a few days. I appeal to critics to listen to victims and their families before objecting to decisive measures.” Mayor Wahab also pointed to legal hurdles, saying that a small group repeatedly approaches courts to block action and then cited an example from India. “This issue also came up in the Indian Supreme Court, and it resolved it. The court said that instead of neutering, culling should be done,” he said. He questioned whether those opposing culling truly understand the suffering caused by dog attacks. “Ask those people who have actually gone through this experience what they want — culling or neutering?,” he said. Uplift work initiated in West, Keamari districts Earlier, the mayor laid the foundation stones for two major infrastructure development projects in district West and district Keamari, aimed at improving road connectivity, drainage and overall civic facilities in the city. In district West, he inaugurated a mega infrastructure project for the rehabilitation of Hub River Road to Tori Bangash Road in Ittehad Town. The project, with an estimated cost of Rs8 billion, is one of the largest road development initiatives in the area. Speaking at the ceremony, attended by city council members, elected representatives and a large number of locals, the mayor said the project reflects the Karachi Metro­poli­tan Corporation’s (KMC) commitment to inclusive and sustainable urban development. Under the project, Hub River Road will be converted into a 12,500-foot-long dual carriageway, a move expected to significantly ease traffic congestion in District West. A modern drainage system spanning 8,000 feet has been incorporated into the design, along with the installation of more than 21,000 feet of RCC drainage pipelines to improve stormwater management. The completion of the project will eliminate flooding issues in the area, he added. Separately, the mayor also laid the foundation stone for the reconstruction of Sparco Road in District Keamari. The project is being executed at a cost of approximately Rs56m and is described as an important milestone in the city’s urban development efforts. The scheme includes 48,000 square feet of paver blocks and 65,000 square feet of asphalt wearing course, along with a modern sewerage system and a high-quality road structure.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he wanted to increase the US defence budget by half next year to a giant $1.5 trillion to deal with “troubled and dangerous times”. Trump has frequently employed the US military — which is currently funded at record spending levels — since returning to office, including strikes on Yemeni rebels, Iranian nuclear sites and alleged drug-smuggling boats, as well as a brazen special forces raid to abduct Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. “I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars,” Trump said on Truth Social. “This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,” the US president said. Trump said the increase is possible due to revenue from the sweeping tariffs he has imposed on friend and foe alike. The United States is already by far the world’s biggest military spender, and a hike to $1.5 trillion would push Washington’s financial outlay on its armed forces even farther ahead of its rivals China and Russia, though it could also spark an arms race with such countries. Trump slams defence companies Trump’s announcement on boosting the US military budget comes after Nato allies committed last year to increase their defence spending to five per cent of GDP by 2035 in response to pressure from the US president. Even as he announced a budget goal that would be a major boon to defence contractors, Trump took aim at them in posts on Truth Social. Defence contractors are “issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks, at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment,” while pay packages for defence executives are “exorbitant and unjustifiable,” Trump said. The president said salaries should be capped at $5 million and that he would prohibit stock buybacks and dividends “until such time as these problems are rectified,” without specifying how he would do so. The announcement took the markets by surprise, sending US companies in the defence sector — such as Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics — more than four per cent lower. Northrop Grumman lost more than five per cent. Trump took aim at Raytheon specifically, saying the Defence Department told him the company was the “least responsive” to its needs and the “slowest in increasing their volume”. Raytheon must boost its investments in plants and equipment, Trump said, threatening it with a loss of US government business if it does not comply.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources said, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year. The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time of acute financial strain and as Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about US commitments in the Middle East. The mutual defence deal was signed following Israel’s strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region. One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion. The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion. The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the deal. Pakistan’s Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, including on “military cooperation between the two sides”, Saudi media outlet SaudiNews50 said on social media platform X on Monday. Tested in combat Amir Masood, a retired air marshal and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment, including JF-17s and electronic and weapons systems for the jets. He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations. The JF-17’s marketability has been increased because “it is tested and has been used in combat,” he told Reuters , adding that it’s also cost-effective. The aircraft was deployed during the conflict with India last May, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades. The military or finance and defence ministries did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s government media office also did not respond. The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership. Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress. In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6bn support package for Pakistan, including a $3bn deposit at the central bank and $3bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payment. Saudi Arabia has since rolled over deposits multiple times, including a $1.2bn deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures. Arms sales outreach Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry. Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4bn with Libya’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country’s largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft. Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East. On Tuesday, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook. “Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif told Geo News . Pakistan is currently under a $7bn IMF programme , its 24th, which followed a short-term $3bn deal that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Fund’s support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.",

      "summary_orig": "I am an airport person — not because I travel often, but because I love their peculiar atmosphere: the sense of transition, the emotion of crossing borders. Yet I have come to recognise another dimension: airports often capture the essence of the society that built them. Earlier in October, I booked my flight from Berlin to Karachi after completing my postgraduation in Germany. This was not my first time travelling the Berlin-Doha-Karachi route and, like every time, I looked forward to my three-hour layover at the Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar. DOHA’S DOUBLE-EDGED LUXURY A brief stay at this airport feels like a delight for the senses; an artificial tropical garden, endless dining options and other curated attractions look like something from a fairytale. I realise that my liking sits at odds with my sociological leanings. The Doha airport represents all that I dislike about the region’s neoliberal culture: hyper-consumerism, late-stage capitalism and an undue fixation on aesthetics. Yet the airport’s commercial excess coexists with a highly efficient service apparatus. The wait times at immigration and baggage claim in Doha are virtually nonexistent. It is difficult not to appreciate the passenger experience, but anyone critical of the neoliberal paradigm is forced to confront certain questions: who built these terminals, who cleans the facilities, and who helps achieve such a high level of service? What do airports reveal about the societies that build them? Comparing Doha’s opulent excess, Berlin’s democratic modesty and Karachi’s perpetual stagnation offers unexpected insights The answer is clear: migrant workers from South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa form the backbone of Gulf infrastructure. They work long hours constructing these expansive environments, while living under conditions marked by vulnerability, if not outright abuse. In 2022, the kafala [sponsorship] system, which tied workers’ legal status to their employers, was officially abolished in Qatar. Nevertheless, the overall labour rights conditions are still far from adequate. The large migration of workers from other countries also speaks to a reality about where they come from: the lack of employment opportunities and survival options available to Pakistanis, Indians, Filipinos and Ethiopians compel them to migrate to the Gulf. BERLIN’S OLD SCHOOL In contrast to Doha airport, Berlin’s Brandenburg Airport, though modern and efficient, is considerably smaller, with fewer shops and only two or three dining options per terminal. Just like its airport, there is certainly nothing in Berlin approaching the scale of luxury found in Gulf megacities. My two years as a student in Berlin surprised me on several fronts: remarkably few shopping malls, dated infrastructure and the metropolis seemed to be perpetually under construction, with dug-up roads and building sites scattered across neighbourhoods. Local friends explained that this was due to long-delayed government development projects, as a result of which fibre-optic cables were only now being laid beneath the city. For me, this reflected Germany’s adherence to older systems and strict bureaucracy. The story of Brandenburg Airport has parallels to these characteristics: the airport, which was scheduled to open in 2012, missed seven scheduled opening dates and finally opened in 2020. Yet Berlin’s pace of modernisation isn’t just about the challenges of the scale of reconstruction. The city residents, too, have made a choice. Time and again, they have resisted the capitalist development model that prioritises profit over public access. REFLECTION AND COMPARISON Unlike Gulf cities, Berlin resists excessive consumerism. Leisure isn’t gatekept by wealth: museums offer free entry days, galleries and exhibitions operate on donation, making cultural participation possible. The political systems of the two regions come into play here. As a strong democracy, the German state, which charges high taxes from its citizens, is also accountable to them. Gulf states, as described by UK-based Adam Hanieh, the author of Capitalism and Class in the Gulf States, operate as capitalist monarchies. By channelling their oil wealth into urban development, the ruling regimes have successfully built tourist economies, cultivated international investment hubs and, most recently, expanded toward knowledge economies. Without elections or citizen-funded taxes, accountability does not operate through the public. Instead, the state strictly regulates chosen domains: food businesses face hefty fines for violations, littering incurs penalties. The resulting order and efficiency create comfortable conditions, selectively benefitting white-collar expats and wealthy natives. HOMECOMING REALITIES When I landed at the airport of my home city after a 12-hour journey, I was overcome with nostalgia for a few seconds, as Karachi is the city where I spent my early childhood. But as my nostalgia faded, I felt the contrast between Karachi airport and any other international airport, including those of Doha and Berlin. The infrastructure was dated and the stores felt like relics of a bygone era. I saw my suitcase after nearly an hour of waiting, although there were only three flights at 7am on a Saturday. Why does the transport hub of Pakistan’s largest city feel frozen in time? What has prevented its renovation or the construction of a contemporary facility? Jinnah Airport, which opened in 1992, has remained unchanged since its founding. It is, in many ways, a microcosm of Karachi itself: perpetually stuck between what it actually is and what it struggles to become. Major governance challenges dominate Karachi’s urban landscape, where crumbling infrastructure frequently results in life-threatening accidents. Unchecked projects are often abandoned with little consequence. A clear blame rests on the shoulders of negligent authorities, but it is no less true that the general public in Karachi also suffers from an almost criminal lack of civic sense. Yet for all its flaws, Karachi is a city whose capacity to receive, absorb and sustain people from all walks of life is remarkable. Home to at least 21 million people, Karachi has, for generations, accepted people from across Pakistan. Punjabis, Pakhtuns, Sindhis, Baloch, Mohajirs, and Bengalis have all found their way here to seek opportunity, refuge, or simply to survive, and the city has given them space to build lives, however precarious. much said about the need for Pakistan to have an international-standard airport, there is a story to be told about the new Islamabad airport, too. When it was opened in 2018, the Islamabad International Airport, described as ‘world-class’ and ‘state-of-the-art’, was a celebration for Pakistanis. After years of unpleasant experiences at the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport, the consensus was that Islamabad deserves a transportation facility that offers, at the very least, a positive first impression of the capital city. Admittedly, the new airport is a significant step up from its predecessor; it is much larger, better-designed and more efficient. Yet one cannot help but notice the substandard quality of construction and other characteristics that fall short of qualifying it as a truly ‘world-class’ airport. The roofs have a tendency to leak when it rains and the elevators accommodate barely four passengers. A 2025 case study by Dr Bilal Karim, Engr Muhammad Arif and Engr Zafar Ali Khan deemed the airport a “project success” for meeting budget and schedule, but a “business failure” for missing air traffic projections. I contend it fails as a project, too. Aesthetically, the truck art offers a slight saving grace, as it shows an appreciation of the creative labour of local painters and calligraphers. With ample to complain about on the infrastructural front, in truth, my relationship with Karachi — my birthplace — and Islamabad, where I’ve lived, is more fundamental in shaping how I feel about their respective airports. Many hellos and goodbyes have been said here, and my associations are about personal memories, and significant life moments more than anything else. So yes, I’m still an airport person — though the term now encompasses many different meanings.
