      "title_orig": "Afghan forces open fire across border to facilitate infiltration of terrorists into Pakistan: DG ISPR",
      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that Afghan forces open fire at Pakistani checkposts across the border to facilitate the infiltration of terrorists into the country. He made the comments during a briefing with journalists on November 25, a video of which was released by the ISPR on Friday evening. “Borders are always mutually guarded. Both countries [guard] them. Now, on the other side is such a country whose posts first engage your posts through fire, and an exchange begins. And then they have them (terrorists) pass through the gaps in between,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. The DG ISPR said one would barely find any “administration” on the borders in terrorism-prone areas, except in “hardly five to 10 per cent” of the areas. “Go to Tirah, Khyber; you will not find any governance. Neither will you find any courts, nor any departments that deal with law enforcement and writ of the government.” The ISPR chief also pointed out that villages and populations were “divided” across the Pak-Afghan border. “There are 29 tribes here that are divided, whose population is here (Pakistan) and there (Afghanistan) as well. Right on the border. How will you control the movement there?” he asked. He noted that many questioned how terrorists could infiltrate the Pak-Afghan border, how smuggling was carried out, and how non-custom paid vehicles were able to pass through if the army and the Frontier Corps were stationed at the border. The military spokesperson then showed images of border fences. He highlighted that military posts were set up at a distance of about 15-25 kilometres from the border. Noting suggestions for hermetically sealing the border, the DG ISPR questioned whether even the United States, with its vast resources, was able to do the same to its border with Mexico. “What you call a fence has no value in military terms if it is not covered by observation of fire, because someone can hold and cut that obstacle to bridge it,” he said. The military spokesman said building a security post every 2-5km and having drone surveillance would incur a “huge cost”. “You will have to invest in the infrastructure, as well as manpower,” he emphasised. Speaking on the “terror-crime nexus”, the DG ISPR said cells of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on the Pakistani side provided support to this network. Similar to the strategy he explained for terrorists’ infiltration, Lt Gen Chaudhry said there were extremely coordinated attacks on the army and FC deployments on the routes. “[They] attack the posts and have smugglers’ vehicles pass from below,” he said. He further said that non-custom-paid vehicles were a part of this network. “If there are 0.40-0.45 million non-custom-paid vehicles moving in your province, then why do you not stop them? Who is to stop them […] why are they not stopping it, why are they not checking it, whose responsibility is this?” he asked. “The non-customs paid vehicles are part of this political-terror-crime nexus, are being used in vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and by these terrorists in their movement,” the DG ISPR said. ‘Afghan side could not deny evidence presented by Pakistan’ On the Pak-Afghan dialogue that broke down earlier this month, Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted that Pakistan’s stance was “absolutely clear”, with Islamabad conveying that the presence of TTP cells, and their funding and functioning from Afghan soil, was not acceptable. “We presented all kinds of evidence, and they could not deny that evidence. It was absolutely clear to the mediators, as well as to the Afghans there,” the military spokesman highlighted. He said that Pakistan was even open to a “third-party agreement” that would detail a verifiable mechanism to combat cross-border terrorism. He cited a report by the United States’ Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) that said more than $7.2 billion worth of US military equipment had been left behind in the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Lt Gen Chaudhry said the Afghan Taliban had been unable to “convert” themselves into a state after 2021, and were now patronising various non-state actors, including those that were “country-specific and region-specific”. He noted that Fitna Al Khawarij (TTP), Fitna al Hindustan , the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , Al Qaeda and Daesh were among those groups found in Afghanistan. “We say that you need to act like a state now. […] They had said that ‘we will not allow our soil to be used for terrorism’,” the DG ISPR said, adding that the Kabul regime was not representative of the Afghans. The military spokesperson recalled the promises made in the 2020 Doha agreement and asserted that Pakistan had been engaging with the Afghan Taliban since 2021. “Our problem is not with the Afghans. Our problem is with the Afghan Taliban regime,” he added. “Blood and business cannot go together,” he said, stressing that trade had been halted as Pakistan’s security was paramount. During the same briefing, Lt Gen Chaudhry also refuted allegations by the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan had conducted overnight strikes in Afghanistan earlier this week. “In our view, there is only one sort of terrorist which is good, which is a dead terrorist,” he quipped, adding that there was “no distinction” between terrorists. The DG ISPR also highlighted statistics for the repatriation of illegal migrants, stating that 971,604 individuals had been sent back this year so far — 239,574 in November alone — compared to 366,704 people in 2024. ‘Delusional India wants to sell defeat as victory’ Lt Gen Chaudhry also spoke about India during his media talk. “We can’t do anything about a delusional mind,” the DG ISPR said, recalling the Indian army chief’s comments on the May conflict being a “trailer”. “Seven jets were downed, 26 locations were attacked, and the S400 batteries were lost in that ‘trailer’. So, I think now he wants to watch a full horror film,” he said, adding that India wanted to sell its defeat as a victory to its population. “Any country that provides any kind of equipment to the Afghan Taliban, saying they are giving it to their army, you can consider that it is available to the terrorists.” The military spokesperson also highlighted that there were social media accounts based outside of Pakistan that were involved in inciting violence in the country. Using social media platform X’s new feature to show the country a user is located in, Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted certain handles that post about Balochistan. He said the accounts were “doing politics inside Pakistan, and concocting a narrative against the state, against your army, against your leaders”. ‘Seems local population engagement missing in KP’ “All our governments and political parties agree that the solution to terrorism lies in a comprehensive National Action Plan ,” the DG ISPR said. He detailed that there were provincial apex committees chaired by the chief minister with 23 members, a provincial steering committee with 25 members, followed by a division-level monitoring committee, and then a district-level implementation body. Speaking further on the non-kinetic aspects, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that the administration and the military had 140 engagements per day with the local population, including school visits and jirgas. “The actual solution to terrorism lies in these, which the provincial and district governments ought to do […] We feel all this is missing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said. The ISPR chief also noted that 949 projects were underway in 35 districts, and that work was also being carried out on the Green Balochistan Initiative, a part of the Green Pakistan Initiative . The military spokesman highlighted that the smuggling of Iranian diesel was a huge contributor to the “illegal spectrum, the funding of the terrorists”. “Before the army, FC and the provincial government started this crackdown, permits were given for 20.5 million litres per day, or it was smuggled. We have brought it down to the current average of 2.7m litres,“ he said. ‘Over 67,000 IBOs conducted since Jan’ Detailing the counter-terrorism efforts, the DG ISPR said 4,910 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) had been carried out since November 4, amounting to 233 IBOs per day. “The intensity of the kinetic counter-terrorism effort is going up,” he said, noting that 206 terrorists were killed in these operations. Providing a breakdown of the security situation since January, Lt Gen Chaudhry said 67,023 IBOs had been conducted across the country since then. Balochistan had the highest number of such operations, with over 53,000, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had over 12,800, and the rest of the country recorded about 850. The military spokesperson said the country had witnessed 4,729 terrorist incidents since January, with 3,357 in KP, 1,346 in Balochistan and 26 in other regions.

      "summary_en": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that Afghan forces open fire at Pakistani checkposts across the border to facilitate the infiltration of terrorists into the country. He made the comments during a briefing with journalists on November 25, a video of which was released by the ISPR on Friday evening. “Borders are always mutually guarded. Both countries [guard] them. Now, on the other side is such a country whose posts first engage your posts through fire, and an exchange begins. And then they have them (terrorists) pass through the gaps in between,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. The DG ISPR said one would barely find any “administration” on the borders in terrorism-prone areas, except in “hardly five to 10 per cent” of the areas. “Go to Tirah, Khyber; you will not find any governance. Neither will you find any courts, nor any departments that deal with law enforcement and writ of the government.” The ISPR chief also pointed out that villages and populations were “divided” across the Pak-Afghan border. “There are 29 tribes here that are divided, whose population is here (Pakistan) and there (Afghanistan) as well. Right on the border. How will you control the movement there?” he asked. He noted that many questioned how terrorists could infiltrate the Pak-Afghan border, how smuggling was carried out, and how non-custom paid vehicles were able to pass through if the army and the Frontier Corps were stationed at the border. The military spokesperson then showed images of border fences. He highlighted that military posts were set up at a distance of about 15-25 kilometres from the border. Noting suggestions for hermetically sealing the border, the DG ISPR questioned whether even the United States, with its vast resources, was able to do the same to its border with Mexico. “What you call a fence has no value in military terms if it is not covered by observation of fire, because someone can hold and cut that obstacle to bridge it,” he said. The military spokesman said building a security post every 2-5km and having drone surveillance would incur a “huge cost”. “You will have to invest in the infrastructure, as well as manpower,” he emphasised. Speaking on the “terror-crime nexus”, the DG ISPR said cells of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on the Pakistani side provided support to this network. Similar to the strategy he explained for terrorists’ infiltration, Lt Gen Chaudhry said there were extremely coordinated attacks on the army and FC deployments on the routes. “[They] attack the posts and have smugglers’ vehicles pass from below,” he said. He further said that non-custom-paid vehicles were a part of this network. “If there are 0.40-0.45 million non-custom-paid vehicles moving in your province, then why do you not stop them? Who is to stop them […] why are they not stopping it, why are they not checking it, whose responsibility is this?” he asked. “The non-customs paid vehicles are part of this political-terror-crime nexus, are being used in vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and by these terrorists in their movement,” the DG ISPR said. ‘Afghan side could not deny evidence presented by Pakistan’ On the Pak-Afghan dialogue that broke down earlier this month, Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted that Pakistan’s stance was “absolutely clear”, with Islamabad conveying that the presence of TTP cells, and their funding and functioning from Afghan soil, was not acceptable. “We presented all kinds of evidence, and they could not deny that evidence. It was absolutely clear to the mediators, as well as to the Afghans there,” the military spokesman highlighted. He said that Pakistan was even open to a “third-party agreement” that would detail a verifiable mechanism to combat cross-border terrorism. He cited a report by the United States’ Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) that said more than $7.2 billion worth of US military equipment had been left behind in the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Lt Gen Chaudhry said the Afghan Taliban had been unable to “convert” themselves into a state after 2021, and were now patronising various non-state actors, including those that were “country-specific and region-specific”. He noted that Fitna Al Khawarij (TTP), Fitna al Hindustan , the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , Al Qaeda and Daesh were among those groups found in Afghanistan. “We say that you need to act like a state now. […] They had said that ‘we will not allow our soil to be used for terrorism’,” the DG ISPR said, adding that the Kabul regime was not representative of the Afghans. The military spokesperson recalled the promises made in the 2020 Doha agreement and asserted that Pakistan had been engaging with the Afghan Taliban since 2021. “Our problem is not with the Afghans. Our problem is with the Afghan Taliban regime,” he added. “Blood and business cannot go together,” he said, stressing that trade had been halted as Pakistan’s security was paramount. During the same briefing, Lt Gen Chaudhry also refuted allegations by the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan had conducted overnight strikes in Afghanistan earlier this week. “In our view, there is only one sort of terrorist which is good, which is a dead terrorist,” he quipped, adding that there was “no distinction” between terrorists. The DG ISPR also highlighted statistics for the repatriation of illegal migrants, stating that 971,604 individuals had been sent back this year so far — 239,574 in November alone — compared to 366,704 people in 2024. ‘Delusional India wants to sell defeat as victory’ Lt Gen Chaudhry also spoke about India during his media talk. “We can’t do anything about a delusional mind,” the DG ISPR said, recalling the Indian army chief’s comments on the May conflict being a “trailer”. “Seven jets were downed, 26 locations were attacked, and the S400 batteries were lost in that ‘trailer’. So, I think now he wants to watch a full horror film,” he said, adding that India wanted to sell its defeat as a victory to its population. “Any country that provides any kind of equipment to the Afghan Taliban, saying they are giving it to their army, you can consider that it is available to the terrorists.” The military spokesperson also highlighted that there were social media accounts based outside of Pakistan that were involved in inciting violence in the country. Using social media platform X’s new feature to show the country a user is located in, Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted certain handles that post about Balochistan. He said the accounts were “doing politics inside Pakistan, and concocting a narrative against the state, against your army, against your leaders”. ‘Seems local population engagement missing in KP’ “All our governments and political parties agree that the solution to terrorism lies in a comprehensive National Action Plan ,” the DG ISPR said. He detailed that there were provincial apex committees chaired by the chief minister with 23 members, a provincial steering committee with 25 members, followed by a division-level monitoring committee, and then a district-level implementation body. Speaking further on the non-kinetic aspects, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that the administration and the military had 140 engagements per day with the local population, including school visits and jirgas. “The actual solution to terrorism lies in these, which the provincial and district governments ought to do […] We feel all this is missing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said. The ISPR chief also noted that 949 projects were underway in 35 districts, and that work was also being carried out on the Green Balochistan Initiative, a part of the Green Pakistan Initiative . The military spokesman highlighted that the smuggling of Iranian diesel was a huge contributor to the “illegal spectrum, the funding of the terrorists”. “Before the army, FC and the provincial government started this crackdown, permits were given for 20.5 million litres per day, or it was smuggled. We have brought it down to the current average of 2.7m litres,“ he said. ‘Over 67,000 IBOs conducted since Jan’ Detailing the counter-terrorism efforts, the DG ISPR said 4,910 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) had been carried out since November 4, amounting to 233 IBOs per day. “The intensity of the kinetic counter-terrorism effort is going up,” he said, noting that 206 terrorists were killed in these operations. Providing a breakdown of the security situation since January, Lt Gen Chaudhry said 67,023 IBOs had been conducted across the country since then. Balochistan had the highest number of such operations, with over 53,000, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had over 12,800, and the rest of the country recorded about 850. The military spokesperson said the country had witnessed 4,729 terrorist incidents since January, with 3,357 in KP, 1,346 in Balochistan and 26 in other regions.

      "summary_orig": "Sri Lanka made an appeal for international assistance on Saturday as the death toll from heavy rains and floods triggered by Cyclone Ditwah rose to 123, with another 130 reported missing. The extreme weather system has destroyed nearly 15,000 homes, sending almost 44,000 people to state-run temporary shelters, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said. Director-General Sampath Kotuwegoda said relief operations had been strengthened with the deployment of thousands of troops from the army, navy and air force. “We have 123 confirmed dead and another 130 missing,” Kotuwegoda told reporters in Colombo. Cyclone Ditwah was moving away from the island on Saturday and was heading towards neighbouring India to the north, but it had already left massive destruction in its wake. “Relief operations with the help of the armed forces are underway,” Kotuwegoda said. Fresh landslides hit the central district of Kandy, 115 kilometres east of Colombo, with the main access road under water at several locations. “Fibre optic cables have snapped at many places and mobile phones are not working because base stations have been flooded,” a DMC official told AFP. He said a special unit had been deployed to restore communication lines, as several remote areas remained inaccessible by road after mudslides in tea-growing mountainous regions. The government issued an appeal for international help and asked Sri Lankans abroad to make cash donations to support nearly half a million affected people Officials said Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya had met with Colombo-based diplomats to update them on the situation and seek the help of their governments. PM says Pakistan ready to extend support India was the first to respond, sending two planeloads of relief supplies, while an Indian warship already in Colombo on a previously planned goodwill visit donated its rations to help victims. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences over the loss of lives in Sri Lanka and said New Delhi was ready to send more aid. “We stand ready to provide more aid and assistance as the situation evolves,” Modi said on X. Meanwhile, Priem Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan was ready to extend “any support in rescue, recovery and relief efforts as a symbol of our solidarity with our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters”. “Pakistan stands in solidarity with the people and government of Sri Lanka in this hour of grief,” he said. Flooding in low-lying areas worsened on Saturday, prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders for those living along the banks of the Kelani River, which flows into the Indian Ocean from Colombo. The Kelani burst its banks on Friday evening, forcing hundreds of people into temporary shelters, DMC said. Rain had eased in most parts of the country, including the capital, but parts of the island’s north were still experiencing showers due to the residual effects of Cyclone Ditwah. DMC officials said they expected flood levels to exceed those recorded in 2016, when 71 people were killed nationwide. This week’s weather-related toll is the highest since June last year, when 26 people were killed following heavy rains. In December, 17 people died in flooding and landslides. The worst flooding Sri Lanka has experienced since the turn of the century occurred in June 2003, when 254 people were killed.",

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences over the loss of lives in Sri Lanka and said New Delhi was ready to send more aid. “We stand ready to provide more aid and assistance as the situation evolves,” Modi said on X. Meanwhile, Priem Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan was ready to extend “any support in rescue, recovery and relief efforts as a symbol of our solidarity with our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters”. “Pakistan stands in solidarity with the people and government of Sri Lanka in this hour of grief,” he said. Flooding in low-lying areas worsened on Saturday, prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders for those living along the banks of the Kelani River, which flows into the Indian Ocean from Colombo. The Kelani burst its banks on Friday evening, forcing hundreds of people into temporary shelters, DMC said. Rain had eased in most parts of the country, including the capital, but parts of the island’s north were still experiencing showers due to the residual effects of Cyclone Ditwah. DMC officials said they expected flood levels to exceed those recorded in 2016, when 71 people were killed nationwide. This week’s weather-related toll is the highest since June last year, when 26 people were killed following heavy rains. In December, 17 people died in flooding and landslides. The worst flooding Sri Lanka has experienced since the turn of the century occurred in June 2003, when 254 people were killed.",

      "summary_orig": "No loss of life was reported after two separate blasts targeted a police checkpoint and a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) vehicle on Quetta’s Qambrani Road. Police said the first blast occurred near a police checkpoint in the area around Qambrani Road, when unknown motorcyclists hurled a grenade at the post. A second blast, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), took place in the same area as miscreants targeted a CTD vehicle that was heading towards the scene of the first explosion. However, the vehicle escaped the IED blast and all CTD officials remained safe, police said. Police added that the IED was fixed to a motorcycle, adding that a remote was used to detonate it. The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) , in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces. Three explosions were reported across Balochistan yesterday, with one person injured in a blast in Kachhi district’s Mach Town. Another two blasts took place at Major Chowk in Mastung, which were followed by an exchange of fire between armed men and security forces. Earlier this week, the Jaffar Express escaped an armed attack while passing through the Bolan Pass area of Kachhi distr­i­­ct. The incident marked the sixth attack on the train during the past one and a half months. On September 30, at least 10 people , including four personnel, lost their lives and 33 were injured when a bomb blast ripped through a busy street near Quetta’s Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters.",

      "summary_orig": "Hong Kong on Saturday mourned the 128 people known to have died in a massive fire at a high-rise apartment complex, a toll that is likely to rise with 200 others still unaccounted for days after the disaster. Authorities have arrested 11 people in connection with the city’s worst blaze in nearly 80 years as they investigate possible corruption and the use of unsafe materials during renovations at the Wang Fuk Court complex. Rescue operations at the site in the district of Tai Po, near the border with mainland China, concluded on Friday, though police say they may find more bodies as they search the burnt-out buildings as part of ongoing investigations. The fire started on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly engulfed seven of the eight 32-storey blocks at the complex, which were wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and green mesh and layered with foam insulation for the renovations. Search for bodies continues Authorities have said the fire alarms at the estate, home to more than 4,600 people, had not been working properly. Hong Kong leader John Lee, other officials and civil servants, all dressed in black, stood in silence for three minutes early on Saturday outside the central government offices, where flags were lowered to half-mast. Condolence books have been set up at 18 points around the former British colony for the public to pay their respects. “Our most heartfelt thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones and with those that are now living with shock and uncertainty,” Britain’s King Charles said in a statement about the “appalling tragedy”. At Wang Fuk Court, police officers from the disaster victim identification unit, wearing white overalls, helmets and oxygen masks, entered one of the charred buildings to continue their search for remains. They climbed over mounds of bamboo scaffolding that had fallen during the disaster and around large puddles of water created after firemen doused the buildings for days to try to lower the temperatures inside. Families and mourners gathered to lay flowers while some faced the grim task of looking at photographs of the dead taken by rescue workers. Authorities said on Friday that only 39 of the 128 dead had been identified. Hong Kong’s Lee has said the government would set up a HK$300 million ($40m) fund to help residents, while some of China’s biggest listed companies have pledged donations. Hundreds of volunteers have also mobilised to help the victims, sorting and distributing items from nappies to hot food. They formed teams to collect, transport and distribute goods in round-the-clock shifts and have set up a sprawling support camp for displaced residents beside a shopping mall across from the complex. Domestic workers from Indonesia and the Philippines were also caught up in the tragedy. Hong Kong has around 368,000 such workers, mostly women from low-income Asian countries who live with their employers, often in cramped spaces. Indonesia said six of its citizens died in the incident. The Philippines said one of its nationals is critically injured, another is confirmed missing, and 28 are thought to be residents of the area but their whereabouts are unknown. Deadliest blaze since 1948 The fire is Hong Kong’s deadliest since 1948, when 176 people died in a warehouse blaze, and has prompted comparisons to London’s Grenfell Tower inferno, which killed 72 people in 2017. Residents of Wang Fuk Court were told by authorities last year that they faced “relatively low fire risks” after complaining repeatedly about fire hazards posed by ongoing renovation, the city’s Labour Department told Reuters. The residents had raised concerns in September 2024, including about the potential flammability of the protective green mesh contractors had used to cover the bamboo scaffolding, a department spokesperson said. Hong Kong’s anti-graft body said it had arrested eight people on Friday, including an engineering consultant, a scaffolding subcontractor and an intermediary. Earlier, police arrested two directors and an engineering consultant of Prestige Construction, a firm identified by the government as doing maintenance on Wang Fuk Court for more than a year, on suspicion of manslaughter for using unsafe materials, including flammable foam boards blocking windows. Prestige did not answer repeated calls for comment. Public anger over the fire has so far been muted, a stark contrast to mass pro-democracy protests of 2019 that prompted Beijing to tighten its grip on the city. Yet some frustrated volunteers handed out flyers near the estate on Friday, demanding proper resettlement of affected residents, an overhaul of government oversight of construction projects, and an independent probe into the blaze. As with other major fire incidents like Grenfell, analysts say pressure for answers may quickly spread beyond the construction firms to government regulators. The Hong Kong government has traditionally staged open inquiries into large-scale tragedies, often headed by an independent judge.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: A judicial magistrate on Friday granted the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) a four-day physical remand of Sohrab Barkat, an Islamabad-based digital media journalist, in a case of spreading misinformation about state institutions. A team of NCCIA produced the journalist before the magistrate at district courts and sought his physical remand for 30 days. The investigating officer said physical custody of the suspect was required for the recovery of social media accounts and completion of investigation. A counsel for the suspect opposed the remand request, saying the journalist was illegally offloaded and arrested from Islamabad airport when he was going abroad to attend a United Nations conference. He said the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) told a court in Islamabad that there was no case registered against the journalist. But later he was booked in the cybercrime case. The counsel argued that there was a delay of 24 hours in the production of the suspect before the court. He said the suspect had not committed any offence. He pointed out that the alleged derogatory remarks were made by PTI activist Sanam Javed, who was a guest in a programme hosted by the journalist for a digital media channel. In his order, Magistrate Naeem Wattoo noted that the record shows that the suspect is nominated in the FIR registered on Aug 5 and an inquiry has been decided against him. He said the suspect was even declared a proclaimed offender after obtaining arrest warrants from the court. “Therefore, it cannot be said that this case was registered for justifying his arrest on alleged offloading,” the magistrate held in his order, approving a four-day physical remand of the journalist. The magistrate directed the NCCIA to produce the suspect again on Dec 2. Published in Dawn, November 29th, 2025",

      "title_orig": "Situationer: What jail rules say about meetings with ‘political prisoners’",
      "summary_orig": "WHILE the government insists that it has provided all possible facilities to Imran Khan, a key cabinet minister claimed on Friday that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s quest to meet his incarcerated party leader was in violation of the jail manual. Information Minister Atta Tarar’s assertion prompted an indignant response from the PTI, which maintains that their court-decreed schedule of meetings — on Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured. In separate remarks, Parliamentary Secretary Barrister Danyal Chaudhry also termed the KP CM’s demand “to seek political guidance from a convicted individual… a clear violation of prison laws”. But what does the jail manual actually say about prisoners’ visitation rights, and do political prisoners enjoy more leeway than others? These and other ancillary questions have doubtless popped up in the minds of many observers. Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings Former and current prison officials Dawn spoke to said that all prisoners in Punjab’s jails — including political prisoners — are allowed meetings with five people per week, including their lawyers and relatives. In addition, they are allowed 30 minutes of phone time per week. Even condemned prisoners are eligible to meet their lawyers and family members once a week, along with 30 minutes of phone time, which is exercised through the several public call offices (PCOs) that are operational in Adiala jail. Officials say jail authorities have the ability to conduct ‘automatic monitoring’ of prisoners’ phone conversations, so they can listen to any communication made by any prisoner, when necessary. In addition, political prisoners are kept in special cells under strict security, and their medical check-up is supposed to be conducted on a daily basis to ensure that they are in good health. ‘Subjective’ rules However, the rules stipulate that these meetings are linked to the “prisoner’s behaviour”, i.e. their obedience to prison rules, making their enforcement necessarily subjective. According to officials, certain serious offenses, such as terrorism and involvement in anti-state activities, could render an inmate ineligible for these provisions. A retired senior officer from the prison department told Dawn that according to the rules, the decision whether or not to allow an incarcerated or under trial prisoner access to his/her lawyers or relatives was at the discretion of the concerned jail superintendent. If the incarcerated prisoner’s behaviour is ‘not good’, it will be up to the jail authorities to disallow meetings or telephonic conversations. In addition, the visitation rights of any prisoners, especially political ones, can be suspended if the government apprehends unrest or a law and order situation. This could be a major stumbling block for the PTI, as prison authorities have repeatedly complained about the conduct of Mr Khan’s visitors, especially taking issue with the press conferences that Aleema Khan or others hold after meeting with the incarcerated party founder. In recent weeks, these have often culminated in sit-ins and protests outside the prison, which the jail authorities could cite as a potential law and order risk. In his remarks, Barrister Danyal Chaudhry maintained that jail meetings are only possible under judicial orders. However, the PTI maintains that in spite of a court-ordered meeting schedule, jail authorities were arbitrarily disallowing meetings with the inmate. However, PM’s aide Senator Rana Sanaullah seemed to strike a softer note , voicing his support for meetings between incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his family members, albeit subject to certain conditions. “There should be permission for meetings and they should definitely take place, but a 90-minute press conference cannot take place after an hour’s meeting; no law allows this,” he told Geo News on Friday. Past precedent One official said that many political prisoners — like PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif , his daughter Maryam Nawaz and son-in-law Safdar Awan — had availed the telephone facility during their imprisonment, thanks to ‘good behaviour’. The PML-N leader used to keep a stopwatch with him while talking to his family members or others to monitor the time, he recalled. In addition, a seasoned journalist who had visited several political prisoners in different jails across the country in the past — such as Javed Hashmi and ex-PM Yousuf Raza Gilani — said that visitors were only allowed to meet prisoners with their consent. He explained that, on scheduled meeting days, prisoners generally provide the jail authorities with a list of their guests or visitors, which is then scrutinised and approved by the jail superintendent. At times, the journalist recalled, they had to identify themselves as “family members” or “a friend of the prisoner” to avoid being denied access. Party infighting over who controls the all-important list, which contains the names of those who would be allowed to meet the prisoner has also not helped the PTI’s cause, as Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and Barrister Ali Zafar have previously found themselves at odds over the issue.

      "summary_en": "WHILE the government insists that it has provided all possible facilities to Imran Khan, a key cabinet minister claimed on Friday that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s quest to meet his incarcerated party leader was in violation of the jail manual. Information Minister Atta Tarar’s assertion prompted an indignant response from the PTI, which maintains that their court-decreed schedule of meetings — on Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured. In separate remarks, Parliamentary Secretary Barrister Danyal Chaudhry also termed the KP CM’s demand “to seek political guidance from a convicted individual… a clear violation of prison laws”. But what does the jail manual actually say about prisoners’ visitation rights, and do political prisoners enjoy more leeway than others? These and other ancillary questions have doubtless popped up in the minds of many observers. Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings Former and current prison officials Dawn spoke to said that all prisoners in Punjab’s jails — including political prisoners — are allowed meetings with five people per week, including their lawyers and relatives. In addition, they are allowed 30 minutes of phone time per week. Even condemned prisoners are eligible to meet their lawyers and family members once a week, along with 30 minutes of phone time, which is exercised through the several public call offices (PCOs) that are operational in Adiala jail. Officials say jail authorities have the ability to conduct ‘automatic monitoring’ of prisoners’ phone conversations, so they can listen to any communication made by any prisoner, when necessary. In addition, political prisoners are kept in special cells under strict security, and their medical check-up is supposed to be conducted on a daily basis to ensure that they are in good health. ‘Subjective’ rules However, the rules stipulate that these meetings are linked to the “prisoner’s behaviour”, i.e. their obedience to prison rules, making their enforcement necessarily subjective. According to officials, certain serious offenses, such as terrorism and involvement in anti-state activities, could render an inmate ineligible for these provisions. A retired senior officer from the prison department told Dawn that according to the rules, the decision whether or not to allow an incarcerated or under trial prisoner access to his/her lawyers or relatives was at the discretion of the concerned jail superintendent.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump has announced that he is terminating all executive actions, proclamations, and directives issued during the presidency of his predecessor Joe Biden that were signed using a mechanical signature device known as an autopen. According to The Guardian , the autopen, which was patented in the US in 1803, is a robotic device that replicates signatures of a person using real ink. The decision comes amid a broader political offensive, including renewed attacks on immigration and personal criticism of Biden. Trump has often sought to drum up outrage over Biden’s alleged use of autopen to sign pardons, executive orders and other documents — accusing Biden of being too senile to govern while in power. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday, Trump wrote: “Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92 per cent of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect.” “The Autopen is not allowed to be used if approval is not specifically given by the President of the United States,” he said. Trump insisted that “the Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him”. “I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,” he said. He claimed that “Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury”. The autopen is widely accepted in Washington as an administrative tool, but Trump has said their use under Biden proves the then-president was mentally incapacitated and not in control of the White House. Biden was 82 when he left office, while Trump is 79 and due to leave office in January 2029. Previous presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower and Gerald Ford to Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden have all used the device for routine correspondence, and in some cases for urgent legislation while travelling. Obama famously used the autopen in 2011 to sign an extension of the Patriot Act while abroad, and George W. Bush also relied on it extensively for letters, condolence messages, and routine certifications. For decades, the device has been considered a practical convenience, not a constitutional issue. In 2005, the US Department of Justice issued a legal opinion confirming that a president’s approval, rather than physical signing, is what validates executive actions. Legal and political implications Trump’s declaration challenges long-standing legal precedent. In US administrative law, the validity of a presidential action rests on intent and approval, not the method of signature. Courts have consistently upheld this principle for decades. Legal experts say that without concrete evidence that Biden did not authorise the documents, Trump’s blanket cancellation order is likely to face immediate judicial scrutiny. Federal agencies, still bound by the Administrative Procedure Act, could be caught in uncertainty over which rules remain valid. If courts rule that autopen signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten ones, many of Trump’s cancellations could be struck down. Politically, the move reinforces Trump’s effort to delegitimise the previous administration and consolidate power in the Oval Office. It mirrors his public vow to “take back control from the Deep State” and forms part of a broader strategy to dismantle Biden-era policies on immigration, climate, education, workplace rules, and foreign aid. Democrats have criticised the move as a manufactured legal crisis, while Republicans argue it corrects a “procedural abuse”. Congressional Democrats are expected to challenge the decision through hearings and potential legislation. Impact on foreign relations The cancellations could also affect US relations abroad, creating uncertainty over the validity of executive actions. Biden-era commitments — including climate cooperation, refugee resettlement, student visas, trade facilitation, and security coordination — may now face ambiguity. Diplomatic observers note that foreign governments may seek clarifications about bilateral agreements and cooperative frameworks. Officials in Washington have expressed concern that retroactively voiding executive actions could undermine long-term confidence in US policy continuity, with implications for allies and partners, including countries like Pakistan, where immigration and visa matters are of direct concern. Trump’s focus on the autopen highlights the highly personalised and confrontational nature of current US politics. While the immediate legal effect of his actions remains uncertain, the decision adds to domestic political polarisation and introduces potential disruption in international relations.

Speaking at a press conference at the Edhi headquarters at Meethadar on Friday, Rashina could not hold back her tears as she thanked all for coming to her aid. “I’m a poor woman. The government of Pakistan had imposed a 22 lac rupees fine on me for illegally overstaying in Pakistan. I didn’t even have money to pay for my return ticket to Sri Lanka, what to say of the heavy fine,” she said. “But God is great. God sent me help in all these people who made it possible for a destitute widow to reunite with her orphaned children,” she said. Sharing her story, Rashina said that she is a born Muslim from Sri Lanka, who found employment as a telephone operator at a travel agency in Kuwait. It was there that she met Javed Iqbal of Mian Channu, Punjab. “We fell in love and got married. Later, we moved to Saudi Arabia where we lived for some 15 years. We have three children, two daughters, Mumtaz and Aneesha, and a son Mohammed Rafay,” she said. In Saudi Arabia, later, when her husband lost his job, he desperately tried to find another but being unable to do so he was deported to Pakistan while Rashina was deported to Sri Lanka with their children. “Leaving my children in the care with my family in Colombo, I came to Pakistan on a visit visa to meet my husband in Mian Channu. But his family would not accept me. We left Punjab to come to Karachi where we found a small rented place. I know I should have returned to Sri Lanka when my visa expired but by then my husband had become seriously ill. His liver was failing. Then he passed away. That was in 2007. I have tried to return home to my children since then but I couldn’t without first paying a 22 lac rupees fine imposed on me for overstaying my welcome,” she informed. Rashina set to reunite with family in Colombo following legal aid and charity support “Having no place to go I would turn up at Saylani Welfare Trust for meals. There I met a volunteer, Anis Abdul Hafeez, who offered me a place to stay with his family in Surjani Town because I had no place to stay. When I fell sick, I reached out to Saylani again, and their chief trustee Arif Lakhani arranged for my heart bypass surgery. My hospital stay and medical bills were also taken care of by Saylani. They also tried to find me legal help. But we were getting nowhere. Not knowing what else to do, I started protesting outside the Karachi Press Club,” she said. Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Edhi said: “That was when some journalists alerted my son Saad Edhi about Rashina’s plight. “I then reached out to our regular legal counsel Advocate Zia Ahmed Awan for help,” Faisal Edhi told Dawn . Advocate Zia Awan said that they reached out to the Ministry of Interior but to no avail. “Hope finally came when we approached the Constitutional Bench of the Sindh High Court which ordered for the Interior Secretary to appear before it. That was when Rashina’s hefty fine was waived and she was ordered to leave Pakistan within 15 days,” the able advocate reported. As Arif Lakhani of Saylani had already got her Sri Lankan passport renewed, it was only a matter of him buying her a one-way air ticket to Colombo. With that arranged, Rashina is now all set to board her flight back home from Karachi on December 2. “You are all welcome to Colombo. You will stay with me there. My children, who are half Pakistani, and I will love to have you,” Rashina told Zia Awan, Faisal Edhi, Arif Lakhani, Anis Abdul Hafeez and even the members of the media who had come to cover her story. Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Edhi and Advocate Awan urged the government to look into waiving off the hefty fines imposed on aliens stuck in this country only because they don’t have money to pay the fines. “When they want to go home we should also not let such hurdles come in their way,” Faisal Edhi said.

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Quetta police have conducted 80 intelligence-based operations over the last month and a half, arresting dozens of suspects in connection with murder, robbery and vehicle theft rings while recovering millions in stolen assets, top officials announced on Friday. Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Imran Shoukat and SSP Serious Crime Investigation Wing Imran Qureshi detailed the successes at a press conference at the Police Lines, emphasising a broad crackdown on crime to protect citizens’ lives and property. In one major success, the Serious Crime Investigation Wing dismantled an interprovincial gang that stole vehicles from Sindh and brought them to Balochistan, arresting four members and recovering 20 vehicles. The wing also solved five blind murder cases and arrested suspects in several robberies, seizing stolen goods, cash, weapons, mobile phones and a large quantity of narcotics. Overall, Quetta police arrested 12 suspects in various murder, theft and robbery cases. The arrests included three suspects in the murder of Imad Kakar: a woman identified as Atiya Rehman, Roman Ilyas and Babar Ali. City’s DIG details successes at a press conference The shop from which the unlicensed murder weapon was purchased has been sealed, officials said. Detailing other operations, DIG Shoukat said police arrested suspects Abdullah and Ibrahim for looting more than Rs20 million from a warehouse after holding a guard hostage in the Sariab area. More than 80 per cent of the stolen goods were recovered. In a separate house robbery case, police arrested Fayyaz Ali, Sabir Ali and Muhammad Salman, recovering over Rs7m in gold jewellery, valuables and cash. In another incident, suspects Najibullah, Janan and Rahmatullah were arrested for snatching Rs11.8m, which was also recovered. Officials said cases have been registered against all arrested suspects and legal proceedings have been initiated. DIG Shoukat issued a stern warning against illegal activities, linking them to terrorist financing and vowing to hold his own officers accountable. “Money generated from drugs and illegal Iranian petrol is being used for terrorism,” Shoukat said, adding that station house officers (SHOs) have been directed to eradicate all illegal activities, including gambling and the sale of Iranian petrol. “If illegal activities are found during raids, the SHO of that area will be suspended and action will be taken against him.” Both officials paid tribute to officers who have died in the line of duty and stressed that public support is crucial for lasting security.

The ruckus by PTI lawmakers, alarmed by social media reports about Mr Khan’s condition, dominated the day’s proceedings. They chanted slogans and hit their desks, demanding that family members, doctors and lawyers be allowed to meet with Mr Khan after what they called a “complete blackout for weeks”. Syed Ali Zafar, the PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate, sought an explanation from the government about the reports. “The tension level of the public has risen so high that there will be an explosion if the matter was not resolved immediately,” Mr Zafar warned. He added that the party’s senators would not participate in proceedings until a minister provided a clear response. “We will not become part of the proceedings till the minister concerned comes and responds,” he said before PTI senators staged a walkout. While the government gave no assurance on allowing visits, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry rejected the social media reports as baseless. Imran Khan “is in good health, facing no threat to his life, and is being provided with all facilities”, Chaudhry said, relaying information from the superintendent of Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where the ex-premier is being held. The minister claimed Afghan media initially spread the “fake stories,” which he said were then amplified by Indian media. The minister’s statement failed to satisfy the opposition. “We will not let the proceedings continue,” one lawmaker said. “You cannot threaten like this,” Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani responded. The proceedings were briefly adjourned when the House was found to be one member short of a quorum. After business resumed, PTI members continued their protest, chanting “release Imran Khan”. Meanwhile, the government laid the money bill — the Income Tax (Third Amendment) Bill, 2025 — before the House, to make recommendations on it to the National Assembly, as required under Article 73 of the Constitution. The chair referred the bill to the Standing Committee for Finance and Revenue for further consideration Later in the session, PTI Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, when called upon to move an item on the agenda, spoke instead on Imran’s health and rejected claims that meetings with the former leader were taking place, saying their leader had been kept behind bars unjustly and on frivolous charges. The session chairman, Shahadat Awan of the PPP, eventually deferred the remaining agenda items after a minister expressed an inability to respond in the noisy environment.

The minister’s statement failed to satisfy the opposition. “We will not let the proceedings continue,” one lawmaker said. “You cannot threaten like this,” Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani responded. The proceedings were briefly adjourned when the House was found to be one member short of a quorum. After business resumed, PTI members continued their protest, chanting “release Imran Khan”. Meanwhile, the government laid the money bill — the Income Tax (Third Amendment) Bill, 2025 — before the House, to make recommendations on it to the National Assembly, as required under Article 73 of the Constitution. The chair referred the bill to the Standing Committee for Finance and Revenue for further consideration Later in the session, PTI Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, when called upon to move an item on the agenda, spoke instead on Imran’s health and rejected claims that meetings with the former leader were taking place, saying their leader had been kept behind bars unjustly and on frivolous charges. The session chairman, Shahadat Awan of the PPP, eventually deferred the remaining agenda items after a minister expressed an inability to respond in the noisy environment. He then adjourned the House to meet again on Monday at 4pm. Published in Dawn, November 29th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• UN condemns Israeli incursion; Damascus calls it a ‘war crime’ • Execution of Palestinians in Jenin termed ‘summary execution’ • E4 condemns settlers’ violence in occupied West Bank JERUSALEM/DAMASCUS: Israeli military killed 13 people in a raid on a village in Syria on Friday which Damascus called a criminal attack, and in the occupied West Bank it injured three Palestinians in its ongoing operation in a Palestinian refugee camp. The Israeli military claimed six soldiers were wounded, three of them severely, during an incursion in the village of Beit Jinn. Israel frequently bombed Syria when it was ruled by Assad and stepped up its military operations in the country after he was ousted, citing goals that include keeping fighters away from the frontier. Syrian state news agency SANA , which reported 13 people killed and dozens wounded, said Israeli forces shelled Beit Jinn and Israeli troops entered the village. Residents confronted the Israeli forces, which responded, leading to “violent clashes”. Syria’s foreign ministry said the Israeli attack killed more than 10 civilians, including women and children, damaged property and forced residents to flee their homes, accusing Israel of committing a “full-fledged war crime”. Walid Akasha, a local official in Beit Jinn, denied there were any terrorist factions there. Meanwhile, Najat Rochdi, the UN’s Deputy Special Envoy for Syria, condemned Israel’s incursion as “a grave and unacceptable violation of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, further destabilising an already fragile environment”. Three injured in West Bank Separately, Israeli continued its military operation in Far’a refugee camp in occupied West Bank, injuring three people on Friday. According to Al Jazeera , the Palestinian Red Crescent Society transported three injured people out of Tubas. Israeli tank fire injured one child in the Rafah area, according to local Palestinian media reports. Israeli forces have started tearing down homes and buildings in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. The operation follows an earlier warning from the Israeli military that troops would raze 24 structures in the camp, which it said is required for “operational” purposes. ‘Summary execution’ The United Nations said on Friday that the killing of two Palestinians , shot dead in occupied West Bank while seemingly surrendering to Israeli forces, was an “apparent summary execution”. “We are appalled at the brazen killing by Israeli border police yesterday (Thursday) of two Palestinian men in Jenin,” UN rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told reporters in Geneva, calling the incident “yet another apparent summary execution”. He said UN rights chief Volker Turk was calling for “independent, prompt and effective investigations into the killings of Palestinians”, and for those responsible for killings and other violations in Israeli-occupied West Bank to “be held fully to account”. Meanwhile, France, Germany, Italy and UK have demanded Israel to abide by international law and protect Palestinians in West Bank as illegal Israeli settler attacks reached their peak in nearly two decades. According to Middle East Monitor , the foreign ministers of four countries, commonly known as the E4, in a joint statement strongly condemned the massive increase of settler violence against Palestinian civilians and called for stability in the occupied West Bank.

      "summary_orig": "UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said on Friday that Pakistan’s “hastily adopted” constitutional amendments seriously undermine judicial independence and raise grave concerns about military accountability and respect for the rule of law. In a statement issued in Geneva, the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society. Turk warned that the amendments run counter to the separation of powers that underpin the rule of law and safeguard the protection of human rights in Pakistan. “Under the changes adopted on November 13, a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) has been given powers over constitutional cases, replacing the previous authority of the Supreme Court, which will now only deal with civil and criminal cases,” the statement read. It added that the systems for appointing, promoting and transferring judges changed in a manner raising “serious concerns about undermining the structural independence of Pakistan’s judiciary”. Turk noted that the president and prime minister had already assigned the chief justice and the first set of FCC judges. “These changes, taken together, risk subjugating the judiciary to political interference and executive control,” Turk was quoted as saying. “Neither the executive nor legislative should be in a position to control or direct the judiciary, and the judiciary should be protected from any form of political influence in its decision-making. “A core measure of judicial independence is a tribunal’s insulation from political interference by the government. If judges are not independent, experience shows that they struggle to apply the law equally and to uphold human rights for all in the face of political pressure.” The UN also noted that the 27th amendment establishes lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrest for the president, field marshal, marshall of the air force and admiral of the fleet. “Sweeping immunity provisions like these undermine accountability, which is a cornerstone of the human rights framework and democratic control of the armed forces under the rule of law,” Turk was quoted as saying. “I am concerned that these amendments risk far-reaching consequences for the principles of democracy and rule of law which the Pakistani people hold dear.” On November 13, the president signed the 27th Constitutional Amendment into law hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest. Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.” The House first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”. The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on November 10 and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate to consider the latest changes.",

      "summary_orig": "Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah voiced support on Friday for meetings between incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his family members, subject to certain conditions. Imran has been in jail since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence on corruption charges. His family and party members have protested outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding a meeting but have been repeatedly denied despite orders from the courts. Imran’s sister Aleema Khan filed a contempt of court petition against the Adiala jail superintendent and others over their failure to comply with an earlier Islamabad High Court (IHC) order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for the incarcerated former premier. Speaking on the matter in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’, Sanaullah said: “There should be permission for meetings and they should definitely take place, but a 90-minute press conference cannot take place after an hour’s meeting; no law allows this.” He further said that political discussions could also not take place in the meetings, saying that no law allowed a prisoner to lead, plan and guide movements on the outside from jail. The senator maintained that it was not permitted for family members to hold press conferences outside the prison premises and for a barrage of messages to appear on social media against the state and officials. Sanaullah argued that the IHC’s order to facilitate meetings was also contingent on similar conditions as he laid out. “They (Imran’s family and legal team) should sit down with jail authorities and settle matters,” he said, saying that the process of meetings should be better conducted without violations from either side. Sanaullah later said the meetings were not being allowed because they were not being conducted in accordance with the law. “The meeting should be in accordance with the law,” he maintained, reiterating that there should be no violation from either side. The contempt petition was filed after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, along with several other PTI members, staged an overnight sit-in outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi. The sit-in was staged as CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the eighth time on Thursday. Previously, Imran’s sisters, including Aleema, had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier. The PTI ended its latest sit-in on Friday morning, with the KP CM announcing that they would be approaching the IHC, where Aleema filed the contempt plea. Meetings not subject to whims or wishes: Barrister Aqeel Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said meetings could not be held on anyone’s ‘whims or wishes’. He said meetings could only be held under existing prison rules and the prerogative in this regard rests with the superintendent. Malik added that the prison administration could curtail a prisoner’s privilege to have meetings “in the public interest” if a necessary cause was found. However, he did not elaborate on the criteria by which the Adiala jail superintendent decides when to allow meetings or not. Malik also maintained that the rules prevented any political discussion. Questioned about the KP chief minister’s threat to launch a protest on Tuesday if a meeting was not allowed, the minister said the government would take the necessary measures in such a situation.",

      "summary_orig": "An Afghan national accused of shooting two National Guard members will be charged with first-degree murder, a US official said Friday, after one of the soldiers died of her wounds as Donald Trump pledged to suspend migration from “third-world countries.” The announcement marks an escalation in charges facing the assailant, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who the US media said was part of the “Zero Units” — a CIA-backed Afghan paramilitary force. “There are certainly many more charges to come, but we are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree,” Jeanine Pirro, the attorney for Washington, DC, told the Fox News programme ‘Fox & Friends’. “It is a premeditated murder. There was an ambush with a gun toward people who didn’t know what was coming.” Pirro’s announcement comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi pledged on Thursday to “seek the death penalty” against Lakanwal, describing him as a “monster.” Pirro said Lakanwal opened fire with a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver on a group of guardsmen on patrol just a few blocks from the White House on Wednesday, the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday. Sarah Beckstrom, a 20-year-old West Virginia National Guard member deployed in the US capital as part of Trump’s crackdown on crime, died from her wounds, the president said on Thursday. He said the other soldier wounded in the attack, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, was “fighting for his life”. “We still have hope,” Pirro said of Wolfe. “He’s still in critical condition. We are doing everything we can to assist his family.” The shooting has brought together three politically explosive issues: Trump’s controversial use of the military on American soil, immigration, and the lingering legacy of the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan — America’s longest war. ‘Rigorous reexamination’ Late on Thursday, Trump pledged on Truth Social to “permanently pause” migration from “all Third World Countries” and threatened to reverse “millions” of admissions granted under his predecessor Joe Biden, in a new escalation in his anti-immigration stance. When asked which specific nationalities would be affected, the US Department of Homeland Security pointed AFP to a list of 19 countries — including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran and Myanmar — facing US travel restrictions under a previous order from Trump in June. Separately, Joseph Edlow, Trump’s director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said on Thursday he had ordered a “full-scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.” When asked to specify the countries, the USCIS referred AFP to the same list of 19 countries. US National Guard soldiers gather near a crime scene after a shooting in downtown Washington, DC, the US on November 26. — AFP More than 1.6 million US green card holders, roughly 12 per cent of the total permanent resident population, were born in the countries listed, according to the latest immigration data available on the agency’s ‘Eligible to Naturalise Dashboard’ analysed by AFP . Afghanistan, which has over 116,000 green card holders, is also affected by a total halt of immigration application processing, ordered by the Trump administration after the shooting. CIA director John Ratcliffe said the suspect, Lakanwal, had been part of a CIA-backed “partner force” fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. He added that he had been brought to the United States as part of a program to evacuate Afghans who had worked with the agency after the Taliban toppled the American-backed government in 2021. Lakanwal had been living in the western state of Washington with his family and had driven across the country to the capital, officials said. The heads of the FBI, CIA and Homeland Security and other senior Trump appointees all insisted that Lakanwal had been granted unvetted access to the US because of lax asylum policies in the wake of the chaotic final US withdrawal from Afghanistan under former president Biden. However, AfghanEvac, a group that helped resettle Afghans in the US after the military withdrawal, said they had undergone “some of the most extensive security vetting” of any migrants.",
