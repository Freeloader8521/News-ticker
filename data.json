      "title_orig": "‘Just the beginning’: Journalists, politicians react to Faiz Hameed’s sentencing",
      "summary_orig": "In a rare conviction, former spymaster Faiz Hameed was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years rigorous imprisonment under the Army Act. Hameed, who served as the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency from 2019 to 2021, was under trial since August last year. The statement released by the military’s media affairs wing stated Hameed was found guilty of charges related to engaging in political activities, violation of the Official Secret Act detrimental to safety and interest of the state, misuse of authority and government resources and causing wrongful loss to persons. However, his troubles may not be over as the statement added that his “involvement of [the] convict in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”. Here is what analysts and politicians have to say. ‘Took political engineering to its peak’ Senior journalist Shahzeb Khanzada, while speaking to Geo News, was of the opinion that “Pakistan has always had a problem of political engineering, but Faiz Hameed took it to its peak”. “He set a precedent for manipulating the judiciary,” Khanzada said, recalling the disqualification of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. The journalist also held Hameed responsible for “harming the country, democracy, media, judiciary, and his own institution”. Khanzada noted that out of the four charges mentioned in the statement released by the ISPR today, “legal proceedings against him regarding his involvement in politics remain to be seen”. “Faiz Hameed is a character in Pakistan’s history who left no stone unturned in harming the country, democracy, and in misusing his authority,” Khanzada added. ‘Good beginning’ Journalist Mubashir Zaidi, reacting to the decision, said that Hameed’s conviction was a “good beginning”. “Life sentencing of former ISI chief Gen Faiz Hameed for involvement in politics is a good beginning. There shouldn’t be any room for the military’s involvement in politics,” he said. ‘Ominous and critical’ Meanwhile, journalist Khurram Husain termed the last paragraph in ISPR’s press release “critical and ominous”. The paragraph states that the former spymaster’s involvement in “fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”. According to Husain, “It could point towards using Faiz Hameed’s testimony to convict [former prime minister] Imran Khan on charges of conspiring to incite mutiny within the armed forces.” ‘Historic decision’ PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the sentencing of the ex-spymaster a “historic decision”. Speaking to the media in Chiniot, he said Hameed was “today being held answerable for his crimes”. View this post on Instagram Mentioning Hameed’s alleged “interference [in politics]” and “irresponsible acts”, he said that if today’s decision was implemented, it would be a “clear message that such mistakes will not be committed again”. ‘Just the beginning’ Senator Faisal Vawda hailed the decision, stating that “it was only the beginning” as charges pertaining to May 9 riots still remained to be seen. Speaking to Geo News, Vawda thanked the Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir for “removing the filth” from his own institution, stressing that the move had laid down the “foundation for self-accountability”. He further said that those responsible for facilitating violent protests in the country on May 9 would also be weeded out. He cautioned that if the armed forces were “not sparing one of their own, then do you think the others will stay safe?” “This is just the beginning,” he said, adding that “a lot of charges were still pending”. “And within the radius of the charges will be the PTI, and their leaders who think they are bigger than Pakistan, the judges from that time, and people who have now distanced themselves. “It will be a long, winding process of justice,” the senator warned. ‘No one should be a sacred cow’ Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan also hailed the conviction, questioning if “similar action will be taken against other generals too”. In a post on X, he said, “It’s a very good thing that a decision has been taken against a general … no one should be a sacred cow, whether it be a judge, a general, a bureaucrat, or a politician.” He called for “transparent, fair and public” accountability to prevail. ‘Far-reaching impact on politics’ Journalist Mazhar Abbas, in a post on social media platform X, said that today’s decision was likely to have a “far-reaching impact on Pakistani politics”. “One has to wait and see what follows next. Today’s decision would certainly have a far-reaching impact on Pakistan’s politics.

      "summary_en": "In a rare conviction, former spymaster Faiz Hameed was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years rigorous imprisonment under the Army Act. Hameed, who served as the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency from 2019 to 2021, was under trial since August last year. The statement released by the military’s media affairs wing stated Hameed was found guilty of charges related to engaging in political activities, violation of the Official Secret Act detrimental to safety and interest of the state, misuse of authority and government resources and causing wrongful loss to persons. However, his troubles may not be over as the statement added that his “involvement of [the] convict in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”. Here is what analysts and politicians have to say. ‘Took political engineering to its peak’ Senior journalist Shahzeb Khanzada, while speaking to Geo News, was of the opinion that “Pakistan has always had a problem of political engineering, but Faiz Hameed took it to its peak”. “He set a precedent for manipulating the judiciary,” Khanzada said, recalling the disqualification of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. The journalist also held Hameed responsible for “harming the country, democracy, media, judiciary, and his own institution”. Khanzada noted that out of the four charges mentioned in the statement released by the ISPR today, “legal proceedings against him regarding his involvement in politics remain to be seen”. “Faiz Hameed is a character in Pakistan’s history who left no stone unturned in harming the country, democracy, and in misusing his authority,” Khanzada added. ‘Good beginning’ Journalist Mubashir Zaidi, reacting to the decision, said that Hameed’s conviction was a “good beginning”. “Life sentencing of former ISI chief Gen Faiz Hameed for involvement in politics is a good beginning. There shouldn’t be any room for the military’s involvement in politics,” he said. ‘Ominous and critical’ Meanwhile, journalist Khurram Husain termed the last paragraph in ISPR’s press release “critical and ominous”. The paragraph states that the former spymaster’s involvement in “fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”. According to Husain, “It could point towards using Faiz Hameed’s testimony to convict [former prime minister] Imran Khan on charges of conspiring to incite mutiny within the armed forces.” ‘Historic decision’ PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the sentencing of the ex-spymaster a “historic decision”. Speaking to the media in Chiniot, he said Hameed was “today being held answerable for his crimes”. View this post on Instagram Mentioning Hameed’s alleged “interference [in politics]” and “irresponsible acts”, he said that if today’s decision was implemented, it would be a “clear message that such mistakes will not be committed again”. ‘Just the beginning’ Senator Faisal Vawda hailed the decision, stating that “it was only the beginning” as charges pertaining to May 9 riots still remained to be seen. Speaking to Geo News, Vawda thanked the Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir for “removing the filth” from his own institution, stressing that the move had laid down the “foundation for self-accountability”. He further said that those responsible for facilitating violent protests in the country on May 9 would also be weeded out. He cautioned that if the armed forces were “not sparing one of their own, then do you think the others will stay safe?” “This is just the beginning,” he said, adding that “a lot of charges were still pending”. “And within the radius of the charges will be the PTI, and their leaders who think they are bigger than Pakistan, the judges from that time, and people who have now distanced themselves. “It will be a long, winding process of justice,” the senator warned. ‘No one should be a sacred cow’ Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan also hailed the conviction, questioning if “similar action will be taken against other generals too”. In a post on X, he said, “It’s a very good thing that a decision has been taken against a general … no one should be a sacred cow, whether it be a judge, a general, a bureaucrat, or a politician.” He called for “transparent, fair and public” accountability to prevail. ‘Far-reaching impact on politics’ Journalist Mazhar Abbas, in a post on social media platform X, said that today’s decision was likely to have a “far-reaching impact on Pakistani politics”. “One has to wait and see what follows next.

      "summary_orig": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday summoned the Norwegian ambassador to Pakistan and urged him to “adhere to the established norms of diplomatic engagement” after his “unwarranted” attendance at a court hearing today. Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsaas attended the Supreme Court hearing of rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts. The diplomat’s presence during the court proceedings generated a lot of chatter on social media. The ministry, in its statement, said the Scandinavian country’s top representative was summoned by the additional foreign secretary (Europe). He was informed that his presence breached “diplomatic protocol and relevant international law”. “Noting that his actions amount to interference in the internal affairs of the country, the Ambassador was urged to adhere to the established norms of diplomatic engagement, as outlined in the relevant articles of the Vienna Convention,” said the statement. However, Imaan defended the envoy’s presence during the court hearing today on social media. Responding to a journalist who termed the presence of the ambassador as a “breach of diplomatic norms”, Imaan said, “Who is going to explain to this genius that diplomats routinely observe court proceedings — that is not equivalent to them taking a position on any case. “This is a standard practice but it’s very clear where the pressure is coming from to malign the ambassador,” she said. Imaan and her husband are facing a trial under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca) — had moved an application in the SC requesting the urgent hearing of their appeal against the IHC’s refusal to grant interim relief. The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under Peca. The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The two have already filed a criminal revision before the IHC challenging the trial proceedings on grounds of due process violations under the CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in their absence.",

      "summary_orig": "The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday stayed trial proceedings against rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts until their pending appeals were decided by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The court issued the directives as a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar and comprising Justice Salahuddin Panwhar and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, heard Imaan’s appeal seeking to set aside the IHC’s Dec 1 order refusing to grant interim relief by staying the trial in the case. Imaan and her husband Abdul Hadi Mohammad Ali — who are facing a trial under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca) — had moved an application in the SC requesting the urgent hearing of their appeal against the IHC’s refusal to grant interim relief. The petitioners have already filed a criminal revision before the IHC challenging the trial proceedings on grounds of due process violations under the CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in their absence. During today’s SC proceedings, Justice Kakar, while dictating the order, said, “We expect the IHC to decide on the fate of the petition after providing a full opportunity of hearing to both parties.” The order stayed the trial court proceedings, which were scheduled to resume on Dec 15 by Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka. Imaan and her husband were represented by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi whereas Additional Attorney General (AAG) Rana Asadur Rehman opposed the maintainability of the appeal. During the hearing, Justice Kakar observed that it was common practice for the plaintiff to devise their own strategies to fight the case, but the court would neither belittle nor undermine the trial court judge. Meanwhile, Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsas also attended the proceedings, which caused a lot of chatter on social media. Responding to a journalist who termed the presence of the ambassador as a “breach of diplomatic norms”, Imaan said, “Who is going to explain to this genius that diplomats routinely observe court proceedings — that is not equivalent to them taking a position on any case. “This is a standard practice but it’s very clear where the pressure is coming from to malign the ambassador,” she said. The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under Peca. The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.",

      "summary_orig": "An attack on a school in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali subdivision earlier this week has jeopardised the future of more than 600 school-going children, it emerged on Thursday. On Monday night, unidentified militants blew up a government primary school in the Khushali area of Ayaz Kot. Unknown attackers had planted explosives in the school and detonated them late on Monday night. The powerful blast, which was heard miles away, destroyed a significant portion of the school building. Education department officials confirmed that more than 600 students were enrolled in the institution, which served as the only functional primary school in the area. Authorities said the remaining sections of the building have been cordoned off, while an emergency plan for alternate learning arrangements is under consideration. Local elders and parents expressed deep concern, calling attacks on educational institutions “a direct assault on the future of children”. “This school was the only beacon of hope for our children. Its destruction has shocked the entire community,” an area elder said. As per the police, evidence had been collected from the site, and the Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU) was assessing the type of explosive used. Initial findings suggest that the device was detonated either through a remote-controlled or a timed mechanism. Security officials stated that the area has been cordoned off and a search operation has been launched. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far. The district administration condemned the incident as an “anti-education act,” saying, “Such attacks hinder peace and development in the region. Those responsible will be brought to justice soon.” The incident comes weeks after Cadet College Wana came under a terrorist attack in South Waziristan. In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat district partially damaged the building. Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Tehsil Shewa of North Waziristan district. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up . No loss of life was reported in the incidents.",

      "title_orig": "Ex-spymaster Faiz Hameed sentenced to 14 years under Army Act, involvement in political agitation being dealt with separately: ISPR",
      "summary_orig": "Former chief of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Faiz Hameed has been sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment by a military court, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday. In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that the process of Field General Court Martial (FGCM) was initiated against Hameed on August 12, 2024 under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act, spanning over 15 months. “The accused was tried on four charges related to engaging in political activities, violation of the Official Secret Act detrimental to safety and interest of the state, misuse of authority and government resources and causing wrongful loss to persons. “After lengthy and laborious legal proceedings, the accused has been found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment,” ISPR said. It added that the sentence was “promulgated on December 11, 2025”. During proceedings against the ex-spymaster, the FGCM complied with all legal provisions, and Hameed was “afforded with all legal rights, including [the] rights of [a] defence team of his choice”, it added. The convict has the right of appeal at a relevant forum, ISPR said. According to Section 133B of the Army Act , a person to whom a court-martial has handed out a sentence of imprisonment exceeding three months may appeal against their conviction to a court of appeals “consisting of the [chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces] or one or more officers designated by him in this behalf”. It states that the appeal may be filed “within 40 days from the date of announcement of finding or sentence or promulgation thereof, whichever is earlier”. ISPR also said that the “involvement of convict (Hameed) in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”. Today’s development comes two months after ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said, in response to a question about Hameed, that legal proceedings were ongoing and would come to a “logical conclusion”. “The Pakistan Army’s system of internal accountability does not work off allegations but facts and evidence. There is a process to it and anybody who is charged is given the complete right to defend themselves and that time will be given and is being given, so we are not worried about any delay because we have to fulfil all the requirements of justice and process,” he had said at a press conference in Peshawar on October 10. Hameed, a former lieutenant general, was taken into custody in August 2024, as the military announced the initiation of FGCM proceedings against him. The move was prompted by allegations of misconduct levelled by the owner of a private housing society and had shattered the long-standing perception that spy chiefs were untouchable in the country where generals have long wielded unparalleled influence. In Dec 2024, a military court indicted Hameed on three accounts — engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority. The indictment marked the start of the trial of the former intelligence chief before a FGCM. At the time, the ISPR had said that “events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading to multiple incidents including, but not limited to May 9, 2023, for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests” were also being investigated. On May 9, 2023, violent protests were witnessed across the country following the arrest of former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan, during which military installations were also vandalised. ‘Hameed given full opportunity to defend himself’ After Hameed’s sentencing was announced, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the former spy chief had also been penalised in the Top City case, in which Hameed was accused of misusing his position to extort money from a private housing society. In a statement, Tarar said in a statement that the conviction of the ex-ISI chief was based on “evidence”. “Today, the person who crossed the red line has been punished,” he added. The minister said Hameed was given “full opportunity” to defend himself during the trial and produce witnesses. “After the statements of all witnesses were recorded and evidence was presented, a just verdict has been issued.” Tarar further asserted that no one was above the law and legal action would be taken against anyone “who crosses the red line”. He said Hameed had “misused his authority, and there will be further investigations into political matters”. The minister also alleged that Hameed had been the PTI’s “political adviser”. Tarar further stated: “The process of self-accountability within the army is very strong, and everyone has now seen a clear example of it. […] Today’s decision is a victory of truth and justice.” Separately, speaking to Geo News , Tarar said today’s decision was “historic”. He further stated that proceedings against Hameed spanned 15 months. “It is a long duration. [During this time,] evidence and proofs were presented. And after the due process of law, this is a historical decision was made,” he added. The minister said that after Hameed’s retirement from the army, he was prohibited from getting involved in politics. “But, he became PTI’s political adviser. He gave the party [his] full support,” Tarar repeated his allegation. Asked whether any further action would be taken against Hameed, Tarar emphatically replied: “Yes, definitely.” He went on to allege that “as a political adviser to PTI, he (Hameed) conspired against the country and spread anarchy to a great extent”. “So much so that even beyond events like May 9, there are serious issues that will be investigated further against him. Another probe is underway into the extent and nature of Hameed’s involvement in politics. “It’s not hidden that he was advising PTI and trying to weaken the state’s writ,” Tarar said. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reacted to Hameed’s sentencing in a post on social media platform X. The minister commented in the post that the “nation will reap the harvest of seeds sown by Faiz Hameed sahib and [former army chief] Bajwa for years”.",

In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that the process of Field General Court Martial (FGCM) was initiated against Hameed on August 12, 2024 under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act, spanning over 15 months. “The accused was tried on four charges related to engaging in political activities, violation of the Official Secret Act detrimental to safety and interest of the state, misuse of authority and government resources and causing wrongful loss to persons. “After lengthy and laborious legal proceedings, the accused has been found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment,” ISPR said. It added that the sentence was “promulgated on December 11, 2025”. During proceedings against the ex-spymaster, the FGCM complied with all legal provisions, and Hameed was “afforded with all legal rights, including [the] rights of [a] defence team of his choice”, it added. The convict has the right of appeal at a relevant forum, ISPR said. According to Section 133B of the Army Act , a person to whom a court-martial has handed out a sentence of imprisonment exceeding three months may appeal against their conviction to a court of appeals “consisting of the [chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces] or one or more officers designated by him in this behalf”. It states that the appeal may be filed “within 40 days from the date of announcement of finding or sentence or promulgation thereof, whichever is earlier”. ISPR also said that the “involvement of convict (Hameed) in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”. Today’s development comes two months after ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said, in response to a question about Hameed, that legal proceedings were ongoing and would come to a “logical conclusion”. “The Pakistan Army’s system of internal accountability does not work off allegations but facts and evidence. There is a process to it and anybody who is charged is given the complete right to defend themselves and that time will be given and is being given, so we are not worried about any delay because we have to fulfil all the requirements of justice and process,” he had said at a press conference in Peshawar on October 10. Hameed, a former lieutenant general, was taken into custody in August 2024, as the military announced the initiation of FGCM proceedings against him. The move was prompted by allegations of misconduct levelled by the owner of a private housing society and had shattered the long-standing perception that spy chiefs were untouchable in the country where generals have long wielded unparalleled influence. In Dec 2024, a military court indicted Hameed on three accounts — engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority. The indictment marked the start of the trial of the former intelligence chief before a FGCM. At the time, the ISPR had said that “events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading to multiple incidents including, but not limited to May 9, 2023, for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests” were also being investigated. On May 9, 2023, violent protests were witnessed across the country following the arrest of former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan, during which military installations were also vandalised. ‘Hameed given full opportunity to defend himself’ After Hameed’s sentencing was announced, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the former spy chief had also been penalised in the Top City case, in which Hameed was accused of misusing his position to extort money from a private housing society. In a statement, Tarar said in a statement that the conviction of the ex-ISI chief was based on “evidence”. “Today, the person who crossed the red line has been punished,” he added. The minister said Hameed was given “full opportunity” to defend himself during the trial and produce witnesses. “After the statements of all witnesses were recorded and evidence was presented, a just verdict has been issued.” Tarar further asserted that no one was above the law and legal action would be taken against anyone “who crosses the red line”. He said Hameed had “misused his authority, and there will be further investigations into political matters”. The minister also alleged that Hameed had been the PTI’s “political adviser”. Tarar further stated: “The process of self-accountability within the army is very strong, and everyone has now seen a clear example of it. […] Today’s decision is a victory of truth and justice.” Separately, speaking to Geo News , Tarar said today’s decision was “historic”. He further stated that proceedings against Hameed spanned 15 months. “It is a long duration. [During this time,] evidence and proofs were presented. And after the due process of law, this is a historical decision was made,” he added. The minister said that after Hameed’s retirement from the army, he was prohibited from getting involved in politics. “But, he became PTI’s political adviser. He gave the party [his] full support,” Tarar repeated his allegation. Asked whether any further action would be taken against Hameed, Tarar emphatically replied: “Yes, definitely.” He went on to allege that “as a political adviser to PTI, he (Hameed) conspired against the country and spread anarchy to a great extent”. “So much so that even beyond events like May 9, there are serious issues that will be investigated further against him. Another probe is underway into the extent and nature of Hameed’s involvement in politics. “It’s not hidden that he was advising PTI and trying to weaken the state’s writ,” Tarar said. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reacted to Hameed’s sentencing in a post on social media platform X. The minister commented in the post that the “nation will reap the harvest of seeds sown by Faiz Hameed sahib and [former army chief] Bajwa for years”.",

      "summary_orig": "This piece was originally published on August 15, 2024. Former intelligence chief retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed has been formally indicted on “charges of engaging in political activities”, the military’s media affairs wing announced on Tuesday, making him the first ex-spymaster to be indicted for violating the Pakistan Army Act . The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Gen Hameed has “been formally arraigned on charges of engaging in political activities, violations of Official Secret Act detrimental to safety and interest of the state, misuse of authority & government resources and causing wrongful loss to a person(s).” “During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (retd), in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading upto multiple incidents including but not limited to 9th May 2023 incident for fomenting instability; at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,” the statement noted. While this is the first time that a former spy-master will face court martial, the army has previously held its officers accountable for misconduct. Here is a list of some high-profile army officials whose accountability caught public attention. Wrongful use of Authority — Lt Gen Faiz Hameed The case against Gen Faiz is based on a petition filed by Cheif Executive Officer (CEO) of Top City housing society, Kanwar Moeez Khan, before the Supreme Court (SC). The petition stated that ISI officials and Pakistan Rangers raided his office of the housing project and the residence of Mr Moeez in connection with a purported terrorism case and took away gold and diamond ornaments, money and other valuables. It further claimed that after a Rawalpindi-based Anti Terrorism Court (ATC), acquitted him in the terrorism case, Gen Hameed tried to contact him through his cousin — a brigadier in the army — to arrange a meeting. The petitioner claimed that in that meeting Gen Hameed told him that he would return all the items taken away during the raid except for 400 tola gold and cash. The petition alleged that retired brigadiers Naeem Fakhar and Ghaffar of the ISI “forced” the petitioner to “pay 4 crores [rupees] in cash” and “sponsor a private TV network for a few months”. The SC, however, only asked the petitioner to approach the relevant forums, including the defence ministry, for redressal of his grievances. But in the written order issued on November 8, 2023 the Supreme Court stated that allegations of an “extremely serious nature” against ex-spymaster retired Lt-Gen Faiz Hameed “cannot be left unattended” as they would undermine the reputation of the country’s institutions if they were proven to be true. Nine months later, Gen Hameed was taken into military’s custody and in December he was formally indicted. NLC scam — Lt Gen (retired) Khalid Munir Khan, Lt Gen (retired) M. Afzal Muzaffar In 2009, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) initiated an inquiry after the National Logistics Cell (NLC) reported that it suffered a loss of Rs1.8 billion between 2004 and 2008 . The loss was incurred as a result of loans from commercial banks being given at high interest rates and investing Rs.4bn of pensioners’ money in stock markets. Additionally, kickbacks were received from companies through which the money was invested. The inquiry by the Planning Commission carried out under orders from PAC revealed that there were financial irregularities, lack of transparency, and failure to observe rules and regulations caused by reckless decisions of the chain of command at NLC. The inquiry pointed to the involvement of former quartermasters Lt Gen (retd) Khalid Munir Khan and Lt Gen (retd) M. Afzal Muzaffar, former NLC director general (retd) Maj Gen Khalid Zaheer Akhtar, and two civilians — Najibur Rehman and Saeedur Rehman. A quartermaster general, by virtue of the office, is the officer in charge of the NLC. In light of the findings of the investigation committee, the then army chief, Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, decided to proceed against the accused under the Pakistan Army Act’s Section 94 instead of referring the matter to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). An Army Court of Inquiry was convened in November 2010, and preliminary findings were reported to the army chief in February 2011. Subsequently, a formal investigation was ordered by Kayani to allow a fair trial. In 2015, the investigation concluded, revealing that two retired general officers and one civilian officer were responsible for making improper investment decisions in violation of NLC rules and regulations. The two generals were punished under the Army Act. Khalid Zaheer was “dismissed from service” while Afzal Muzaffar was penalised with “severe displeasure (recordable)”. Espionage — Lt Gen (retired) Javed Iqbal Lt Gen (retd) Javed Iqbal was convicted by the Field General Court Martial (FGCM), on May 30, 2019, of “espionage/leakage of sensitive information to foreign agencies prejudicial to the national security”. In May 2021, the 14-year sentence was commuted by the appellate authority for seven years. Later, former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa further reduced the sentence by another two and a half years just before his departure from the GHQ. The jailed general was, therefore, scheduled to be freed on May 29 last year, but the new Army Chief Gen Asim Munir finished the sentence completely, paving the way for his early release. Attempted coup — Maj Gen Zaheerul Islam Abbasi and others Maj Gen Zaheerul Islam Abbasi, Brig Mustansir Billah, Col Mohammad Azad Minhas, Col Inayat Ullah Khan, and 38 other military officers were arrested on September 26, 1995, on charges of plotting to storm a corps commanders’ meeting, to be held on Sept 30 at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi. The alleged plan included the assassination of then-prime minister Benazir Bhutto and the then-army chief Gen Waheed Kakar, senior cabinet ministers, and military chiefs, to be followed by the proclamation of the Islamic system of Khilafat with Maj Gen Abbasi as Ameerul Momineen. The details of the conspiracy were revealed after Qari Saifullah Akhtar, one of the conspirators and chief of his breakaway faction called Harkat-ul-Jihad al Islami, turned an approver. On his witness, the FGCM awarded seven years of imprisonment to retired Maj Gen Abbasi, when a large cache of arms and military uniforms were confiscated. The FGCM also awarded a 14-year jail term to Brig Mustansir Billa for his alleged involvement in the attempted coup. Col Minhas and Col Khan were court-martialled in Sept 1996 for their alleged role in the conspiracy by the FGCM and sentenced to four years each in prison by a military court. Mutiny and terror links — Brigadier (retired) Ali Khan In 2011, Brig Ali Khan was arrested on charges of having links with banned outfit Hizb ut-Tahrir . Along with Maj Inayat Aziz, Maj Iftikhar, Maj Sohail Akbar, and Maj Jawad Baseer, the four accused were convicted in the case. The FGCM awarded a sentence of five years of Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) to Brig Ali Khan. Maj Sohail Akbar was awarded three years RI while Maj Jawad Baseer was sentenced to two years RI, whereas Maj Inayat Aziz and Maj Iftikhar were awarded one year and six months of RI each. Brig Khan was also accused of being involved in conspiring to topple the government, trying to instigate a mutiny within the army, and planning an attack on the GHQ. He was released in 2016 , after serving his five-year term. During the seven-month-long proceedings, five military officers recorded their testimonies from the prosecutor’s side. The officers had claimed that the accused, Brig Khan, provoked them to mutiny against the civil leadership. Removed from service There have also been instances when general officers instead of being brought in for a court-martial were removed administratively after disciplinary proceedings. Gen (retd) Ziauddin Butt, made army chief in October 1999 by the then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif, was kept in custody for two years. In a conversation with Dawn , Butt said that he was given a hand-written order that he was removed under Section 16 of the Pakistan Military Law and Manual of Pakistan Military Law but was never court-martialled. In 2016, in one of the biggest corruption purges in the military, six army officers including two serving generals — Lt Gen Obaidullah Khattak, inspector-general arms, and Maj Gen Ejaz Shahid — were sacked during the tenure of Gen Raheel Sharif. In 2015, the general officers involved in the NLC scam were also removed from service after disciplinary proceedings. Not court-martialled despite SC orders While there are great examples of how the army has held its officials responsible for wrongdoing and taken action against them, there have been instances when the institution failed to do so despite receiving orders from the apex court. In 1996, Asghar Khan had filed a human rights petition in the SC, accusing the ISI of doling out Rs140m to a group of politicians in the 1990s. Among the accused were former army chief Aslam Beg and former director general of the ISI Lt Gen (retd) Asad Durrani. Durrani confirmed the allegations in an affidavit to the apex court. In it, he admitted his role in the affair, named the other players, and elaborated on how the scheme unfolded. Following that, in a landmark judgement on Oct 19, 2012, the SC asked the defence ministry to initiate necessary action against the officials for their role in dishing out the money. By 2019, according to a report submitted by the defence ministry to the SC during the hearing of a plea by Asghar Khan’s family for implementation of the judgement, the defence ministry had constituted a court of inquiry, which had recorded the statements of six witnesses and was looking for more witnesses. Another ‘court of inquiry’ to investigate Durrani was set up in 2018. The court of inquiry was made to look into the book ‘The Spy Chronicles: RAW, ISI, and the Illusion of Peace’ and determine if its content and Durrani’s involvement with the book was culpable. Three years later , while opposing Durrani’s request for the removal of his name from the no-fly list, the Ministry of Defence accused him of being involved in anti-state activities, alleging that he was either “affiliated or interacting with hostile elements, especially Indian RAW [Research and Analysis Wing], since 2008”, in a report submitted before the Islamabad High Court (IHC). However the IHC removed Durrani’s name off the Exit Control List (ECL), with the judge remarking that “according to the record, there was no inquiry underway at the time.”",

By 2019, according to a report submitted by the defence ministry to the SC during the hearing of a plea by Asghar Khan’s family for implementation of the judgement, the defence ministry had constituted a court of inquiry, which had recorded the statements of six witnesses and was looking for more witnesses. Another ‘court of inquiry’ to investigate Durrani was set up in 2018. The court of inquiry was made to look into the book ‘The Spy Chronicles: RAW, ISI, and the Illusion of Peace’ and determine if its content and Durrani’s involvement with the book was culpable. Three years later , while opposing Durrani’s request for the removal of his name from the no-fly list, the Ministry of Defence accused him of being involved in anti-state activities, alleging that he was either “affiliated or interacting with hostile elements, especially Indian RAW [Research and Analysis Wing], since 2008”, in a report submitted before the Islamabad High Court (IHC). However the IHC removed Durrani’s name off the Exit Control List (ECL), with the judge remarking that “according to the record, there was no inquiry underway at the time.”",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan says terrorism emanating from Afghan soil poses ‘gravest threat’ to national security, sovereignty",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday that terrorism emanating from Afghan soil posed the “gravest threat” to the country’s national security and sovereignty. Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad made the remarks while addressing a debate in New York on the situation in Afghanistan. In his statement, he highlighted Islamabad’s concerns about security, humanitarian, and socio-economic challenges emerging from neighbouring Afghanistan. Briefing the UNSC on Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, the ambassador said Pakistan had maintained consistent engagement with the Afghan Taliban, conducting high-level visits, facilitating humanitarian relief, supporting the transportation of goods, and announcing trade and transit concessions. Despite these efforts, he said, threats persisted, creating mounting security challenges for Pakistan and the wider region. “Afghanistan is once again a safe sanctuary for terrorist groups and proxies, with devastating consequences and mounting security challenges for its immediate neighbours, particularly Pakistan, and the region and beyond.” He said Afghan authorities were failing to take concrete measures against terrorist groups, adding that Pakistan had witnessed a surge in militant attacks that were planned, financed and orchestrated using Afghan soil under their watch. “Just this year alone, we have lost close to 1,200 lives to terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Since 2022, more than 214 Afghan terrorists, including suicide bombers, have been neutralised in Pakistan during counter-terror operations,” he said. “Terrorism emanating from Afghan soil poses the gravest threat to Pakistan’s national security and sovereignty,” the envoy said, adding that terrorist groups, including the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Al-Qaeda, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), and the Majeed Brigade, enjoyed “safe haven” in the neighbouring country. He said Pakistan had successfully thwarted multiple infiltration attempts by TTP and BLA terrorists from across Afghanistan, confiscating caches of military grade equipment left behind by international forces in Afghanistan. “These efforts have had a human cost, with huge sacrifices by our valiant security forces and civilians,” he said. “Elements within the Taliban rank and file are supporting these terrorist groups and allowing them safe passage to operate with impunity and free will. There is also credible evidence of collaboration among these terrorist groups through joint training, illicit weapons trade, refuge to terrorists, and coordinated attacks against Pakistan using the Afghan soil,” he said. “And not surprisingly, one detractor in the region, opportunist, and spoiler, has moved fast to intensify its sponsorship of terrorist activity through material, technical and financial support, to terrorist groups and proxies active against Pakistan from Afghan soil,” he added, without taking any names. Ambassador Ahmad also urged the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to strengthen efforts to prevent illicit arms trade and provide an objective assessment of border security, emphasising that cross-border terrorism was the primary issue behind border clashes between the two countries. He also highlighted Pakistan’s efforts to engage with the Afghan Taliban, including recent talks held in Doha and Istanbul. He expressed gratitude to the governments of Qatar and Türkiye for facilitating dialogue with the Afghan Taliban and called for concrete, verifiable action by them against terrorist groups. He warned that failure to do so would result in Pakistan taking “all necessary defensive measures” to protect its citizens and sovereignty. Ambassador Ahmad also highlighted Pakistan’s decades-long role in hosting Afghan refugees. He told the UNSC that millions of Afghans had been welcomed over the past four decades despite Pakistan’s own constraints. “With conflict now ended, we expect that Afghans will now return to their country of origin in a dignified, phased and orderly manner,” he said. The envoy said Pakistan would continue to extend all possible assistance to the Afghans but also called on the international community to “shoulder its responsibility”. He also noted Pakistan’s visa regime, saying that it allowed Afghans to enter the country legally for purposes such as education, health, business, and family visits. He highlighted that more than 536,000 medical visas have been issued since September 2023. The envoy stressed that Pakistan sought a peaceful, stable, interconnected, and prosperous Afghanistan — one that was at peace with itself and its neighbours. He cautioned that bilateral engagements should not be used by countries with negative agendas to destabilise the Pakistan–Afghanistan border or the wider region. “No country desires peace and stability in Afghanistan more than Pakistan. No country has suffered from the consequences of decades of conflict more than Pakistan,” he said. Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to work for peace in Afghanistan, emphasising that lasting stability could only be achieved through sincere dialogue with the Afghan Taliban, respect for international obligations, and strengthened regional cooperation. He called upon the international community to remain engaged, provide humanitarian support, and assist in fostering a security environment conducive to long-term development and prosperity in Afghanistan and the region. Recent reporting provides a stark backdrop to Pakistan’s warnings at the UNSC. A report by US watchdog Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has confirmed that billions of dollars’ worth of American-supplied weapons, military equipment, and security infrastructure left behind during the 2021 US withdrawal now form the backbone of the Afghan Taliban’s security apparatus. Parallel assessments by UN monitoring teams and investigative reporting by the Washington Post indicate that some of these weapons have already reached the TTP, strengthening a group responsible for escalating attacks inside Pakistan. A UN panel also reported that the Taliban continue to provide logistical and operational support to the TTP, reinforcing Islamabad’s concerns about safe havens for terrorists and cross-border militancy.",

      "summary_orig": "Renewed fighting raged at the border of Cambodia and Thailand on Thursday, with combat heard near centuries-old temples, ahead of US President Donald Trump’s planned phone call to the two nations’ leaders. At least 15 people, including Thai soldiers and Cambodian civilians, have been killed in the reignited border conflict, officials said. More than half a million people, mostly in Thailand, have fled border areas near where jets, tanks and drones have waged battle. The Southeast Asian nations dispute the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) frontier, where both sides claim a smattering of historic temples. This week’s clashes are the deadliest since five days of fighting in July that killed dozens before a shaky truce was agreed, following intervention by Trump. The US president said he expected to speak on Thursday with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia to demand a halt to their renewed clashes. “I think I’m scheduled to speak to them tomorrow,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. Both sides blame the other for reigniting the conflict, which has expanded to five provinces of both Thailand and Cambodia, according to an AFP tally of official accounts. In Thailand’s northeast on Thursday morning, hundreds of evacuated families woke up inside a university building in Surin city that has been transformed into a shelter. A few older women pound chilli paste while volunteers stir big pots of food. Nearby, 61-year-old farmer Rat, who declined to give her last name, said she had to leave her home before she could plant a cassava crop this season, fleeing with her family of eight. “I just want to go home and farm again,” she told AFP . “Every time the fighting starts, it feels like life gets paused all over again.” Cultural heritage AFP journalists in Cambodia’s northwestern Oddar Meanchey province heard the blasts of incoming artillery from the direction of disputed temples since dawn on Wednesday. Cambodia’s defence ministry said in a statement that Thai forces initiated an attack early on Thursday morning in the province, “shelling into Khnar Temple area”. On the other side of the border, the Thai military announced an overnight curfew in parts of Sa Kaeo beginning Wednesday night. The Thai army said on Wednesday that Cambodian forces fired rockets early that day that landed in the vicinity of the Phanom Dong Rak Hospital in Surin province — to the north of Sa Kaeo, and which was struck in the fighting in July. Cambodia’s defence ministry said more than 101,000 people have been evacuated, while in Thailand, authorities said more than 400,000 civilians have taken shelter elsewhere. The United States, China and Malaysia, as chair of the regional bloc ASEAN, brokered a ceasefire back in July. In October, Trump backed a follow-on joint declaration, touting new trade deals with Thailand and Cambodia after they agreed to prolong their truce. But Thailand suspended the agreement the following month. The United Nations cultural agency called on Wednesday for “protection of the region’s cultural heritage in all its forms” amid the ongoing fighting. “Unesco has communicated to all parties concerned the geographical coordinates of sites on the World Heritage List as well as those of national significance, in order to avoid any potential damage,” it said in a statement. In 2008, military clashes between Thailand and Cambodia erupted over a patch of land next to the 900-year-old temple, located on the border. Sporadic violence from 2008 to 2011 led to the deaths of two dozen people and displacement of tens of thousands.",

      "title_orig": "Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado emerges from hiding after winning Nobel",
      "summary_orig": "Nobel laureate and Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado emerged from hiding to make her first public appearance in almost a year, waving to supporters from the balcony of her Oslo hotel early on Thursday. Machado, who won the Nobel for challenging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s grip on power, did not arrive in Norway in time for Wednesday’s prize ceremony. Her daughter collected the prestigious award on her behalf, and delivered a blistering acceptance speech in her stead. The Venezuelan democracy campaigner made it to the Norwegian capital hours later, and went straight to see her family, Nobel Prize Committee Chair Jorgen Watne Frydnes said. From the balcony of the Grand Hotel, Machado later greeted a crowd of jubilant supporters, who sang and shouted “libertad” (freedom), according to AFP journalists. Machado, who has been living in hiding in Venezuela, was last seen in public on January 9, when she protested Maduro’s inauguration for his third term. In her Nobel acceptance speech, the democracy campaigner urged her compatriots to keep fighting against Maduro’s “state terrorism”. “What we Venezuelans can offer the world is the lesson forged through this long and difficult journey: that to have democracy, we must be willing to fight for freedom,” Machado said in a speech delivered by her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado. It is unclear how Machado managed to leave Venezuela, or how she plans to eventually return. She was warned by Caracas that she would be labelled a “fugitive” if she left the country. “She risks being arrested if she returns, even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value,” said Benedicte Bull, a professor specialising in Latin America at the University of Oslo. Machado’s previous refusal to leave the country had also boosted her political power. “She is the undisputed leader of the opposition, but if she were to stay away in exile for a long time, I think that would change and she would gradually lose political influence,” Bull added. ‘State terrorism’ Her daughter assured the Nobel prize audience that her mother would return. “She wants to live in a free Venezuela, and she will never give up on that purpose,” Ana Corina Sosa Machado said. Machado’s mother and three daughters, and some Latin American heads of state, including Argentine President Javier Milei, were at the prize-giving at Oslo’s City Hall. In her acceptance speech, Machado denounced kidnappings and torture under Maduro’s tenure, calling them “crimes against humanity” and “state terrorism, deployed to bury the will of the people”. Machado has been hailed for her fight for democracy, but also criticised for aligning herself with US President Donald Trump, to whom she has dedicated her Nobel. The Oslo ceremony coincides with a large US military build-up in the Caribbean in recent weeks and deadly strikes on what Washington says are drug-smuggling boats. Maduro, who came to power in 2013, insists the goal of the US operations — which Machado has said are justified — is to topple the government and seize Venezuela’s oil reserves Nobel prize Machado has accused Maduro of stealing Venezuela’s July 2024 election , from which she was banned — a claim backed by much of the international community. The opposition claimed its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the election. He now lives in exile and was also in Oslo on Wednesday. Multiple other Nobel Peace Prize-winners have been unable to collect their awards in person. Family members usually do so on their behalf, Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken explained this week. The Nobel laureates in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics all received their prizes from Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf at a separate ceremony in Stockholm on Wednesday. The prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and 11 million kronor ($1.2 million) — which is shared when several laureates are honoured in the same category.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Treasury members in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Wednesday flayed the military spokesperson’s what they called humiliating remarks against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and provincial Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, triggering uproar in the house. During a sitting chaired by Deputy Speaker Suriyya Bibi, the assembly witnessed ruckus and adjournment when the opposition PML-N’s woman lawmaker, Sobia Shahid, displayed a picture of Army Chief and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir. The chair ordered security personnel to remove the picture. She censured Ms Shahid, saying the CDF represents the military and not her party. “You should talk about your own performance as the lawmaker instead of displaying the CDF’s picture,” she observed before adjourning the sitting due to commotion. Earlier, members of the ruling PTI complained that the country faced serious challenges like the poor law and order situation, financial stress and political instability. They insisted that that the country’s external issues could only be resolved once the “house is in order.” Treasury MPA Mohammad Ajmal Khan said the recent presser by ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry against the PTI leadership, especially founder Imran Khan and CM Sohail Afridi, had angered the people of KP. He said the military’s spokesman should not be speaking on controversial matters would aggravate the current political crisis in the country. The lawmaker opposed the option of enforcing the Governor’s Rule in the province, warning it is no solution and will be unacceptable to residents. He said that the provincial assembly could help resolve issues among Mr Imran, the federal government and the security establishment. Mr Khan also said once the “house was in order”, dialogue could be held with Afghanistan for lasting peace in the region. Treasury MPA Humayun Khan said the legislature, the judiciary and the executive were main pillars of the state but an institution called itself the state that it never was. He said that the military was raised and paid to protect the country’s borders. Mr Khan came down hard on the military’s spokesman for making “insulting” remarks against the PTI founder and KP’s chief minister. He said it was the Pakistan Air Force that did a great job in the May 8 conflict with India, so its chief should have been credited and made the Field Marshal. The lawmaker said the creation of the CDS post should be reconsidered. Member of the opposition PML-N Shahjahan Yousaf said the people were proud of the country’s armed forces for defeating a much larger adversary in the May clashes. He said PTI members in the National Assembly should discuss the matters related to the Centre, while those in the KP Assembly should take up provincial issues. Mr Yousaf said there was nothing wrong if all defence forces got united to defend the country. He congratulated Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir on becoming the CDF. Housing minister Dr Amjad Ali condemned the use of water cannons against the sisters of the PTI’s founder during their protest sit-in staged outside Adiala Jail to seek a meeting with their brother. He said that a law and order situation was being deliberately created in the province. He wondered how an official, being paid by the government, could hold a political presser. The minister said the military’s spokesperson should hold more and more news conferences to increase Mr Imran’s popularity . Meanwhile, the house was informed that the province lacked the facility to measure uranium levels in the drinking water supplied to Karak district. “We do not have that testing facility. We recently sent a letter to the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority in this respect and will follow up and inform the house,” public health engineering minister Fazal Shakoor Khan informed lawmakers. The minister’s statement came as PML-N member Farah Khan raised serious concerns about the rising number of blood and bone cancer patients as well as the high incidence of kidney failures due to the contaminated drinking water in the area. In a question, she also asked whether any water filtration plant existed in the district, insisting that high-risk diseases in Karak were on the rise and the situation in the Shnawa Kudikhel area of the district had become alarming.

      "summary_orig": "• PTI slams water cannon ‘assault’ on Imran’s sisters and party workers, warns against his transfer to another jail • Privilege motion moved in NA after Khattak injured in melee • Opposition plans ‘national conference’ on Dec 20-21; says party founder inseparable from nation, politics • PM’s aide says all doors to talks with PTI now closed as party passed ‘point of no return’ • Gohar wants ‘common sense’ to prevail, questions move to isolate major party RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: Politi­cal temperatures rose further on Wedne­sday, as Rawalpindi police sought a legal opinion on the question of registering an FIR against PTI leaders and supporters over a protest outside Adiala jail, even as the party moved a privilege motion in the National Assembly over alleged use of force against its workers, and voiced alarm at reports of Imran Khan’s possible transfer to another prison. The PTI also joined other opposition parties in warning that efforts to “minus” the incarcerated former premier and clamp down on peaceful protest would only deepen the stand-off with the government and push the country towards greater political turmoil. After entering a report in its daily police diary ( roznamcha ) on the PTI sit-in outside Adiala jail on the previous night, Rawalpindi police termed the demonstration a “violent protest by a political party with the intention of attacking Adiala jail” in a statement issued on Wednesday. It noted that Section 144 was in force in the city and that it was the police’s respo­n­sibility to ensure its implementation. A police spokesperson said Adiala jail was a sensitive and densely populated area where maintaining security and traffic order was crucial. He added that there was no visiting time at night and no one could be allowed to meet an inmate without a court order. The spokesperson claimed that the po­lice had “shown extreme patience” du­r­ing the sit-in despite “attempts to vandalise and resist the police” by protesters. “Members of the political party pelted stones and attacked the police, on which the law had to take its course. Water cannon had to be used, with extreme patience and strategy, to prevent malicious activity and an attack,” he said, adding that violation of the law would not be tolerated “under any circumstances” in such a sensitive area. In a post on X at 3:58am, the party had claimed that authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM. The party said Mr Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Niazi, along with party leaders and workers, had spent the entire day peacefully waiting outside the prison to exercise their “constitutional and legal right” to meet their incarcerated leader on a court-mandated visitation day. “This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene. A police source said a report on Tuesday night’s incident had already been recorded and could be converted into a formal FIR, in which the accused would be nominated and booked under the relevant sections of the law. Privilege motion On the other hand, PTI MNAs on Wednesday submitted a complaint for a “privilege motion” in the National Assembly against Rawalpindi police. At a subsequent presser, opposition leaders claimed that PTI parliamentary leader Shahid Khattak’s “leg had been broken” in the melee. The motion claimed that police had used force against PTI leaders and workers who were present outside the jail to express solidarity with the PTI founder imprisoned there. The party also expressed grave concern over reports that the former prime minister might be transferred to another jail, calling such a move a blatant display of “fear, political desperation and weakness” on the part of the government. The party said its founding chairman could neither be “minused” nor removed from the political arena, nor could his voice be sile­nced behind prison walls. In a statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party condemned remarks by federal ministers suggesting that Mr Khan may be mov­ed to another facility, saying the government “continued to tremble at his very name” despite keeping him incarcerated for over two and a half years. The party also condemned what it described as a police “assault” on Mr Khan’s sisters, female workers and party leaders outside Adiala Jail. It said the episode once again exposed the “stark reality” that the incumbent government had abandoned “moral boundaries, constitutional principles and basic human values” in its use of force against political opponents. War of words Meanwhile, the war of words between the opposition and the ruling coalition continued on Wed­nesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”. The tensions have particularly intensified in rec­ent days after the spok­esperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on Dec 6, in response to Imran Kha­n’s latest outburst against the military leadership. Addressing a press conference, Mr Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance. All doors to talks are now closed.” He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour and development”. “We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what else can be done”. ‘Common sense’ Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament. Among them, Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections. “We did not stage a sit-in back then … We sat in parliament, believing that our voices would be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties would be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years. However, “at some point, common sense should prevail”, he said Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.” He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday. The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.” “You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked. Achakzai on dialogue Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside parliament. Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan. How can we negotiate without his permission?” For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “nati­onal conference” on Dec 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited. A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.” Mr Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adiala jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”. ‘Dark period’ Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addressed a press conference, assailing the PTI and its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history. “He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said. “It is the same Khan who was willing to give Gen Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.” “Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?” Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, in a press conference in Islamabad, called on overseas Pakist­anis to recognise the “venomous rhetoric” being spread by PTI. “I want the overseas Pakistanis to identify and acknowledge these gro­ups,” Mr Chaudhry said. “I want my nation, my Pakistanis, to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong.” Published in Dawn, December 11th, 2025",

The PTI also joined other opposition parties in warning that efforts to “minus” the incarcerated former premier and clamp down on peaceful protest would only deepen the stand-off with the government and push the country towards greater political turmoil. After entering a report in its daily police diary ( roznamcha ) on the PTI sit-in outside Adiala jail on the previous night, Rawalpindi police termed the demonstration a “violent protest by a political party with the intention of attacking Adiala jail” in a statement issued on Wednesday. It noted that Section 144 was in force in the city and that it was the police’s respo­n­sibility to ensure its implementation. A police spokesperson said Adiala jail was a sensitive and densely populated area where maintaining security and traffic order was crucial. He added that there was no visiting time at night and no one could be allowed to meet an inmate without a court order. The spokesperson claimed that the po­lice had “shown extreme patience” du­r­ing the sit-in despite “attempts to vandalise and resist the police” by protesters. “Members of the political party pelted stones and attacked the police, on which the law had to take its course. Water cannon had to be used, with extreme patience and strategy, to prevent malicious activity and an attack,” he said, adding that violation of the law would not be tolerated “under any circumstances” in such a sensitive area. In a post on X at 3:58am, the party had claimed that authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM. The party said Mr Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Niazi, along with party leaders and workers, had spent the entire day peacefully waiting outside the prison to exercise their “constitutional and legal right” to meet their incarcerated leader on a court-mandated visitation day. “This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene. A police source said a report on Tuesday night’s incident had already been recorded and could be converted into a formal FIR, in which the accused would be nominated and booked under the relevant sections of the law. Privilege motion On the other hand, PTI MNAs on Wednesday submitted a complaint for a “privilege motion” in the National Assembly against Rawalpindi police. At a subsequent presser, opposition leaders claimed that PTI parliamentary leader Shahid Khattak’s “leg had been broken” in the melee. The motion claimed that police had used force against PTI leaders and workers who were present outside the jail to express solidarity with the PTI founder imprisoned there. The party also expressed grave concern over reports that the former prime minister might be transferred to another jail, calling such a move a blatant display of “fear, political desperation and weakness” on the part of the government. The party said its founding chairman could neither be “minused” nor removed from the political arena, nor could his voice be sile­nced behind prison walls. In a statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party condemned remarks by federal ministers suggesting that Mr Khan may be mov­ed to another facility, saying the government “continued to tremble at his very name” despite keeping him incarcerated for over two and a half years. The party also condemned what it described as a police “assault” on Mr Khan’s sisters, female workers and party leaders outside Adiala Jail. It said the episode once again exposed the “stark reality” that the incumbent government had abandoned “moral boundaries, constitutional principles and basic human values” in its use of force against political opponents. War of words Meanwhile, the war of words between the opposition and the ruling coalition continued on Wed­nesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”. The tensions have particularly intensified in rec­ent days after the spok­esperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on Dec 6, in response to Imran Kha­n’s latest outburst against the military leadership. Addressing a press conference, Mr Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance. All doors to talks are now closed.” He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour and development”. “We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what else can be done”. ‘Common sense’ Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament. Among them, Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections. “We did not stage a sit-in back then … We sat in parliament, believing that our voices would be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties would be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years. However, “at some point, common sense should prevail”, he said Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.” He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday. The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.” “You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked. Achakzai on dialogue Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside parliament. Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan. How can we negotiate without his permission?” For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “nati­onal conference” on Dec 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited. A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.” Mr Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adiala jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”. ‘Dark period’ Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addressed a press conference, assailing the PTI and its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history. “He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said. “It is the same Khan who was willing to give Gen Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.” “Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?” Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, in a press conference in Islamabad, called on overseas Pakist­anis to recognise the “venomous rhetoric” being spread by PTI. “I want the overseas Pakistanis to identify and acknowledge these gro­ups,” Mr Chaudhry said. “I want my nation, my Pakistanis, to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong.” Published in Dawn, December 11th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The United States has approved the sale of advanced technology and support for Pakistan’s F-16 fighter jets, valued at $686 million, according to a letter the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) sent to Congress on December 8. The package includes Link–16 systems, cryptographic equipment, avionics updates, training, and comprehensive logistical support. The DSCA letter makes clear the rationale for the sale, stating that it “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations.” The proposed sale is also aimed at modernising Pakistan’s F-16 fleet and addressing operational safety concerns. The letter notes that it will “maintain Pakistan’s capability to meet current and future threats by updating and refurbishing its Block–52 and Mid Life Upgrade F–16 fleet.” These updates will provide more “seamless integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force in combat operations, exercises, and training, and refurbishment will extend the aircraft life through 2040 while addressing critical flight safety concerns,” the letter adds. The letter also emphasises Pakistan’s readiness to absorb the technology, stating that the country “has shown a commitment to maintaining its military forces and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” It also addresses regional concerns, asserting that “the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.” Lockheed Martin Company of Fort Worth, Texas, will serve as the principal contractor for the sale. The US defence agency pointed out that “implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional US Government or contractor representatives to Pakistan” and that there will be “no adverse impact on US defence readiness as a result of this proposed sale.” The total estimated value of the sale is $686 million, with major defence equipment valued at $37 million and other items at $649 million. The major defence equipment (MDE) component includes 92 Link–16 data link systems and six inert Mk–82 500-lb general purpose bomb bodies; the latter will have no explosive payload and will be used for weapons integration testing. Link-16 is an advanced command, control, communications and intelligence system. It is a secure, real-time communication network that shares tactical data among allied forces and is used by US and allied Nato forces. The system is also resistant to electronic jamming from enemy air and ground assets. “It provides the warfighter key theatre functions such as surveillance, identification, air control, weapons engagement coordination, and direction for all services and allied forces,” the letter read. The rest of the deal consists of $649m worth of non-MDE equipment, including the AN/APQ–10C Simple Key Loaders and AN/APX–126 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe system — used to identify hostile and allied aircraft. It also includes hardware and software modifications to support the Operational Flight Program and mandated avionics updates, as well as KY–58M and KIV–78 cryptographic appliqués, which are National Security Agency (NSA)-certified modules used in military aircraft and other tactical systems for secure communications and identification. The equipment also covers additional secure communications, precision navigation and cryptographic devices, Joint Mission Planning Systems and support, Common Munitions Built-in-test Reprogramming Equipment, and ADU–981 missile adaptor units. Other weapons integration, test and support equipment, spare and repair parts, software delivery and support, publications and technical documentation, full motion simulators, personnel training, and training equipment are also included. The package will also provide Pakistan with US government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support services, studies and surveys, and other related elements of logistical and program support. Pakistan had requested upgrades to its F-16 fleet in 2021 amid strained relations, but Washington delayed its response. The country is now less dependent on the F-16s, having acquired and jointly developed other platforms, which proved their worth during the May 2025 air war by inflicting significant damage on the Indian fleet. “Pakistan still welcomes the US offer, as it will enhance the shelf life of its F-16s until 2040,” a diplomatic source said. The DSCA letter, sent to the Speaker of the House and the chairmen of the relevant congressional committees, concludes that the sale “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States” while ensuring that Pakistan can continue to operate its F-16 fleet safely and effectively.",

      "title_orig": "TENNIS: THE GOAT OF PAK TENNIS",
      "summary_orig": "On November 29, after playing the doubles final of the ATP Challenger in Islamabad, Aisamul Haq Qureshi called time on his 27-year illustrious professional tennis career. He is arguably the greatest tennis player that Pakistan has ever produced. The first Pakistani tennis player to hit international headlines was Haroon Rahim in the 1970s, with a highest singles ranking of 34 in 1977. In three of the four Grand Slams, he reached the singles’ second or third round. In the doubles, his best showing in Grand Slams was a quarter-final appearance. It took around three decades for the next tennis star to emerge from Pakistan. Aisamul Haq, like Rahim from Lahore, was born into a tennis family. His maternal grandfather, Khawaja Iftikhar, is the only one to have reached the top national ranking in both undivided India and, later, Pakistan. Khawaja Iftikhar’s daughter and Aisam’s mother, Nausheen Ehtisham, was ranked as Pakistan’s No 1 woman player for almost 10 years. Ironically, Aisam didn’t pick up a tennis racket till he was 13 years old. He did indulge in other sports at his school, Crescent Model School, which boasts of multiple sports facilities. But when he picked up the racket, he picked it up really well. Aisamul Haq Qureshi, who just retired from professional tennis, is the greatest of tennis players that Pakistan has ever produced. What will the future of the game in the country be like after his bowing out? Within four years, he was competing in junior grand slam tournaments. At the age of 18, Aisam was World No 7 and Asia No 1 in the junior rankings. He beat Andy Roddick and David Nalbandian, the future World No 1 and 3, respectively, in the World Super Junior Championships in 1998. In the junior grand slams, his best showing in singles was reaching the third round at Wimbledon in 1998. That year, he figured in the doubles quarter-finals of all four grand slam tournaments. Also in 1998, he turned professional. It was a long struggle. Devoid of sponsorship, Aisam mainly banked on his family’s support. He first appeared in the Futures (now named ITF World Tennis Tour), the entry-level professional circuit. The following year, he made it into the quarter-finals of his first Challenger tournament, the second tier of professional tennis. His ranking improved and, in 2001, he made his debut in a top tier ATP tournament (in the doubles). His first appearance in a Grand Slam arrived the following year (in doubles) at Wimbledon, where he reached the third round. It was in 2004 that Aisam made his maiden singles appearance in an ATP event. The year 2007 was his annus mirabilis in singles. In June, in the Gerry Weber Open, he defeated World No 11 Richard Gasquet who, three weeks later, reached the Wimbledon semi-final. He qualified for Wimbledon, becoming the first Pakistani in 31 years to play at a Grand Slam singles, and the second to win a match. In the second round, he was defeated by the former world No 1 Marat Safin. He also reached the final qualifying round at the US Open. But an injury forced him to pull out with the match finely poised at one set all. He ended the year with his highest career ranking of 125. In doubles, 2010 was his most memorable year. With his long-time partner, Rohan Bopanna of India, he created history at the US Open. The 16th-seeded pair, known as the Indo-Pak express, surprised everyone by reaching the final, where they lost 7-6, 7-6 to the Bryan twins, widely acknowledged as the greatest doubles pair. It was the first time that a Pakistani had played the final of a Grand Slam. There was a double delight. In the mixed doubles too, the unseeded pair of Aisam and Kveta Peschke (Czech Republic) finished runners-up. But what endeared him to everyone was his post-final speech. At the time, Pakistan was suffering from a phase of terrorism worse than that of today. At New York’s Arthur Ashe Stadium, Aisam declared to the crowd, “There’s a very wrong perception about Pakistan being a terrorist country. We are a very friendly, loving and caring people, and we want peace in this world as much as you guys want. May Allah bless us all.” The Aisam and Rohan pair was awarded the ‘Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year’ award in 2010. The duo also received the 2010 ‘Peace and Sport Image of the Year’ award. Aisam’s highest doubles ranking was eight and, from 2009 to 2023, he had a streak of playing in 50 grand slams. The government of Pakistan conferred on him the President’s Award for Pride of Performance in 2004 and the Sitara-i-Imtiaz in 2010. All these years, the national cause remained close to his heart. Aisam played for Pakistan in the Davis Cup throughout, sometimes skipping lucrative pro circuit tournaments. He had stopped entering singles on the pro circuit in 2009 but continued in the Davis Cup. In 2005, Pakistan made it to the World Group play-off for only the second time. He says he is still available for national duty: “I have played my last match on the professional circuit. But if Pakistan needs me for the Davis Cup, I will be available for doubles.” But the nation expects even more from him. Last year, Aisam was elected the president of the Pakistan Tennis Federation. And from the looks of things, he has his sights set on making big strides for the sport in the country. The ATP Challenger was recently staged in Pakistan for the first time. “Players from 14 countries participated,” points out Aisam. “In his maiden appearance, Muzammil Murtaza reached the second round in singles and the final in doubles. He would get ATP points. That was our goal. More ATP events will be hosted. The ATP points earned will improve players’ rankings, hence enabling them to appear in the pro circuit abroad.” Even legendary tennis player Bjorn Borg, winner of 11 Grand Slam singles titles, congratulated Aisam on hosting the first-ever ATP Challengers in Pakistan, “It is the start of a new era for Pakistan,” he said. For now, Aisam’s  main focus is on the juniors. “In 2025, Pakistan hosted five ITF Juniors Tournaments for the first time,” he says. “For next year, Pakistan has been allocated seven ITF Juniors.” It all ties in with Aisam’s vision for promoting tennis in Pakistan. “When I turned pro, I had no sponsorship,” Aisam points out. “Many of my contemporaries on the junior circuit, hailing from tennis-rich countries, got sponsorship. This enabled them to acquire the services of good coaches and physical fitness experts. It helped them make rapid strides on the pro circuit. My first financial sponsor was when I was 27. I wish promising players of today get patronage at an early stage.” Ostensibly the biggest initiative to put Pakistan tennis on track was taken much before Aisam assumed the office of the PTF President. The Ace Tennis Initiative was launched in August 2022, under the umbrella of the Haq Foundation, initially run solely by Aisamul Haq’s family. Later, other sponsors joined, including the BARD Foundation, McDonald’s and Servis Industries. “Ace Tennis conducted a nationwide talent hunt in Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar,” explains Aisam. “Four promising players were selected in each city, 15 boys and one girl. They joined a 12-month programme for customised training and fitness plans for each athlete. It is a sort of conveyor belt, where some players have been dropped from the programme over time, while a few have graduated out due to age. Similarly, players have also been added.” The results are very encouraging. The best coming through the Ace initiative have been sent abroad for competitions and have been doing well. Others doing well on the domestic circuit are also being facilitated and encouraged and arrangements have also been made for their training abroad. Aisam’s efforts have gone beyond bringing glory to Pakistan tennis just by dint of his own sportsmanship. And from the looks of things, it won’t take that long for Pakistan tennis to see the emergence of the next Aisam. The writer is a freelance sports journalist based in Lahore.

For now, Aisam’s  main focus is on the juniors. “In 2025, Pakistan hosted five ITF Juniors Tournaments for the first time,” he says. “For next year, Pakistan has been allocated seven ITF Juniors.” It all ties in with Aisam’s vision for promoting tennis in Pakistan. “When I turned pro, I had no sponsorship,” Aisam points out. “Many of my contemporaries on the junior circuit, hailing from tennis-rich countries, got sponsorship. This enabled them to acquire the services of good coaches and physical fitness experts. It helped them make rapid strides on the pro circuit. My first financial sponsor was when I was 27. I wish promising players of today get patronage at an early stage.” Ostensibly the biggest initiative to put Pakistan tennis on track was taken much before Aisam assumed the office of the PTF President. The Ace Tennis Initiative was launched in August 2022, under the umbrella of the Haq Foundation, initially run solely by Aisamul Haq’s family. Later, other sponsors joined, including the BARD Foundation, McDonald’s and Servis Industries. “Ace Tennis conducted a nationwide talent hunt in Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar,” explains Aisam. “Four promising players were selected in each city, 15 boys and one girl. They joined a 12-month programme for customised training and fitness plans for each athlete. It is a sort of conveyor belt, where some players have been dropped from the programme over time, while a few have graduated out due to age. Similarly, players have also been added.” The results are very encouraging. The best coming through the Ace initiative have been sent abroad for competitions and have been doing well. Others doing well on the domestic circuit are also being facilitated and encouraged and arrangements have also been made for their training abroad. Aisam’s efforts have gone beyond bringing glory to Pakistan tennis just by dint of his own sportsmanship. And from the looks of things, it won’t take that long for Pakistan tennis to see the emergence of the next Aisam. The writer is a freelance sports journalist based in Lahore.

      "title": "TENNIS: THE GOAT OF PAK TENNIS",
      "summary": "On November 29, after playing the doubles final of the ATP Challenger in Islamabad, Aisamul Haq Qureshi called time on his 27-year illustrious professional tennis career. He is arguably the greatest tennis player that Pakistan has ever produced. The first Pakistani tennis player to hit international headlines was Haroon Rahim in the 1970s, with a highest singles ranking of 34 in 1977. In three of the four Grand Slams, he reached the singles’ second or third round. In the doubles, his best showing in Grand Slams was a quarter-final appearance. It took around three decades for the next tennis star to emerge from Pakistan. Aisamul Haq, like Rahim from Lahore, was born into a tennis family. His maternal grandfather, Khawaja Iftikhar, is the only one to have reached the top national ranking in both undivided India and, later, Pakistan. Khawaja Iftikhar’s daughter and Aisam’s mother, Nausheen Ehtisham, was ranked as Pakistan’s No 1 woman player for almost 10 years. Ironically, Aisam didn’t pick up a tennis racket till he was 13 years old. He did indulge in other sports at his school, Crescent Model School, which boasts of multiple sports facilities. But when he picked up the racket, he picked it up really well. Aisamul Haq Qureshi, who just retired from professional tennis, is the greatest of tennis players that Pakistan has ever produced. What will the future of the game in the country be like after his bowing out? Within four years, he was competing in junior grand slam tournaments. At the age of 18, Aisam was World No 7 and Asia No 1 in the junior rankings. He beat Andy Roddick and David Nalbandian, the future World No 1 and 3, respectively, in the World Super Junior Championships in 1998. In the junior grand slams, his best showing in singles was reaching the third round at Wimbledon in 1998. That year, he figured in the doubles quarter-finals of all four grand slam tournaments. Also in 1998, he turned professional. It was a long struggle. Devoid of sponsorship, Aisam mainly banked on his family’s support. He first appeared in the Futures (now named ITF World Tennis Tour), the entry-level professional circuit. The following year, he made it into the quarter-finals of his first Challenger tournament, the second tier of professional tennis. His ranking improved and, in 2001, he made his debut in a top tier ATP tournament (in the doubles). His first appearance in a Grand Slam arrived the following year (in doubles) at Wimbledon, where he reached the third round. It was in 2004 that Aisam made his maiden singles appearance in an ATP event. The year 2007 was his annus mirabilis in singles. In June, in the Gerry Weber Open, he defeated World No 11 Richard Gasquet who, three weeks later, reached the Wimbledon semi-final. He qualified for Wimbledon, becoming the first Pakistani in 31 years to play at a Grand Slam singles, and the second to win a match. In the second round, he was defeated by the former world No 1 Marat Safin. He also reached the final qualifying round at the US Open. But an injury forced him to pull out with the match finely poised at one set all. He ended the year with his highest career ranking of 125. In doubles, 2010 was his most memorable year. With his long-time partner, Rohan Bopanna of India, he created history at the US Open. The 16th-seeded pair, known as the Indo-Pak express, surprised everyone by reaching the final, where they lost 7-6, 7-6 to the Bryan twins, widely acknowledged as the greatest doubles pair. It was the first time that a Pakistani had played the final of a Grand Slam. There was a double delight. In the mixed doubles too, the unseeded pair of Aisam and Kveta Peschke (Czech Republic) finished runners-up. But what endeared him to everyone was his post-final speech. At the time, Pakistan was suffering from a phase of terrorism worse than that of today. At New York’s Arthur Ashe Stadium, Aisam declared to the crowd, “There’s a very wrong perception about Pakistan being a terrorist country. We are a very friendly, loving and caring people, and we want peace in this world as much as you guys want. May Allah bless us all.” The Aisam and Rohan pair was awarded the ‘Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year’ award in 2010. The duo also received the 2010 ‘Peace and Sport Image of the Year’ award. Aisam’s highest doubles ranking was eight and, from 2009 to 2023, he had a streak of playing in 50 grand slams. The government of Pakistan conferred on him the President’s Award for Pride of Performance in 2004 and the Sitara-i-Imtiaz in 2010. All these years, the national cause remained close to his heart. Aisam played for Pakistan in the Davis Cup throughout, sometimes skipping lucrative pro circuit tournaments. He had stopped entering singles on the pro circuit in 2009 but continued in the Davis Cup. In 2005, Pakistan made it to the World Group play-off for only the second time. He says he is still available for national duty: “I have played my last match on the professional circuit. But if Pakistan needs me for the Davis Cup, I will be available for doubles.” But the nation expects even more from him. Last year, Aisam was elected the president of the Pakistan Tennis Federation. And from the looks of things, he has his sights set on making big strides for the sport in the country. The ATP Challenger was recently staged in Pakistan for the first time. “Players from 14 countries participated,” points out Aisam. “In his maiden appearance, Muzammil Murtaza reached the second round in singles and the final in doubles. He would get ATP points. That was our goal. More ATP events will be hosted. The ATP points earned will improve players’ rankings, hence enabling them to appear in the pro circuit abroad.” Even legendary tennis player Bjorn Borg, winner of 11 Grand Slam singles titles, congratulated Aisam on hosting the first-ever ATP Challengers in Pakistan, “It is the start of a new era for Pakistan,” he said. For now, Aisam’s  main focus is on the juniors. “In 2025, Pakistan hosted five ITF Juniors Tournaments for the first time,” he says. “For next year, Pakistan has been allocated seven ITF Juniors.” It all ties in with Aisam’s vision for promoting tennis in Pakistan. “When I turned pro, I had no sponsorship,” Aisam points out. “Many of my contemporaries on the junior circuit, hailing from tennis-rich countries, got sponsorship.
