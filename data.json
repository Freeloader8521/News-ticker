The instruction came shortly before Lee embarked on his trip to Singapore and the Philippines, according to presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung. The president also instructed officials to keep him informed of the government's response to the situation in the Middle East and its economic impact while ordering \"utmost\" precautions to ensure the safety of Koreans residing in the region. The move comes one day after a joint U.S.-Israeli strike against Iran reportedly left Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dead. Cheong Wa Dae expressed hope that the Middle East will regain stability and peace as promptly as possible, adding it was also taking \"various measures\" to ensure the safety of Koreans overseas.",

      "summary_orig": "South Africa survived a brilliant all-round show by Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza to record a five-wicket win on Sunday, which means they remained unbeaten ahead of a semi-final against New Zealand on Wednesday. After Zimbabwe scored 153-7 in New Delhi, South Africa survived an early wobble. Dewald Brevis hit 42 off 18 balls as the 2024 runners-up reached 154-5 in 17.5 overs. Raza earlier hit 73 and then took 3-29 with his off-spin for Zimbabwe, who had stunned Australia and co-hosts Sri Lanka in the group stage to reach the Super Eights. Raza struck on the third ball of the South African chase to send back Quinton de Kock, caught behind for a duck. Raza bowled skipper Aiden Markram for four in the next over. Ryan Rickelton was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Brad Evans and took five minutes to recover. He then lifted Evans for two straight sixes in the next over before the bowler had him caught for 31. Brevis and David Miller, who hit 22, put on 50 before two more quick strikes from Zimbabwe. Blessing Muzarabani dismissed Miller, and Raza removed Brevis. Tristan Stubbs (21) and George Linde (30) then put on an unbeaten 53 to steer their side to the target. After choosing to bat, Zimbabwe lost the in-form opener Brian Bennett, who hit an unbeaten 97 in the defeat by India, for 15. Raza reached his fifty off 29 balls before falling to left-armer Kwena Maphaka, caught by Miller off a leading edge. Clive Madande boosted the total with 26 not out off 20 balls at the end. Maphaka took 2-21 from his four overs and Corbin Bosch 2-40.",

After choosing to bat, Zimbabwe lost the in-form opener Brian Bennett, who hit an unbeaten 97 in the defeat by India, for 15. Raza reached his fifty off 29 balls before falling to left-armer Kwena Maphaka, caught by Miller off a leading edge. Clive Madande boosted the total with 26 not out off 20 balls at the end. Maphaka took 2-21 from his four overs and Corbin Bosch 2-40.",
      "title": "South Africa beat plucky Zimbabwe ahead of New Zealand semi-final",
      "summary": "South Africa survived a brilliant all-round show by Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza to record a five-wicket win on Sunday, which means they remained unbeaten ahead of a semi-final against New Zealand on Wednesday. After Zimbabwe scored 153-7 in New Delhi, South Africa survived an early wobble. Dewald Brevis hit 42 off 18 balls as the 2024 runners-up reached 154-5 in 17.5 overs. Raza earlier hit 73 and then took 3-29 with his off-spin for Zimbabwe, who had stunned Australia and co-hosts Sri Lanka in the group stage to reach the Super Eights. Raza struck on the third ball of the South African chase to send back Quinton de Kock, caught behind for a duck. Raza bowled skipper Aiden Markram for four in the next over. Ryan Rickelton was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Brad Evans and took five minutes to recover. He then lifted Evans for two straight sixes in the next over before the bowler had him caught for 31. Brevis and David Miller, who hit 22, put on 50 before two more quick strikes from Zimbabwe. Blessing Muzarabani dismissed Miller, and Raza removed Brevis. Tristan Stubbs (21) and George Linde (30) then put on an unbeaten 53 to steer their side to the target. After choosing to bat, Zimbabwe lost the in-form opener Brian Bennett, who hit an unbeaten 97 in the defeat by India, for 15.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday postponed his official visit to Russia, citing the recent “regional and internal situation”. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) confirmed the development in a statement. It added that the premier’s visit to Russia was of “great significance” for advancing the bilateral relations between the two countries, but given the current situation, it was being postponed. A new date would be decided after “mutual consultations”, the statement added. According to Russian media, PM Shehbaz was due to travel to Russia from March 3 to 5. The development comes as Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban earlier this week after the neighbouring country targeted Pakistani positions along the border. Separately, the United States and Israel launched strikes against Iran on Saturday, assassinating Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Tehran called the strikes unprovoked and illegal and responded with missiles fired at Israel and at least seven other countries, including Gulf states that host US bases. However, the assassination resulted in protests across major cities in Pakistan on Sunday, with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi urging citizens to remain peaceful.

      "summary_orig": "UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan struck a delicate balance at a tense UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, condemning unwarranted attacks on Iran, expressing solidarity with Gulf states, and urging an immediate return to negotiations and diplomacy. The Council’s emergency session examined the repercussions of the US and Israeli air strikes on Iran and laid bare the deep divisions within the 15-member body over the escalating crisis. Speaking at the meeting, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, outlined Islamabad’s growing concern as the situation in the Middle East becomes more complex with each new development. “Pakistan condemns the initiation of unwarranted attacks against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in violation of international law,” the ambassador said. At the same time, he stressed that Pakistan also “condemns the attacks against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and stands in solidarity with all these brotherly countries.” He warned that, at a time when renewed diplomatic efforts were underway, such actions would “undermine the peace and stability of the entire region, with far-reaching consequences.” Ambassador Ahmad made clear that Pakistan’s concern extends beyond any single capital. Instead, it is focused on the security architecture of the entire Gulf region — home to millions of Pakistani expatriates and a region with which Islamabad maintains deep political, economic and security ties. This dual condemnation — of strikes on Iran and of attacks on Gulf states — illustrates the fine line Pakistan is walking. It cannot afford to alienate Tehran, a neighbor with whom it shares a sensitive border and a complex security equation. Nor can it distance itself from Gulf partners that host large Pakistani communities and play a critical role in Pakistan’s economy. The envoy’s emphasis on mediation and dialogue further underscored this balancing act. “We particularly laud Oman’s role in facilitating and mediating dialogue between Iran and the United States,” he said, aligning Pakistan firmly with diplomatic efforts rather than military blocs. In another pointed observation, he lamented that “diplomacy has once again been derailed as these attacks have happened right in the middle of negotiations,” warning that “these military actions undermine dialogue and further erode trust that was already in short supply.” Islamabad’s legal framing was equally deliberate. The ambassador reminded the Council that “the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct,” stressing that the Charter “prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states.” This formulation allows Pakistan to oppose unilateral or pre-emptive military actions without directly isolating any particular power beyond the immediate incidents. At the humanitarian level, Pakistan sought to humanise the crisis. Ambassador Ahmad offered condolences to “civilians caught in the middle of these violent acts,” specifically mentioning “school children in Iran” and the family of a Pakistani national killed in the United Arab Emirates. In doing so, Islamabad reinforced its message that ordinary people — Iranians, Arabs and Pakistanis alike — are the real victims of escalation. The strategic anxiety was also explicit. “We are deeply alarmed at the risk of regional conflagration,” the ambassador said, noting that the “safety and well-being of millions of our compatriots in the countries of the region is also our top priority.” Ultimately, Pakistan’s message was straightforward but urgent: “Pakistan calls on all sides to immediately halt escalation and urgently resume diplomacy with a view to achieving a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis.” Whether the balance Islamabad seeks to maintain can endure will depend not only on its own diplomatic agility, but also on whether the region itself steps back from the brink.",

      "summary_orig": "On the international chessboard, no piece can move as freely as the United States. It moves vertically, horizontally and diagonally, across any number of squares. Regime change in Venezuela , blockades on Cuba , strikes on Iran , all within a few months. It can move north, east, south and west. And Iran? Iran is the opposing king trapped in a corner by not only the king and rook (Israel), but also its own pawns — the many factions inside Iran that the Israelis have been funding to rise up against it. A war against it from abroad and at home. In refusing to capitulate, the Iranians have decided they would rather die on their feet than be checkmated on their knees in front of their rivals. The opening gambit By the day prior to the strikes, the US had at least 50 per cent of its deployable air power around the Middle East poised to attack Iran, including more than 250 combat aircraft. As Professor Pape from the University of Chicago notes , the US had never deployed this much force against a potential enemy and not launched strikes. All the while, the Iranians were making significant concessions to the US, including importantly that they would even allow American inspectors into the country for verification on their nuclear programme. Trump’s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff remarked that Trump was surprised that the Iranians were not completely capitulating with this much firepower at their doorstep. But Trump had fundamentally misread the Iranian regime’s goal in entering these discussions; which was to prevent their evisceration without subjugation. At the heart of this, is the Iranian government’s core principle after the revolution of 1979: independence ( istiqlal ). Iran’s refusal to give up its ballistic missile programme and support for proxies was the country stating that it would rather court war than give up its sovereignty. Consequently, the ambition of Tel Aviv comes up against the defiance of Tehran. The Omani Foreign Minister went on CBS News the night before the strikes to publicly state how well the negotiations were going, in what seems to be a last ditch effort to avert war. Most importantly, states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Turkey were against this war. These states have been lobbying behind the scenes against the US attacking. The Saudis’ shift in stance appears to have come after Israel’s attack on Hamas in Qatar last year, and its apparent realisation that there needs to be a counter to Israeli hegemony. However, the unprecedented compromises made by the proud pragmatists of Iran were not enough for the Israelis and their powerful co-religionists in the US for whom the balkanisation of Iran is the goal . It has now been revealed by an Israeli officer that the day for the strikes was decided weeks ago, regardless of how negotiations were going. It seems that again negotiations were used as a ruse for preparations. This is yet another indication that the Russians are right about the Americans: they are agreement non-capable . Dialogue does not matter, only the clenched fist. A game played outside the rules The strikes against Iran are manifestly illegal and a clear violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter. The Western press has already publicised the incorrect claim that Israel and the US are fighting a war of pre-emptive self-defence against Iran. As Marco Milanović, international law scholar points out , the use of force against Iran would be lawful only if “(1) Iran had the intent (i.e. its leadership decided) to attack the US/Israel; (2) it had the capability to do so; (3) and it was necessary to use force today, because today would be the last window of opportunity to prevent this future attack”. None of these conditions are met and the argument for pre-emptive self-defence (even if an argument for pre-emption is accepted which many states reject) is even weaker considering President Trump said that the US had “ obliterated ” Iran’s nuclear capability last year. There is no argument of international law under which these strikes could be lawful given there was no imminent armed attack by Iran which is being thwarted. Iran now has the right to self-defence, under Article 51 of the UN Charter, to respond to these attacks. The coming moves Despite President Trump’s fervent belief in the invincibility of the US military, there were a number of leaks from the Pentagon in the days leading up to the war in which officials flagged their concerns about a lengthy conflict. A long war seems to be Iran’s best bet with the US military being better at ‘one and done’ strikes like the abduction of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro and the assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Lengthier conflicts, like Iraq and Afghanistan, are much riskier, especially given the current run on the US’ munitions stockpiles and air defence interceptors. Wargames conducted in 2023 noted that in the event of a war with China, “the United States would likely run out of some munitions — such as long-range, precision-guided munitions — in less than one week.” However, that is if Iran can last that long. So far it seems that the US has engaged in attacking military targets while Israel has engaged in decapitation strikes, which includes their key target: Iranian Ayatollah Khamenei . They are going after regime officials in an effort to topple it and end the war sooner. However, it may be that regime hardliners come into power and wrest control. Iran is exporting the destruction meted upon it to the US bases of the Arab regimes which surround it. These regimes have subcontracted their protection to the Americans, and Iran has chosen to attack them for this dignity deficit. It hopes that the more damage it inflicts on them means they will clamour for a ceasefire to the Americans on its behalf. Part of this strategy may include Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz through which 20 per cent of world’s oil consumption flows, destabilising the world’s economy. As it is with most asymmetric conflicts, Iran wins if it doesn’t lose, and the US loses if it doesn’t win. The board after the game On February 27, the day before Israel struck Iran, Yoav Gallant, former Israeli Minister of Defence and wanted war criminal by the International Criminal Court, wrote an article titled ‘The Next Strategic Shift in the Middle East’ . I read the article anticipating it would be about Israel’s war with Iran, but it wasn’t. Gallant’s focus of the piece was Turkiye. He advocates for a pivot to countering the Eurasian country, stating that ‘[t]he weakening of Iran is a significant achievement. But the structure replacing it will define the next generation of regional order. Turkey is already positioning itself at the center of that structure, with the military capacity, the institutional reach, and the ambition to shape what comes next’. When the US was invading Iraq in 2003, Zionists were supporting that war but already wanting to turn to Iran immediately after, popularising the slogan “Anyone can go to Baghdad. Real men go to Tehran.” It seems now, Israelis are already saying “Anyone can go to Tehran. Real men go to Ankara.” Israel is, as always, planning a few moves ahead.",

Iran’s refusal to give up its ballistic missile programme and support for proxies was the country stating that it would rather court war than give up its sovereignty. Consequently, the ambition of Tel Aviv comes up against the defiance of Tehran. The Omani Foreign Minister went on CBS News the night before the strikes to publicly state how well the negotiations were going, in what seems to be a last ditch effort to avert war. Most importantly, states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Turkey were against this war. These states have been lobbying behind the scenes against the US attacking. The Saudis’ shift in stance appears to have come after Israel’s attack on Hamas in Qatar last year, and its apparent realisation that there needs to be a counter to Israeli hegemony. However, the unprecedented compromises made by the proud pragmatists of Iran were not enough for the Israelis and their powerful co-religionists in the US for whom the balkanisation of Iran is the goal . It has now been revealed by an Israeli officer that the day for the strikes was decided weeks ago, regardless of how negotiations were going. It seems that again negotiations were used as a ruse for preparations. This is yet another indication that the Russians are right about the Americans: they are agreement non-capable . Dialogue does not matter, only the clenched fist. A game played outside the rules The strikes against Iran are manifestly illegal and a clear violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter. The Western press has already publicised the incorrect claim that Israel and the US are fighting a war of pre-emptive self-defence against Iran. As Marco Milanović, international law scholar points out , the use of force against Iran would be lawful only if “(1) Iran had the intent (i.e. its leadership decided) to attack the US/Israel; (2) it had the capability to do so; (3) and it was necessary to use force today, because today would be the last window of opportunity to prevent this future attack”. None of these conditions are met and the argument for pre-emptive self-defence (even if an argument for pre-emption is accepted which many states reject) is even weaker considering President Trump said that the US had “ obliterated ” Iran’s nuclear capability last year. There is no argument of international law under which these strikes could be lawful given there was no imminent armed attack by Iran which is being thwarted. Iran now has the right to self-defence, under Article 51 of the UN Charter, to respond to these attacks. The coming moves Despite President Trump’s fervent belief in the invincibility of the US military, there were a number of leaks from the Pentagon in the days leading up to the war in which officials flagged their concerns about a lengthy conflict. A long war seems to be Iran’s best bet with the US military being better at ‘one and done’ strikes like the abduction of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro and the assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Lengthier conflicts, like Iraq and Afghanistan, are much riskier, especially given the current run on the US’ munitions stockpiles and air defence interceptors. Wargames conducted in 2023 noted that in the event of a war with China, “the United States would likely run out of some munitions — such as long-range, precision-guided munitions — in less than one week.” However, that is if Iran can last that long. So far it seems that the US has engaged in attacking military targets while Israel has engaged in decapitation strikes, which includes their key target: Iranian Ayatollah Khamenei . They are going after regime officials in an effort to topple it and end the war sooner. However, it may be that regime hardliners come into power and wrest control. Iran is exporting the destruction meted upon it to the US bases of the Arab regimes which surround it. These regimes have subcontracted their protection to the Americans, and Iran has chosen to attack them for this dignity deficit. It hopes that the more damage it inflicts on them means they will clamour for a ceasefire to the Americans on its behalf. Part of this strategy may include Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz through which 20 per cent of world’s oil consumption flows, destabilising the world’s economy. As it is with most asymmetric conflicts, Iran wins if it doesn’t lose, and the US loses if it doesn’t win. The board after the game On February 27, the day before Israel struck Iran, Yoav Gallant, former Israeli Minister of Defence and wanted war criminal by the International Criminal Court, wrote an article titled ‘The Next Strategic Shift in the Middle East’ . I read the article anticipating it would be about Israel’s war with Iran, but it wasn’t. Gallant’s focus of the piece was Turkiye. He advocates for a pivot to countering the Eurasian country, stating that ‘[t]he weakening of Iran is a significant achievement. But the structure replacing it will define the next generation of regional order. Turkey is already positioning itself at the center of that structure, with the military capacity, the institutional reach, and the ambition to shape what comes next’. When the US was invading Iraq in 2003, Zionists were supporting that war but already wanting to turn to Iran immediately after, popularising the slogan “Anyone can go to Baghdad. Real men go to Tehran.” It seems now, Israelis are already saying “Anyone can go to Tehran. Real men go to Ankara.” Israel is, as always, planning a few moves ahead.",
      "title": "The US and Israel struck Iran despite headway in negotiations. What is the endgame here?",
      "summary": "On the international chessboard, no piece can move as freely as the United States. It moves vertically, horizontally and diagonally, across any number of squares. Regime change in Venezuela , blockades on Cuba , strikes on Iran , all within a few months. It can move north, east, south and west. And Iran? Iran is the opposing king trapped in a corner by not only the king and rook (Israel), but also its own pawns — the many factions inside Iran that the Israelis have been funding to rise up against it. A war against it from abroad and at home. In refusing to capitulate, the Iranians have decided they would rather die on their feet than be checkmated on their knees in front of their rivals. The opening gambit By the day prior to the strikes, the US had at least 50 per cent of its deployable air power around the Middle East poised to attack Iran, including more than 250 combat aircraft. As Professor Pape from the University of Chicago notes , the US had never deployed this much force against a potential enemy and not launched strikes. All the while, the Iranians were making significant concessions to the US, including importantly that they would even allow American inspectors into the country for verification on their nuclear programme. Trump’s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff remarked that Trump was surprised that the Iranians were not completely capitulating with this much firepower at their doorstep. But Trump had fundamentally misread the Iranian regime’s goal in entering these discussions; which was to prevent their evisceration without subjugation. At the heart of this, is the Iranian government’s core principle after the revolution of 1979: independence ( istiqlal ).

      "title_orig": "Ayatollah Khamenei’s assassination: A new chapter for Iran, a region at a crossroads",
      "summary_orig": "The assassination of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader and Marjai Taqleed for millions of Shia Muslims, in coordinated US-Israeli airstrikes marks a turning point not only for the Islamic Republic of Iran but for the wider West Asian region. His assassination removes a figure who for more than three decades stood at the apex of Iran’s political, military and religious order. Yet those expecting the immediate collapse of the Iranian system may be misreading both its structure and its history. Ayatollah Khamenei was not merely a head of state. As Supreme Leader, he exercised ultimate authority over foreign policy, the armed forces and the direction of the revolution. As Marjai Taqleed, a source of emulation in Shia jurisprudence, he embodied religious legitimacy that extended beyond Iran’s borders. His passing, therefore, creates a vacuum that is institutional as much as personal. Under Iran’s constitution, an interim council comprising President Masoud Pezeshkian, the judiciary chief, and a cleric from the Guardian Council is to assume responsibilities until the Assembly of Experts appoints a successor. The Assembly must choose from among senior Shia clerics. No consensus candidate has so far emerged. Names circulating in Tehran include Sadeq Larijani, the former judiciary chief and a close aide to Khamenei; Alireza Arafi, who oversees Iran’s seminaries; Mohsen Araki, a longtime member of the Assembly; Mohsen Qomi, an adviser within the Supreme Leader’s office; and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ruhollah Khomeini. Arafi, a source said, may be the favourite for filling in the space left behind by Ayatollah Khamenei. The late Ebrahim Raisi had been widely seen as a frontrunner before his own death in an air crash. Reports that Ayatollah Khamenei had quietly identified three potential successors during earlier crises suggest that contingency planning was already underway, though the names remain undisclosed. Institutional depth Despite the shock, Iran’s system is not built around one man alone. The Islamic Republic rests on multiple pillars, including the clerical establishment, security services, the bureaucracy, and an ideological base shaped by the doctrine of Velayat e Faqih. Unlike personality-driven autocracies, it therefore has institutional depth. During the transition phase, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is likely to play a decisive role in managing the affair. Whether as a stabiliser or dominant force, it will seek to prevent fragmentation. People react as they gather at the Enghelab Square, after Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was killed in Israeli and US strikes on Saturday, in Tehran, Iran on March 1, 2026. — Reuters That, however, does not mean friction is impossible. Economic sanctions have already strained society and fueled periodic unrest. Elite rivalries could surface as factions maneuver for influence over the next Supreme Leader. A hardline successor would definitely double down on ideological orthodoxy. Even if a relatively moderate cleric is chosen, immediate flexibility toward the West appears unlikely, as regimes, in moments of perceived siege, tend to project strength, not compromise. Iran’s own history counsels against premature obituaries. The Islamic Republic has faced moments far more perilous and yet endured. During the Iran-Iraq War, when the revolution was still young, Iran confronted invasion, diplomatic isolation, and crippling arms embargoes. It answered not by retreat but by mobilising society through revolutionary zeal and religious conviction, expanding the Basij volunteer force and adjusting its economy to survive under siege. During that period, the Hafte Tir bombing, carried out by the militant Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), eliminated 74 senior officials in one stroke, among them Chief Justice Mohammad Beheshti and several cabinet members. It was a decapitation attempt targeting the heart of the nascent revolution. Yet the system did not unravel. Vacancies were filled with speed, institutions closed ranks, and the doctrine of Velayat e Faqih was consolidated rather than diluted. The external consequences are already visible. Iran has responded to aggression with missile and drone strikes against Israel and US facilities in the Gulf. Its network of regional allies and proxies, often described as the Axis of Resistance, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, is expected to intensify asymmetrical attacks. Ayatollah Khamenei’s death will be framed as martyrdom, a narrative that resonates deeply within Shia political theology and could mobilise supporters from Iraq to Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei meets with a group of girls who reached the age of puberty in Tehran, Iran on February 3, 2023. — Reuters/File For Israel, the operation may have removed a principal adversary, but it also introduces new unpredictability. Khamenei, though implacably opposed to Israel, was a calculating actor who calibrated escalation. A leadership in transition, under pressure to demonstrate resolve, may be less restrained. Multi-front confrontations stretching from the Gulf to the Levant become more conceivable. Strategic gamble The US under President Donald Trump has presented the assassination as an act of “justice” and even an opportunity for Iranians to reclaim their country. Yet history offers caution. Air power alone seldom topples entrenched systems absent ground intervention or a coherent internal uprising. Instead, external attack often consolidates ruling elites and blunts domestic dissent, at least in the short term. The strategic gamble is therefore immense. If retaliation expands to target US assets across West Asia, Washington could find itself drawn deeper into a conflict without a clear political end state. Moreover, with the erosion of deterrence, cycles of strike and counterstrike may harden into a wider war. And if the Islamic Republic survives, as seems probable in the near term, it may emerge more securitized and more distrustful. Khamenei’s assassination has closed one chapter in Iran’s revolutionary history, but it does not automatically open another aligned with the ambitions of those who ordered the strike. Instead, it ushers in a period of uncertainty. The Islamic Republic is wounded but not necessarily weakened and the region is unsettled and more combustible. The world may soon discover that removing a man is far easier than reshaping the order he helped build.",

      "summary_orig": "• Civil Defence official testifies power shutdown, closed exits and lack of emergency lighting hampered evacuation • Says building was inspected twice in 2024, 2025 and fire safety mesasures were found inadequate KARACHI: An official of Civil Defence has informed the Gul Plaza Judicial Commission that the fire and rescue service of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), as well as the Rescue 1122, were equipped with advanced machinery, but failed to douse the fire efficiently and rescue people trapped inside the burning building on Jan 17. He also deposed that premature shutdown of electricity, lack of emergency/backup lights and closure of gates had further exacerbated panic among people stuck in the ill-fated building and significantly impaired evacuation efforts. Mirza Mursaleen Baig, a technical instructor at the Civil Defence department, further testified that fire safety measures were found inadequate during an inspection of the building, but a challan could not be filed in court over non-compliance with safety regulations. While mainly shifting responsibility of the tragic incident to the fire crew and rescue services, he maintained that Civil Defence was facing a severe shortage of staff and resources, and it was impossible to inspect all the buildings comprehensively. Earlier, the single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court had directed additional controller Civil Defence Fatima Memon to respond to its various questions after outgoing director Abdul Hameed informed it that he could not reply to the questionnaires as he was no longer holding the charge. However, Mr Baig turned up before the commission, tasked with probing the devastating blaze, and informed it that he was assisting Ms Memon, who has been placed under suspension after the Gul Plaza fire incident. In his testimony recorded under oath, the technical instructor said that inspection and fire prevention in commercial and industrial sectors and holding training sessions for firefighting/casualty were core responsibilities of Civil Defence. He deposed that inspections of the ill-fated building were carried out in 2024 and 2025, and that fire safety measures were found inadequate, while the building management was directed to comply with safety regulations. He also said that generally, Civil Defence used to file challans before the special courts in case of non-compliance, but the same could not be filed in this particular case due to the unavailability of courts/judge. The official conceded that the courts had become functional in July last year; however, the challan was not placed before it till the devastating fire incident took place. Based on available information, Mr Baig further testified that it was a class “B” fire involving multiple types of highly flammable material/fuel, including plastic, rubber, melamine crockery, fabrics, cosmetic products, etc. As per standard fire safety principles, the electricity is ordinarily shut down where the fire originates from an electrical short circuit, categorising the same as class “C” fire, whereas immediate disconnection of power in class “B” fire was not necessarily mandated unless there is a direct electrical hazard, he maintained. He also deposed that the premature shutdown of power had contributed to darkness in the premises and panic among the people present inside the building at the time of the incident. The official of Civil Defence further testified that the exit points should have remained open to facilitate the evacuation, as closure of gates, darkness and smoke have significantly impaired evacuation efforts. Under the applicable fire safety laws and standard operating procedures (SOPs), the technical instructor was of the view that the building management was required to maintain firefighting capacity sufficient for around 15 minutes before the arrival of emergency services. He also said that no separate emergency lighting arrangements were installed at the passages/corridors, which were normally required to function in the event of a power shutdown during a fire emergency. The absence of such emergency lights had further exacerbated panic among occupants, particularly in darkness combined with thick smoke, he said, and further asserted that Civil Defence was facing a severe shortage of staff and resources as there were only 88 personnel for the whole province. He maintained that only six persons were assigned to the South district with no supporting staff, and under such constraints, it was humanly impossible to inspect all buildings comprehensively. About the Gul Plaza fire, the technical instructor of Civil Defence said, “I state that the primary responsibility lies with the KMC fire and rescue services and the Rescue 1122 department. They are equipped with advanced machinery such as special oxygen masks with tanks, tools and specialised SOPs to handle such emergencies. Unfortunately, due to a lack of awareness or negligence, they failed to extinguish the fire effectively and rescue the trapped individuals”. Thereafter, the commission invited the director general of Rescue 1122 and the chief fire officer to cross-examine the technical instructor of Civil Defence, as he had levelled accusations of serious nature.

      "summary_orig": "WHEN the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2803 on Nov 17, 2025, it expected the Board of Peace (BoP) to be a transitional administration that would coordinate funding for Gaza’s redevelopment until such time the Palestinian Authority completed its reform programme and conditions were in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian statehood. The resolution authorised the creation of a transitional governance administration, including a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to administer the territory and the establishment of a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza. Three months after the resolution’s adoption, the BoP held its first formal meeting on Feb 19, 2026, in Washington. While officials from 50 nations attended the meeting, only 27, including some notable Arab and Muslim countries, have joined the BoP as members so far. Countries like China, Russia and France stayed away due to lack of clarity on the BoP’s scope. The confusion followed President Donald Trump’s statement that the BoP’s remit could expand beyond Gaza to address other conflicts worldwide. Understandably, the EU would not like the BoP to talk about Greenland, nor would India wish it to discuss Indian-occupied Kashmir. Ironically, while the BoP has been set up to discuss issues relating to Gaza’s future, it has no Palestinian member, even though Israel is one. While Trump characterised the BoP as the “most consequential international body in history”, its members are well aware that it essentially revolves around the persona of the US president and can never be a replacement for the UN, the most representative body for conflict resolution. There were three immediate expectations from the BoP’s first meeting, nearly all of which have fallen short. Firstly, the world expected the BoP to take steps towards the solemn implementation of the Oct 10, 2025, ceasefire , which ended a brutal two-year war imposed by Israel on Gaza’s residents, killing over 72,000 people, destroying 80 per cent of its buildings and displacing 2.1 million Gazans. Sadly, the ceasefire has not been fully implemented as Israel has continued its killing spree daily, slaughtering over 600 Palestinians since the ceasefire. Pakistan has taken a prudent position. Another expectation from the BoP was to ensure that humanitarian assistance would flow in. Although assistance has started coming into Gaza to provide food, rehabilitate hospitals and clear the rubble, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has observed that the Palestinians continue to suffer “displacement, trauma, uncertainty and deprivation”. The European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management has also noted that humanitarian aid was entering Gaza “drop by drop” and needed expanded access through the Rafah crossing. More than 600 aid workers have been killed. For his part, Trump informed the BoP that the US would contribute $10 billion and that nine countries had pledged $7bn towards a reconstruction fund. However, Israel has conditioned any reconstruction on the demilitarisation of the Gaza Strip and the disarmament of Hamas. The Israeli prime minister is keen to disarm Hamas, but fails to recognise that the Israeli Defence Forces are still occupying over half of Gaza and continue to bomb innocent Palestinians. Hamas is reluctant to surrender its arms as it fears Israeli reprisals, but is ready to hand over the administration to a committee of Palestinian technocrats. The third expectation from the BoP’s first meeting was to work towards creating conditions for Palestin­ian self-determination and statehood. There appears to be no progress towards this pivotal issue, which must be addressed if the world wishes to see lasting peace in the Middle East. Amidst news of Israeli plans to integrate the West Bank, the US ambassador to Israel has termed the establishment of Greater Israel a biblical right of the Jewish state. This statement was strongly condemned by Arab and other Muslim states. Although the statement was later downplayed, it is being interpreted as tacit US support for the creation of Greater Israel on lands stretching from the Euphrates to the Nile. As for the proposed ISF, five countries, including Indonesia, have volunteered to provide troops. However, troop-contributing countries would not want to be in a situation where they either fight Hamas or the Israeli forces. For its part, Pakistan has prudently decided to not commit any troops for the ISF until Israeli forces have withdrawn from Gaza and a Palestinian administration is in place. Commendably, Pakistan was one of the strongest voices at the BoP for the rights of the Palestinians, including self-determination and statehood.

The resolution authorised the creation of a transitional governance administration, including a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to administer the territory and the establishment of a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza. Three months after the resolution’s adoption, the BoP held its first formal meeting on Feb 19, 2026, in Washington.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: There was no let-up in fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the conflict entered its third day despite efforts by the international community to de-escalate the situation, which has claimed scores of lives since Thursday night. The clashes started after the Afghan Taliban targeted Pakistani positions along the border in response to earlier air strikes by Pakistan in multiple Afghan provinces to target the militants involved in cross-border attacks. Pakistan launched the operation ‘Ghazb lil Haq’ in response and took out military targets across Afghanistan. On Saturday, the armed forces continued ground and air operations against the Afghan Taliban overnight, striking formation headquarters in Nangarhar and other areas. The headquarters of the Afghan army in Kandahar and Nangarhar provinces were destroyed in targeted air strikes carried out by the armed forces, said security sources. State-run media reported that air strikes “hit two targets at the Mohmand Dara Base in Nangarhar” while Afghan Taliban posts near Miranshah and in the Ghulam Khan sector along the border were also destroyed. Info ministry says 331 Taliban combatants killed, 104 posts destroyed so far In a statement on Saturday, Info­rmation Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed that under the operation ‘Ghazab lil-Haq’, the armed forces have killed “331 Afghan Taliban personnel and injured more than 500 others” since the start of the operation. He said that the armed forces had destroyed 104 posts and captured 22 others. According to the minister, 163 tanks and other vehicles were also destroyed, and 37 locations had been targeted across the border. Amid intense clashes along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, authorities across the country took a series of precautionary measures, such as hospital emergencies in areas near the border and a ban on drones in almost all parts of the country. According to a notification, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government imposed an immediate and complete ban on outdoor drone flying across the territory for 30 days to ensure the safety of citizens and protection of public and private installations amid heightened tensions along the country’s western borders. Meanwhile, in Landi Kotal, the authorities relocated all 37 under-trial prisoners to a lockup in Jamrud after mortar shells fired from Afghanistan fell in the nearby tehsil offices compound. Officials said that the tehsil offices compound was earlier vacated, with district administration officials advised to work from home. The ‘open war’ also took a toll on the Afghan refugees, as the state authorities intensified their crackdown against them. Claim rejected The information ministry rejected claims about a Pakistani jet being shot down in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar. The ministry’s fact-check account on X attributed the claims to Afghan Taliban officials that were “amplified by Indian media”. “The Ministry of Defence of the so-called Islamic Emirate claimed that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani fighter jet in Nangarhar and captured its pilot alive. The claim was widely amplified by Indian media and Afghan propaganda outlets,” it said. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington did not view Pakistan as the aggressor in the latest escalation and that Islamabad was under pressure to address its security challenges, Reuters reported, adding Wash­ington hoped the situation would not escalate further. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that “our cup of patience has overflowed” and described the fighting as “open war”, warning that Pakistan would respond to further attacks. According to Reuters , Taliban deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said 19 civilians were killed and 26 wounded in Khost and Paktika. Reuters could not verify the claim. Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani said in a speech in Khost province that the conflict “will be very costly”, and that Afghan forces had not deployed broadly beyond those already engaged. Pakistan’s military capabilities far exceed those of Afghanistan, with a standing army of hundreds of thousands and a modern air force. In stark contrast, the Taliban lacks a conventional air force and relies largely on light weaponry and ground forces. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LA PAZ : At least 22 people were killed when a Bolivian military cargo plane carrying banknotes crashed while landing near the capital city La Paz, police said Friday, as crowds attempted to loot the site. The aircraft, a C-130 Hercules transport plane — manufactured by Lockheed Martin — veered off the runway at El Alto Intern­ational Airport and crashed into an avenue, destroying multiple cars and damaging trucks, local media footage showed. Mangled parts of the aircraft were seen on the road where the plane came down and bystanders could be seen rushing to grab the scattered cash prompting police to deploy tear gas to repel the hordes. Authorities were later seen setting the money alight in a bonfire at the scene of the crash. It was not immediately known what caused the crash but witnesses told AFP that the weather had been treacherous. 28 injured as hospitals launch emergency blood donation drive The Ministry of Defence said it would launch an investigation into the crash. Colonel Rene Tambo, head of the police homicide division in El Alto, told reporters late Friday that “there are about 20, maybe a few more,” casualties. Colonel Pavel Tovar of the National Fire Department gave an earlier toll of “between 15 and 16 people” dead in the disaster. “We are recovering the bodies of these people who have sadly suffered in the accident,” he said. Bolivia’s health ministry rep­orted that at least 28 people were injured. Money grab ‘a crime’ Fatalities were recorded both at the airport and on the busy avenue where the plane crashed and struck several vehicles. The Bolivian Air Navigation and Airports authority NAABOL said in a statement that the C-130 Hercules had departed from the eastern city of Santa Cruz and crashed while landing at El Alto international airport, which has since suspended operations. The defence ministry in a statement said that “the money transported in the crashed aircraft has no official serial number… therefore it has no legal or purchasing power.” It said that “its collection, possession, or use constitutes a crime.” The La Paz Prosecutor’s Office received reports of businesses that were also targeted by criminals taking advantage of the chaos. “Twelve people have been arrested” for questioning, prosecutor Luis Carlos Torres told reporters. Hospitals in El Alto also launched a blood donation campaign to treat the injured. La Paz, at an altitude of 1,975 feet and surrounded by Andean peaks, is the highest administrative capital in the world. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",

Mangled parts of the aircraft were seen on the road where the plane came down and bystanders could be seen rushing to grab the scattered cash prompting police to deploy tear gas to repel the hordes. Authorities were later seen setting the money alight in a bonfire at the scene of the crash. It was not immediately known what caused the crash but witnesses told AFP that the weather had been treacherous. 28 injured as hospitals launch emergency blood donation drive The Ministry of Defence said it would launch an investigation into the crash. Colonel Rene Tambo, head of the police homicide division in El Alto, told reporters late Friday that “there are about 20, maybe a few more,” casualties. Colonel Pavel Tovar of the National Fire Department gave an earlier toll of “between 15 and 16 people” dead in the disaster. “We are recovering the bodies of these people who have sadly suffered in the accident,” he said. Bolivia’s health ministry rep­orted that at least 28 people were injured. Money grab ‘a crime’ Fatalities were recorded both at the airport and on the busy avenue where the plane crashed and struck several vehicles. The Bolivian Air Navigation and Airports authority NAABOL said in a statement that the C-130 Hercules had departed from the eastern city of Santa Cruz and crashed while landing at El Alto international airport, which has since suspended operations. The defence ministry in a statement said that “the money transported in the crashed aircraft has no official serial number… therefore it has no legal or purchasing power.” It said that “its collection, possession, or use constitutes a crime.” The La Paz Prosecutor’s Office received reports of businesses that were also targeted by criminals taking advantage of the chaos. “Twelve people have been arrested” for questioning, prosecutor Luis Carlos Torres told reporters. Hospitals in El Alto also launched a blood donation campaign to treat the injured. La Paz, at an altitude of 1,975 feet and surrounded by Andean peaks, is the highest administrative capital in the world. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Airspace shut over Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan • Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, 24 other airlines ground flights ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Int­ernational Airlines (PIA) suspended flights to several Gulf countries on Saturday, joining a cascade of global carriers grounding aircraft across the Middle East after US and Israeli strikes on Iran plunged the region into a renewed military conflict and shut down major air corridors. According to a statement by the PIA spokesperson, flights have been suspended to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait. “These flights will not operate until tomorrow evening or until the restoration of airspace, whichever comes later,” the spokesperson said. “PIA flights to Saudi Arabia will continue; however, their routes have been changed,” he added. “Flights have been shifted to Boeing 777 aircraft and will reach their destinations via longer routes,” the spokesperson added. The national carrier requested the travellers to contact the PIA call centre at 111-786-786 for information related to their flights or changes in the booking of flights. The widespread disruption followed a series of Israeli strikes on Iran and retaliatory missile salvoes from Tehran, forcing an immediate shutdown of airspace over at least seven countries. The conflict’s most significant impact was felt at Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel. Dubai Airports announced a suspension of all flights until further notice, a move echoed by its flagship carrier, Emirates. Flydubai, its sister airline, also halted operations, while in the neighbouring Emirati capital, Etihad Airways suspended all departures from Abu Dhabi until Sunday morning and cancelled expected arrivals. The skies over Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan were virtually empty on Saturday, according to flight-tracking service Flightradar24, as civilian aircraft were rerouted around a vast no-fly zone. The European Union’s aviation regulator, EASA, recommended that its airlines stay out of the affected airspace. Oman Air has also announced cancellations and temporary suspensions of several flights due to the evolving regional situation. Major international carriers moved swiftly to suspend services. British Airways cancelled flights to Tel Aviv and Bahrain until March 3. Germany’s Lufthansa suspended flights to and from Dubai for the weekend and halted routes to Tel Aviv, Beirut and Oman until March 7. Air France cancelled flights to Tel Aviv, Beirut and Dubai, while Italy’s ITA Airways suspended its Tel Aviv route and announced it would avoid the airspace of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon until March 7. Wizz Air halted flights to Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman until the same date. The chaos rippled eastward, with Air India and Indigo suspending flights to the Middle East. Russia’s transport ministry said its air carriers had suspended flights to both Iran and Israel. Regional carriers were also profoundly affected, with Qatar Airways and Kuwait Airways temporarily suspending all flights from their home hubs after their national airspace was closed. Turkish Airlines cancelled flights to 10 Middle Eastern nations, though some Gulf suspensions were only for Saturday. The sudden shutdown caught many flights mid-air, with a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Dubai forced to return to its origin city. Virgin Atlantic said it would temporarily avoid Iraqi airspace, causing some re-routing. Throughout the day, more airlines suspended services, including Swiss, KLM, Iberia Express, SAS, Finnair, and Norwegian. Regional operators like Air Algerie and Aegean Airlines also grounded routes. Japan Airlines also cancelled a flight to the region. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "The Avrocar was the result of a Canadian effort to develop a supersonic, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) fighter-bomber in the early 1950s. However, its circular shape gave it the appearance of a “flying saucer” out of science fiction movies of the period. A.V. Roe (Avro) Aircraft Limited (later Avro Canada) based its design concept for the Avrocar on using the exhaust from turbojet engines to drive a circular “turborotor” which produced thrust. By directing this thrust downward, the turborotor would create a cushion of air (also known as “ground effect”) upon which the aircraft would float at low altitude. When the thrust was directed toward the rear, the aircraft would accelerate and gain altitude. In 1952, the Canadian government provided initial funding but dropped the project when it became too expensive. Avro offered the project to the U.S. government, and the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force took it over in 1958. Each service had different requirements: the Army wanted to use it as a subsonic, all-terrain troop transport and reconnaissance craft, but the USAF wanted a VTOL aircraft that could hover below enemy radar then zoom up to supersonic speed. Avro’s designers believed they could satisfy both services, but these two sets of requirements differed too much. Research data originally indicated that a circular wing might satisfy both the Army’s and Air Force’s requirements, and Avro built two small test vehicles to prove the concept. Designated the VZ-9AV Avrocar (“VZ” stood for “experimental vertical flight,” “9” for the ninth concept proposal, and “AV” for Avro). Tests with scale models at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, indicated that the cushion of air under the Avrocar would become unstable just a few feet off the ground. The aircraft would be incapable of reaching supersonic speeds, but the testing went ahead to determine if a suitable aircraft could be developed for the Army. The first prototype -- the Avrocar on display (serial number 58-7055) -- was sent to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif. There, wind tunnel tests proved that the aircraft had insufficient control for high speed flight and was aerodynamically unstable. The second Avrocar prototype underwent flight tests that validated the wind tunnel tests. If it flew more than three feet above the ground, the Avrocar displayed uncontrollable pitch and roll motions, which the Avro engineers called \"hubcapping.\" The Avrocar could only reach a maximum speed of 35 mph, and all attempts to end the hubcapping failed. The project was cancelled in December 1961. The second prototype aircraft went to the U.S. Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis, Va., and the first prototype Avrocar came to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in 2007.

In 1952, the Canadian government provided initial funding but dropped the project when it became too expensive. Avro offered the project to the U.S. government, and the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force took it over in 1958. Each service had different requirements: the Army wanted to use it as a subsonic, all-terrain troop transport and reconnaissance craft, but the USAF wanted a VTOL aircraft that could hover below enemy radar then zoom up to supersonic speed. Avro’s designers believed they could satisfy both services, but these two sets of requirements differed too much. Research data originally indicated that a circular wing might satisfy both the Army’s and Air Force’s requirements, and Avro built two small test vehicles to prove the concept. Designated the VZ-9AV Avrocar (“VZ” stood for “experimental vertical flight,” “9” for the ninth concept proposal, and “AV” for Avro). Tests with scale models at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, indicated that the cushion of air under the Avrocar would become unstable just a few feet off the ground. The aircraft would be incapable of reaching supersonic speeds, but the testing went ahead to determine if a suitable aircraft could be developed for the Army. The first prototype -- the Avrocar on display (serial number 58-7055) -- was sent to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif. There, wind tunnel tests proved that the aircraft had insufficient control for high speed flight and was aerodynamically unstable. The second Avrocar prototype underwent flight tests that validated the wind tunnel tests. If it flew more than three feet above the ground, the Avrocar displayed uncontrollable pitch and roll motions, which the Avro engineers called \"hubcapping.\" The Avrocar could only reach a maximum speed of 35 mph, and all attempts to end the hubcapping failed. The project was cancelled in December 1961. The second prototype aircraft went to the U.S. Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis, Va., and the first prototype Avrocar came to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in 2007.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, police on Saturday issued a public safety advisory which stated that Karachi had been placed on “high alert”. The advisory issued by the office of the Karachi additional inspector general of police, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said, “Karachi has been placed on high alert following increased military tensions between Pakistan and Afghan Taliban forces near the Pak-Afghan border.” “Police and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) have strengthened surveillance and tightened security at key entry-exit points, transportation hubs, sensitive and important places to pre-empt potential security threats,” it said. In the safety guidelines for residents and visitors, the Karachi police urged them to stay vigilant and alert to announcements from local police, law enforcement and provincial officials. The advisory urged the citizens to report suspicious activity and immediately notify local police or emergency services if they observe unusual movements, unattended packages, unfamiliar persons loitering in sensitive areas, illegal foreigners or any other suspicious activity. It also urged citizens to follow the directions of security personnel and comply promptly with instructions from police checkpoints or clearance operations. Further, it urged citizens to verify information and to avoid spreading unverified rumours or “panic content” on social media. The advisory pointed out to a recent fake threat alert on social media related to a few shopping centres and commercial areas that caused “fear and panic” in public. It advised the citizens to “rely on official statements from Sindh Police, local administration, or government press briefings”. Further, air travellers were advised to leave their homes for the airport at least one hour earlier than usual due to enhanced screening, stop-and-search measures and increased security around airport and key points. It stated that only one visitor or attendant should accompany one passenger to the designated drop off or pick-up point to avoid crowding at the airport. Citizens were also told to carry their computerised national identity cards (CNICs) with them at all times, as they may be required for verification at various checkpoints. “National security forces and law enforcement agencies are fully prepared to respond to threats and protect citizens. All measures are designed to maintain peace, stability, and public safety,” the advisory concluded.",

Further, it urged citizens to verify information and to avoid spreading unverified rumours or “panic content” on social media. The advisory pointed out to a recent fake threat alert on social media related to a few shopping centres and commercial areas that caused “fear and panic” in public. It advised the citizens to “rely on official statements from Sindh Police, local administration, or government press briefings”. Further, air travellers were advised to leave their homes for the airport at least one hour earlier than usual due to enhanced screening, stop-and-search measures and increased security around airport and key points. It stated that only one visitor or attendant should accompany one passenger to the designated drop off or pick-up point to avoid crowding at the airport. Citizens were also told to carry their computerised national identity cards (CNICs) with them at all times, as they may be required for verification at various checkpoints. “National security forces and law enforcement agencies are fully prepared to respond to threats and protect citizens. All measures are designed to maintain peace, stability, and public safety,” the advisory concluded.",
