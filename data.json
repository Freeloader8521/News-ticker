      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed four Indian-sponsored terrorists in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, the military’s media wing said on Thursday. According to a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted an IBO last night on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij. Fitna al Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. “During conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, four khawarij were sent to hell,” ISPR said. It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, who “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”. It said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. It said that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country. In separate statements, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari commended the security forces for the operation, state-run Radio Pakistan reported. “The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in this war against terrorism,” the report quoted the prime minister as saying. PM Shehbaz expressed the government’s firm resolve to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism in the country. The prime minister said that security forces “continue to achieve significant successes under the Azm-i-Istehkam vision”, according to the report. In a separate statement, President Zardari said, “The relentless efforts of the security forces and law enforcement agencies under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam are commendable.” The president reaffirmed the nation’s resolve to continue the fight against terrorism until its complete eradication. He reiterated that the entire nation stands united with its security forces in safeguarding the country’s peace and stability. The operation in Lakki Marwat has been conducted days after a terrorist attack , involving an explosive-laden vehicle, on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district, martyred 11 security personnel, as per ISPR. 12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khwarij with precision,” ISPR said. KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.",

      "summary_orig": "The finance ministry said on Thursday that Pakistan and the United States had formally launched a strategic economic initiative, including collaboration regarding the operation, maintenance, renovation and redevelopment of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York. In a statement, the ministry said that the initiative would include collaboration with the US General Services Administration (GSA) for the redevelopment of the hotel. “This engagement was negotiated and stewarded by US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump,” it said. “To advance this partnership, both governments have signed an MoU formalising their cooperation,” the ministry added. The statement said the MoU was signed by GSA Administrator Edward C Forst and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and was witnessed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Witkoff. “It establishes a structured, time-bound framework for joint evaluation of the technical, commercial, and economic parameters of cooperation, reflecting a shared commitment to transparent, disciplined, and mutually beneficial progress,” the statement said. The statement noted the Roosevelt Hotel’s prime location in Manhattan and the complexity of New York zoning and municipal process, saying the “institutional coordination aims to reduce execution risk, enhance regulatory clarity, and maximize transaction value”. “Such facilitative frameworks are consistent with international practice in cross-border real estate and infrastructure projects,” it added. “The objective remains to secure maximum value for this property in alignment with the government’s privatisation strategy while strengthening Pakistan-United States economic ties,” the statement concluded. The GSA primarily manages federal property and procurement for US government agencies, and its publicly stated mandate does not typically include commercial redevelopment of foreign state-owned assets. It was not immediately clear under what authority the agency would facilitate the project. Named after former US President Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a migrant shelter . The hotel is located near marquee New York destinations such as Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and Fifth Avenue, placing it in one of Manhattan’s most valuable commercial zones.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: At least 15 people, including women and children, were killed, and 18 others were injured after a gas explosion caused part of a residential building to collapse in Karachi’s Soldier Bazaar area, according to officials. The incident occurred at a residence in the Gul Rana Colony area of Soldier Bazaar. The injured and the deceased were shifted to Civil Hospital. Initially, Rescue 1122 put the death toll at 16. However, officials later confirmed that the death toll was 15, while 18 others were injured. Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Jamshed Asher said the incident occurred at around 4:15am during Sehri, and that the gas explosion took place on the building’s first floor. East Deputy Commissioner Nasrullah Abbasi told Dawn that the gas explosion occurred at the time of Sehri in a building located in Gul Rana Colony. He said it was a highly congested locality where a ground plus three-storey building was constructed on 40-45 yards with one small room on each floor. He said that the explosion destroyed the whole building. Speaking to Dawn , Abid Farooq, an official from the bomb disposal squad, ruled out the possibility of any sabotage. He stated that the incident was caused by a gas leak; the explosion was triggered by someone lighting a match. He said that the structure in question was a precast building, covered on all four sides with a narrow street. He said that the gas fittings in the kitchen on the first floor were not upto mark, while plastic pipes were installed for providing gas supply everywhere else. Farooq said that an electric gas pump had also been installed. Quoting residents, Farooq said there was no gas supply in the area for several days but it suddenly increased on Wednesday night. Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the residents of the building were buried under the rubble after the explosion, adding that the building was in a dilapidated condition. He said Gul Rana Colony was spread over two streets in the historic Soldier Bazaar area, with no access for vehicles and tools. He said rescue teams could hear the screams of children and women from the debris. Therefore, they avoided using heavy machinery and preferred to carry out rescue work manually, he said. Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed that a total of 15 people were brought dead to Civil Hospital Karachi. The police surgeon said most of the deaths occurred due to injuries to the head. “Some victims were brought with crush injuries while others had multiple wounds,” Dr Summaiya said. Soldier Bazaar Station House Officer Rizwan Patel said that a first information report of the incident had not yet been registered. He said legal proceedings would be initiated under the directives of higher authorities. Meanwhile, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh told Dawn that the search and rescue operation had been completed. Speaking to the media, COO Shaikh had confirmed that a gas explosion was the cause of the structure’s partial collapse. He noted that the ground plus two-floor structure had small rooms, and the limited space made the rescue operation challenging. “This is not a legal building, and the structure is made of individual rooms,” said the senior rescue official, adding that the collapse also damaged surrounding structures. CM takes notice; temporary rehabilitation ordered Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and expressed sorrow and grief over the loss of lives, said a statement released by the CM House. The statement added that Murad directed the relevant authorities to “immediately rescue people trapped under the debris” and provide the victims with the “best possible” medical assistance. Murad also ordered that all possible support be provided to the affected families and instructed the Karachi commissioner to investigate the cause of the incident. Adviser to CM for Rehabilitation Giyan Chand Essrani, as per a statement from his office, sought reports from Rescue 1122 and the relevant departments over the incident. “The Rehabilitation Department’s teams are present at the site of the incident to provide immediate relief, temporary accommodation and basic necessities to the affected families,” Essrani said. He affirmed that his department was working under a “comprehensive plan to provide complete rehabilitation, mental health assistance and necessary facilities” to the affected families. “The temporary rehabilitation and safe relocation of the affected building’s occupants and nearby residents should be ensured,” Essrani stated. Rescue workers recover a victim’s body amid the debris of a collapsed building following an explosion, in Karachi on Feb 19, 2026. — AFP Condolences President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, expressed their deep grief over the loss of lives in the incident. In a statement reported by state-run APP , President Zardari conveyed his sympathies to the families of the deceased and directed the relevant authorities to extend the best possible medical care to those injured. Also directing the acceleration of the rescue operation, the president asked the Sindh government to inspect buildings, ensure the safety of gas cylinders, and strictly enforce building codes. He said that the provincial government should conduct a thorough investigation into every aspect of the incident and take measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. In his statement, PM Shehbaz offered condolences to the bereaved families and prayed for the speedy recovery of those wounded. He directed the authorities concerned to provide all possible medical assistance to the injured. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also offered condolences to the families of the deceased, as per a statement issued via PPP’s media cell. Bilawal stressed the need for effective measures to prevent such incidents in the future, the statement added. Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also expressed grief over the incident. He directed authorities to accelerate the pace of rescue efforts and ensure proper medical care for the injured citizens, said a statement from the minister’s office. “All updates and details of the relief work should be regularly reported, the home minister directed,” added the statement. Conveying his condolences, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said the provincial government shared the grief of the bereaved families. He urged citizens to be cautious while using gas and to immediately contact the relevant authorities if they suspected a gas leakage. Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also expressed his condolences over the gas explosion, assuring the affected people of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) support. Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials. But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations. In July 2025, at least 27 people died and 10 others were injured after a five-storey building collapsed in the Lyari area of the metropolis. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure. In a statement back then, the Sindh Building Control Authority had noted that 588 buildings had been declared dangerous throughout Karachi. A month later, four workers of the Awami National Party (ANP) were injured , with one of them suffering severe burn wounds, when a gas explosion caused the collapse of their office in Orangi Town. In June 2024, following the death of 27 persons , including 19 children, in an explosion in a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder filling shop in Hyderabad, the Sindh government had decided to shift all such facilities from residential areas.",

CM takes notice; temporary rehabilitation ordered Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and expressed sorrow and grief over the loss of lives, said a statement released by the CM House. The statement added that Murad directed the relevant authorities to “immediately rescue people trapped under the debris” and provide the victims with the “best possible” medical assistance. Murad also ordered that all possible support be provided to the affected families and instructed the Karachi commissioner to investigate the cause of the incident. Adviser to CM for Rehabilitation Giyan Chand Essrani, as per a statement from his office, sought reports from Rescue 1122 and the relevant departments over the incident. “The Rehabilitation Department’s teams are present at the site of the incident to provide immediate relief, temporary accommodation and basic necessities to the affected families,” Essrani said. He affirmed that his department was working under a “comprehensive plan to provide complete rehabilitation, mental health assistance and necessary facilities” to the affected families. “The temporary rehabilitation and safe relocation of the affected building’s occupants and nearby residents should be ensured,” Essrani stated.

In a statement reported by state-run APP , President Zardari conveyed his sympathies to the families of the deceased and directed the relevant authorities to extend the best possible medical care to those injured. Also directing the acceleration of the rescue operation, the president asked the Sindh government to inspect buildings, ensure the safety of gas cylinders, and strictly enforce building codes. He said that the provincial government should conduct a thorough investigation into every aspect of the incident and take measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. In his statement, PM Shehbaz offered condolences to the bereaved families and prayed for the speedy recovery of those wounded. He directed the authorities concerned to provide all possible medical assistance to the injured.

Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also expressed his condolences over the gas explosion, assuring the affected people of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) support. Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials. But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations. In July 2025, at least 27 people died and 10 others were injured after a five-storey building collapsed in the Lyari area of the metropolis. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure. In a statement back then, the Sindh Building Control Authority had noted that 588 buildings had been declared dangerous throughout Karachi. A month later, four workers of the Awami National Party (ANP) were injured , with one of them suffering severe burn wounds, when a gas explosion caused the collapse of their office in Orangi Town. In June 2024, following the death of 27 persons , including 19 children, in an explosion in a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder filling shop in Hyderabad, the Sindh government had decided to shift all such facilities from residential areas.",

      "summary": "KARACHI: At least 15 people, including women and children, were killed, and 18 others were injured after a gas explosion caused part of a residential building to collapse in Karachi’s Soldier Bazaar area, according to officials. The incident occurred at a residence in the Gul Rana Colony area of Soldier Bazaar. The injured and the deceased were shifted to Civil Hospital. Initially, Rescue 1122 put the death toll at 16. However, officials later confirmed that the death toll was 15, while 18 others were injured. Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Jamshed Asher said the incident occurred at around 4:15am during Sehri, and that the gas explosion took place on the building’s first floor. East Deputy Commissioner Nasrullah Abbasi told Dawn that the gas explosion occurred at the time of Sehri in a building located in Gul Rana Colony. He said it was a highly congested locality where a ground plus three-storey building was constructed on 40-45 yards with one small room on each floor. He said that the explosion destroyed the whole building. Speaking to Dawn , Abid Farooq, an official from the bomb disposal squad, ruled out the possibility of any sabotage. He stated that the incident was caused by a gas leak; the explosion was triggered by someone lighting a match. He said that the structure in question was a precast building, covered on all four sides with a narrow street. He said that the gas fittings in the kitchen on the first floor were not upto mark, while plastic pipes were installed for providing gas supply everywhere else. Farooq said that an electric gas pump had also been installed. Quoting residents, Farooq said there was no gas supply in the area for several days but it suddenly increased on Wednesday night. Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the residents of the building were buried under the rubble after the explosion, adding that the building was in a dilapidated condition. He said Gul Rana Colony was spread over two streets in the historic Soldier Bazaar area, with no access for vehicles and tools. He said rescue teams could hear the screams of children and women from the debris. Therefore, they avoided using heavy machinery and preferred to carry out rescue work manually, he said. Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed that a total of 15 people were brought dead to Civil Hospital Karachi. The police surgeon said most of the deaths occurred due to injuries to the head. “Some victims were brought with crush injuries while others had multiple wounds,” Dr Summaiya said. Soldier Bazaar Station House Officer Rizwan Patel said that a first information report of the incident had not yet been registered. He said legal proceedings would be initiated under the directives of higher authorities. Meanwhile, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh told Dawn that the search and rescue operation had been completed. Speaking to the media, COO Shaikh had confirmed that a gas explosion was the cause of the structure’s partial collapse.

      "title_orig": "Police arrest King Charles’ brother Andrew over misconduct relating to Epstein",
      "summary_orig": "King Charles’ younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor, celebrating his 66th birthday on Thursday, was arrested and questioned by detectives from Thames Valley Police, which this month said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy. “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement. “We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.” The former prince, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, who is in police custody, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and said he regrets their friendship. But he has not responded to requests for comment since the latest mass release of documents by the US government. Mountbatten-Windsor’s office did not respond to a request for comment. He becomes the first senior royal to have been arrested in this manner, and presents his elder brother with the biggest scandal of his reign. “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement, adding the authorities had the royals’ “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”. “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” Unmarked police cars British media published pictures of six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothed officers who arrived at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England, where Mountbatten-Windsor now lives. Thames Valley Police said officers were also searching a property in Berkshire, where the royal used to live on the king’s Windsor estate until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations. While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt. A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which only deals with the most serious criminal offences. In 2022, the former prince settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager. The police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety. The former prince was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honours last October amid further revelations about their relationship. Epstein files triggered fresh complaint to police Mountbatten-Windsor had been reported to police by the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic following the release of more than 3 million pages of documents relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had, in 2010, forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips. Thames Valley Police and the Crown Prosecution Service have previously said that they were in discussions about the case. Police said allegations of misconduct in public office, which is a ‘Common Law’ offence and so is not covered by written statute legislation, involved “particular complexities”. Were Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offences. His elder sister, Princess Anne, was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children. King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649, towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty and beheaded. The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking. Republic has also reported him over allegations that he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said the force was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently. Buckingham Palace has previously said it was ready to support any police investigation, saying the king had expressed “profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct”. “Their majesties’ thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse,” the palace said. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein trafficking women without proper checks by the authorities through London’s Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mountbatten-Windsor. Essex police said on Wednesday it was looking into the issue.",

Mountbatten-Windsor, celebrating his 66th birthday on Thursday, was arrested and questioned by detectives from Thames Valley Police, which this month said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy. “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement. “We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.” The former prince, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, who is in police custody, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and said he regrets their friendship. But he has not responded to requests for comment since the latest mass release of documents by the US government. Mountbatten-Windsor’s office did not respond to a request for comment. He becomes the first senior royal to have been arrested in this manner, and presents his elder brother with the biggest scandal of his reign. “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement, adding the authorities had the royals’ “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”. “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” Unmarked police cars British media published pictures of six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothed officers who arrived at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England, where Mountbatten-Windsor now lives. Thames Valley Police said officers were also searching a property in Berkshire, where the royal used to live on the king’s Windsor estate until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations. While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt. A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which only deals with the most serious criminal offences. In 2022, the former prince settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager. The police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety. The former prince was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honours last October amid further revelations about their relationship. Epstein files triggered fresh complaint to police Mountbatten-Windsor had been reported to police by the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic following the release of more than 3 million pages of documents relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had, in 2010, forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips. Thames Valley Police and the Crown Prosecution Service have previously said that they were in discussions about the case. Police said allegations of misconduct in public office, which is a ‘Common Law’ offence and so is not covered by written statute legislation, involved “particular complexities”. Were Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offences. His elder sister, Princess Anne, was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children. King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649, towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty and beheaded. The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking. Republic has also reported him over allegations that he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said the force was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently. Buckingham Palace has previously said it was ready to support any police investigation, saying the king had expressed “profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct”. “Their majesties’ thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse,” the palace said. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein trafficking women without proper checks by the authorities through London’s Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mountbatten-Windsor. Essex police said on Wednesday it was looking into the issue.",

      "summary_orig": "The government is paying compensation totaling more than Rs190 million to the families of 40 people killed in a suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad this month, the Prime Minister’s Office said on Thursday. The February 6 attack , claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, on the outskirts of the capital was the deadliest in Islamabad since a 2008 truck bombing that killed 60 people at the Marriott Hotel. “Relief cheques have been delivered to the heirs of 36 martyrs belonging to Islamabad,” PMO said in a statement, adding each victim’s family received Rs5m. Cheques will also be delivered to four families of victims living outside Islamabad, the statement said. Although officials have not released a final death toll, the statement marked the first official acknowledgement that 40 people were killed in the blast. On Feb 11, PM Shehbaz had announced compensation for those martyred and injured in the suicide attack while visiting the site of the attack. Speaking on the occasion, he said, “These terrorists have no religion, and they have crossed all the limits of cruelty.” The suicide attack occurred during Friday prayers. The last major attack in Islamabad took place in November when a suicide blast outside a court killed 12 people and wounded dozens, the first such incident to hit the capital in nearly three years. Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that the government was paying compensation totaling more than Rs19 million. It is, in fac,t paying more than Rs190 million in compensation.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: In a dramatic development in the narcotics and terrorism case against senior journalist Matiullah Jan, a forensic report submitted to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday revealed that the substance allegedly recovered from him was not a prohibited drug. The case — registered at Margalla Police Station on Nov 28, 2024 — had accused the journalist of snatching a government-issued rifle, hitting a vehicle at a police barrier and possessing narcotics. Initiation of legal proceedings against Jan drew strong criticism from journalist bodies and rights groups, who maintained that he was being targeted for investigating reports of alleged deaths during law enforcement action against PTI protesters in November 2024. On Thursday, a division bench comprising Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the matter in a packed IHC courtroom. During the hearing, the Islamabad police placed on record a laboratory report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency. According to the forensic analysis, the material allegedly recovered from the journalist did not contain methamphetamine — commonly known as “ice”. The courtroom was filled with members of the legal fraternity, political workers and journalists expressing solidarity with Jan. When former senator Farhatullah Babar was spotted in the courtroom, Justice Tahir inquired about his presence. Babar responded that he had come to show support for the senior journalist. Advocate Rai Hanif Rahi informed the bench that lawyers had appeared in solidarity, while journalist Saqib Bashir submitted that the case had been pursued “as if Matiullah Jan were a drug dealer”. The advocate further apprised the court that the matter had been fixed before the trial court for framing of charges. Observing that the forensic findings carried significant legal implications, the bench questioned whether narcotics-related charges could be sustained in the absence of a prohibited substance. The judges remarked that an appropriate order would be passed and subsequently referred the matter back to the trial court for further proceedings. A day ago, an Islamabad ATC had rejected Jan’s application challenging the jurisdiction of the court and fixed February 19 (today) as the date for framing of charges. ‘Allegations proven false’ In a post on X after the hearing, Jan said the allegations against him of “smuggling narcotics have been proven false”. He highlighted that the PFSA report presented before the court “revealed that the substance allegedly recovered from me was not narcotics or ice”. According to the journalist, the IHC bench asked the prosecution counsel how charges could be framed against Jan in light of the lab report. The court then referred the case to the trial court and directed the state to submit a supplementary charge-sheet, he added. “On this occasion, in my legal team, I am first grateful to Advocate Imaan Mazari and Advocate Hadi for giving me their full support, who stood by me fully from my arrest until the case was made,” Jan said. “May Allah Almighty grant them release,” he added, referring to the lawyer couple who were convicted in January over controversial social media posts, with their sentencing sparking outrage among rights bodies. “After that, my current legal team — Advocate Ali Ashfaq, Barrister Abdul Qadeer, Barrister Ahad, Advocate Fayyaz, and my younger brother Advocate Shahid Akbar Abbasi — gave me their full support from the trial to the high court and are still standing with me,” Jan said. He stated that Barrister Qadeer was representing him in the IHC. “Finally, thanks to those government and non-government politicians who, immediately after the registration of this fake case, openly declared it wrong and fabricated. By the way, thanks to the lab folks too,” he jested. The case On Nov 28, 2024, Jan’s son had posted on X about his father being “abducted from the parking” of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad by “unmarked abductors in an unmarked vehicle”. Authorities later the same day confirmed he had been booked in a first information report (FIR), which claimed that Jan was found possessing 246 grams of narcotic methamphetamine (crystal meth) when his vehicle was stopped at E-9 in the federal capital. The case was registered at 3:20am, nearly an hour after the alleged incident took place. Jan was initially sent on a two-day physical remand in police custody by an Islamabad Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC). However, the next day, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) overturned that decision and sent him to judicial custody. On Nov 30, 2024, the journalist was granted bail by the ATC and subsequently released from the Adiala jail. On Oct 31, 2025 — the day Jan was set to be indicted — an ATC issued a notice to police on the journalist’s application for the provision of case documents. The FIR invoked Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA) 1997 ’s Section 9(2)4, which specifies the punishment for possessing or trafficking “more than 100g and up to 500g” of psychotropic substance. The FIR also invoked Sections 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 as well as Sections 186 (obstructing public servant), 279 (Rash driving or riding on a public way), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) and 506ii (threat to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code .",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan issued a demarche to the Taliban regime over the use of Afghan soil for a terrorist attack on security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur that martyred 11 soldiers, it emerged on Thursday. According to a press release by the Foreign Office (FO), the demarche was issued on Wednesday afternoon when the FO summoned the Afghan deputy head of mission. “Pakistan condemned in the strongest possible terms the vehicle-borne suicide terrorist attack followed by a fire raid on Pakistan military and law enforcement agencies’ posts in Bajaur, carried out by Fitna al Khawarij [or] the TTP,” the statement said. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The FO expressed concern that the group, whose entire leadership is based in Afghanistan, “operates with impunity from Afghan soil”. It re-emphasised that Pakistan had received repeated assurances from the Afghan Taliban regime, “but, regrettably, with no visible or concrete actions”. “The Afghan Taliban regime has been told to take immediate, concrete and verifiable measures against all terror groups operating from its territory, including their leadership,” the press release said. The ministry also “categorically informed” the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan “reserved the right to respond and eliminate any khawarij belonging to the group as well as their affiliates”, wherever they were located, “to ensure [the] safety of its soldiers, civilians and territorial boundaries”. It is worth mentioning that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday that Islamabad will not hesitate to launch air operations inside Afghanistan to combat militancy, characterising the current regional instability as the “price we are paying” for decisions made during the 1980s and after Sept 11 terrorist attacks. Speaking during a visit to Berlin, Asif accused the Afghan Taliban regime of conducting a “proxy war” alongside India against Pakistani interests and said military action would remain on the table until Kabul offered meaningful “assurances of peace”, according to a BBC report. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a terror attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in Bajaur martyred 11 security personnel on Monday. The statement added that 12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khawarij with precision”. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack and extended condolences to the families of martyrs. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed sorrow at the loss of lives and condemned the attack in the “strongest terms”. Pakistan had also issued a demarche to Afghanistan in late December, over its failure to rein in terrorist organisations ope­r­ating from Afghan soil, after a deadly attack on a military camp in North Waziristan.",

      "summary_orig": "Bill Gates pulled out of India’s AI Impact Summit hours before his scheduled keynote address on Thursday, dealing another blow to a flagship event already marred by organisational lapses, a robot row and complaints of traffic chaos. Gates’ absence, followed by another high-profile cancellation by Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, adds to a difficult opening for a summit billed as the first major artificial intelligence forum in the Global South, where India has sought to position itself as a leading voice in worldwide AI governance. The Gates Foundation said the billionaire will not deliver his address “to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities”. Only days ago, the foundation had dismissed rumours of his absence and insisted he was on track to attend. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for children’s safety on AI platforms as he addressed the gathering on Thursday, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. “We must be even more vigilant about children’s safety. Just as a school syllabus is curated, the AI space should also be child- and family-guided,” Modi said, after standing on stage with top AI executives and posing for photographs with their arms raised in a show of strength. The photoshoot produced an awkward moment when Altman and Amodei, chiefs of rival AI firms OpenAI and Anthropic, stood side by side on stage but did not hold hands, although the other executives did. India’s first major AI summit has been marred by organisational lapses that have left attendees shocked and angry over what they described as a lack of planning by the Indian government. Chaos and traffic snarls Gates’ cancellation comes after the US Department of Justice released emails last month that included communication between late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the Gates Foundation’s staff. Gates has said the relationship was confined to philanthropy-related discussions and that it was a mistake for him to meet Epstein. The summit exhibition halls were shut to the public on Thursday in a surprise move that led to more anger among participating companies that had put up stalls and pavilions. The venue compound was largely deserted after three days of large crowds at the event. Indian university Galgotias was asked to vacate its stall after a staff member presented a commercially available robotic dog made in China as its own creation, sparking a public uproar. Police repeatedly shut roads to give preference to VIP movement at the summit, creating chaos in the city of 20 million people. The Indian government has apologised for the inconvenience caused to attendees in the initial days. But on Wednesday, footage on social media showed scores of attendees at the summit walking for miles in central Delhi as roads were shut, with no availability of taxis and no shuttle services arranged. Opposition parties attacked the government and the prime minister for poorly managing the global summit. “How can you expect your engineers, AI guys, to walk such distances…And then we complain that entrepreneurs are leaving India,” said Pawan Khera, the Congress party spokesperson. Still, there has been more than $100 billion of investment in India AI projects pledged during the summit, including from the Adani Group conglomerate, tech giant Microsoft, and data centre firm Yotta. The Indian government has said it expects total pledges to exceed $200bn in the next two years, although analysts have warned that the rapid build-out risks straining India’s power grid and water supply.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday issued notices to the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) on appeals filed by Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, against their conviction in the controversial tweets case. Justice Muhammad Asif, who heard the appeals, also issued notices on the couple’s applications seeking suspension of their sentence and called for a response from the agency. The IHC then adjourned further proceedings, observing that a date for the next hearing would be fixed. On January 24, Imaan and Hadi were handed a total of 17 years in jail on multiple charges under the Prevention of Electr­onic Crimes Act (Peca) by a sessions court in Islamabad, sparking outrage among rights groups, opposition parties, and other segments of society. The lawyer duo was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment under Peca’s Section 10 (cyberterrorism), five years’ jail under Section 9 (glorification of an offence) and two years in prison under Section 26-A (false and fake information). All sentences will run concurrently. Appearing on behalf of the appellants, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui, along with Zainab Janjua and other members of the defence team, contended that the trial court announced its verdict while a transfer application was still pending before the IHC . Siddiqui argued that two prosecution witnesses were examined in the absence of the accused and questioned the manner in which the trial judge subsequently expunged a paragraph from the judgment. “Punishment may be awarded ten times over, but a fair trial must first be conducted,” Siddiqui contended, stressing that due process had been compromised. Justice Asif remarked that notices were being issued and directed that the paper books be prepared. Siddiqui requested an early date for the hearing of the suspension of sentence applications, pointing that he travelled from Karachi to appear before the court, and sought a Monday or Tuesday date. The judge responded that an appropriate date would be fixed. The IHC subsequently issued notices to the NCCIA and sought the agency’s reply before adjourning the matter. On February 7, the couple had challenged the trial court’s order convicting them. In their appeals, the two contended that the impugned judgment was passed in blatant violation of settled legal principles and mandatory procedural requi­rements. They argued that the trial court proceeded to pronounce the verdict despite the fact that an application seeking transfer of the case was pending adjudication before the IHC, rendering the decision “unlawful and without jurisdiction”. Imaan and Chattha’s convictions had sparked concerns from the United Nations Human Rights Office, a team of UN special rapporteurs, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), and a European Union (EU) official. The case The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the NCCIA in Islamabad. The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the banned outfits Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Judge Majoka indicted Imaan and Hadi on Oct 30, 2025 and then issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025. Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him. Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them. Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.",

Appearing on behalf of the appellants, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui, along with Zainab Janjua and other members of the defence team, contended that the trial court announced its verdict while a transfer application was still pending before the IHC . Siddiqui argued that two prosecution witnesses were examined in the absence of the accused and questioned the manner in which the trial judge subsequently expunged a paragraph from the judgment. “Punishment may be awarded ten times over, but a fair trial must first be conducted,” Siddiqui contended, stressing that due process had been compromised. Justice Asif remarked that notices were being issued and directed that the paper books be prepared. Siddiqui requested an early date for the hearing of the suspension of sentence applications, pointing that he travelled from Karachi to appear before the court, and sought a Monday or Tuesday date. The judge responded that an appropriate date would be fixed. The IHC subsequently issued notices to the NCCIA and sought the agency’s reply before adjourning the matter. On February 7, the couple had challenged the trial court’s order convicting them. In their appeals, the two contended that the impugned judgment was passed in blatant violation of settled legal principles and mandatory procedural requi­rements. They argued that the trial court proceeded to pronounce the verdict despite the fact that an application seeking transfer of the case was pending adjudication before the IHC, rendering the decision “unlawful and without jurisdiction”. Imaan and Chattha’s convictions had sparked concerns from the United Nations Human Rights Office, a team of UN special rapporteurs, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), and a European Union (EU) official. The case The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the NCCIA in Islamabad. The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the banned outfits Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Judge Majoka indicted Imaan and Hadi on Oct 30, 2025 and then issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025. Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him. Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them. Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.",

      "summary_orig": "The White House warned on Wednesday that Iran would be “wise” to do a deal with the United States as President Donald Trump once again hinted at military action. The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman, after Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month. A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. “Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. On Wednesday, Trump again suggested the United States might strike Iran in a post on his Truth Social site, with a US military buildup underway in the Middle East. He warned Britain against giving up sovereignty over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, saying that the archipelago’s Diego Garcia airbase might be needed were Iran not to agree a deal, “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime”. CNN and CBS reported on Wednesday that the US military will be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Trump has been briefed on his military options with “all of them designed to maximise damage”, including a campaign to “kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government”, unnamed US officials told the newspaper. Earlier on Wednesday, Tehran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran was “drafting” a framework for future talks with the US. Iran and the US held a second round of Oman-mediated negotiations on Tuesday in Geneva. Araghchi said then that Tehran had agreed with Washington on “guiding principles”, but US Vice President JD Vance said Iran had not yet acknowledged all of Washington’s red lines. ‘Do not want war’ Speaking on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted “we do not want war” but suggested Tehran could not give in to US demands. “From the day I took office, I have believed that war must be set aside. But if they are going to try to impose their will on us, humiliate us and demand that we bow our heads at any cost, should we accept that?” Earlier on Wednesday, Araghchi held a phone call with Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. In the call, the Iranian foreign minister “stressed the Islamic Republic of Iran’s focus on drafting an initial and coherent framework to advance future talks”, according to a statement from his ministry. Tehran has suspended some cooperation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog’s inspectors from accessing sites bombed by Israel and the United States, accusing the UN body of bias and of failing to condemn the strikes. Meanwhile, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned that Washington would deter Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons “one way or the other”. “They’ve been very clear about what they would do with nuclear weapons. It’s entirely unacceptable,” Wright told reporters in Paris on the sidelines of meetings of the International Energy Agency. Displays of military might The Omani-mediated talks were aimed at averting the possibility of US military action, while Tehran is demanding the lifting of US sanctions that are crippling its economy. Iran has insisted that the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table. While talks have resumed, the US has also been building up its military forces near Iran. Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed. Iran has sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps beginning a series of war games on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz. Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a major global conduit for oil and gas. On Tuesday, state TV reported that Tehran would close parts of the waterway for safety measures during the drills.",

The airspace will remain closed for all Indian civil and military registered aircraft till March 23, the Pakistan Airport Authority (PAA) said in a new notice to airmen (Notam) issued today.

      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday strongly rejected media speculations regarding any “deal” between the government and incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan. In a statement shared on X, Tarar said, “There is neither any deal nor any leniency for Imran.” He added that any impression of the government granting the ex-premier concessions was “entirely false and misleading”. “Imran Khan is a criminal convicted by courts, and the reports about  leniency for him are baseless,” Tarar asserted. “There is no truth in these reports.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was months ago convicted in another case regarding state gifts. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023 . Tarar’s clarification follows recent statements made by Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, wherein he said efforts were made to reach a solution, but Imran was not ready for “any deal”. “He (Imran) is not ready for any deal,” Sanaullah said in an interview with ARY News aired on Wednesday. “Two very serious efforts were made [and] not only is he not ready for a deal but his demands are such that the current government cannot fulfil them,” he added. Sanaullah described the PTI founder as having a “non-political attitude” and being “stubborn”. “The way they (PTI supporters) say that he is standing tall,” he quipped. According to the PML-N leader, “one serious effort” was made between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in the aftermath of the November 2024 protests . “On the second [effort], I cannot go into details more than this that some individuals had arrived from abroad,” Sanaullah said, adding that they “had links” with Imran. “They also met with Imran Khan sahib , and as per my information, Imran Khan sahib first agreed with them, but then he stepped back from it.” In January 2026, Sanaullah had said PTI leaders were seeking dialogue with the government but Imran opposed the move. On Tuesday, Parliamentary Secretary Barrister Danyal Chaudhry also denied any kind of “deal” with Imran, claiming that the latter wanted a deal and concession since day one. “We are also ready for talks, but we will not accept any blackmail in this regard. The only reason for sending Imran Khan abroad for treatment can be that, God forbid, he may be suffering from a life-threatening disease that cannot be treated here,” he had said. His statement came amid concerns raised by the PTI about the party founder’s health after a report submitted to the Supreme Court quoted him as saying he had lost partial vision in his right eye due to an ailment .",

The latest atrocity has occurred in Bajaur, where a suicide bomber reportedly belonging to the banned TTP attacked a checkpost in Bajaur on Monday. At least 12 people were martyred in the incident — 11 security personnel and one minor girl. Meanwhile, on the same day, a motorcycle rigged with explosives was blown up outside a police station in Bannu, causing two fatalities. Furthermore, law enforcers said on Wednesday that terrorists attacked a police station and a customs office in Dera Ismail Khan, martyring a policeman and a customs officer. They added that the terrorists also fired at passenger buses in the area. Several acts of deadly violence have occurred in this area over the past few weeks. Following the Bajaur attack, the prime minister commented that “under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security forces are gaining major success in the fight against terrorism”. While that may be so, Pakistan continues to pay a high price as it loses security personnel and civilians in frequent terrorist attacks. For example, apart from the latest violence in KP, an imambargah in Islamabad was attacked earlier this month causing major casualties, while only days before the atrocity in the capital terrorists had launched coordinated attacks in Balochistan. Unless the state takes a fresh approach towards terrorism, we may see the same high levels of violence in the current year as we did in 2025. Last year was said to be the bloodiest in over a decade. The threats may be varied — separatist terrorists in Balochistan, religiously inspired elements in KP — but the response must ensure that all violent elements are neutralised, and the state is able to establish peace in the disturbed areas. There has been some welcome recent cooperation between the KP government — which remains the hardest hit province — and the centre in the field of counterterrorism; such efforts must be intensified. A whole-of-nation approach is needed, applying kinetic measures where required, conducting intel-based operations as well as sociopolitical interventions as needed, to defeat terrorism. The federal and provincial governments, lawmakers and the security apparatus, along with CT experts, must put their heads together to arrive at a solution that can bring lasting peace to Pakistan.
