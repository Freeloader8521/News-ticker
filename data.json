      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Adviser to the Nuclear Command Authority Lt Gen (retd) Mazhar Jamil said Pakistan would continue to pursue its policy of ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus’ to reinforce strategic stability in South Asia, which has been undermined by great power politics and a technology bias in favour of India. Quid Pro Quo Plus is a military doctrine that entails a retaliatory response to Indian aggression exceeding the initial provocation in scale or severity. “Pakistan would continue to uphold its policy of ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus,’ thereby reinforcing strategic stability in South Asia,” Gen Jamil said while addressing the concluding session of a three-day workshop hosted by the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) in Islamabad. “Pakistan,” he added, “stands fully prepared to respond to any act of aggression, strategic, operational, or tactical, with resolve and capability, ensuring the preservation of deterrence equilibrium in the region.” The statement follows an ongoing tense period this month, which revived brinkmanship last seen during India’s “Operation Sindoor” airstrikes in May. It also comes as Indian armed forces prepare for Exercise Trishul , a major drill from Oct. 30 to Nov 10 near the disputed Sir Creek region, with Indian officials warning of “overwhelming retaliation” against any cross-border terrorism. Jamil cautioned that global power politics were upsetting the regional balance of power. “Great power politics has facilitated a discriminatory transfer of advanced and emerging technologies to India, thereby undermining the strategic balance in South Asia,” he said. “Such preferential access is reshaping the regional security paradigm and transforming the nature and character of warfare across the region.” He said this international support has emboldened India’s actions. “Emboldened by these external enablers and strategic partnerships, India has increasingly exhibited adventurist tendencies, particularly evident in the post-Pahalgam incident,” he noted. Referring to a May confrontation between the two countries following the Pahalgam incident, Jamil said the episode “effectively challenged India’s misplaced notions of escalation dominance and escalation control”. Pakistan, he said, “once again demonstrated restraint and responsibility, reaffirming the credibility and maturity of its nuclear deterrence posture”. Jamil warned that India’s “Hindutva-driven nationalism” poses a “grave challenge to regional peace and strategic stability,” which he said reflects “the ideological and strategic imprint of Chanakya’s Mandala Theory” of power politics and regional dominance. “India’s increasingly offensive military doctrines, coupled with a culture of coercive behaviour, underscore both its intent and capability to project aggression in the region,” he cautioned.

      "summary_orig": "In every civilisation’s story, water has never been just a resource — it has been power itself. Those who commanded its flow commanded destinies, shaping empires, hierarchies, and enduring inequalities. Across centuries and continents, this elemental force has mirrored control and exclusion in equal measure. In Pakistan, cradled by the mighty Indus (one of the world’s great river systems), the politics of water runs deep, revealing how history, bureaucracy, gender, and infrastructure intertwine in a struggle for authority. The hydraulic mission To understand Pakistan’s water politics, one must return to what scholars call the hydraulic mission — a 19th-century global project of control. From British India to Egypt and the American West, colonial and postcolonial states sought to dominate nature through massive dams and sprawling irrigation works. These were not merely feats of engineering; they were declarations of power. The state’s authority quite literally flowed through its canals and concrete. In Pakistan, this legacy endures. The Tarbela and Mangla dams, the vast Indus Basin irrigation network, and the formidable bureaucracies that govern them are all products of the same hydraulic ambition. The engineers of these systems became symbols of state authority. Their institutions, known as hydrocracies, remain among the most entrenched and powerful bureaucratic structures in the country. But this infrastructure-led model has a dark underside. As researcher François Molle and his colleagues argue, the “hydraulic mission” often treated infrastructure as an end in itself — legitimising governments while concealing inefficiencies, corruption, and rent-seeking. Pakistan’s irrigation departments, still operating in the colonial mould, epitomise this: sprawling, opaque, and resistant to reform. This has resulted in both institutional weaknesses and deep vulnerabilities. The 2025 floods, triggered by heavy monsoon rains and glacial lake outbursts since June, starkly exposed these flaws, overwhelming outdated dams and canals, causing over 1,000 deaths , and destroying thousands of homes, mostly belonging to impoverished communities. Moreover, elite-driven decisions such as constructing the Expressway near Jalalpur Pirwala have worsened flooding in southern Punjab, diverting water destructively into already vulnerable settlements. Water and power: A colonial legacy that still governs In Pakistan’s rural heartlands, water control is synonymous with political control. From Punjab to Sindh, powerful landlords have long dictated who receives canal water and who does not. They create unauthorised water outlets (or manage to get direct outlets approved that should be impossible), manipulate irrigation schedules, bypass rotation plans, and exploit their influence over irrigation officials to bend the system in their favour. What began as a centralised colonial bureaucracy has evolved into a network of local despots — a form of “decentralised despotism” where water serves as an instrument of patronage and dominance. This structure reflects what historian Karl Wittfogel once called hydraulic despotism : centralised control over water, breeding political submission. Only now, in Pakistan’s case, that despotism operates through feudal influence and bureaucratic inertia rather than emperors and dynasties. During the 2025 floods, these power dynamics deepened; influential landowners reportedly controlled the flow of aid and reconstruction resources, while small farmers and marginalised communities were left to shoulder the losses across more than 1.8 million acres of farmland . Established power dynamics continue to determine who receives state relief and rehabilitation — and when. Reconstruction and humanitarian assistance often bypass those most in need, favouring the well-connected instead. Masculinities of water — The gendered politics of control Yet, there is another current in this story: a quieter but equally powerful one. As feminist scholar Margreet Zwarteveen reminds us , irrigation and water management are not gender-neutral fields. They are overwhelmingly masculine domains: symbolically, structurally, and professionally. Across much of South Asia, the irrigation engineer has long been imagined as the heroic man mastering nature — a colonial archetype that continues to shape modern institutions. In Pakistan, women remain largely invisible in water governance , even as they bear the brunt of its failures — fetching water, sustaining households, and working in fields. Their exclusion is not accidental; it is systemic. Engineering departments, decision-making boards, and policy forums remain male-dominated, reinforcing the notion that expertise and authority are inherently masculine. Even well-meaning “gender mainstreaming” initiatives struggle against this entrenched culture of exclusion. Here, gender intersects sharply with power. The hydrocracy’s authority is not merely bureaucratic — it is patriarchal. The 2025 floods have laid bare this gendered burden : women and girls have faced heightened risks during evacuation and recovery, with limited access to safe sanitation, healthcare, and shelter. In camps across Lahore and south Punjab, as the Ravi River inundated newly built housing schemes in floodplains, women’s voices rose in protest and pain. Yet, the PDMA, revenue departments, and other authorities failed to meet even their most basic needs. Infrastructure and the rise of new despotisms As anthropologist Veronica Strang puts it , infrastructure is never merely physical. It is profoundly political. Dams, drains, pipelines, and canals shape social relations, determining who is connected, who is excluded, and who profits. Today, a new form of despotism is emerging globally: the privatisation of water. When public water systems are handed over to corporations, control shifts from bureaucrats to markets — from visible authority to unaccountable power. The British experiment of 1989, when water utilities were privatised, offers a telling example: profits soared while regulation weakened and public accountability evaporated. Similar trends are evident in Australia and Latin America, where water trading and corporate consolidation have turned rivers into commodities. Pakistan stands on the brink of the same trap. Proposals to privatise water institutions and utilities have sparked protests, fuelled by fears that such reforms will deepen inequality and strip citizens of what should remain a shared right. In a system already marred by elite capture and bureaucratic masculinity, privatisation risks creating a new corporate despotism: one even less accountable to the public. Critics argue that poorly planned road and motorway projects have obstructed natural waterways , intensifying the 2025 floods. These disasters have shown how floodplain encroachments and legally allotted lands involve the powerful’s grip over rivers, water channels, and floodplains, endangering the lives and livelihoods of the poor and lower middle class. Bureaucracy, gender, and governance The nexus of water, power, and governance in Pakistan is the product of layered histories. Colonial legacies built the hydraulic bureaucracy. Patriarchal norms cemented its masculine character. Political elites captured its flows for private gain. And now, market forces threaten to commodify whatever little remains of public ownership. Pakistan’s water crisis, then, is not merely one of scarcity; it is one of equity. It is about who controls, who benefits, and who is silenced. The inequities between provinces, the rural-urban divide, the marginalisation of small farmers, and the invisibility of women all stem from the question of how water is governed and by whom. The floods of 2025 have only deepened these fractures. As swollen rivers devastated communities and submerged farmlands, bureaucratic inertia and delayed relief compounded human suffering. Inter- and intra-provincial tensions over water management resurfaced, exposing the deep structural divides within the state. While mainstream media captured fragments of the misery, power and control continue to dictate what is revealed, and what is concealed, muting the full extent of the crisis. A way forward — From control to care To break this cycle, Pakistan must move beyond the old hydraulic mission — beyond the obsession with concrete, control, and command. The future of water governance must rest on inclusivity, transparency, and local participation. Women’s leadership in water management is a structural necessity. Bureaucratic reform, too, must aim to democratise decision-making, not merely decentralise it into the hands of new elites. Equally, the march toward water privatisation must be resisted unless supported by strong regulation, equity safeguards, and public oversight. Water cannot be reduced to a commodity. It is a public trust, a shared right, and the foundation of life itself. As Pakistan faces intensifying climate stress, from melting glaciers to erratic monsoons, its survival will depend on transforming its understanding of power. True resilience will not emerge from new dams or privatised pipelines, but from building a just and inclusive system where every drop serves the people. Lessons from the 2025 floods, driven by climate-induced heavy rains and glacial outbursts, emphasise the urgency of this transformation. Yet the human toll continues to unfold: families displaced by the Chenab River’s waters still live in makeshift roadside camps, long after the Punjab government declared rescue and relief operations over. Many continue to commute by boat to their drowned villages — conditions largely overlooked by prevailing power dynamics. The simple truth is that the politics of water is the politics of life. To control it is to shape society itself. The recurring floods are not just a symptom of climate change, but a mirror reflecting deeper structures of power and exclusion. If we look closer, the destruction and deaths unleashed by the 2025 floods reveal something far beyond climate impacts — they expose a crisis of governance, justice, and imagination.",

A warning is typically issued 36 \nhours before the anticipated first occurrence of \ntropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside \npreparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life \nand property should be complete in Jamaica and rushed to completion \nin Cuba.\n \nA Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible\nwithin the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours\nbefore the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force\nwinds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous.\n \nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are\nexpected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.\n \nInterests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Melissa.\n \nFor storm information specific to your area, please monitor\nproducts issued by your national meteorological service.\n \n \nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\n----------------------\nAt 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Melissa was located \nnear latitude 16.8 North, longitude 78.4 West. Melissa is moving \ntoward the north-northeast near 2 mph (4 km/h). A turn toward the \nnortheast with an increase in forward speed is expected today, \nfollowed by a faster northeastward motion on Wednesday and Thursday. \nOn the forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move over \nJamaica today, across southeastern Cuba Wednesday morning, and \nacross the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday.\n \nData from the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters indicate that \nmaximum sustained winds are near 175 mph (280 km/h) with higher \ngusts. Melissa is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson \nHurricane Wind Scale. Some fluctuations in intensity are likely \nbefore Melissa makes landfall on Jamaica later today. However, \nMelissa is expected to reach Jamaica and southeastern Cuba as an \nextremely dangerous major hurricane, and will still be at hurricane \nstrength when it moves across the southeastern Bahamas.\n \nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from\nthe center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195\nmiles (315 km). Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, \nJamaica, recently reported a sustained wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) \nand a gust of 52 mph (83 km/h).\n \nThe minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane \nHunter observations is 901 mb (26.61 inches).\n \n \nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nKey messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone\nDiscussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.\n \nWIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring in Jamaica, and \ncatastrophic and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected \nto begin this morning. Within the eyewall, total structural failure \nis likely, especially in higher elevation areas where wind speeds \natop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains could be up to \n30 percent stronger.\n \nTropical storm conditions are expected to begin in eastern Cuba \ntoday, with hurricane conditions expected in the hurricane warning \narea starting tonight into Wednesday morning. Tropical storm \nconditions are expected in Haiti later today and Wednesday.\n \nHurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central \nBahamas on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected and \nhurricane conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands on \nWednesday.\n \nRAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 15 to 30 inches\nto portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 6 to 12 inches for\nsouthern Hispaniola through Wednesday, with storm total local maxima\nof 40 inches possible. Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous\nlandslides are likely.\n \nFor eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches, with\nlocal amounts to 25 inches, is expected into Wednesday resulting in\nlife-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with\nnumerous landslides.\n \nOver the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is \nexpected today into Wednesday resulting in areas of flash flooding.\n \nFor a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with\nMelissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total\nRainfall Graphic, available at\nhurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf\n \nSTORM SURGE: A life-threatening storm surge is likely along the \nsouth coast of Jamaica today. Peak storm surge heights could reach 9 \nto 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the \ncenter of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge will be \naccompanied by large and destructive waves. On the northwest coast \nof Jamaica, near Montego Bay, there is the possibility of 2 to 4 \nfeet of storm surge above ground level.\n \nThere is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast\ncoast of Cuba late today or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights\ncould reach 7 to 11 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the\neast of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge\nwill be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n \nStorm surge of 4 to 6 ft above normally dry ground is possible in\nthe southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday.\n \nSURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of \nHispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the \nnext several days, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip \ncurrent conditions. These swells will reach the Bahamas, the Turks \nand Caicos Islands, and Bermuda later this week.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday ahead of the Ninth Edition of the Future Investment Initiative (FII9) in Riyadh. The premier, visiting Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the crown prince, is leading a high-level Pakistani delegation during the trip. The delegation includes Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and PM’s aides Tariq Fatemi and Bilal Bin Saqib, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). A statement issued on social media platform X by state broadcaster PTV News said the meeting with the Saudi crown prince was held in a “cordial atmosphere”. “Matters of mutual interest were discussed in the meeting. The joint statement of the meeting regarding discussions on promoting trade, investment, and cooperation in various sectors between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will be issued shortly,” the statement said, adding that the meeting was attended by FM Dar, COAS Munir and senior cabinet members from both sides. Late on Monday, the premier said it was a “great pleasure and honour” to meet the Saudi crown prince. “We reaffirmed the enduring strength of the Pakistan–Saudi Arabia brotherly bonds and discussed ways to further expand this historic and time-tested partnership in trade, investment, and economic cooperation,” he said. He stated that he was grateful for the Saudi crown prince’s “personal commitment and resolute support in advancing our shared vision for deeper collaboration and prosperity for our two nations and peoples”. PM Shehbaz earlier arrived at the King Khalid International Airport where he was received by Riyadh Deputy Governor Muhammad bin Abdulrahman bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to Pakistan Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Malki and Pakistan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Farooq. The prime minister left for Riyadh earlier today from Lahore. The invitation for the conference, signed by the crown prince, was given to PM Shehbaz in August by Ambassador of the King­dom of Saudi Arabia Naw­af bin Said Al-Malky. The FII9 will convene global leaders, investors, policymakers, and innovators to explore the theme, “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth”. Thematic discussions will address global challenges and opportunities, focusing on key topics such as innovation, sustainability, economic inclusion, and geopolitical shifts. The Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement yesterday that during his visit, the PM would engage with the Saudi leadership to explore avenues for enhanced cooperation in the trade, investment, energy, and human resource sectors. “The discussions will also cover regional and global issues of mutual interest and concern,” it added. On the sidelines of the summit, the PM will also interact with leaders from other participating countries and heads of international organisations. The FO said these exchanges would highlight Pakistan’s investment potential and its readiness to pursue collaborations in sustainable development, in line with the “Think, Exchange, and Act” model.",

The 1781 battle of Yorktown and the vicious stand-off between Chinese and Indian troops in Galwan in 2020 are thus linked to the state assembly elections currently underway in Bihar. This is the rare north Indian state where the Hindu right is struggling to take power on its own. Other Hindi-belt states like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have seen BJP taking power on its own steam, but in Bihar it continues to lean on allies, that too playing second fiddle. This, even though the BJP won more seats than the chief minister Nitish Kumar’s party in the 2020 polls. There is lingering apprehension today that the BJP, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch, could do with Kumar what it did with allies in Maharashtra — pare them down by splitting their ranks and usurp direct power. Bihar though has been a different kettle of fish. The state is among the most fractured regions in caste terms, far more intractable than other BJP-ruled states. In Uttar Pradesh, for example, the Bahujan Samaj Party of Dalits could take power with or without allies. Likewise, the Samajwadi Party of lower caste peasants was able to rule on its own. Unlike Uttar Pradesh where it runs its own government, the BJP has so far failed to gain power in Bihar by itself. Two historical events have influenced the state’s hugely politicised and intellectually raw earthiness. This was the region after all where Buddha attained enlightenment 2,500 years ago. Buddhism spread from Bihar and marked the most entrenched and durable rebellion in history against Brahminical hegemony over much of ancient India. There was thus already something about Bihar — it derives its name from Buddhist vihars or monasteries — which spurred anti-caste revolt to spread via Buddhism and Jainism. Bihar is the rare north Indian state where the Hindu right is struggling to take power on its own. The other significant event in Bihar, which continues to stalk its fragmented social relations, was the land revenue arrangement installed by British governor-general Lord Cornwallis. The Permanent Settlement created a violent system of zamindars with hereditary rights. They extracted from the peasants all that could fill the coffers of the East India Company and enough for themselves to buy muscle power to ply the ruthless system. Think about it. Had Cornwallis not been routed by George Washington in Yorktown, Bihar might have been spared the pain of his socially disruptive extortion. Who knows, perhaps Tipu Sultan would have carved a different role for India, not unlike what George Washington did for America, as an ally of the French and tormentor of British rule. Cornwallis vented his spleen at the French for supporting Tipu who he defeated in Srirangapatnam in 1792. The unabated exploitation of Dalits and tribespeople Cornwallis created in Bihar would erupt in political movements — now dressed as Naxalites or again as the middle caste-led advocate of ‘total revolution’. Political earthiness apart, acid verse too abounds about elections in India. One such by Ashok Chakradhar describes a famished tiger that far from eating up a lamb and its mother, wishes them health and longevity, instead. The lines end tartly: “Itna keh kar sher kar gaya prasthaan. Bakri hairaan. Beta taajjub hai. Bhala ye sher kisi per rahem khanewala hai. Lagta hai jangal mein chunaav aane wala hai.” (The goat shared its bewilderment with the baby. Hungry tigers don’t usually bungle. It must be election time in the jungle.) Likewise, the late Raahat Indori conflated military tensions on the border with elections. “Sarhad par bahot tanaav hai kya? Kuchh pata karo, chunaav hai kya?” (There’s tension on the borders, but why? Go find out if an election is nigh.) Cynicism apart, the state assembly polls underway in Bihar, the second most populous of the so-called Hindi-belt states, where the BJP derives much of its strength from, do have a military connection. Two days after the horrific attack in Pahalgam on April 20, a livid Narendra Modi showed up at a public rally in Bihar, not at the site of the communal carnage in Kashmir as might be expected of him. From the rally in Bihar, Modi declared his fight to the finish against terrorism. Significantly, he made the most critical point about the prospects of war in English. Bihar was the platform not the audience. About 20 days later, Operation Sindoor was unleashed only to be quickly suspended with a tentative and, by many accounts, puzzling ceasefire . In Bihar’s election campaign though, the short sharp exchange with Pakistan appears to be offering little purchase in the two-stage Nov 6 and 11 elections for the 243 assembly seats. Curiously, in the October 2020 Bihar elections too, the prime minister tried to stoke the memory of the killings of Indian soldiers by Chinese troops along the disputed Sino-Indian border at Galwan. At three brief halts in Sasaram, Gaya and Bhagalpur, Modi spoke of the clash with China, in which soldiers — notably of 16 Bihar regiment — had been killed. Modi accused the opposition of supporting those “conspiring” against India. Bihar happens to be where L.K. Advani’s communally divisive 1990 ‘rath yatra’ to Ayodhya was brought to heel by Lalu Prasad Yadav, the state’s chief minister at the time.

      "summary_orig": "• Former ISI chief claims it was his own countrymen, not Pakistan, that handed Afghan envoy Mullah Zaeef over to the Americans • Retired Gen Ehsanul Haq says Zaeef insisted on remaining in Islamabad, despite warnings from Pakistani officials ISLAMABAD: Over 20 years after his now-infamous handover to American forces following their invasion of Afghan­istan, a former Pakistani spymaster has claimed that it was his own countrymen, and not Pakistan, that handed over former Taliban ambassador Abdus Salam Zaeef to the US. The claim, which comes in the midst of an escalating fracas with a resurgent Taliban in Kabul, was made by retired Gen Ehsanul Haq, who took over the reins of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) following the September 11, 2001 attacks. For years, it was believed that Zaeef — who was the Afghan Taliban regime’s envoy to Islam­abad at the time of the 9/11 atta­cks — was handed over to the Americans in violation of international law. In his book, My Life With The Taliban , the former envoy had asserted that he was given into US custody in Peshawar, and this account has never been publicly challenged by any Pakistani official. However, when asked about Zaeef’s claims during a recent seminar, the former four-star general recounted how the previous Taliban regime came to be ‘de-recognised’, and how Pakistani officials tried for months to convince the envoy to leave Islamabad to avoid the situation he later faced. Zaeef spent just under four years as a captive in the infamous US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, and was eventually released in 2005. When approached for comment, Zaeef said he rejected the former general’s statement. In his remarks at a recent seminar on Pakistan and Afgha­n­istan relations — organised by the Khyber Margalla Founda­tion, an Islamabad-based organisation of government servants, retired officials and professionals from Khyber Pakht­unkhwa — Gen Haq recalled that Zaeef was told that he should leave Islamabad. If he did not accept, he would be taken to Torkham and deported, the former general said. “When he was being flown in a helicopter, our people again told him that if you agree, we will drop you somewhere else rather than taking you to the border for deportation.” “Ultimately, he was taken to the Torkham border and asked to cross over. No one in Pakistan handed him over to the US. When he crossed… Afghan aut­h­orities arrested and han­d­ed him over to American forces. Then he was transferred to Guant­anamo. Pakistan has not done it,” the ex-ISI chief said. Although Pakistan had recognised the Taliban regime and accepted Zaeef as Kabul’s amb­a­ssador, the recognition was withdrawn in the wake of 9/11. The former spy chief — who has also served as the head of Military Intelligence and ret­ired as Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee — recalled that despite the breakdown of ties, Zaeef continued to reside in the ambassador’s official residence, where the foreign media would remain camped out. He also recounted how Tali­ban leaders started leaving Afgh­anistan after the US began bombing Kabul in October 2001. They had plans to form a government-in-exile in Pakis­tan, with Zaeef as its head, he said. “A decision was made to ask Mullah Zaeef to leave Pakistan. There were five million Afghans living in Pakistan that time and we did not hand over any Afghan to the US,” he said. Gen Haq said Pakistani officials had advised Zaeef to move to a refugee camp, or any other place, to live as a common Afg­han and stop what he was doing. “This message was conveyed to him through the foreign ministry and other relevant govt functionaries.” However, the former ISI chief said, the erstwhile env­oy refused to leave Islamabad. “Our people would keep on ask­ing him for months to shift from Islamabad. Other countr­ies would also lodge protests that there are UN resolutions and Pa­­k­­istan had de-recognised the Af­g­han govt [but he is still] he is sitting in Islamabad,” he recalled.

Speaking about the roa­d­side explosion, officials said the improvised explosive device, which was pla­n­ted in a motorbike, went off next to a security vehicle when the DC’s convoy reac­h­ed Thana road in Turbat. “At least nine Levies personnel present in the security vehicle, as well as a passerby, were injured in the powerful blast,” Nazeer Ahmed, Turbat deputy superintendent of police, told Dawn . The deputy commissi­oner, who was travelling in a bulletproof vehicle, rem­ained safe in the explosion. Soon after the blast, the security forces and the police rushed to the site, and the injured Levies personnel and the sole civilian were rushed to the district hospital in Turbat. “The condition of two personnel is serious,” the police said, quoting hospital officials. The explosion destr­oyed the security vehicle, while the bulletproof vehicle of the DC also received damage. At least a dozen buildings and five vehicles parked in the vicinity also sustained damage. Police station torched Separately, dozens of militants attacked Bhag, a town in Kacchi district, and set the Levies station and other government buildings on fire. Officials said two assailants were also gunned down — one body was tak­en into custody by the Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment and the other was tak­en away by the fleeing militants. In the attack, a police official was also killed, while another sustained injuries and moved to Sibi for treatment. Officials said up to 50 armed men arrived in Bhag at 4:15pm on motorbikes, attacking a pickup truck and police and Levies stations. They took the Levies personnel hostage and started firing at the police station. However, the police deployed in the area immediately retaliated, leading to a heavy exchange of fire. In the shootout, Bhag SHO Lutaf Khosa received multiple injuries and lost his life. “Our police officer was martyred and a police constable [Muhammad Afzal Khosa] was injured in the heavy exchange of fire,” Maazur Rehman, Ka­c­chi SSP, told Dawn . He said two militants were also killed. According to the SSP, armed men broke into the judicial lockup and took away six undertrial prisoners. He said the tehsil office was also attacked by the militants who ransacked the record of ‘Patwarkhana’ and its furniture. They tried to enter a National Bank branch but the police foiled their attempt, said the SSP. He said the police station was completely gutted. The building of the National Bank was also damaged as heavy weapons were used in the attack. Ali Jan Mangi in Nasirabad also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, October 28th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "THIS past week was Arshad Sharif’s third death anniversary. Back in 2022, he was killed under mysterious circumstances in Kenya , far away from Pakistan. That year was a chaotic one in Pakistan, chaos which is easier to ascribe to politics than to point out more uncomfortable truths; and it also claimed Arshad Sharif’s life. Once the grief and horror over his death passed, the conversation returned to prosaic matters such as inquiries, commissions and justice. I call them prosaic because when journalists die in Pakistan, everyone pushes earnestly for answers, despite knowing that justice will never be done and no one will be held accountable. The same storyline was faithfully adhered to this time around. In the three years since, we have seen journalist organisations promising — politician-like — to push for investigations, as well as politicians and also other powerful people. Some promises were made publicly and some in secret but none were fulfilled. Three years on, very few questions have been answered. But such tragedies are the norm in Pakistan. Here popular leaders are given the death penalty, others are targeted by militant groups and those from the smaller provinces are even disappeared. It is no wonder then that journalists are not treated more kindly. Just in the past couple of decades, Hayatullah was disappeared and killed in what was then Fata; Saleem Shahzad was disappeared and found dead near Islamabad and Wali Khan Babar was targeted in Karachi — just to name a few. Three years ago, it was Arshad Sharif. But his death seemed to and continues to feel like a turning point. Partly because it came in a year that was a turning point in so many ways, but also because of the manner in which it happened. Before Arshad Sharif, many of us were always bystanders to the violence which affected one of our own. The threats that came before, the harassment that Babar or Shahzad faced was usually limited to a close circle but with Arshad Sharif it played out like a film. The FIRs, the letters he wrote, his exit from the country, his resignation from his job and then his vlogs, we all had a ringside seat to the events. What journalist colleagues in smaller towns and cities go through is hard to even imagine. Equally, what made it a turning point was that his death told us journalists that borders now no longer keep us safe. To be accurate, the message had been sent earlier with the death of Sajid Husain in Sweden in 2020 — but Arshad Sharif’s demise in Kenya emphasised it more. It is no longer necessary that once the borders of Pakistan are crossed, threatened journalists will be able to breathe freely. Once this was a guarantee of safety but not anymore. Despite this, many others from the community have left the country and settled abroad. And for multiple reasons, journalism and the ability of journalists to do their job has been in a free fall since 2022; it was not much better before it either but the speed at which the environment has become worse is increasing. So much has been written about this already that little can be added to it. But as our job is sometimes to state the obvious, let me point out that this past week, as Arshad Sharif’s death anniversary was being commemorated, Matiullah Jan, another colleague from Islamabad, was in the news because the ludicrous case against him for ‘attacking policemen’ while ‘under the influence’ and for ‘possession’ of heroin was also proceeding. News reports say he will be indicted on Oct 31. The allegations are so ridiculous that even those in the government cannot defend them but the case goes ahead, for we now live in times better suited for magical realism than the real world. So even as the case will progress, we will complain and yet be grateful that Matiullah Jan was thus accused and is out on bail. At least, he was produced in court after being formally charged, even as he has every right to be angry about the indignity of this case and also hear the inanities uttered by those who claim to lead and represent us. The harassment of journalists has indeed taken on new hues, in recent years. Just in the past year, Matiullah and Asad Toor both lost access to their bank accounts as did others around them. Friends, relatives and even ordinary vendors they interacted with, everyone paid the price for having pesky journalists in their lives. There are others also in a similar predicament. What colleagues in the smaller towns and cities go through is hard to even imagine, as most of us in Islamabad worry about the next red line we are told not to cross; the next big event that is not to be covered; or express horror at the next colleague to be banned from the airwaves. And if there is any outrage or protest, the reply comes in the shape of a lecture on good or bad journalism and the difference between a good journalist and a propagandist. As if somehow, the label of a bad journalist justifies kidnapping, criminal cases, disappearances and death. In the midst of all this, some journalists last week did remember Arshad Sharif’s death and the justice he and his family continue to be denied. As occasionally a voice is raised for Saleem Shahzad or Nazim Jokhio . The list was long before Arshad Sharif’s name was added to it and it will keep growing. But whether those in power ignore the issue or speak of it only to deflect the matter, what they don’t realise is that in the people’s imagination the culprits were identified long ago. When the truth is withheld and the facts obscured, the people’s court doesn’t wait forever to make its own judgement. These judgements have little need for an order from the Supreme Court or an inquiry commission. For ordinary people, they have already reached their decision in Arshad Sharif’s case. And it will not be easy to change their minds. The writer is a journalist. Published in Dawn, October 28th, 2025",

Perhaps the biggest stumbling block is the fact that the Afghan Taliban are unwilling to give ironclad guarantees that their soil will not be used by banned groups such as the TTP and the BLA to carry out acts of terrorism against this country. Complicating matters was the fact — as related by sources — that Kabul’s rulers were “following someone else’s agenda”, an allusion to the recent bonhomie between India and the Taliban . Reportedly, the Taliban have refused to provide written assurances stating that terrorist activity from Afghanistan will stop. Pakistan must proceed carefully. During the talks, the Afghan side has reportedly urged Pakistan to negotiate with the TTP. This should be a red line for this country as past attempts to reason with the terrorist group have given Pakistan nothing but martyred security men and civilians. Even as the talks in Turkiye were underway, TTP fighters tried to cross the border . At least five troops were martyred in these engagements. Therefore, the Taliban’s offer of arranging a dialogue with the TTP is a non-starter, as the outfit wants to impose its writ through the barrel of the gun. It is also a fact that terrorist groups in Afghanistan have been given a veritable treasure trove in the form of billions of dollars of American arms and military hardware that the US left behind as it exited Afghanistan in 2021. Large volumes of this deadly ware have ended up in the hands of Al Qaeda and the TTP, and are being used against Pakistan. The negotiations should continue, and it is hoped this impasse can be resolved peacefully. US President Donald Trump has offered his good offices , saying he could “get that [Pak-Afghan dispute] solved very quickly”. The US leader, who says he has prevented “eight wars”, is welcome to try his hand at Pak-Afghan diplomacy. But on a more critical note, there can be no permanent peace until terrorist groups based in Afghanistan stop their violent anti-Pakistan campaigns. If Kabul can rein in these outfits, there would be nothing like it. But if the dialogue process goes nowhere, Pakistan must be prepared to defend its frontiers. Intelligence-based operations must be conducted to prevent militants from crossing the border, and targeting innocent Pakistanis. If the Taliban remain unwilling to stop cross-border terrorism, then, along with using its kinetic options, Pakistan must launch a diplomatic offensive, involving regional allies such as China, the Gulf states, Iran, etc, to freeze the normalisation process with Kabul until it takes verifiable action against terrorist groups.

The negotiations should continue, and it is hoped this impasse can be resolved peacefully. US President Donald Trump has offered his good offices , saying he could “get that [Pak-Afghan dispute] solved very quickly”. The US leader, who says he has prevented “eight wars”, is welcome to try his hand at Pak-Afghan diplomacy. But on a more critical note, there can be no permanent peace until terrorist groups based in Afghanistan stop their violent anti-Pakistan campaigns. If Kabul can rein in these outfits, there would be nothing like it. But if the dialogue process goes nowhere, Pakistan must be prepared to defend its frontiers. Intelligence-based operations must be conducted to prevent militants from crossing the border, and targeting innocent Pakistanis. If the Taliban remain unwilling to stop cross-border terrorism, then, along with using its kinetic options, Pakistan must launch a diplomatic offensive, involving regional allies such as China, the Gulf states, Iran, etc, to freeze the normalisation process with Kabul until it takes verifiable action against terrorist groups.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The third day of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the Turkish capital kept oscillating between hope and despair on Monday, as both sides struggled to bridge their differences over a mechanism to curb cross-border terrorism. By late evening, officials said a final agreement still remained elusive. Sources familiar with the closed-door discussions said that while “most of the points had been mutually agreed between the two sides”, the mechanism for verifiable action against terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory continued to be the main sticking point. “We kept hoping that we would be able to sign a mutual document with Afgha­nistan soon, followed by a joint statement, but it still remains out of our reach,” one source said, sounding dejected, yet unwilling to abandon hope. Mechanism for verifiable action against terrorists operating from Afghan soil remains main issue between Islamabad and Kabul The atmosphere early in the day had been markedly positive. Participants des­c­­ribed “encouraging progress” and “serious engagement” from both delegations. As the day wore on and talks stretched into the evening, optimism began to fade. “It is a difficult phase,” a source admitted, reflecting the growing sense of frustration within the room. By nightfall, it appeared that the process had once again hit a roadblock. According to the participants, the Afghan Taliban delegation continued to resist putting anything in writing, particularly on the issue of providing verifiable guarantees to end support for the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “The hosts understand Pakistan’s concerns,” one Pakistani official said, “but people in Kabul and Kandahar are not willing to commit.” This hesitation has left the Pakistani side increasingly frustrated. “Pakistan’s principled stance has been clear from the outset,” a security source said. “The Taliban must end their patronage of the TTP and prevent Afghan territory from being used for terrorism against Pakistan.” The source added that despite “some negative and external influences” — a reference to India , Pakistan and the mediating countries remained “sincere and serious” in their efforts to move the dialogue toward a positive outcome. The tone at the start of Monday’s proceedings contrasted sharply with the pessimism that followed Sunday’s session, when Pakistani officials told reporters that Islamabad had presented its final position to the Taliban delegation — a statement widely interpreted in local media as signalling the possible collapse of the talks. In contrast to those reports, members of the Afghan negotiating team had on Sunday night and Monday morning continued to express optimism. They maintained that the dialogue in Istanbul could still yield results, describing the remaining disagreements as “few” and “resolvable”. “The Afghan side has made it clear that tensions benefit no one,” one member of the delegation said. “We are hopeful that these talks will produce a positive outcome.” Mediators from Turkiye and Qatar were said to share this sentiment, stressing the importance of maintaining engagement and preventing the process from unraveling. Despite the lingering stalemate, diplomatic sources described Monday’s session as “not without significance”. “Even if the talks didn’t produce a breakthrough, the fact that both sides stayed engaged for three straight days is important,” one mediator said. “It shows that neither wants the process to collapse.” By late evening, negotiators in Istanbul were weighing whether to extend discussions into a fourth day.

Prince Andrew announced he would cease using his title of Duke of York after a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who accused the prince of sexually abusing her as a teenager, intensified scrutiny over his behaviour and connections to Epstein. Andrew has always denied Giuffre's account. In 2022, he made an undisclosed payment to settle a lawsuit brought in the US by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s build-up towards next year’s T20 World Cup will continue on Tuesday when they take on South Africa in the opener of the three-match series at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. The national side goes into the series after faring decently in their biggest test at the Asia Cup last month — beating all sides they came up against except world number one and archrivals India, who handed them defeats in all three encounters including the final. South Africa, in contrast, arrive as a depleted outfit on paper — the presence of star batter Quinton de Kock, featuring in a Twenty20 International for the first time since June 2024, standing out in a largely second-string squad led by Donovan Ferreira, who has just nine T20Is to his name. Hence, Pakistan can be safely called favourites to take the series trophy, which would help restore their damaged confidence following the triple-drubbing from India. The hosts too haven’t shied away from striking a balance between experimentation and experience. Former skipper Babar Azam has returned to the T20I ranks following a four-month absence, while Fakhar Zaman waits in the reserves. “He’s a world-class player,” Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said of Babar in the pre-series press conference on the eve of the match. “His presence always benefits the team. He’s played over a hundred T20s, led Pakistan many times, and scored heavily. His experience will strengthen our batting line-up.” Pacer Naseem Shah, who missed both the tri-nation series and the Asia Cup, is also set to make his comeback. Uncapped spinner Usman Tariq and exciting middle-order batter Abdul Samad have been drafted in as part of Pakistan’s search for depth and flexibility ahead of the global showpiece next year. Pakistan have also axed Mohammad Haris, despite the team management previously backing the wicket-keeper batter before he fell out of favour to make way for Usman Khan. The decision has raised concerns of inconsistent selection. “We were looking for a wicket-keeper-batter who can play in the middle order, especially against spin,” Salman said, defending Usman’s inclusion. “Even though his international record isn’t great yet, you must’ve seen in the PSL that he bats well against spin in middle overs. We needed that kind of player who can both keep wickets and handle spin in that phase.” Pakistan have undergone a T20I revamp since the appointment of Mike Hesson as the side’s white-ball head coach in June, with an increased emphasis on strike-rates under the New Zealander. Hard-hitting has been a central theme of their approach in the 21 matches under Hesson so far. But with the strategy largely failing to yield consistent results, there is a growing realisation that a more adaptable approach is needed. “Given the kind of conditions we’ve been playing in, we need batters who can build innings and rotate strike, and then accelerate when required,” Salman said. “Middle-overs batting against spin is another key area. We need to improve strike rotation there, and we’ve worked on that during our recent camp.” The pitch at Rawalpindi is expected to be a batting paradise, which could also allow South Africa to challenge Pakistan with big totals and put the hosts under pressure. For the visitors, too, the series offers an opportunity to fine-tune their combination ahead of the T20 World Cup. “It is important to build up toward the World Cup,” Ferreira said. “I think this is the big stepping stone for us toward the World Cup.” Ferreira was named skipper after veteran batter David Miller was ruled out due to injury. Gerald Coetzee and Kwena Maphaka have also missed out through fitness issues, while the Proteas have rested regular T20I captain Aiden Markram, batters Tristan Stubbs and Ryan Rickelton, and spearhead Kagiso Rabada.

      "summary_en": "Pakistan’s build-up towards next year’s T20 World Cup will continue on Tuesday when they take on South Africa in the opener of the three-match series at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. The national side goes into the series after faring decently in their biggest test at the Asia Cup last month — beating all sides they came up against except world number one and archrivals India, who handed them defeats in all three encounters including the final. South Africa, in contrast, arrive as a depleted outfit on paper — the presence of star batter Quinton de Kock, featuring in a Twenty20 International for the first time since June 2024, standing out in a largely second-string squad led by Donovan Ferreira, who has just nine T20Is to his name. Hence, Pakistan can be safely called favourites to take the series trophy, which would help restore their damaged confidence following the triple-drubbing from India. The hosts too haven’t shied away from striking a balance between experimentation and experience. Former skipper Babar Azam has returned to the T20I ranks following a four-month absence, while Fakhar Zaman waits in the reserves. “He’s a world-class player,” Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said of Babar in the pre-series press conference on the eve of the match. “His presence always benefits the team. He’s played over a hundred T20s, led Pakistan many times, and scored heavily. His experience will strengthen our batting line-up.” Pacer Naseem Shah, who missed both the tri-nation series and the Asia Cup, is also set to make his comeback. Uncapped spinner Usman Tariq and exciting middle-order batter Abdul Samad have been drafted in as part of Pakistan’s search for depth and flexibility ahead of the global showpiece next year. Pakistan have also axed Mohammad Haris, despite the team management previously backing the wicket-keeper batter before he fell out of favour to make way for Usman Khan.

      "summary_orig": "The Sindh government and police on Monday announced the arrest of four suspects from a proscribed outfit in the murder case of journalist and anchorperson Imtiaz Mir. Mir, who was associated with Metro News television, was heading home in a car driven by his elder brother last month when six assailants riding two motorcycles fired a volley of bullets on his vehicle on the National Highway. The anchorperson sustained multiple bullet wounds and was taken to a private hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Journalists had strongly condemned the inaction by the police for failing to arrest the attackers and demanded their immediate arrest. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, many members of his cabinet and leaders of political parties had expressed their sorrow, with CM Shah directing the inspector general of police (IG) to immediately arrest the killers. Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, IG Ghulam Nabi Memon and Additional IG Javed Alam Odho held a press conference today on updates regarding the case. “Four people have been arrested in the murder of journalist Imtiaz Mir,” Lanjar said, adding that a joint operation was carried out by the Karachi police and a federal intelligence agency. “The culprits belong to a banned organisation that used to take instructions from abroad,” he added. Lanjar termed it a breakthrough in the murder case, adding that the bike used in the attack was also recovered. The home minister said that Mir had given an interview in which he talked in “favour of Israel”, adding that it appeared to be “an exact motive” of the murder. He said a sub-organisation of the proscribed Zainabiyoun Brigade was involved in the case. Lanjar added that the primary suspect lived in a neighboring country, without specifying who he was referring to. The home minister alleged that the neighboring country was “providing funding and spreading chaos” in Pakistan. Mir’s brother Riaz Ali had registered a case under Sections 34 (common intention) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Saudabad police station, nominating a man and his sons for the attack. The complainant said that the attack was carried out at the behest of Umer Daraz and his two sons — Ahmed Bux and Aftab — with whom they had a land dispute in their native town in Jacobabad. Saudabad Station House Officer Ateequr Rehman had told Dawn that both parties belonged to the same tribe. He recalled that the late anchorperson had also lodged an FIR against the same suspects at the Shah Latif Town police in 2023. According to a report published last month by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.",

      "title_orig": "Kundi seeks PM’s intervention against ‘unconstitutional’ restrictions on inter-provincial movement of wheat",
      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Monday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif against “unconstitutional restrictions” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to the province. The development comes as the Punjab government has faced criticism by the KP and Sindh governments for choking wheat flow to the two provinces. However, a day earlier, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari insisted that there was no ban on the inter-provincial movement of wheat, terming the “ongoing propaganda in this regard baseless and contrary to facts”. In a post on social media platform X today, the KP governor said he had written to the premier, urging his “immediate intervention to lift the unconstitutional restrictions” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to the province. “Such limitations not only affect the province’s food security but also go against the spirit of cooperative federalism enshrined in our Constitution,” he said. He expressed his confidence that the matter would be resolved promptly “under the prime minister’s leadership”. The letter, which Kundi also posted on X, termed the restrictions a “serious concern”, pointing out that KP was a “wheat-deficient province and depends substantially on inter-provincial inflows to meet its essential food requirements”. It said that the restrictions were against Article 151 of the Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse among the provinces. “Any disruption in supply risks creating artificial shortages, price escalation and public hardship,” he said. “It has further been observed that these limitations are unintentionally encouraging illegal and informal transportation of wheat through alternate means and routes, which is resulting in uncontrollable supply distortions in the open market. This diversion is causing [a] rapid escalation in wheat and flour prices, directly burdening the general public and potentially triggering unwarranted public resentment,” he said. Kundi requested PM Shehbaz’s “kind and immediate intervention in this matter and direction to the concerned authorities” to withdraw the restrictions in order to ensure the “uninterrupted and legally protected movement of wheat” into KP. “I remain confident that, under your leadership, the constitutional rights of the people of KP will be safeguarded effectively and without delay,” he said. Kundi seeks restoration of daily int’l flights from Peshawar Separately, the KP governor wrote to Defence Minister Khawaja Asif requesting him to restore daily flights between Peshawar and Karachi, as well as international ones, “particularly to the Gulf and Middle Eastern countries”. “The suspension of these (international) flights has caused considerable hardship for overseas Pakistanis, entrepreneurs and their families,” Kundi said in a later post on X, noting that a “large expatriate population” from KP was employed in the Middle East. Kundi further said a “single private airline is operating with absolute monopoly” on the route between Peshawar and Karachi, inconveniencing people and traders due to exorbitant fares and limited seat availability. The governor requested Asif to issue directions to restore the flight services, adding, “I also earnestly hope and pray that our National Flag Bearer airline will once again ascend to command the skies of the world as it gloriously did during the golden decades of the 1960s and 1970s.” KP’s grievances In the aftermath of the recent floods, the Punjab government had begun tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage. The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement. While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. On Sept 7, Kundi had regretted the reports that Punjab had banned the movement of wheat to other provinces. He had issued another condemnation of the reported ban the very next day in a post on social media platform X. “The arbitrary ban imposed on August 31, 2025, by the Government of Punjab on the supply of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a blatant violation of Article 151 of the Constitution and a serious breach of national unity,” Kundi had said on X. The Constitution’s Article 151 states that “trade, commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free”, but empowers the parliament to “impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one province and another or within any part of Pakistan as may be required in the public interest”. The KP governor had further said: “As a result, the price of a 20kg bag of flour has soared to approximately Rs 1,200 in Punjab and up to Rs 2,800 in KP — an unbearable burden on families already struggling with inflation. “On behalf of the people of KP, I strongly condemn this discriminatory act and urge Chief Minister Punjab [Maryam Nawaz] to not only condemn but also immediately withdraw this verbal ban.” Meanwhile, on Sept 7, the KP Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution, denouncing the Punjab government’s “restrictions” on wheat supply amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in flour prices across the province. Subsequently, the government had approved a national wheat policy earlier this month. According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, stakeholders were told during a briefing about the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat. Then, in a letter dated October 23, the KP government had asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province. KP’s food secretary, in a letter to his Punjab counterpart, said that lifting the ban was critical to res­t­oring a smooth supply chain, stabilising market prices, and safeguarding his province’s food security. The letter said KP, a wheat-deficient province, depended on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its requirements — roughly 14,500 tonnes per day. “The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,” it read. While KP acknowledged Punjab’s recent permit-based allocation of 2,000 tonnes of flour for transport to KP, it termed the quota “insufficient” relative to actual requirements. KP lamented that despite repeated communications from its chief secretary, food secretary and director of food to Punjab, the ban continued to remain in force. “This situation is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 151(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which guarantees freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country,” the letter said. The letter added that the issue was raised at a high-level meeting, chaired by PM Shehbaz, on October 17 regarding the Interim Wheat Policy 2025 . “The KP Flour Mills Association has repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that the non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist,” it said. Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed. Last week, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had again condemned Punjab’s “ban” on wheat and flour transport to the province, calling it a violation of the Constitution and “an attack on the rights” of the people of the province. Chairing a meeting, he directed the food department’s high-ups to write a letter to the Punjab government demanding immediate removal of all restrictions to ensure free movement of wheat and its flour across the provincial borders, according to a statement from the chief minister’s secretariat. Afridi said that hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of necessities was unacceptable. Officials told the meeting that KP consumes about 5.3 million tonnes of wheat and flour annually, of which only 1.5m tonnes are produced locally, while the remainder is sourced from Punjab and other provinces.",

Kundi requested PM Shehbaz’s “kind and immediate intervention in this matter and direction to the concerned authorities” to withdraw the restrictions in order to ensure the “uninterrupted and legally protected movement of wheat” into KP. “I remain confident that, under your leadership, the constitutional rights of the people of KP will be safeguarded effectively and without delay,” he said. Kundi seeks restoration of daily int’l flights from Peshawar Separately, the KP governor wrote to Defence Minister Khawaja Asif requesting him to restore daily flights between Peshawar and Karachi, as well as international ones, “particularly to the Gulf and Middle Eastern countries”. “The suspension of these (international) flights has caused considerable hardship for overseas Pakistanis, entrepreneurs and their families,” Kundi said in a later post on X, noting that a “large expatriate population” from KP was employed in the Middle East. Kundi further said a “single private airline is operating with absolute monopoly” on the route between Peshawar and Karachi, inconveniencing people and traders due to exorbitant fares and limited seat availability. The governor requested Asif to issue directions to restore the flight services, adding, “I also earnestly hope and pray that our National Flag Bearer airline will once again ascend to command the skies of the world as it gloriously did during the golden decades of the 1960s and 1970s.” KP’s grievances In the aftermath of the recent floods, the Punjab government had begun tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage. The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement. While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. On Sept 7, Kundi had regretted the reports that Punjab had banned the movement of wheat to other provinces. He had issued another condemnation of the reported ban the very next day in a post on social media platform X. “The arbitrary ban imposed on August 31, 2025, by the Government of Punjab on the supply of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a blatant violation of Article 151 of the Constitution and a serious breach of national unity,” Kundi had said on X. The Constitution’s Article 151 states that “trade, commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free”, but empowers the parliament to “impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one province and another or within any part of Pakistan as may be required in the public interest”. The KP governor had further said: “As a result, the price of a 20kg bag of flour has soared to approximately Rs 1,200 in Punjab and up to Rs 2,800 in KP — an unbearable burden on families already struggling with inflation. “On behalf of the people of KP, I strongly condemn this discriminatory act and urge Chief Minister Punjab [Maryam Nawaz] to not only condemn but also immediately withdraw this verbal ban.” Meanwhile, on Sept 7, the KP Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution, denouncing the Punjab government’s “restrictions” on wheat supply amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in flour prices across the province. Subsequently, the government had approved a national wheat policy earlier this month. According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, stakeholders were told during a briefing about the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat. Then, in a letter dated October 23, the KP government had asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province. KP’s food secretary, in a letter to his Punjab counterpart, said that lifting the ban was critical to res­t­oring a smooth supply chain, stabilising market prices, and safeguarding his province’s food security. The letter said KP, a wheat-deficient province, depended on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its requirements — roughly 14,500 tonnes per day. “The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,” it read. While KP acknowledged Punjab’s recent permit-based allocation of 2,000 tonnes of flour for transport to KP, it termed the quota “insufficient” relative to actual requirements. KP lamented that despite repeated communications from its chief secretary, food secretary and director of food to Punjab, the ban continued to remain in force. “This situation is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 151(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which guarantees freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country,” the letter said. The letter added that the issue was raised at a high-level meeting, chaired by PM Shehbaz, on October 17 regarding the Interim Wheat Policy 2025 . “The KP Flour Mills Association has repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that the non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist,” it said. Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed. Last week, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had again condemned Punjab’s “ban” on wheat and flour transport to the province, calling it a violation of the Constitution and “an attack on the rights” of the people of the province. Chairing a meeting, he directed the food department’s high-ups to write a letter to the Punjab government demanding immediate removal of all restrictions to ensure free movement of wheat and its flour across the provincial borders, according to a statement from the chief minister’s secretariat. Afridi said that hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of necessities was unacceptable. Officials told the meeting that KP consumes about 5.3 million tonnes of wheat and flour annually, of which only 1.5m tonnes are produced locally, while the remainder is sourced from Punjab and other provinces.",
