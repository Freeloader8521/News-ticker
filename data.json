Last week, a pet lion attacked an eight-year-old boy in the Sabzazar area of Lahore, in which he lost one arm. According to police, Wajid Ali went close to the lion’s cage while playing when it attacked him. Seven sent to jail on judicial remand in pet lioness attack case The lion chewed off the child’s arm owing to improper enclosure arrangements and negligence by the owner.

      "summary_orig": "JERUSALEM: The Israeli military said on Monday that the remains of the last prisoner held in Gaza, Ran Gvili, had been identified and were being repatriated to Israel. The announcement put an end to a lengthy process to locate and return the last of the 251 prisoners taken by Hamas during their October 2023 attack on Israel. Meanwhile, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the return of all those held prisoner “down to the very last”. The latest set of prisoner handovers were part of the first phase of the US-backed ceasefire deal, which began on October 10 and aimed to stop the fighting in the Palestinian territory. Hamas says return reflects the group’s commitment to ceasefire agreement Gvili’s family had expressed strong opposition to launching the second phase of the plan before they had received his remains. The Israeli military said in a statement that its representatives “informed the family of Ran Gvili… that their loved one has been identified and will be returned for burial”. It added that all prisoners have been returned from the Gaza Strip to the State of Israel. The gradual return of the prisoners over several stages had been a complicated and arduous process for both sides. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement that “the discovery of the body of the last Israeli prisoner in Gaza confirms Hamas’s commitment to all the requirements of the ceasefire agreement on the Gaza Strip”. Officials said on Sunday that Israeli forces were searching for Gvili’s remains in a cemetery in northern Gaza. The announcement of the search came after visiting US envoys reportedly pushed Israeli officials to reopen Gaza’s Rafah crossing, a vital entry point for aid. Israeli officials said on Monday that though they would open the crossing, only pedestrians would be allowed to travel through the crossing to Egypt. Reopening Rafah, a vital entry point for aid into Gaza, forms part of the US-brokered truce. Published in Dawn, January 27th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: In a revealing interview with The Sunday Times, former UK Chancellor Sajid Javid reflected on his life journey from a childhood marked by poverty, domestic violence and racism to a career as a multimillionaire, cabinet minister, and home secretary. He also discussed his family’s complex past and integration in Britain and modern immigration policy. Among the most striking revelations, British Pakistani Javid admitted that under the existing immigration rules, he “wouldn’t allow either his unskilled father or his non-English speaking mother entry today”. “The biggest block to good community cohesion is English. We should have set a requirement that if you want to settle in the UK, you should be able to speak fluent English. We should have done that ages ago,” he said. Javid’s parents arrived from Pakistan in the early 1960s. His father, arriving with just £1, worked as a bus driver, mill worker and shop owner, while his mother who was uneducated and initially unable to speak English, struggled to adapt. The Colour of Home, Javid’s new memoir, details a childhood shaped by hardship and family tension. In revealing Sunday Times interview, Sajid Javid says he ‘wouldn’t allow his unskilled father or his non-English speaking mother entry’ into UK under current rules The memoir describes his father’s violence. Javid recounts being beaten with a leather slipper, a wooden spoon and on one occasion a hammer that required a CT scan. He writes about enduring racist attacks from skinheads and school bullies, as well as the emotional toll of growing up in cramped and impoverished living conditions. “Crouching in a ball and covering his face while his father beat him,” Javid recalls, highlights the intensity of these early struggles. Family tensions extended to marriage expectations. His mother initially objected to his white Christian wife Laura refusing to meet her for two years, and had even tried to arrange a marriage with his cousin. His mother also “didn’t want two black workmen her husband employed to come for dinner” though she later learnt English and “came to deeply regret her racism towards the black workmen”. Later in life, his father apologised to Javid for his past violence. Despite these hardships, the family’s story is one of resilience. Javid fulfilled his childhood goal of buying his parents a house in Bristol, writing that one of his proudest moments was achieving “enough to give myself and my family a better life”. He told the interviewer that a “Reform voter… might think this is exactly the kind of family that we want in the UK because they went on a journey and look where they’ve ended”. In politics, Javid was known for his positions on immigration. He supported a post-Brexit points-based system but argued that the UK “lets in too many immigrants” and stressed that language skills are essential for community cohesion.

      "summary_orig": "DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates will not allow attacks on Iran to be launched from its territory, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday. Last week, President Donald Trump said a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely after a crackdown on protesters. The foreign ministry said in a statement it “has reaffirmed the United Arab Emirates’ commitment to not allowing its airspace, territory or waters to be used in any hostile military actions against Iran”. The UAE hosts thousands of US personnel at Al Dhafra airbase near the capital Abu Dhabi, one of several American military bases in the Gulf. US aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln arrives in Middle East; Hezbollah chief warns any war against Iran will ignite the region The UAE also refuses to provide logistical support for attacks, the statement said, adding that “dialogue, de-escalation, adherence to international law, and respect for state sovereignty” were the best way to address “current crises” US aircraft carrier arrives in Middle East The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has arrived in the Middle East, the US military said on Monday, dramatically boosting American firepower in the region at a time of heightened tensions with Iran. The Lincoln and accompanying ships are “currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability”, US Central Command said in a post on X. Hezbollah chief’s warning Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem warned on Monday that any war against the group’s backer Tehran this time will ignite the region as it will also target the group. “Faced with aggression that does not distinguish between us… we are targeted by any potential aggression and determined to defend ourselves,” he said in a televised address to supporters at a solidarity rally for Iran. “We will choose at that time how to act… but we are not neutral,” he said, warning that “a war on Iran this time will ignite the region”. Rubio’s warning to Iraq US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iraq on Sunday against a pro-Iranian government as the expected return of Nouri al-Maliki as prime minister stirs Washington’s concern. Maliki, who left power in 2014 following heated pressure from the United States, has been chosen by Iraq’s largest Shia bloc, which would put him in line to be nominated prime minister. Rubio, in a telephone call with incumbent Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, voiced hope the next government will work to make Iraq “a force for stability, prosperity and security in the Middle East”. “The secretary emphasised that a government controlled by Iran cannot successfully put Iraq’s own interests first, keep Iraq out of regional conflicts or advance the mutually beneficial partnership between the United States and Iraq,” Rubio said, according to State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott. An Iraqi political source said the US had conveyed that it “holds a negative view of previous governments led by former prime minister Maliki”. In a letter, US representatives said that while the selection of the prime minister is an Iraqi decision, “the United States will make its own sovereign decisions regarding the next government in line with American interests”. The US wields key leverage over Iraq as the country’s oil export revenue is largely held at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, in an arrangement reached after the 2003 US invasion toppled military dictator Saddam Hussein. Iraq’s parliament meets Tuesday to elect a new president, who holds a ceremonial role but will appoint a prime minister. A US-based rights group claimed on Monday it had “confirmed” reports of deaths of 5,848 people in a wave of protests in Iran suppressed by security forces. Published in Dawn, January 27th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• State, cities of Minneapolis and St Paul ask court to pause operation • Federal judge hears arguments whether the deployment of federal officers violates state’s sovereignty • White House dismisses concerns as Congress Democrats threaten to hold up funding unless ICE reformed MINNEAPOLIS: In a bid to regain control over an escalating crisis sparked by the second killing of a protester against his administration’s militarised immigration raids, US President Donald Trump dispatched his top border official to Minnesota on Monday. Trump said that Tom Homan, his point man for border security, would arrive in the state later and “will report directly to me”. As Minneapolis has become ground zero in the clash between Trump and growing numbers of Americans over his nationwide immigration crackdown, Trump’s deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, described the city on Fox News as a ‘powder keg’. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been transformed under Trump into the United States’ most heavily funded law enforcement body. But polls show growing anger over its frequently brutal tactics. A huge rally took place despite bitter cold in Minneapolis on Friday to protest the raids and the point blank shooting by an ICE agent of protester Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three on Jan 7. Then on Saturday, immigration agents gunned down Alex Jeffrey Pretti, also 37, after having already tackled him to the ground. Like Good, the intensive care unit nurse was a US citizen. More rallies erupted after his death in Minneapolis, New York and other major cities across the United States. Minnesota’s sovereignty On Monday, a federal judge in Minnea­polis was hearing arguments on whether the deployment of federal officers — often masked, heavily armed and unidentified — violates the state of Minnesota’s sovereignty. The judge would consider a request to temporarily stop Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota, following the fatal shooting of a second US citizen over the weekend that sparked a fierce backlash. The state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are asking the court to pause the 3,000-agent operation, calling it a “completely disproportionate” violation of state sovereignty. The Trump administration, in a court filing, called the request an “absurdity” that would make federal law an afterthought. In Congress, Democrats are threatening to hold up funding for the US government unless immigration enforcement agencies are reformed. Trump has so far dismissed concerns. The 79-year-old Republican’s first reaction to Pretti’s killing was to suggest that the nurse had come intending to shoot at the police. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison then accused Trump of pushing a “flat-out insane” narrative. In Monday’s court action, the judge was hearing arguments from state and city lawyers that the federal deployments amount to an occupying force. Also under consideration was a bid to force federal officials to preserve evidence related to Pretti’s killing. The lawsuits highlight the deep rift between local and federal law enforcement over the deployment, dubbed “Operation Metro Surge”. Trump’s immigration raids have focused deliberately on Democratic-run cities, pitting mayors and governors against the president. Local police have repeatedly confronted federal agents and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has even suggested he could call out the state’s National Guard to push back against Trump’s forces. Trump will also be watching signs of growing disenchantment from his Republican Party in Congress. The party is usually in lockstep with Trump but it has only a slender majority. One of the most prominent cautions came from House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer, who signalled on Sunday that federal agents should withdraw from Minneapolis — an intervention that would normally be unheard of from a figure considered one of Trump’s staunchest loyalists. Sixty of the state’s largest businesses, including Target, 3M, UnitedHealth and US Bancorp, have called for an immediate de-escalation of tensions between the state and the Trump administration. Trump claimed that the immigration agents would leave Minneapolis “at some point”. Published in Dawn, January 27th, 2026",

Trump will also be watching signs of growing disenchantment from his Republican Party in Congress. The party is usually in lockstep with Trump but it has only a slender majority. One of the most prominent cautions came from House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer, who signalled on Sunday that federal agents should withdraw from Minneapolis — an intervention that would normally be unheard of from a figure considered one of Trump’s staunchest loyalists. Sixty of the state’s largest businesses, including Target, 3M, UnitedHealth and US Bancorp, have called for an immediate de-escalation of tensions between the state and the Trump administration. Trump claimed that the immigration agents would leave Minneapolis “at some point”. Published in Dawn, January 27th, 2026",

      "summary": "• State, cities of Minneapolis and St Paul ask court to pause operation • Federal judge hears arguments whether the deployment of federal officers violates state’s sovereignty • White House dismisses concerns as Congress Democrats threaten to hold up funding unless ICE reformed MINNEAPOLIS: In a bid to regain control over an escalating crisis sparked by the second killing of a protester against his administration’s militarised immigration raids, US President Donald Trump dispatched his top border official to Minnesota on Monday. Trump said that Tom Homan, his point man for border security, would arrive in the state later and “will report directly to me”. As Minneapolis has become ground zero in the clash between Trump and growing numbers of Americans over his nationwide immigration crackdown, Trump’s deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, described the city on Fox News as a ‘powder keg’. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been transformed under Trump into the United States’ most heavily funded law enforcement body. But polls show growing anger over its frequently brutal tactics. A huge rally took place despite bitter cold in Minneapolis on Friday to protest the raids and the point blank shooting by an ICE agent of protester Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three on Jan 7. Then on Saturday, immigration agents gunned down Alex Jeffrey Pretti, also 37, after having already tackled him to the ground. Like Good, the intensive care unit nurse was a US citizen. More rallies erupted after his death in Minneapolis, New York and other major cities across the United States. Minnesota’s sovereignty On Monday, a federal judge in Minnea­polis was hearing arguments on whether the deployment of federal officers — often masked, heavily armed and unidentified — violates the state of Minnesota’s sovereignty. The judge would consider a request to temporarily stop Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota, following the fatal shooting of a second US citizen over the weekend that sparked a fierce backlash. The state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are asking the court to pause the 3,000-agent operation, calling it a “completely disproportionate” violation of state sovereignty. The Trump administration, in a court filing, called the request an “absurdity” that would make federal law an afterthought. In Congress, Democrats are threatening to hold up funding for the US government unless immigration enforcement agencies are reformed. Trump has so far dismissed concerns. The 79-year-old Republican’s first reaction to Pretti’s killing was to suggest that the nurse had come intending to shoot at the police. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison then accused Trump of pushing a “flat-out insane” narrative. In Monday’s court action, the judge was hearing arguments from state and city lawyers that the federal deployments amount to an occupying force. Also under consideration was a bid to force federal officials to preserve evidence related to Pretti’s killing. The lawsuits highlight the deep rift between local and federal law enforcement over the deployment, dubbed “Operation Metro Surge”. Trump’s immigration raids have focused deliberately on Democratic-run cities, pitting mayors and governors against the president. Local police have repeatedly confronted federal agents and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has even suggested he could call out the state’s National Guard to push back against Trump’s forces.

TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Monday said that the call for a countrywide protest on Feb 8 — the second anniversary of the 2024 general polls —would not be withdrawn under any circumstances. He urged the masses to shut down everything on that day, which falls on a Sunday. Suggesting that the alliance might announce a Jail Bharo Tehreek, he said it would be just the beginning and that more moves would follow. Mr Achakzai was chairing a meeting of the TTAP, attended by alliance’s vice chief Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, former Sindh governor Zubair Umar, Asad Qaiser, Dr Ammar Ali Jan, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Yousufzai and Advocate Khalid Chaudhry. The participants decided that Feb 8 would be observed as a Black Day and that a nationwide strike would be ensured. Ten committees formed They said 10 committees had been formed at international, national and provincial levels to ensure the success of the strike. They termed Feb 8 a day of humiliation for the entire nation, saying people had been deprived of their basic right to elect representatives and rendered powerless. The meeting also expressed concern over the sentences awarded to rights activist, Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, terming them a violation of constitutional rights to freedom of expression and a fair trial. The participants warned of a looming humanitarian crisis in Khyber Agency’s Tirah valley, saying millions could be forced to migrate in harsh weather. They said any deviation from resolutions passed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and decisions of the national jirga would be against provincial autonomy. They further criticised the government’s decision to join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking parliament and the public into confidence, questioning Pakistan’s participation when Palestinians were excluded from the forum. Later, a TTAP delegation led by Mr Achakzai visited the residence of former PTI leader Dr Shireen Mazari to express solidarity with her over the arrest and conviction of her daughter and son-in-law, Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha. JUI-F rally Meanwhile, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has announced that his party would stage a rally in Rawalpindi on Feb 8 to protest against the alleged rigging in the last general elections. According to JUI-F Rawalpindi district spokesperson Hafiz Ziaullah, the party chief will address the public gathering. The party spokesperson said the Feb 8 elections were “tantamount to the killing of the public mandate” and an “insult” to the nation’s vote, and “would not be accepted under any circumstances”. He said the government formed as a result of the 2024 polls would be “rejected through public power”, and the struggle would continue to protect the original principles of democracy. According to the spokesperson, preparations for the rally have been formally started, and instructions have been issued to all tehsils, workers and officials of the Rawalpindi district to ensure full participation. “A large number of people, workers and people belonging to different schools of thought will participate in the rally,” he said. The JUI-F Rawalpindi chapter initially appealed to the public to reach Dera Taji Khokhar on Feb 8 to raise their voices against the “fake” elections and the “illegitimate” government, and to stand with the JUI-F for the restoration of democracy. The spokesperson said under the initial plan, the public gathering would be held at Dera Taji Khokhar near the old airport, but the venue was likely to change. Responding to a question about seeking permission from the district administration, he said a meeting of the JUI-F general council would be held on Jan 31, after which the venue would be decided and an application submitted to the district administration by Feb 1. Hafiz Ziaullah said preparations had already begun and all office-bearers had been informed about the decision to launch a protest against the “rigged” 2024 general elections. He added that tehsil chapters had been asked to form committees for public mobilisation, and the general council would task these committees with bringing the maximum number of people to the meeting. Meanwhile, the district administration has imposed Section 144 in the district since December and extending it on a weekly basis. Under Section 144, public gatherings are not permitted. The current one has been imposed from Jan 23 till Feb 6. A senior district administration official told Dawn that if an application was received from any party, it would be forwarded to the Punjab government after a report from the District Intelligence Committee.

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Four bogies of the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express train coming from Peshawar were derailed in a blast on the railway track linking Sindh to Balochistan on Monday night. Railway officials in Sultankot confirmed that the blast occurred on the railway track between Sultankot and Jacobabad in Sindh. “Four bogies have derailed after a blast that damaged the track,” a senior official of the Pakistan Railway told Dawn , adding no deaths or injuries were reported in the blast. The railway officials added that repair on the track had begun after the area was cleared. They said a relief train had also reached the site to resume railway traffic on the main line. The Jaffar Express has come under attack several times over the past year. Last November, it had escaped an ar­­m­­ed attack in the Bolan Pass area of Kachhi distr­i­­ct, Balochistan. The same month it also escaped a bomb attack in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district. In October 2025, at least seven people were injured after a blast on a railway track derailed four bogies of the Jaf­far Express in Sindh’s Shikarpur district. The same month, it escaped another rocket attack in the Notal area of Nasir­abad district. In September 2025, twelve people, including women and chil­dren, were injured wh­en the Quetta-bound Jaf­far Express was targeted in a bomb blast in the Spizend area of Mas­tung On March 11, 2025, terrorists had hijacked the Peshawar-bound passenger train, carrying 440 passengers. They had opened fire on the train and held the passengers hostage, prompting security forces to initiate an operation that lasted two days.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Roads leading to the Karachi Press Club (KPC) were blocked for hours on Monday as lawyers, human rights activists and civil society members staged a protest against the conviction of Imaan Zainab Hazir-Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatta. The closure of roads slowed down the movement of traffic on several arteries affected by the move, causing inconvenience for commuters. Police barred several protesters, including activist Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Junior, from reaching the press club — a move that KPC President and journalist Fazil Jamili called a violation of the fundamental right to peaceful assembly. “The siege of the Karachi Press Club today is a blatant assault on democratic freedoms. By cordoning off the KPC and barring citizens, including Zulfiqar Bhutto Jr., from protesting the sentencing of Imaan Mazari, authorities are violating the fundamental right to peaceful assembly,” he posted on social media platform X. Lawyer and human rights activist Jibran Nasir posted on social media platform X that “all roads leading to the KPC have been blocked by placing containers and parking buses. The state wants to deny journalists, advocates and civil society the right to protest and expose the sham trial and conviction of Advocates Imaan Mazaari and Hadi Ali Chattha”. Journalist Sameer Mandhro, in a similar post, said “police [have] blocked all routes leading to the Karachi Press Club”. “The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, journalists, lawyers, and civil society activists are protesting against the Peca Act and the sentence awarded to Imaan Mazari,” he added. Meanwhile, Zulfikar Bhutto Junior, the son of late politician Murtaza Bhutto, staged a sit-in at the KPC Roundabout when he was stopped from reaching the press club. Speaking to the media there, he said that police were not even allowing them to protest on the pavements. “We are being deprived of fundamental human rights. I want to participate in the protest, but participation in the protest has become a crime,” he said. On Mazari and Chattha’s sentencing, he said, “They were convicted over just a tweet. My father faced similar treatment by the police.” Activist Sheema Kermani was also among the protesters staging a sit-in at the KPC Roundabout. Meanwhile, roads around Zainab Market and the roundabout near the Arts Council of Pakistan remained blocked. Some of the routes were reopened and the sit-in ended at around 6:45pm when Zulfikar Bhutto Junior and others were allowed to go to the KPC. Later, all blocked routes were opened by around 9pm. As for Zulfikar Bhutto Junior, he again spoke to the media at the KPC, saying that there were no restrictions on protest in a democracy. “Only thieves are happy in this country, and I am talking about those thieves who hold posts and are sitting in Islamabad,” he commented. Imaan and Hadi’s conviction A sessions court sentenced lawyers Mazari and Chattha to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case linked to social media posts on Saturday, sparking outrage among rights groups, opposition parties, and other segments of society. They were sentenced a day after being arrested in Islamabad, which was also denounced by rights bodies, politicians, and journalists, who stressed their right to a fair trial. Amnesty International noted the “lack of adherence to due process” and said these were “retaliatory cases aimed solely at silencing Mazari and Chattha for their human rights work and dissent”. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan also condemned the arrests, terming the case a “tool to harass, intimidate and ultimately muzzle dissent”.",

      "summary_orig": "A US naval strike group led by an aircraft carrier has deployed to Middle Eastern waters, the United States said on Monday, as Tehran warned it was ready to hit back at any American attack launched in response to a crackdown on anti-government protests. The protests started in late December, driven by economic grievances, but turned into a mass movement against the Islamic Republic, with huge street demonstrations for several days from January 8. But rights groups have accused authorities of quelling the movement with unprecedented violence, shooting into crowds of protesters under the cover of an internet shutdown that has now lasted 18 days — the longest Iran has ever imposed. US President Donald Trump has previously threatened to step in, saying last week that Washington was sending a “massive fleet” to the region “just in case”. The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group dramatically boosts American firepower in the region. The United States backed and briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against Iran in June, and while Trump last week appeared to step back from his threats of new military intervention, he has never ruled the option out. The Lincoln’s strike group has arrived in the region, US Central Command said in a post on X, adding the ships were “currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability”. ‘Regret-inducing response’ Iran’s foreign ministry warned on Monday of a “comprehensive and regret-inducing response to any aggression”. Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said Iran was “confident in its own capabilities”. In apparent reference to the Lincoln, he added: “The arrival of such a battleship is not going to affect Iran’s determination and seriousness to defend the Iranian nation.” Meanwhile, a new anti-US billboard has appeared in the central Enghelab Square in Tehran that appears to show an American aircraft carrier being destroyed. “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind,” its English-language caption reads. State news agency IRNA quoted the commander of the Iranian navy Shahram Irani, as saying on Monday: “Iran’s naval power is not merely defensive but also acts as an anchor of stability in the region.” In Lebanon, Hezbollah organised a rally in support of the Islamic Republic featuring an address by its leader, Naim Qassem, who warned, “a war on Iran this time will ignite the region”. Iran’s Gulf neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, which hosts a US airbase, said it would not allow attacks on Iran to be launched from its territory.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: With the festival of Basant drawing closer, the Punjab government on Monday imposed a ban on the manufacturing and use of kites bearing images of any political party’s flag for 30 days. In the notification seen by Dawn , the Punjab Home Department notified the imposition of Section 144 prohibiting the purchase and use of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party in an effort to “avoid any discrimination or disruption of public order”. The department said that it had been reported that to disrupt the festival, miscreants may use images of holy scripture, religious places and flags of countries and political parties. “Only plain, uni-coloured or multi-coloured kites (i.e. gudda or patang ) shall be allowed during kite flying in the district of Lahore from February 6 to 8,” the department said. It asserted that the government had permitted kite flying solely for “recreation and festivity”, while banning “the manufacturing, trade, transport, storage, sale, purchase” of kites bearing pictures, flags and places for 30 days from Monday onwards. Basant is making a comeback after 18 years, with the festival set to be celebrated in Lahore from February 6 to 8. The festival will coincide with a nationwide protest announced by the opposition on Feb 8. Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules 2025 , the Punjab government has prohibited flying kites with metallic wire, nylon cord or strings coated with glass or other sharp materials, along with the manufacturing, transport, storage and sale of kites and hazardous strings. The violators could face three to five years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs2 million, while those manufacturing or selling banned materials may be punished with five to seven years in jail and fines up to Rs5 million. On Friday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had finalised all preparations for the three-day Basant festival, urging people to celebrate it in a safe manner. Announcing strict safety measures, the chief minister said a comprehensive Basant safety plan had been finalised to prevent accidents associated with kite flying. “Lahore has been divided into Red, Yellow and Green zones, and only cotton kite string made of nine threads will be allowed. Nylon and metallic strings are strictly banned, with violators facing up to five-year jail terms and fines up to Rs5 million,” she said and added that illegal kite flying, other than the notified dates, would invite imprisonment and fines, while parents and guardians would be held responsible for underage or illegal kite flying.",

The violators could face three to five years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs2 million, while those manufacturing or selling banned materials may be punished with five to seven years in jail and fines up to Rs5 million. On Friday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had finalised all preparations for the three-day Basant festival, urging people to celebrate it in a safe manner. Announcing strict safety measures, the chief minister said a comprehensive Basant safety plan had been finalised to prevent accidents associated with kite flying. “Lahore has been divided into Red, Yellow and Green zones, and only cotton kite string made of nine threads will be allowed. Nylon and metallic strings are strictly banned, with violators facing up to five-year jail terms and fines up to Rs5 million,” she said and added that illegal kite flying, other than the notified dates, would invite imprisonment and fines, while parents and guardians would be held responsible for underage or illegal kite flying.",

      "summary": "LAHORE: With the festival of Basant drawing closer, the Punjab government on Monday imposed a ban on the manufacturing and use of kites bearing images of any political party’s flag for 30 days. In the notification seen by Dawn , the Punjab Home Department notified the imposition of Section 144 prohibiting the purchase and use of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party in an effort to “avoid any discrimination or disruption of public order”. The department said that it had been reported that to disrupt the festival, miscreants may use images of holy scripture, religious places and flags of countries and political parties. “Only plain, uni-coloured or multi-coloured kites (i.e. gudda or patang ) shall be allowed during kite flying in the district of Lahore from February 6 to 8,” the department said. It asserted that the government had permitted kite flying solely for “recreation and festivity”, while banning “the manufacturing, trade, transport, storage, sale, purchase” of kites bearing pictures, flags and places for 30 days from Monday onwards. Basant is making a comeback after 18 years, with the festival set to be celebrated in Lahore from February 6 to 8.

      "title_orig": "KP CM pens letter to PM Shehbaz over Centre’s ‘persistent failure to release constitutionally guaranteed’ funds",
      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif over what he dubbed the Centre’s “persistent failure” to release “constitutionally guaranteed” funds, demanding the “full and unconditional” release of all outstanding federal dues. Since becoming the provincial chief executive in October last year, Afridi has repeatedly accused the federal government of stalling the release of funds allocated for KP, particularly those committed for the merged districts under the National Finance Commission (NFC). In a fresh call for the release of funds, the KP CM said: “I am compelled to place on record the deep and mounting concern of the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa regarding the persistent failure to release constitutionally guaranteed federal transfers.” This failure, he added, “has now translated into an acute fiscal and governance crisis for the province”. Afridi underscored that KP’s budget for fiscal year 2025-26 was framed and approved “strictly on the basis of clear constitutional entitlements”, including net hydel profit, oil and gas royalties, post-merger NFC shares, and regular monthly releases under the NFC. “These were not discretionary assumptions but binding fiscal obligations,” he emphasised, adding that “contrary to these commitments, actual releases have consistently fallen short of budgeted levels”. Moreover, “of even greater concern is the withholding of routine monthly NFC transfers, a practice that finds no sanction in the Constitution and strikes at the core of cooperative federalism”, he said. The KP CM maintained that his province was entitled to receive Rs658.4 billion under the NFC, but it had received just Rs604bn so far, leading to a shortfall of Rs54.4bn. “This is not an accounting variance; it represents a material breach that has directly impaired cash management, disrupted budget execution, and constrained service delivery across critical sectors of governance,” he asserted. He added, “The impact is most stark in the merged districts, where development, stabilisation, and state consolidation are acknowledged national priorities. Despite a provincial allocation of Rs292bn, federal releases amount to only Rs56bn thus far. “This severe and continuing gap has undermined the provision of essential public services and development interventions in these historically marginalised areas, eroding the objectives of the merger and weakening national cohesion.” The KP CM also highlighted that these fiscal constraints were unfolding at a time when the province remained on the frontline of counter-terrorism, while simultaneously shouldering extraordinary and unavoidable expenditures arising from flood response and rehabilitation, as well as the management and support of temporarily displaced persons. “These are national responsibilities; however, the financial burden continues to be borne disproportionately and unsustainably by the province,” he said. In view of the above, he said, the KP government expected “immediate corrective action by the federal government, including the full and unconditional release of all outstanding federal dues, particularly routine monthly NFC transfers, net hydel profit, oil and gas royalties, and allocations for the merged districts, strictly in accordance with constitutional provisions and agreed fiscal arrangements”. “Any further delay will only compound the province’s fiscal stress and weaken governance capacity at a critical juncture,” he warned, telling the premier that given the seriousness of the matter, it warranted his “urgent and personal attention”.",

A public row had erupted between the two countries over Yemen after UAE-backed separatists seized swathes of land late last year, including areas along the Saudi border, infuriating Riyadh. Last month, the UAE had moved to de-escalate tensions with Saudi Arabia by announcing the immediate withdrawal of its remaining forces from Yemen, after the kingdom carried out airstrikes on the Mukalla port and supported a call for UAE forces to leave within 24 hours.

      "summary_orig": "The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Monday condemned the prison sentences of lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her spouse Hadi Ali Chatta, lamenting that “dictatorship has been imposed in Pakistan”. The remarks came as a TTAP delegation called on Imaan’s mother Shireen Mazari to “express solidarity” with the jailed couple, according to post by the party on X. The video accompanying the post showed TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokar and the PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan included in the delegation. Speaking to the media after the meeting, PTI’s Gohar condemned the couple’s arrest, their trial and how “due process was violated”. “We have always been and will always remain opponents of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca). Voices cannot be suppressed. Nations cannot be suppressed by suppressing voices,” he said, “We condemn this judgment. We met her family and mother. They said that they have no contact with her (Imaan),” Gohar said, drawing a parallel between how PTI founder Imran Khan was also not being allowed to meet his family. Gohar said that such verdicts led to lawlessness, where people turn to “vigilante justice” and take the law into their own hands. “We hope that the chief justice of Pakistan will take action on this case and other related cases in which speech is prohibited and people’s rights are violated,” he said, expressing the hope that justice would prevail. “We demand that their (Imaan and Hadi) cases be fixed [for hearing], their convictions be reversed and their sentences be suspended,” he added. “We are hopeful that the chief justice will act on this,” he said. In his remarks, Khokar said that the TTAP condemned Imaan and Hadi’s arrest and their denial of Constitutional rights, namely the right to a fair trial and freedom of expression. “Without mincing words, today, dictatorship has been imposed in Pakistan,” he asserted. “If anyone believes that Pakistan is a democracy or under a hybrid system, then they must correct themselves,” he said. “The decisions being made by the courts are an effort to make Pakistan like North Korea or Egypt,” he emphasised. “But those who want to make this country like North Korea or Egypt should know that resistance and the struggle for democratic rights define Pakistan’s history,” he said, adding that even dictators eventually lost power. He said that the reality of the system imposed on the people after the February 8, 2024 general elections was now before the people. “The reality is that there are no longer critical voices in the country; that anyone voicing criticism or demanding their rights will be silenced. Such a situation is unacceptable for us,” he stated. Khokhar said the TTAP alliance would stage a protest on February 8, saying that the alliance would do everything in its power for the people of Pakistan. He also expressed the hope that people within the system and the judiciary who had a “conscience” would oppose such acts as this would not cause harm to a single person, but to the whole of Pakistan. Responding to a question, Gohar stated that the PTI had not taken back its Feb 8 protest call nor had it received any call from the government to do so. “Only [Imran] Khan sahib can take back his own call,” he replied. “On Feb 8, we request that everyone close their shops, perform a wheel-jam and record their protest. There are no second thoughts about it.” On Saturday, Imaan and Hadi were sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case linked to social media posts, sparking outrage among rights groups, opposition parties, and other segments of society. The written order by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka stated that the “prosecution has been able to prove its case against both the accused” under sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyberterrorism), 26-A (false and fake information) of Peca. Under Section 9 of Peca, both were sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs5 million each, with an additional year in default. For Section 10, they were each handed 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs30m, with two more years in default. Under Section 26-A, they received two years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs1m each, with six months’ additional jail time in case of non-payment.",

      "summary_orig": "Bundled up in a yellow hat and black puffer jacket, Taylor was one of hundreds of protesters marching after the killing of a second US citizen this month by federal agents carrying out an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. The violence has put new pressure and scrutiny on US President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation campaign, which has drawn demonstrators onto the streets of the Midwestern city. “I think it was completely senseless, it was murder,” said the young woman, who did not want to give her last name. Federal agents shot to death 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti, claiming he intended to harm them during a confrontation on Saturday. However, a video shared widely on social media and verified by US media showed Pretti never drawing a weapon, with agents firing at him seconds after he was sprayed in the face with a chemical irritant and thrown to the ground. “I think the way that the government is bringing ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in to take away our neighbours and to pull families apart is completely inhumane. And if we don’t speak out for them, then other people won’t,” she added during the protest on Sunday. Pretti was killed less than three weeks after another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good, was shot dead by an ICE agent — on a street just over a mile (1.6 kilometres) away. Trump and his officials quickly defended the officer who fired the shots, who has neither been suspended nor charged. ‘This is America’ Coleen Fitzgerald, a 73-year-old retired construction worker, attended the protest wearing a clown costume and multi-colored wig and wig to mock the Trump administration. “We started to have ICE people come up there, and they’re coming into our restaurant,s and they’re going to people’s homes, and they’re taking them,” she told AFP . “We can’t live like this. This is America. We’re supposed to be free, and they’re trying to take that away.” Fitzgerald brandished a homemade sign, “Hire clowns, expect a circus”, against a backdrop of demonstrators chanting “our streets” and “ICE out now”. Thousands of federal immigration agents have been deployed for weeks to Minneapolis, after media reports on alleged fraud by Somali immigrants — which Trump has seized upon. The Democratic-led city has one of the highest concentrations of Somali immigrants in the United States. The area around Pretti’s killing was marked off Sunday by yellow caution tape with police cars parked across the road. At a makeshift memorial near the site of the shooting, demonstrators gathered after the march to lay flowers and candles. Locals wearing hats and coats huddled around a sea of bouquets. Some knelt despite the icy ground, with temperatures falling as low as -4F (-20C). “Stop killing us,” “Enough is enough. ICE out,” and “Alex should be here” were among the slogans written on signs posted around the site.",

We’re supposed to be free, and they’re trying to take that away.” Fitzgerald brandished a homemade sign, “Hire clowns, expect a circus”, against a backdrop of demonstrators chanting “our streets” and “ICE out now”. Thousands of federal immigration agents have been deployed for weeks to Minneapolis, after media reports on alleged fraud by Somali immigrants — which Trump has seized upon. The Democratic-led city has one of the highest concentrations of Somali immigrants in the United States. The area around Pretti’s killing was marked off Sunday by yellow caution tape with police cars parked across the road. At a makeshift memorial near the site of the shooting, demonstrators gathered after the march to lay flowers and candles. Locals wearing hats and coats huddled around a sea of bouquets. Some knelt despite the icy ground, with temperatures falling as low as -4F (-20C). “Stop killing us,” “Enough is enough. ICE out,” and “Alex should be here” were among the slogans written on signs posted around the site.",

      "summary": "Bundled up in a yellow hat and black puffer jacket, Taylor was one of hundreds of protesters marching after the killing of a second US citizen this month by federal agents carrying out an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. The violence has put new pressure and scrutiny on US President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation campaign, which has drawn demonstrators onto the streets of the Midwestern city. “I think it was completely senseless, it was murder,” said the young woman, who did not want to give her last name. Federal agents shot to death 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti, claiming he intended to harm them during a confrontation on Saturday. However, a video shared widely on social media and verified by US media showed Pretti never drawing a weapon, with agents firing at him seconds after he was sprayed in the face with a chemical irritant and thrown to the ground. “I think the way that the government is bringing ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in to take away our neighbours and to pull families apart is completely inhumane. And if we don’t speak out for them, then other people won’t,” she added during the protest on Sunday. Pretti was killed less than three weeks after another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good, was shot dead by an ICE agent — on a street just over a mile (1.6 kilometres) away. Trump and his officials quickly defended the officer who fired the shots, who has neither been suspended nor charged. ‘This is America’ Coleen Fitzgerald, a 73-year-old retired construction worker, attended the protest wearing a clown costume and multi-colored wig and wig to mock the Trump administration. “We started to have ICE people come up there, and they’re coming into our restaurant,s and they’re going to people’s homes, and they’re taking them,” she told AFP . “We can’t live like this.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Lawyers staged a protest on Monday at the main gate of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the arrest and sentencing of lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, in the controversial social media posts case. The protest was led by IHC Bar President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani. Senior lawyer Babar Awan and a large number of advocates from the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC), High Court Bar and District Bar also participated in the protest. They carried banners reading “Justice for Lawyers” and raised slogans against the police. Addressing the gathering, Awan said that “state and police terrorism” was being carried out against lawyers, adding that such actions were harmful for society. Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA), IBC and Islamabad District Bar jointly announced a strike. However, lawyers appeared in the high court only in urgent matters. Due to the protest, strict security arrangements were made in and around the IHC, with a heavy police contingent deployed and armoured vehicles stationed outside the court premises. The issue of the strike also came up during the hearing of a civil case before Chief Justice Sarfaraz Dogar. Advocate Qaiser Abbas Gondal informed the court that the bar had called for a strike due to the arrest of lawyers. When the chief justice asked which lawyers had been arrested, Gondal replied that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha had been taken into custody. The chief justice then asked whether they were considered lawyers. No reply was given. CJ Dogar observed that if the bar considered them lawyers, their representatives could convey their position in chambers. Due to the lawyers’ strike, proceedings in several cases were affected. In a separate statement, IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Jajja said lawyers were requested not to appear in court as part of the strike. He announced that lawyers would proceed to the district courts in a convoy and later gather again to record their protest. On Saturday, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka sentenced Imaan and Hadi to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in the case. The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad. The NCCIA complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.",
