      "summary_orig": "Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir said on Thursday that Pakistan seeks peace with all neighbours, including Afghanistan, but reiterated that the country will not allow cross-border terrorism to be perpetrated from Afghan soil. According to a statement from the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Field Marshal Munir made the comments during a trip to Peshawar, where he held an interactive session with a jirga of tribal elders. Later on, he was given a comprehensive briefing at Headquarters 11 Corps on the prevailing security environment, operational preparedness and ongoing counter terrorism efforts to maintain peace and stability along the Pak-Afghan border. Pakistan-Afghanistan relations have worsened sharply in recent weeks, marked by border clashes and mutual accusations . Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul against permitting the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to use Afghan territory for attacks — an allegation the Taliban reject. After a ceasefire, both sides initiated talks in Turkiye to develop a mechanism for monitoring Taliban measures to curb cross-border assaults, but discussions have so far reached a stalemate. While addressing the jirga, Field Marshal Munir “highlighted that despite the continuation of cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan, Pakistan, over the last few years has exercised patience and extended multiple diplomatic and economic overtures to Afghanistan, aimed at improving Pak-Afghan bilateral relations.” “However, instead of acting decisively against Indian-sponsored terror proxies Fitna Al Khwarij and Fitna Al Hindustan , [the] Afghan Taliban regime has been providing all possible assistance to these groups,” the statement said. It added that during the interaction, the COAS assured the tribal elders that Pakistan, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, will be “cleansed of the terrorists and their abettors.” The army chief also appreciated the “steadfast and unconditional support” rendered by the tribal people to the security forces during the recent standoff between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban. “He paid rich tribute to the resilience and sacrifices of the brave people of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa in [the] war against terrorism,” the statement said, adding that the tribal elders reiterated their “full support to the armed forces against terrorism and also against the Afghan Taliban.” Per the statement, the tribal elders appreciated the candid discourse by the COAS and expressed their unwavering commitment to peace in Pakistan and highlighted that the “twisted ideology” of the Fitna al Khwarij had no acceptance among the tribes of KP.

      "summary_orig": "Police on Thursday arrested two men who allegedly mutilated a cow that entered his field in the village of Mohaal in Punjab’s Jhelum district, according to a senior officer. A first information report (FIR) — seen by Dawn.com — was filed against two landowners who allegedly attacked and mutilated a cow that crossed onto their land under Section 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc, of any value or any animal of the value of fifty rupees) of the Pakistan Penal Code. The complainant, who is the owner of the cow, alleged that the suspects struck its front leg with an axe, severely injuring it. They fled the scene while threatening the complainant. Jhelum District Police Officer Tariq Aziz Sindhu told Dawn.com that both suspects had been arrested, one of whom was apprehended from a forested area near the scene of the incident. “Police have registered a case under Section 429 of the PPC and investigations are underway,” the DPO said “Cruelty against animals is intolerable and after proper investigation, those found guilty will be presented before the court of law,” the DPO added. The FIR read that the cow had been shifted to a veterinary hospital in Chak Aka for treatment. Animal cruelty is not a new phenomenon in Pakistan. On Sunday, a landlord and his son were charged with animal cruelty after they tortured a buffalo and tried to cut off its legs for entering their home in Minchinabad, in Bahawalnagar. Police said that a farmer from Munshi Hathar owned some cattle and one of them accidentally entered the house of a landlord while grazing on October 18. The landlord allegedly trapped the animal and, along with his son, tried to cut off its legs with axes and stabbed it repeatedly. They allegedly left the buffalo on the road in a critically injured state. After video footage of the incident went viral on social media, police took action and arrested the main suspect. In September, a female camel, allegedly tortured by a landowner in Sukkur, was handed over to a private animal shelter in Karachi. According to an FIR, the complainant alleged that when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond on the land, one of the suspects hit one of them with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor, causing severe injuries. Last year, a magistrate in Sanghar remanded six suspects into police custody in connection with the mutilation of a camel that saw the animal’s right leg chopped off in Mund Jamrao village. The incident took place when a landlord allegedly chopped off the camel’s leg as punishment for foraging into his field for fodder. In July this year, that camel stood up for the first time since the incident with the help of a prosthetic leg .",

      "summary_orig": "PTI-backed independent candidate Khurram Zeeshan on Thursday was elected as a senator on the general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz, who was the opposition leader in the Senate, after he was convicted in cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots. A minimum of 75 votes were needed to win the seat. Zeeshan won a total of 91 votes out of the 137 cast by KP lawmakers during the polling process today. He defeated opposition-backed Taj Mohammad Afridi, who was able to secure 45 votes. Out of the 145-member KP Assembly, eight lawmakers did not cast their ballots, including four Awami National Party (ANP) leaders. One vote was rejected. “Thank God,” Zeeshan said in a post on his Facebook account after his win. “Our priority is Pakistan’s haqeeqi azadi (true freedom)”, the PTI leader told reporters outside the KP Assembly earlier today, echoing a phrase used by Imran. Though three candidates were in the run for the polls, the main contest was expected to be between Zeeshan and Afridi. Irfan Saleem, another PTI-backed candidate on the electoral roll, was the covering candidate for Zeeshan. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also took part in the voting process, with a post on his X account voicing support for Zeeshan. The polling began at 9:30am and concluded at 4pm, with provincial election commissioner Saeed Gul as the returning officer (RO). KP CM Sohail Afridi, a PTI MPA, casts his vote for Senate by-polls at KP Assembly on Oct 30, 2025. — via author JUI-F’s Gurpal Singh casts his vote for Senate by-polls at KP Assembly on Oct 30, 2025. — via author PPP’s MPA Ehsanullah Khan casts his vote for Senate by-polls at KP Assembly on Oct 30, 2025. — via author Zeeshan and Saleem had also been nominated by the PTI to contest the Senate elections in 2024, but the polls for seats from KP were postponed and later held in July this year. Afridi, who hails from the Khyber tribal district, was in 2020 reported to be the richest senator with his assets declared for the previous year amounting to Rs1.22 billion. Two other candidates — independent Abid Khan Yousafzai and PPP’s Nisar Khan — withdrew their candidature. Yesterday, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had dismissed the request of Faraz’s lawyer to stay today’s by-polls. Faraz had challenged his disqualification and subsequent de-notification as a senator before the Peshawar High Court (PHC). However, the PHC earlier this month denied him and two MNAs any relief, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats, and instead ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court. CM Afridi to announce ‘brief’ KP cabinet today Separately, CM Afridi said he would announce a “brief” provincial cabinet once the Senate elections had concluded. This comes two days after PTI founder Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “ complete authority ” to form the provincial cabinet after he was once again denied a meeting with the incarcerated ex-premier. Opposition MPAs in the KP Assembly have criticised the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province. Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, the chief minister said PTI came to power in the province for the third time because of its “good governance”. Afridi said he was listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today. He added that if barred again from meeting his party founder, he would file a contempt of court case against the Adiala jail administration for not implementing the Islamabad High Court’s directives . During his media talk, the chief minister termed the KP government the “main stakeholder” in the recent counterterrorism talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan. CM Afridi said the government and people of KP were not taken into confidence for “any decisions or talks”. While welcoming the Pak-Afghan discussions, he said his government had “some reservations”. The chief minister said Pakistan should take decisions while considering its interests. However, he added that the security decisions of KP, which has “sacrificed more than 80,000 lives in the war against terrorism”, should not be taken behind closed doors. CM Afridi said, “One person comes with his formula and turns them (militants) into Mujahideens and heroes. Another person comes and carries out operations. A third person comes and thinks about rehabilitating them. Then a fourth person again thinks to conduct operations.” “This is not a laboratory; this is our province,” he quipped, calling for a clear policy and questioning why terrorism had not been eradicated despite thousands of intelligence-based operations. The chief minister further said legal action should be taken against those responsible for “collateral damage in drone attacks”. He added that an in-house committee of all parliamentary leaders yesterday discussed various topics, including the introduction of laws related to the matter.\n۔",

      "summary_orig": "Hurricane Melissa smashed through the northern Caribbean and was seen picking up speed as it churned across open ocean towards Bermuda on Thursday, leaving a trail of high winds and destruction from Jamaica to Cuba and Haiti in its wake. People across the Bahamas and nearby Turks and Caicos hunkered down as the passing storm pummelled them with dangerous gusts and rain. Around 600 miles (970 km) northeast of the storm’s last position, Bermudans prepared for its approach, expected by the evening. Authorities across the region, struggling to keep track of the devastation, confirmed 25 deaths in Haiti - 10 of them children - and four in Jamaica.\nAs of 1200 GMT (5pm PKT) Melissa was packing winds of close to 105 miles per hour (165 kph), according to the US National Hurricane Centre, downgraded from its peak to a Category 2 hurricane. Wading barefoot through mud It was expected to keep accelerating northeastward and “pass to the northwest of Bermuda” later on Thursday, before likely weakening on Friday, the Florida-based forecaster said. Bermuda will close its causeway on Thursday night and all schools and ferries on Friday, among other measures, “out of an abundance of caution,” National Security Minister Michael Weeks said in a statement. “I implore all residents to remain vigilant while we navigate another natural threat to our way of life,” he said. People should check on their neighbours and stay off roads until further notice, he added. Melissa struck Jamaica on Tuesday as the strongest-ever hurricane to directly hit its shores, with sustained winds of 185 mph, far above the minimum strength for a Category 5, the strongest classification for hurricanes. In a neighbourhood of the island’s Montego Bay, 77-year-old Alfred Hines waded barefoot through thick mud and debris as he described his narrow escape from the rising floodwaters. At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape,” he told Reuters on Wednesday. “I just want to forget it, and things come back to normal.” The capital Kingston, was spared the worst damage, and its main airport was set to reopen on Thursday. But US forecaster AccuWeather estimated Melissa could cost $22 billion in damages and economic loss, and that rebuilding could take a decade or more. “DEVASTATION,” read the front page headline on Thursday’s Jamaica Observer newspaper. Evacuations and floods Melissa was the Caribbean’s third-most intense recorded hurricane, as well as its slowest-moving, which made it particularly destructive, AccuWeather said.\nAcross the Bahamas archipelago, the government flew out nearly 1,500 people as the storm approached, in what it called one of its largest evacuation operations. High winds shook palm trees and whipped up waves at a resort near George Town, video showed on Wednesday. The storm did not directly hit Haiti, the Caribbean’s most populous nation, but lashed it with days of rain. Authorities reported at least 25 deaths, largely due to floods in Petit-Goave, a coastal town 64 km west of the capital, where a river burst its banks. At least 10 children were killed and 12 people are missing there, Haiti’s disaster management agency said, adding that more than 1,000 homes have been flooded nationwide and nearly 12,000 people moved into emergency shelters. In Cuba, at least 241 communities remained isolated and without communications on Wednesday following the storm’s passage across Santiago province, according to preliminary media reports, affecting as many as 140,000 residents. Across eastern Cuba, authorities evacuated around 735,000 people as the storm approached. Scientists say hurricanes are intensifying faster with greater frequency as a result of warming ocean waters caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Many Caribbean leaders have called on wealthy, heavy-polluting nations to provide reparations in the form of aid or debt relief.",

At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape,” he told Reuters on Wednesday. “I just want to forget it, and things come back to normal.” The capital Kingston, was spared the worst damage, and its main airport was set to reopen on Thursday. But US forecaster AccuWeather estimated Melissa could cost $22 billion in damages and economic loss, and that rebuilding could take a decade or more. “DEVASTATION,” read the front page headline on Thursday’s Jamaica Observer newspaper.

High winds shook palm trees and whipped up waves at a resort near George Town, video showed on Wednesday. The storm did not directly hit Haiti, the Caribbean’s most populous nation, but lashed it with days of rain. Authorities reported at least 25 deaths, largely due to floods in Petit-Goave, a coastal town 64 km west of the capital, where a river burst its banks. At least 10 children were killed and 12 people are missing there, Haiti’s disaster management agency said, adding that more than 1,000 homes have been flooded nationwide and nearly 12,000 people moved into emergency shelters. In Cuba, at least 241 communities remained isolated and without communications on Wednesday following the storm’s passage across Santiago province, according to preliminary media reports, affecting as many as 140,000 residents. Across eastern Cuba, authorities evacuated around 735,000 people as the storm approached. Scientists say hurricanes are intensifying faster with greater frequency as a result of warming ocean waters caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Many Caribbean leaders have called on wealthy, heavy-polluting nations to provide reparations in the form of aid or debt relief.",

      "summary": "Hurricane Melissa smashed through the northern Caribbean and was seen picking up speed as it churned across open ocean towards Bermuda on Thursday, leaving a trail of high winds and destruction from Jamaica to Cuba and Haiti in its wake. People across the Bahamas and nearby Turks and Caicos hunkered down as the passing storm pummelled them with dangerous gusts and rain. Around 600 miles (970 km) northeast of the storm’s last position, Bermudans prepared for its approach, expected by the evening. Authorities across the region, struggling to keep track of the devastation, confirmed 25 deaths in Haiti - 10 of them children - and four in Jamaica.\nAs of 1200 GMT (5pm PKT) Melissa was packing winds of close to 105 miles per hour (165 kph), according to the US National Hurricane Centre, downgraded from its peak to a Category 2 hurricane. Wading barefoot through mud It was expected to keep accelerating northeastward and “pass to the northwest of Bermuda” later on Thursday, before likely weakening on Friday, the Florida-based forecaster said. Bermuda will close its causeway on Thursday night and all schools and ferries on Friday, among other measures, “out of an abundance of caution,” National Security Minister Michael Weeks said in a statement. “I implore all residents to remain vigilant while we navigate another natural threat to our way of life,” he said. People should check on their neighbours and stay off roads until further notice, he added.

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump ordered the US military on Thursday to immediately resume testing nuclear weapons after a gap of 33 years, minutes before beginning a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump made the surprise announcement on Truth Social while he was aboard his Marine One helicopter flying to meet Xi for a trade negotiating session in Busan, South Korea. He said he was instructing the Pentagon to test the US nuclear arsenal on an “equal basis” with other nuclear powers. “Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump wrote in a social media post. “Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.” The move comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday that Moscow had successfully tested a nuclear-capable underwater drone, in defiance of Washington’s warnings. A senior Russian lawmaker said Trump’s decision would herald a new era of unpredictability and open confrontation, state news agency RIA reported. China’s foreign ministry called for the US to abide by its commitment to a moratorium on nuclear testing and uphold the global strategic balance and stability. It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to nuclear-explosive testing, which would be carried out by the National Nuclear Security Administration, or flight testing of nuclear-capable missiles. No nuclear power, other than North Korea, has carried out explosive testing in more than 25 years. Russia insists weapons tests ‘not nuclear’ Moscow sought to cool rising nuclear tensions with Washington after the two weapons tests, stating that its testing of nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable weapons did not constitute a direct test of an atomic weapon. “Regarding the tests of Poseidon and Burevestnik, we hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists, including AFP , during a daily briefing. “This cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,” he added. The Kremlin implied that it would also test nuclear warheads if Trump ordered a live test of an atomic weapon. “If someone departs from the moratorium [on nuclear weapon testing], Russia will act accordingly,” Peskov said. Nuclear testing sites to be determined later Later, on his way back to Washington, Trump said testing was needed to ensure the US keeps up with its rival nuclear powers. “With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said on board Air Force One, adding that nuclear test sites would be determined later. Asked whether the world was entering a more risky phase around nuclear weapons, Trump dismissed the threat, saying US stocks were “well locked up” before adding he would welcome denuclearisation. “I’d like to see a denuclearisation because we have so many and Russia’s second and China’s third and China will catch up within four or five years,” he said. “We are actually talking to Russia about that and China would be added to that if we do something.” China more than doubled nuclear arsenal in last 5 years Trump’s decision to restart nuclear weapons testing follows a rapid expansion by China of its nuclear stockpile in recent years. It also comes just after Russia announced a “successful“ test of a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable cruise missile as well as a nuclear-powered torpedo, which military analysts say is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells. Trump addressed the Russian moves on his way to Asia earlier this week, telling reporters that Putin should be working to end the war in Ukraine “instead of testing missiles“. Beijing has more than doubled the size of its arsenal to an estimated 600 nuclear weapons in 2025 from 300 weapons in 2020, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank. It said US military officials estimate that China will have more than 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030. A Victory Day parade in September revealed five nuclear capabilities that can all reach the continental United States, CSIS said. The Washington-based Arms Control Association (ACA) says the US has a stockpile of 5,225 nuclear warheads and Russia has 5,580. As Trump has toughened both his rhetoric and his stance on Russia, Putin has publicly flexed his nuclear muscles with the test of a new Burevestnik cruise missile on October 21 and nuclear launch drills on October 22. ‘Will blow apart nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty’ The reaction to Trump’s announcement on testing was swift. Representative Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said on X: “I’ll be introducing legislation to put a stop to this.” ACA Director Daryl Kimball said it would take the US at least 36 months to resume contained nuclear tests underground at the former test site in Nevada. “Trump is misinformed and out of touch. The US has no technical, military, or political reason to resume nuclear explosive testing for the first time since 1992,” Kimball said on X. Trump’s announcement could “trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by US adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty”. Apart from providing technical data, a US test would be seen in Russia and China as a deliberate assertion of Washington’s strategic power. Putin has repeatedly said that Russia will test if the US does. In August , Trump said he had discussed nuclear arms control with Putin and wanted China to get involved. Beijing responded by saying it was “unreasonable and unrealistic” to ask the country to join in nuclear disarmament negotiations with the two countries, since its arsenal was much smaller. Trump had first laid out his intention to pursue nuclear arms control efforts in February, saying he wanted to begin discussions with both Putin and Xi about imposing limits on their arsenals. Most major nuclear powers, except North Korea, stopped explosive nuclear testing in the 1990s. North Korea conducted its last nuclear test in 2017 . Russia’s last confirmed test was in 1990, followed by the last US test in 1992, and by China’s in 1996. The US opened the nuclear era in July 1945 with the test of a 20-kiloton atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico, and then dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 to force Japan to surrender in World War Two.",

      "summary_orig": "Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani blamed a “Palestinian party” for a ceasefire violation, referring to the reported killing of an Israeli soldier in southern Gaza’s Rafah on Tuesday. Speaking at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York yesterday, the PM told interviewer Ayman Mohyeldin that the attack on the Israeli soldiers was “basically a violation by the Palestinian party”, pointing out that while Hamas has put out a statement that they are not in communication with this group, there is no “verification if this is true or not”. It is important to note, however, that following the attack on the soldier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered “powerful” retaliatory strikes on Gaza. The attacks killed 104 people, mostly women and children, Al Jazeera reported, citing Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel claimed its strikes targeted senior Hamas fighters, killing dozens, and then said it would start observing the ceasefire again mid-Wednesday. “We’ve been engaging in a very intensive way with both parties in order to ensure that the ceasefire holds,” Qatar’s PM stated. “The US engagement, of course, was key in that. And I believe that what happened yesterday [Tuesday] was a violation.” He pointed out that there had been discussions about Hamas trying to “delay the transfer of bodies”. “We made it very clear for them that this is part of the commitment that we needed to be fulfilled,” he added. “From our perspective, since the start of this, since October 7 until today, if you look throughout the process, we went through a lot of challenges, a lot of obstacles, and it wasn’t an easy road,” he said. “We tried our best to navigate and to make sure that we achieved the first [ceasefire], the second one, and now the ceasefire that hopefully will last,” the PM added. Referring to the incident as “very disappointing and frustrating”, Al-Thani said they are trying to contain it. “We mobilised right away after this and in full coordination with the United States. And we have seen that the US is also committed to the deal.”",

Referring to the incident as “very disappointing and frustrating”, Al-Thani said they are trying to contain it. “We mobilised right away after this and in full coordination with the United States. And we have seen that the US is also committed to the deal.”",

      "summary": "Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani blamed a “Palestinian party” for a ceasefire violation, referring to the reported killing of an Israeli soldier in southern Gaza’s Rafah on Tuesday. Speaking at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York yesterday, the PM told interviewer Ayman Mohyeldin that the attack on the Israeli soldiers was “basically a violation by the Palestinian party”, pointing out that while Hamas has put out a statement that they are not in communication with this group, there is no “verification if this is true or not”. It is important to note, however, that following the attack on the soldier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered “powerful” retaliatory strikes on Gaza. The attacks killed 104 people, mostly women and children, Al Jazeera reported, citing Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel claimed its strikes targeted senior Hamas fighters, killing dozens, and then said it would start observing the ceasefire again mid-Wednesday. “We’ve been engaging in a very intensive way with both parties in order to ensure that the ceasefire holds,” Qatar’s PM stated. “The US engagement, of course, was key in that.

      "summary_orig": "Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday said that India remains committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan, amid Kabul’s heightened tensions with Pakistan. Pakistan-Afghanistan ties have deteriorated sharply in recent weeks amid border clashes and mutual accusations . Islamabad has long been warning Kabul against allowing the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to operate from Afghan soil — a claim the Taliban deny. Following a ceasefire, talks in Turkiye began to establish a mechanism to monitor Taliban efforts to curb cross-border attacks, but have so far resulted in an impasse. At a press briefing, the spokesperson received questions asking why Pakistan was blaming Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij for terrorist attacks on its soil and  Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s remarks about Kabul fighting a proxy war on behalf of Delhi. “In my last briefing, I had elaborated our point of view; our thoughts on this particular matter. Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its territories,” Jaiswal replied. “Pakistan seems to think it has the right to practice cross-border terrorism with impunity. Its neighbours find it unacceptable. “India remains committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,” Jaiswal said. In response to a question about Indian projects in Afghanistan, Jaiswal referred to Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s recent visit to India and the joint statement issued afterwards. “As part of the visit, we had issued a joint statement between both countries,” the spokesperson said. “This joint statement clearly emphasises that India stands ready to support all efforts of Afghanistan that are directed towards the sustainable management of water resources, including hydroelectric projects.” Border skirmishes and failed talks Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.",

      "title_orig": "What the US resumption of nuclear testing could mean for the rest of the world",
      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he had instructed the Department of Defence to immediately resume the testing of nuclear weapons on an “equal basis” with other nuclear powers, in a move that could potentially destabilise the nuclear treaty under which countries have been constrained for decades. The move has raised concerns about the threat of nuclear power being wielded by multiple countries, including the risk of the collapse of the nuclear disarmament treaty that keeps this power under strict control. Why is the US resuming nuclear testing? Trump posted on the social media platform Truth Social early this morning the news of the announcement, saying that the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country as a result of his first term in office. “Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but I had no choice!” he said, adding, “Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.” The Associated Press (AP) reports, contrastingly, that Russia is believed to have 5,580 nuclear warheads according to the Washington-based Arms Control Association, while the US has 5,225. The two countries account for nearly 90 per cent of the world’s atomic warheads. In his post, the president attributed the decision to other countries’ testing programmes, saying he had ordered the resumption of testing “on an equal basis” to these countries. He was possibly alluding to the successful test of the Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo by Russia as announced by its president Vladimir Putin yesterday. There are a few confirmed details about the Poseidon, but Reuters has called it a “nuclear-capable cross between a torpedo and a drone”. Military analysts have said this torpedo is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells, while arms control experts say it breaks most of the traditional nuclear deterrence and classification rules. The US also has a nuclear weapons rivalry with China, which AP reports is building more ground-based nuclear missile siloes. In particular, under President Xi Jinping, NYT says that China has been rapidly building up its nuclear arsenal after decades of maintaining a comparatively modest force. After the earlier remarks, Trump had met Xi today on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and struck a deal to reduce his harsh tariffs on China, in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases; analysts now express concern about the consequences of ratcheting up nuclear competition between the countries. According to NYT , “Trump’s combative words alone could reinforce wariness in Beijing about US nuclear intentions. Nuclear weapons are one area where distrust between China and the United States has deepened, with little prospect for quick agreement.” However, NYT added that when asked later about his remarks on nuclear weapons testing, Trump suggested that they were not related to China. “It had to do with others,” he said, without naming any countries. “They seem to all be nuclear testing.” Nuclear treaty under stress The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty has been signed by 187 states and is one of the most widely supported disarmament treaties in the world, according to The Conversation . Although the US has yet to ratify the treaty, it is legally bound not to violate its spirit and purpose as a signatory for decades. According to Business Insider , the US last conducted a nuclear weapons test in 1992, when Congress pushed to halt such experiments after the Cold War’s conclusion. Former US President George H.W. Bush signed the moratorium on tests in October of the same year. Under the treaty, both the US and Russia have agreed to keep their deployed warheads to a maximum of 1,550. However, China’s rapid buildup of weapons has led to the fear from Washington that China will soon reach the same number of nuclear weapons, turning two-way negotiations into a three-cornered struggle. The New York Times reports that moves toward renewed explosive tests of nuclear warheads could “further endanger the treaty that for decades has constrained all but a handful of countries from carrying them out”. A new arms race AP reports that, if the US restarted nuclear weapons testing, it isn’t immediately clear what the goal would be. Nonproliferation experts have warned that any scientific objective likely would be eclipsed by backlash. They also point out the possibility that the decision will serve as a “starting gun” for other major nuclear powers to begin their own widespread testing. If the United States follows through with resuming nuclear testing, “it would effectively give, I think, China and Russia a carte blanche to resume full-yield nuclear testing, which is something that neither country has done in a number of years,” said Ankit Panda, author of The New Nuclear Age and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, according to NYT . Panda added that the nuclear nonproliferation regime was “under tremendous stress”, saying, “Russia, China, the United States can’t even agree on the basic principles of what really makes the nonproliferation regime tick.” Meanwhile, Business Insider reports that some advisors have urged the US to pursue more aggressive nuclear policies and introduce additional modern methods of nuclear attack as a show of strength. As a result, concerns have been growing among nuclear analysts in Washington that the world is on the cusp of a new arms race.

According to NYT , “Trump’s combative words alone could reinforce wariness in Beijing about US nuclear intentions. Nuclear weapons are one area where distrust between China and the United States has deepened, with little prospect for quick agreement.” However, NYT added that when asked later about his remarks on nuclear weapons testing, Trump suggested that they were not related to China. “It had to do with others,” he said, without naming any countries. “They seem to all be nuclear testing.” Nuclear treaty under stress The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty has been signed by 187 states and is one of the most widely supported disarmament treaties in the world, according to The Conversation . Although the US has yet to ratify the treaty, it is legally bound not to violate its spirit and purpose as a signatory for decades. According to Business Insider , the US last conducted a nuclear weapons test in 1992, when Congress pushed to halt such experiments after the Cold War’s conclusion. Former US President George H.W. Bush signed the moratorium on tests in October of the same year. Under the treaty, both the US and Russia have agreed to keep their deployed warheads to a maximum of 1,550. However, China’s rapid buildup of weapons has led to the fear from Washington that China will soon reach the same number of nuclear weapons, turning two-way negotiations into a three-cornered struggle. The New York Times reports that moves toward renewed explosive tests of nuclear warheads could “further endanger the treaty that for decades has constrained all but a handful of countries from carrying them out”.

Panda added that the nuclear nonproliferation regime was “under tremendous stress”, saying, “Russia, China, the United States can’t even agree on the basic principles of what really makes the nonproliferation regime tick.” Meanwhile, Business Insider reports that some advisors have urged the US to pursue more aggressive nuclear policies and introduce additional modern methods of nuclear attack as a show of strength. As a result, concerns have been growing among nuclear analysts in Washington that the world is on the cusp of a new arms race.

      "title": "What the US resumption of nuclear testing could mean for the rest of the world",
      "summary": "United States President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he had instructed the Department of Defence to immediately resume the testing of nuclear weapons on an “equal basis” with other nuclear powers, in a move that could potentially destabilise the nuclear treaty under which countries have been constrained for decades. The move has raised concerns about the threat of nuclear power being wielded by multiple countries, including the risk of the collapse of the nuclear disarmament treaty that keeps this power under strict control. Why is the US resuming nuclear testing? Trump posted on the social media platform Truth Social early this morning the news of the announcement, saying that the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country as a result of his first term in office. “Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but I had no choice!” he said, adding, “Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.” The Associated Press (AP) reports, contrastingly, that Russia is believed to have 5,580 nuclear warheads according to the Washington-based Arms Control Association, while the US has 5,225. The two countries account for nearly 90 per cent of the world’s atomic warheads. In his post, the president attributed the decision to other countries’ testing programmes, saying he had ordered the resumption of testing “on an equal basis” to these countries. He was possibly alluding to the successful test of the Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo by Russia as announced by its president Vladimir Putin yesterday. There are a few confirmed details about the Poseidon, but Reuters has called it a “nuclear-capable cross between a torpedo and a drone”. Military analysts have said this torpedo is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells, while arms control experts say it breaks most of the traditional nuclear deterrence and classification rules. The US also has a nuclear weapons rivalry with China, which AP reports is building more ground-based nuclear missile siloes.

      "summary_orig": "The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday that a “high-value target” identified as a commander of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was among four terrorists killed after security forces thwarted an attempt to infiltrate the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that last night the movement of a group of khwarij attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was picked up by security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district. “Own troops effectively engaged and thwarted khwarijs ’ attempt to infiltrate. As a result of precise and skilful engagement, four khwarij , including kharji leader, a high-value target kharji Amjad alias Mazahim, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said. The statement further said that the militant leader was the deputy of TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and the head of Rehbari Shura of Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP. The ISPR said the militant leader was wanted by law enforcement agencies and the government had allocated a bounty of Rs5 million on him as he remained “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan”. “It is pertinent to highlight that the leadership of Fitna al Khawarij , while residing in Afghanistan, is orchestrating infiltration attempts into Pakistan — primarily to project an impression of domestic presence and to raise the diminishing morale of their khwarij in Bajaur and Mohmand because of effective operations of security forces,” the ISPR said. “It is once again reiterated that the interim Afghan government must take concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by kharji proxies to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan,” the ISPR said. “It also validates our stance that Afghan soil is continuously being used as [a] safe [haven] by khwarij belonging to Fitna al Khwarij against Pakistan,” it said. President Asif Ali Zardari lauded security forces for foiling the infiltration by India-backed Fitna al-Khwarij in Bajaur. In a post on social media platform X, he praised the troops’ courage and reaffirmed that the nation stands united under Azm-i-Istehkam to eliminate all terrorist elements. 18 terrorists killed in 2 separate operations in Balochistan Earlier in the day, the ISPR said that 18 terrorists were killed in two separate operations in Balochistan. In a statement, the ISPR said that the militants belonged to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan . The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR stated that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in the Chiltan mountain range in Quetta district on the reported presence of terrorists. “During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said. The ISPR further stated that another IBO was conducted in Buleda in Kech district, where a hideout was busted and four militants were “successfully neutralised”. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” the ISPR said. It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area, adding that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country. President Zardari, in a statement posted on X, paid tribute to security forces for eliminating 18 militants. He said that the operation was a reflection of security forces’ determination to eradicate terrorism. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also said the entire nation stood with the country’s security forces in the fight against terrorism. In a statement, he also reiterated the firm commitment to eradicating terrorism in all its forms from the country, Radio Pakistan reported. In a post on X, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to security forces for thwarting the infiltration attempt. “The nation takes pride in the skill and bravery of the security forces,” Naqvi said, vowing to “stand side by side” with them. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. A day earlier, at least six Pakistan Army soldiers, including a captain, were martyred , while seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Dogar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district. According to the military, seven terrorists were also killed in the operation.",

The ISPR said the militant leader was wanted by law enforcement agencies and the government had allocated a bounty of Rs5 million on him as he remained “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan”. “It is pertinent to highlight that the leadership of Fitna al Khawarij , while residing in Afghanistan, is orchestrating infiltration attempts into Pakistan — primarily to project an impression of domestic presence and to raise the diminishing morale of their khwarij in Bajaur and Mohmand because of effective operations of security forces,” the ISPR said. “It is once again reiterated that the interim Afghan government must take concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by kharji proxies to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan,” the ISPR said. “It also validates our stance that Afghan soil is continuously being used as [a] safe [haven] by khwarij belonging to Fitna al Khwarij against Pakistan,” it said. President Asif Ali Zardari lauded security forces for foiling the infiltration by India-backed Fitna al-Khwarij in Bajaur. In a post on social media platform X, he praised the troops’ courage and reaffirmed that the nation stands united under Azm-i-Istehkam to eliminate all terrorist elements. 18 terrorists killed in 2 separate operations in Balochistan Earlier in the day, the ISPR said that 18 terrorists were killed in two separate operations in Balochistan. In a statement, the ISPR said that the militants belonged to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan . The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR stated that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in the Chiltan mountain range in Quetta district on the reported presence of terrorists. “During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said. The ISPR further stated that another IBO was conducted in Buleda in Kech district, where a hideout was busted and four militants were “successfully neutralised”. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” the ISPR said. It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area, adding that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country. President Zardari, in a statement posted on X, paid tribute to security forces for eliminating 18 militants. He said that the operation was a reflection of security forces’ determination to eradicate terrorism. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also said the entire nation stood with the country’s security forces in the fight against terrorism. In a statement, he also reiterated the firm commitment to eradicating terrorism in all its forms from the country, Radio Pakistan reported. In a post on X, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to security forces for thwarting the infiltration attempt. “The nation takes pride in the skill and bravery of the security forces,” Naqvi said, vowing to “stand side by side” with them. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. A day earlier, at least six Pakistan Army soldiers, including a captain, were martyred , while seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Dogar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district. According to the military, seven terrorists were also killed in the operation.",
      "title": "TTP commander among 4 terrorists killed as security forces thwart infiltration attempt at Pak-Afghan border: ISPR",
      "summary": "The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday that a “high-value target” identified as a commander of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was among four terrorists killed after security forces thwarted an attempt to infiltrate the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that last night the movement of a group of khwarij attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was picked up by security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district. “Own troops effectively engaged and thwarted khwarijs ’ attempt to infiltrate. As a result of precise and skilful engagement, four khwarij , including kharji leader, a high-value target kharji Amjad alias Mazahim, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.

      "summary_orig": "A five-member Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Thursday referred a plea against the detention of Baloch Yakjehti Committee chief Mahrang Baloch to the Practice and Procedure Committee, which forms benches and fixes cases under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023. The plea, filed by Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi in June, urges the SC to set aside an April 15 order of the Balo­ch­istan High Court (BHC) that rej­ected a petition against Mahrang’s detention under the Main­tenance of Public Order— a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order initially for a period of 30 days. Mahrang is currently detained at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta on charges of attacking Quetta Civil Hospital and inciting people to violence. The plea filed by her sister was taken up by the CB today. The CB was headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprised Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi Shakeel Ahmad. During the hearing, Nadia’s counsel Siddiqui argued that “this case should be fixed before a regular bench and not a constitutional bench”. At this, Justice Mazhar said, “Since you have challenged the MPO, that makes this a case for the CB.” Siddiqi responded by saying that he did not ask for “an interpretation of the law” and had only challenged the MPO order. Subsequently, the court referred the case to the Practice and Procedure Committee. Appeal Mahrang, whose advocacy group has been working against enforced disappearances since 2018, has been in detention since March 22. Nadia had initially filed a petition in the BHC against her sister’s detention. However, in its April 15 order , the BHC disposed of the application and directed the petitioner to approach the Balochistan Home Department. Subsequently, Nadia had approached the apex court. The federal governm­ent through the interior ministry, home and tribal aff­airs department of Baloch­istan, prosecutor general, inspector general of police, Federal Investiga­tion Agency director general, Quetta deputy commissioner and the state were named as res­pon­dents in her petition filed in the SC. The plea contended that the April 15 BHC order was contrary to the Cons­titution, law and facts. The petition alleged that Mahrang’s repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a sympathiser of militants was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons. It stated that Mahrang’s father and brother, too, were subjected to enforced disappearance in 2011 and 2017. The appeal further said that in December 2023, the “ Baloch Long March ”, organised and led by the detainee and other members of the BYC, was allegedly met with excessive and unlawful force. The petition alleged that following a militant attack on a passenger train on March 11, there was a marked escalation in retaliatory measures by the state. On March 20, Bebarg Zehri, a BYC central committee member and his brother were abducted from their residence, the petition alleged, adding on March 19, their relative Saeeda Baloch was arrested and unlawfully detained for two days without any formal charge. The appeal contended that the BHC erred by not ensuring the production of all the relevant material before it on which Balochistan MPO was passed so that the high court could have satisfied itself regarding reasonableness, arbitrariness and legality of the MPO. It recalled that the SC held in 2003 that it was incumbent upon the detaining authority to place entire material before court on which basis the detention order was passed, regardless of any claim of privilege related to any document, as the high court was competent to decide the same and satisfy itself regarding the existence of the requisite condition of MPO of the detaining authority. The petition further contended that the balance of convenience was in favour of the petitioner and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioner unless the operation of the high court order was not suspended during the pendency of the present case. The petitioner asserted that the deputy commissioner, by issuing the MPO order, acted in clear excess of his statutory mandate, since it was issued unilaterally by him without securing the requisite approval from the chief minister. BYC leaders’ detention Mahrang and other BYC leaders, including Sibghatullah Baloch, Beebow Baloch, Beebarg Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, were arrested under the MPO in March and have remained in custody since, having been remanded multiple times. They were initially taken into custody for a period of 30 days. Thereafter, their detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April. After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order for their detention. Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has stated that India is waging a “low-intensity” war against Pakistan from Afghanistan, adding that New Delhi is trying to “settle the score” after facing defeat in the four-day conflict with Islamabad in May. Asif expressed these views during an interview with Al Arabiya English that was released late on Wednesday. His remarks are a continuation of the censure he has been directing toward Kabul in connection with terror incidents in Pakistan, recent border hostilities and the subsequent failure of talks with its Taliban rulers. He was asked during his interview with Al Arabiya about the evidence he had to back his assertions that New Delhi was “pulling the strings” during talks with Taliban representatives in Doha and Turkiye. “When it comes to showing the evidence, or tabling the evidence, we will do that. We have the evidence,” Asif replied, highlighting that the Afghan foreign minister was visiting the Indian capital when border clashes began between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He went on to say that there was no doubt about Afghanistan having become an “Indian proxy”. “And India is actually waging a low-intensity war against us from the Afghan territory and trying to settle the score [after] the last round we had around six or five months back, when they were squarely defeated. And they lost seven planes. “The president of the United States has, on several occasions, mentioned — he even mentioned it yesterday — that seven beautiful planes were lost in the clash between India and Pakistan,” he added. The conflict between the two countries in May was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Pakistan initially said it had downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, and later raised the tally to seven . US President Donald Trump has also mentioned the downing of seven jets during the conflict on multiple occasions, but has stopped short of elaborating on which side lost the jets. When Asif again referred to the May episode in the context of hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the interviewer remarked that him saying India was trying to take revenge using another country was a very bold statement. At that, Asif replied, “You want me to reiterate that statement? I will do that. I have no problem with that.” He continued that Kabul and New Delhi had a “relationship irrespective of the regimes in both countries”. “There is a continuity to the relationship between the two countries, and it has always been to the detriment of Pakistan.” Responding to a subsequent question, he also warned that in case of any violation on Pakistan’s eastern or western border — frontiers that the country shares with India and Afghanistan — Islamabad would respond effectively. The defence minister further commented that Afghanistan had “chosen to become a stooge or proxy of India”. Asked whether he saw a “broader or full-blown war” with Afghanistan on the horizon, the defence minister replied: “I won’t speculate about this, that there could be a full-blown war.

      "summary_en": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has stated that India is waging a “low-intensity” war against Pakistan from Afghanistan, adding that New Delhi is trying to “settle the score” after facing defeat in the four-day conflict with Islamabad in May. Asif expressed these views during an interview with Al Arabiya English that was released late on Wednesday. His remarks are a continuation of the censure he has been directing toward Kabul in connection with terror incidents in Pakistan, recent border hostilities and the subsequent failure of talks with its Taliban rulers. He was asked during his interview with Al Arabiya about the evidence he had to back his assertions that New Delhi was “pulling the strings” during talks with Taliban representatives in Doha and Turkiye. “When it comes to showing the evidence, or tabling the evidence, we will do that. We have the evidence,” Asif replied, highlighting that the Afghan foreign minister was visiting the Indian capital when border clashes began between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He went on to say that there was no doubt about Afghanistan having become an “Indian proxy”. “And India is actually waging a low-intensity war against us from the Afghan territory and trying to settle the score [after] the last round we had around six or five months back, when they were squarely defeated. And they lost seven planes. “The president of the United States has, on several occasions, mentioned — he even mentioned it yesterday — that seven beautiful planes were lost in the clash between India and Pakistan,” he added. The conflict between the two countries in May was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Pakistan initially said it had downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, and later raised the tally to seven . US President Donald Trump has also mentioned the downing of seven jets during the conflict on multiple occasions, but has stopped short of elaborating on which side lost the jets. When Asif again referred to the May episode in the context of hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the interviewer remarked that him saying India was trying to take revenge using another country was a very bold statement. At that, Asif replied, “You want me to reiterate that statement? I will do that. I have no problem with that.” He continued that Kabul and New Delhi had a “relationship irrespective of the regimes in both countries”. “There is a continuity to the relationship between the two countries, and it has always been to the detriment of Pakistan.” Responding to a subsequent question, he also warned that in case of any violation on Pakistan’s eastern or western border — frontiers that the country shares with India and Afghanistan — Islamabad would respond effectively. The defence minister further commented that Afghanistan had “chosen to become a stooge or proxy of India”. Asked whether he saw a “broader or full-blown war” with Afghanistan on the horizon, the defence minister replied: “I won’t speculate about this, that there could be a full-blown war. But, there is a risk of [things] heating up, at least on the border. And obviously, if we have evidence of indulgence from across the border, we will retaliate. We will go inside and settle the score with them.” The interviewer also asked him where Pakistan stood with regards to sending troops to become part of an international force in Gaza. “We [have] already [said] on record that if need be we will be part of that force to maintain […] peace and tranquility and […] normalisation [of situation] in Gaza.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said he had struck a deal to reduce tariffs on China on Thursday in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases, keeping rare earths exports flowing and cracking down on the illicit trade of fentanyl. His remarks after the face-to-face talks with  China’s leader Xi Jinping in the South Korean city of Busan, their first since 2019, marked the finale of Trump’s whirlwind Asia trip on which he also touted trade breakthroughs with South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asian nations. The meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, lasted nearly two hours. Trump shook hands and escorted Xi to his car before the US president was given a red carpet send off at the airport. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said the meeting with Xi yielded an extendable one-year deal on the supply of crucial rare earths. “All the rare earths has been settled, and that’s for the world,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that the deal was for a year and would be re-negotiated annually. He also described his meeting with Xi as a “great success” and said he would head to China in April for new talks. “I’ll be going to China in April and he’ll be coming here sometime after that, whether it’s in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, DC,” Trump said. “A lot of things we brought to finalisation” at Thursday’s talks in Busan, South Korea, added Trump, praising Xi as a “tremendous leader of a very powerful country”. Chinese stocks climbed to a decade high and the yuan currency to a near one-year peak against the dollar as investors hoped for an easing of trade tensions that have upended supply chains and rocked global business confidence. World stock markets from Wall Street to Tokyo have hit record highs in recent days. Trump repeatedly talked up the prospect of reaching agreement with Xi since US negotiators on Sunday said they had agreed a framework with China that will avoid 100 per cent US tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China’s export curbs on rare earths, a sector it dominates. But with both countries increasingly willing to play hardball over areas of economic and geopolitical competition, many questions remain about how long any trade detente may last.",

      "summary_orig": "• CM Maryam orders release of ‘innocent’ supporters of proscribed outfit • Dismisses claim about 400 to 600 deaths in Muridke protest LAHORE: Apparently under pressure from some religious groups, the Punjab government on Wednesday announced handing over the administrative control of the mosques and seminaries erstwhile being run by proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) to a group of moderate clerics. The administration led by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had earlier announced giving the administrative control of 300 mosques and 125 seminaries run by the TLP in the province to the Auqaf department. Besides, CM Maryam ordered the release of TLP prisoners, who were fount innocent during the investigations. At least eight people, including a policeman, were killed and over 1,600 injured in clashes between police and TLP supporters in Muridke earlier this month. The Punjab police had arrested over 6,000 TLP activists so far following the violence, which was sparked by the outfit’s attempt to hold an anti-Israel demonstration outside the US embassy in Islamabad. On Wednesday, a meeting of the Ittehad Bainul Muslimeen Committee was held with CM Maryam Nawaz in the chair. Religious leaders from all schools of thought expressed full support for the Punjab government’s stance against the TLP and endorsed its efforts for maintaining peace. In the meeting it was decided that the administration of the TLP-run mosques and seminaries would be handed over to the Tanzeem-ul-Madaris Ahle Sunnat Pakistan led by Mufti Muneebur Rehman. “Those who misuse religion for personal agendas are not serving the faith,” the CM noted. “The mosques and seminaries are being handed over to Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman’s organisation for proper management,” she added. Release of TLP supporters The CM also ordered the immediate release of the TLP supporters, who were proven innocent, and instr­ucted officials to escort them home with “dignity”. She dismissed the claim that 400 to 600 people were killed during the TLP protest in Muridke. Referring to jailed former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan, the Punjab CM said: “A person sitting in Adiala Jail tweets that 400 to 600 people died [in Muridke].” She added that Mr Khan had been in jail for the last two years and still not stopped inciting sedition. “The lie of hundreds of people being killed was falsely spread. If it were true, where were the dead bodies?” she asked. The CM further raised the question as to which hospitals provided medical treatment if thousands were injured. “No videos of the injured and killed came to surface, but only those of raids and recoveries emerged,” she noted. “When a police inspector was martyred, his funeral was held and everyone watched,” she continued, asking why were matters brought to such a tragic point that parents, wives, husbands and children were deprived of their loved ones. The Punjab CM said everyone was surprised to see such a large number of weapons being recovered from TLP activists and supporters. During police raids, she stated that modern weapons were recovered from TLP activists, including ones that even law enforcement agencies did not possess. “These arms were meant to be used against the state and the police.” She denounced the harsh statements being made on social media about security personnel, adding that the agenda of those behind them was only to “defame religious and political parties”. ‘Miscreants creating divisions’ The CM observed that some people in religious groups were pious, guiding followers toward the truth. However, she asked: “who are those destroying property and taking innocent lives.” She criticised the elements creating divisions among religious groups. She said certain miscreant groups were formed only to discredit and harm religious organisations. “It is the state’s responsibility to protect the lives, property, and honour of citizens and to ensure daily life is not disrupted,” she added. “The state was forced to act [against the TLP],” she said, continuing that while the world rejoiced over the Gaza ceasefire, some people in the country were calling for a march on Islamabad. “Not once did these agitators [TLP] speak for Palestine. Instead, they incited violence against the police.” She said using women as shields and hiding weapons in mosques was inhumane, referring to the TLP tactics. The meeting was inf­o­rmed that all personnel deployed for the CM’s sec­urity were being screened following the crackdown against the TLP. Besides, the security of the CM and some other members of her cabinet has been beefed up. The CM announced a stipend of Rs25,000 per month for a prayer leader (imam) of each of the 65,000 mosques in the province. Published in Dawn, October 30th, 2025",
