      "summary_orig": "In the latest violence to undermine the ceasefire in Gaza, health officials said Israeli tank shelling and airstrikes killed 20 Palestinians, including four children, on Wednesday. Among the dead was a medic who rushed to help victims of a strike in the southern city of Khan Younis and was then killed by a second attack on the same location, health officials said. Other strikes hit Gaza City in the north, where health officials said a five-month-old boy was killed. The attacks come three days after Israel reopened Gaza’s main border crossing with Egypt, a major step in the US-backed truce. The Israeli military claimed it had launched the strikes in response to gunmen opening fire against Israeli troops operating near its armistice line with Hamas. It said an Israeli soldier was severely injured by the fire. Wednesday’s attacks bring the number of Palestinians killed since the border reopened to 28, according to a tally from Gazan health officials. On Saturday, before its reopening, Israeli strikes killed more than 30 Palestinians in Gaza. The military said it launched those strikes after gunmen emerged from a tunnel in a Gaza area under Israeli control. Patient crossings at Rafah halted Palestinian patients preparing to cross through the newly opened Rafah border crossing to Egypt were told that Israel had postponed the passage of patients through the border. A few hours later, the patients were told to prepare again to cross the border. A spokesperson for the Red Crescent said patients had arrived at a hospital in Khan Younis in preparation for crossing Rafah for treatment, only to be informed that Israel had postponed the evacuations. “They called the patients and said today there is no travel at all, the crossing is closed,” Raja’a Abu Teir, a Palestinian patient who was set to be evacuated, told Reuters at the hospital, where several patients were waiting in ambulances. An Egyptian security source told Reuters that efforts were being made to reopen the crossing, and that Israel had cited security issues in the Rafah area as the reason for the closure. The Israeli agency that controls access to Gaza, COGAT, claimed in a statement on Wednesday that Rafah crossing remained open, adding that it had not received the necessary coordination details from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to facilitate the crossing. The WHO did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reopening the crossing was one of the requirements under the October ceasefire that set out the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas. Sixteen patients from Gaza and 40 of their escorts crossed into Egypt on Tuesday, Gazan medics told Reuters . A Hamas police source told Reuters that at least 40 people crossed from Egypt to Gaza late on Tuesday. In January, Trump declared the start of the second phase of the ceasefire, where the sides would negotiate the shattered enclave’s future governance and reconstruction. Key issues like the withdrawal of Israeli forces from over 50 per cent of Gaza, which they currently occupy, and the disarmament of Hamas remain unresolved, while the fragile ceasefire has been marked by near-daily violence. Since the start of the ceasefire, Israeli fire has killed at least 530 people, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials. Palestinian fighters have killed four Israeli soldiers in the same period, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health authorities, displaced most of its population, and left much of the strip in ruins. Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects. The Oct 7, 2023 Hamas attack that triggered the offensive killed around 1,200 in Israel, according to Israeli tallies.",

However, he added, “Now that the situation is returning to normal, it has been decided to restore mobile internet service from tomorrow at 12am midnight.” Meanwhile, mobile data services reportedly remained suspended in Nushki, and in Mastung, where services were briefly restored. Mobile data has been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur, Sibi and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns. Separately, a spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, Muhammad Kashif, told Dawn that train services from Quetta to other parts of the country remain suspended. He added that “once the security situation improves and we receive clearance, services of the Jaffar Express (Quetta-Peshawar) and the Bolan Mail (Quetta-Karachi) will be restored”. On Tuesday, security forces continued ‘mop-up actions’ in Nushki district and other parts of the province following the coordinated attacks, with the number of terrorists killed now at 197. In Nushki, armed men had attacked various government offices on Saturday, including a police station, judicial complex, police lines, Deputy Commissioner (DC) office and a Federal Constabulary (FC) camp in the town, and set some government buildings on fire. But while the town of Nushki has been cleared and bazaars reopened after three days, search operations by security forces are continuing in the mountainous areas of the district, officials told Dawn.",

      "summary_orig": "Terrorists martyred a police recruit constable in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, the local police said on Wednesday. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. KP and Balochistan are particularly frequent targets. The constable was killed in the Darga forest in Nasrkhel, near the Sarai Naurang area of ​​Lakki Marwat. District Police Spokesperson Qudratullah confirmed the incident, saying that the martyred constable had been undergoing training at Hangu Training School. “On Tuesday night, terrorists abducted him from his house in Nasrkhel and took him to a forest called Darga and shot and killed him there,” he said. The funeral prayers of the constable were offered with official honours at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines. Lakki Marwat’s District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan, Superintendent of Police (SP) Investigation Murad Khan, police officers, district administration officers and police personnel attended the prayers in large numbers. The DPO also paid tribute to the martyr’s sacrifice, saying that the constable had set “a shining example of bravery and sacrifice” by giving his life in the line of duty. “The entire nation is proud of this brave soldier. These cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken our resolve,” he said. “The morale of Lakki Marwat police is high and actions against Fitna-al-Khawarij will be further intensified. No sacrifice will be spared to protect the lives and property of the people, and the involved elements will be brought to their logical end soon.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Despite record militant deaths , the country saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. Last month, the KP Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan. Only days before that, at least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts, officials said. The previous week, the military’s media wing had said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. That same day, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu.",

District Police Spokesperson Qudratullah confirmed the incident, saying that the martyred constable had been undergoing training at Hangu Training School. “On Tuesday night, terrorists abducted him from his house in Nasrkhel and took him to a forest called Darga and shot and killed him there,” he said. The funeral prayers of the constable were offered with official honours at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines. Lakki Marwat’s District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan, Superintendent of Police (SP) Investigation Murad Khan, police officers, district administration officers and police personnel attended the prayers in large numbers. The DPO also paid tribute to the martyr’s sacrifice, saying that the constable had set “a shining example of bravery and sacrifice” by giving his life in the line of duty. “The entire nation is proud of this brave soldier. These cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken our resolve,” he said. “The morale of Lakki Marwat police is high and actions against Fitna-al-Khawarij will be further intensified. No sacrifice will be spared to protect the lives and property of the people, and the involved elements will be brought to their logical end soon.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Despite record militant deaths , the country saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. Last month, the KP Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan. Only days before that, at least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts, officials said. The previous week, the military’s media wing had said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. That same day, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu.",

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the UNSC said the attacks, which occurred on January 31, 2026, were carried out across the province and described them as “heinous and cowardly acts of terrorism”. The UNSC expressed its “deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the governor and people of Pakistan”. The council also wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured in the attacks. The statement reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”. It added that it was crucial to “hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice,” urging all states to cooperate with the government of Pakistan in accordance with international law and relevant UNSC resolutions. The UNSC reiterated that “any act of terrorism is criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of motivation, timing, or perpetrator”. It further stressed that all states must combat terrorism “by all means, in accordance with the UN Charter and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, and international humanitarian law,” in order to address threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. Earlier on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combating terrorism. “We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said. The number of terrorists killed in clearance operations across Balochistan has risen to 197, as security forces continued ‘ mop-up’ actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province. The clearance operations follow several coordinated terrorist attacks staged across the province on Saturday.",

Earlier on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combating terrorism. “We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said. The number of terrorists killed in clearance operations across Balochistan has risen to 197, as security forces continued ‘ mop-up’ actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province. The clearance operations follow several coordinated terrorist attacks staged across the province on Saturday.",

      "title_orig": "The eternal ascent: Basant returns to the skies of Lahore",
      "summary_orig": "In the ancient city of Lahore, where the Ravi river whispers secrets to the minarets of the Badshahi Mosque, spring arrives not with a gentle sigh, but with a sudden, jubilant roar. When the winter’s fog finally yields to the sun’s warm gaze, the skies above the walled city awaken. Kites (‘patangs’) burst upward from rooftops, their paper bodies trembling, their tails slicing the blue sky like calligraphy in motion. This is Basant: a centuries-old festival marked by marigold blooms and kites, carried by colour and the steady pull of the wind. Bo Kata! — a festival of freedom and flight Basant traces its roots to Vasant Panchami, the ancient herald of spring observed on the fifth day of Magh, when the land stirs from winter’s slumber. In the mustard fields of Punjab, ochre blooms unfurl like carpets laid for spring’s arrival. Goddess Saraswati, (the goddess of learning and the arts), clad in saffron-gold, is invoked with music and learning, her veena (an Indian stringed instrument) resonating with the promise of renewal. In Lahore, however, Basant long outgrew its ritual origins. It became deeply Punjabi, exuberantly urban, and radically inclusive. Hindu, Muslim and Sikh households alike climbed their roofs, dressed in amber and marigold hues, turning the city into a living mosaic where faith receded, and celebration took flight. Historical chronicles recall Basant at its most magnificent during the Mughal era. Emperors revelled in the spectacle: kites wheeling above the ramparts of Lahore Fort, their strings guided by hands adorned with henna. Amir Khusrau, the Sufi poet whose verses still seem to linger in the city’s breath, sang of Basant as a season of love, colour, and divine intoxication. A man holds kites ahead of the three-day kite-flying festival (Basant) at a market in Lahore on Feb 2, 2026. — APP/ File Later, in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the festival assumed an even grander, almost theatrical form. For 10 days, Lahore became a city lost in celebration. Marigold garlands draped streets and courtyards; soldiers appeared in turmeric-hued turbans; women swayed on jhulas (swings), the steady beat of the dhol travelled through every lane. Above it all, kite battles drew cheers of “Bo kata!” from rooftop to rooftop. Yet the true poetry of Basant lies not in its pomp, but in the humble kite itself. A fragile diamond-framed paper and bamboo, it is tethered to earth by a single string, yet it yearns for the heavens. In the hands of a Lahori child or elder, the patang becomes more than play: it is an act of transcendence. As the wind takes hold, the kite escapes the dust and clamour of crowded streets, briefly escaping the confines of class and circumstance, carrying the hopes of those who hold the string below. For many in Lahore, Basant has always been this quiet rebellion against gravity. In narrow streets where life presses close, the rooftop becomes a stage for liberation. A young man, burdened by tomorrow’s worries, sends his kite aloft and watches it soar, higher, freer, until it seems to touch the very edge of possibility. A woman, her heart full of unspoken longings, lets the wind carry her kite as if it could bear her dreams to distant horizons. The kite is an escape made visible: fragile yet defiant, tethered yet boundless. It reminds us that even the smallest soul can touch the infinite if given the right wind. The ghost of Basant lingering in memory for two decades For nearly two decades, however, the skies remained silent. The ban descended after tragic losses, lives claimed by sharp, glass-coated or metallic strings that sliced through the air, severing throats and injuring bystanders on rooftops and streets below. The silence was born of necessary grief and reckoning, a painful but essential pause to protect what mattered most. Families who once gathered with spools of thread in their hands now looked up at an empty blue sky, feeling the absence like a missing heartbeat. Old men sat on charpoys in the evenings, eyes distant, murmuring about days when the sky was alive with colour. Mothers recalled their children’s laughter as they ran across terraces, cheeks flushed with sun and excitement. Young people, who had known Basant only through stories and grainy videos, carried a quiet nostalgia for something they had never truly touched. A tournament at Guddi Ground in Lahore’s Iqbal Park in January 2001. — Dawn/ File The city missed it deeply: the shared joy, the playful rivalries, the way the wind seemed to carry away every worry for a single radiant day. Basant had become a beloved ghost, lingering over rooftops and in memory. But the longing never died. It lived in whispered conversations, in turmeric-hued kurtas worn on spring days as quiet tribute, in the careful way kite-makers kept their craft alive in the city’s hidden corners. It lived in the hope that one day the skies would fill again — not recklessly, but with wisdom earned from sorrow. Lahore’s patangs are set to rise once more, responsibly And now, as February has ascended, the wind is stirring once more. Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025, with its strict mandates for cotton strings only (no metallic or glass coatings), QR-coded registration, maximum nine threads, drone monitoring, and zero tolerance for violations, the patangs will rise again, thoughtfully and safely, over the rooftops of Lahore on February 6, 7, and 8, 2026. The old songs are being rehearsed, the dhol awaits its beat, and the air will soon carry the sweet scent of marigold sweets and the gentle tug of ordinary thread. What was lost is being remembered with care; what was mourned is being welcomed back, wiser and more precious for the wait. As one lifelong resident of Anarkali, Anwar Bajwa, shared with quiet emotion: “Basant was never just a day for me; it was part of who I was, part of every spring morning when the air turned warm and full of promise. As a boy, I would wake before dawn and run to the rooftop with my siblings, thread in hand, my heart racing for the wind to lift our kites. Those patangs were my companions, my secrets, my way of whispering dreams to the sky when words fell short. Every tug on the string felt like my own heartbeat reaching higher.” He added that when the rooftops went silent, “it was like losing a piece of my childhood. The empty sky in spring felt wrong, heavy, and incomplete. Now, hearing that the kites will fly again, safely and responsibly, I feel that old excitement stirring inside me, like time has turned back and I’m that boy once again, waiting for the wind to carry my dreams up where nothing can touch them.” The skies of old Basant were tapestries of scarlet, emerald, indigo, and amber, woven by thousands of patangs locked in gentle combat. Rooftops brimmed with laughter, the air thick with the scent of marigold-hued sweets. Families gathered, strangers became friends, and for radiant days, Lahore was united in pure, unbridled joy. The kite, too, carries its own quiet symbolism. A close look reveals intricate designs — stars, eyes, flowers — each patang a small work of art, born in the hands of artisans who know the wind’s secrets. And beneath it all, the earth itself celebrates: vast fields of mustard-gold sway in the breeze, a living mirror to the crowds above. The return of flight and soaring spirits As the season approaches, the memory of those quiet years only deepens the anticipation. The skies have been empty for too long, yet the longing has made every coming flight more sacred. In every Lahori heart, the kite still waits, patient, hopeful, and soon it will rise once more. When it does, Lahore will not merely remember joy; it will reclaim it, wiser for the silence, stronger for the lessons etched in loss. Basant returns not as a fleeting spectacle, but as proof that even after the darkest pause, the human spirit, fragile as paper and defiant as wind, can ascend again, tethered only by the thinnest thread of care, soaring toward a boundless sky that belongs, once more, to all of us.

And beneath it all, the earth itself celebrates: vast fields of mustard-gold sway in the breeze, a living mirror to the crowds above. The return of flight and soaring spirits As the season approaches, the memory of those quiet years only deepens the anticipation. The skies have been empty for too long, yet the longing has made every coming flight more sacred. In every Lahori heart, the kite still waits, patient, hopeful, and soon it will rise once more. When it does, Lahore will not merely remember joy; it will reclaim it, wiser for the silence, stronger for the lessons etched in loss. Basant returns not as a fleeting spectacle, but as proof that even after the darkest pause, the human spirit, fragile as paper and defiant as wind, can ascend again, tethered only by the thinnest thread of care, soaring toward a boundless sky that belongs, once more, to all of us.

      "summary_orig": "Gold prices extended gains on Wednesday on safe-haven appeal, as renewed geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran added to the yellow metal’s recent upswing that saw it mark its best day since 2008 in the previous session. Spot gold gained 2.7 per cent to$5,071.79 per ounce as of 03:53 GMT, after surging 5.9pc on Tuesday, its biggest daily gain since November 2008. Bullion scaled a record high of $5,594.82 last Thursday. US gold futures for April delivery climbed 3.2pc to $5,092.0 per ounce. “Gold has climbed back about the key $5,000 level, … (as) geopolitical tensions have lifted the metal’s safe-haven appeal after US forces downed an Iranian drone,” said Jigar Trivedi, a senior research analyst at IndusInd Securities. The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters. Nuclear talks between the US and Iran are expected to take place in Oman on Friday, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on Tuesday, citing an Arab source. Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a spending deal into law that ends a partial US government shutdown, which had delayed key labour data reports that were due for release this week. Investors expect at least two Fed interest rate cuts in 2026 and await ADP private payroll data later in the day for more cues on the Fed’s policy path. Non-yielding bullion tends to perform better in low-interest-rate environments. “Going ahead (gold) prices may touch $5,100 in the very near-term … and we are expecting the same $5,600 levels by the end of the first half or April-end while prices will continue to rise thereafter and our year-end target is $6,000/oz,” Trivedi added. The current wave is expected to be sharp, probably to surge into the $4,950 to $5,198 range, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said on Tuesday. Spot silver rose 3.2pc to $87.84 an ounce. It touched a record high of $121.64 on Thursday. Spot platinum added 2.9pc to $2,273.70 per ounce after hitting an all-time high of $2,918.80 on January 26, while palladium gained 3pc to $1,784.67.",

      "title_orig": "Remembering Prince Karim Aga Khan — Faith, pluralism and service",
      "summary_orig": "The late Prince Karim al-Hussaini Aga Khan IV passed away on Feb 4, 2025 in Lisbon, Portugal, at the age of 88. He is remembered not only by his faithful followers but also by vulnerable communities globally, as he was a champion of community-based development as well as efforts to combat natural disasters. Late Prince Karim, the Aga Khan IV, was not only the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, but also a prominent statesman and key supporter of global development. Prince Karim was born on Dec 13, 1936 in Geneva to late Prince Aly Khan and his first wife, the late Princess Tajuddawlah, née Joan Yarde-Buller. He spent his early childhood in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. The philanthropist was also an accomplished skier and represented Iran at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. He founded what is now the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) more than 50 years ago, with the purpose of improving the quality of life of those in need — regardless of origin, race, gender or religion — through efforts in health care, education, habitat, culture and the creation of economic opportunity. The AKDN is active in more than 30 countries, with a particular focus on some of the poorest parts of Asia and Africa. Prince Karim held the position of Aga Khan for 67 years after succeeding his grandfather, Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan III, in 1957 at the age of 20. He guided all the agencies that comprise the AKDN to work closely with national and local governments on a politically neutral basis and to identify and implement solutions in a collaborative manner. The alleviation of poverty, enhancement of pluralism and gender equality, and protection of the environment are among its key areas of focus. The institutional framework and holistic approach of the AKDN have led to the establishment of two universities, over 200 schools and more than 700 health facilities. There are parks and gardens, foundations that work in social and cultural development, as well as microfinance programmes, environmental protection and climate change mitigation initiatives , habitat planning, disaster preparedness and humanitarian assistance. There are also businesses in commercial banking, insurance, telecommunications, energy, tourism and media. The AKDN’s impact is wide-ranging: it annually generates electricity for 10 million people, provides health care to 5m, educates 2m students, and hosts 5m visitors at its parks and gardens. With an annual budget of approximately $1bn for its non-profit activities, AKDN agencies employ some 96,000 people, the vast majority of whom are Asians and Africans living and working in their home countries or regions. Education Providing access to high-quality education in the developing world and promoting gender-equal education were among the most important priorities of the late Prince Karim. He inherited and enhanced schools that his grandfather, Aga Khan III, established in Asia and Africa, and expanded the portfolio of 200 schools to serve more than 85,000 students. Following the tradition of his ancestors, who founded Al-Azhar University in Cairo in 970, Prince Karim placed great importance on education and established the Aga Khan University in 1983 as Pakistan’s first private, internationally chartered university. It is home to leading medical, nursing and education faculties and programmes. It operates in six countries, in partnership with the governments of Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan through an international treaty. Prince Karim also founded the University of Central Asia in 2000 to improve the social and economic development of Central Asia, with special attention to its high-mountain societies. Continuing this initiative, he also supported partnerships with leading universities across the world and endowed programmes at Harvard, MIT and Brown. Patron of the arts The Aga Khan was deeply engaged in the arts and cultural matters, and established programmes and initiatives to support architecture, music and conservation. The Aga Khan Award for Architecture was established in 1977 and, with a prize fund of $1m, is awarded every three years to projects that set new standards of excellence in architecture, planning practices, preservation and landscape architecture. The Aga Khan Music Programme fosters the development of musical heritage in societies where Muslims have a significant presence. The Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme supports the delivery of restoration and conservation projects and the creation of parks and gardens, such as Al-Azhar Park in Cairo. Underlining his commitment to preserving Muslim heritage, Prince Karim in 2014 opened the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, home to over 1,000 masterpieces showcasing the arts of Muslim civilisations. Sporting pursuits Building on a long family tradition, the Aga Khan was a globally recognised horse owner and breeder. With stud farms in France and Ireland where his racehorses were bred and raised, Prince Karim had five Derby winners — including Shergar , who won the Irish and Epsom Derbies — four winners of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, and a record seven winners of the Prix de Diane. Bridge building Prince Karim embodied understanding and tolerance, promoted unity, and underscored the crucial importance of peace as a foundational building block for the progress of society. Through his personal efforts over the course of six decades, he played a vital role in bringing peace to a fragmented world. He facilitated diplomatic talks at regional and global levels, including the landmark 1985 summit between Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev in Geneva. In partnership with the Government of Canada, he founded the Global Centre for Pluralism in 2006. The centre works with policy leaders, educators and community builders around the world to amplify and implement the transformative power of pluralism. Titles and honours The hereditary title “Aga Khan” (meaning “Commanding Chief”) is an honorific title given by the 19th-century Persian Qajar monarch, Fath Ali Shah (1797–1834), to the 46th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, Hasan Ali Shah Aga Khan I (1817–1881). In keeping with the recognition accorded to the previous three Aga Khans by British monarchs, Queen Elizabeth II granted the title “His Highness” to Aga Khan IV in 1957. The Ismailis live in over 35 countries, mainly in Central, East and South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America and Australia, and number approximately 12–15m. In acknowledgement of his exceptional contributions to human development and improving social conditions globally, Prince Karim received distinctions of honour from France, Portugal, Kenya, Canada, the United Kingdom, Iran, India, Pakistan and Senegal. He received 44 international awards, including honorary Canadian citizenship and the UN Champion for Global Change Award, and was the recipient of 24 honorary degrees from leading institutions such as Cambridge, Harvard and McGill. His Highness the Aga Khan IV graduated from Harvard University in 1959 with a B.A. Honours degree in Islamic history. His grandfather served twice as the president of the League of Nations, and his uncle was a long-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Prince Karim cared deeply about the continued development of communities and societies, irrespective of their faith.",

      "summary_en": "The late Prince Karim al-Hussaini Aga Khan IV passed away on Feb 4, 2025 in Lisbon, Portugal, at the age of 88. He is remembered not only by his faithful followers but also by vulnerable communities globally, as he was a champion of community-based development as well as efforts to combat natural disasters. Late Prince Karim, the Aga Khan IV, was not only the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, but also a prominent statesman and key supporter of global development. Prince Karim was born on Dec 13, 1936 in Geneva to late Prince Aly Khan and his first wife, the late Princess Tajuddawlah, née Joan Yarde-Buller. He spent his early childhood in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. The philanthropist was also an accomplished skier and represented Iran at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. He founded what is now the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) more than 50 years ago, with the purpose of improving the quality of life of those in need — regardless of origin, race, gender or religion — through efforts in health care, education, habitat, culture and the creation of economic opportunity. The AKDN is active in more than 30 countries, with a particular focus on some of the poorest parts of Asia and Africa. Prince Karim held the position of Aga Khan for 67 years after succeeding his grandfather, Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan III, in 1957 at the age of 20. He guided all the agencies that comprise the AKDN to work closely with national and local governments on a politically neutral basis and to identify and implement solutions in a collaborative manner. The alleviation of poverty, enhancement of pluralism and gender equality, and protection of the environment are among its key areas of focus. The institutional framework and holistic approach of the AKDN have led to the establishment of two universities, over 200 schools and more than 700 health facilities. There are parks and gardens, foundations that work in social and cultural development, as well as microfinance programmes, environmental protection and climate change mitigation initiatives , habitat planning, disaster preparedness and humanitarian assistance. There are also businesses in commercial banking, insurance, telecommunications, energy, tourism and media. The AKDN’s impact is wide-ranging: it annually generates electricity for 10 million people, provides health care to 5m, educates 2m students, and hosts 5m visitors at its parks and gardens. With an annual budget of approximately $1bn for its non-profit activities, AKDN agencies employ some 96,000 people, the vast majority of whom are Asians and Africans living and working in their home countries or regions. Education Providing access to high-quality education in the developing world and promoting gender-equal education were among the most important priorities of the late Prince Karim. He inherited and enhanced schools that his grandfather, Aga Khan III, established in Asia and Africa, and expanded the portfolio of 200 schools to serve more than 85,000 students. Following the tradition of his ancestors, who founded Al-Azhar University in Cairo in 970, Prince Karim placed great importance on education and established the Aga Khan University in 1983 as Pakistan’s first private, internationally chartered university. It is home to leading medical, nursing and education faculties and programmes. It operates in six countries, in partnership with the governments of Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan through an international treaty. Prince Karim also founded the University of Central Asia in 2000 to improve the social and economic development of Central Asia, with special attention to its high-mountain societies. Continuing this initiative, he also supported partnerships with leading universities across the world and endowed programmes at Harvard, MIT and Brown. Patron of the arts The Aga Khan was deeply engaged in the arts and cultural matters, and established programmes and initiatives to support architecture, music and conservation. The Aga Khan Award for Architecture was established in 1977 and, with a prize fund of $1m, is awarded every three years to projects that set new standards of excellence in architecture, planning practices, preservation and landscape architecture.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s spin-heavy squad are in winning form ahead of the T20 World Cup, but a controversial decision to forfeit their marquee clash against India could still trigger another early exit. Pakistan came close to withdrawing from the tournament in solidarity with Bangladesh , who pulled out after refusing to play in India, citing security concerns. The Pakistan government eventually cleared the team’s participation but it barred them from facing India in Colombo in a blockbuster clash on February 15. With two points for a win, a forfeit of the match will leave Pakistan with no margin for error if they are to progress as one of the top two from a five-team Group A. It means they must win their opening game against the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday and beat the United States three days later to stay in contention. Their final group game will be against Namibia on February 18. Captain Salman Agha said the move to boycott the India game was out of the team’s hands. “That is not our decision. We have to follow what our government decides,” he said. The Pakistan government has not said what their stance might be if the team were to end up facing India again in the semi-finals or final. Agha was not thinking about that. “Our job is to win, and we are capable of doing that,” he said. Pakistan will be keen to avoid a repeat of the last T20 World Cup in 2024, where a shock super over defeat to co-hosts the United States led to them failing to get out of the group. The side has since faced criticism for failing to adapt to the modern demands of T20 cricket, with the batting, particularly Babar Azam’s low strike rate , under scrutiny. The criticism was fuelled by Pakistan’s record last year, where 21 of their 34 T20 international wins came against lower-ranked opponents. Confidence restored Against elite teams, the results were sobering: three losses to India in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series defeat to New Zealand. However, Agha believes recent performances have restored confidence. Pakistan beat South Africa 2-1, won a home tri-series, and then completed a 3-0 sweep of an under-strength Australia. “We’ve had good preparation by beating Australia. We have the luxury of quality spinning all-rounders like Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan and Saim Ayub. “We’re ticking most boxes and believe we can win the World Cup,” Agha said. The spin department has been strengthened by Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, the latter known for his unusual, slingy action and exaggerated pause at the crease. The pace attack is led by the experienced Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah. Faheem Ashraf provides seam-bowling all-round support and newcomer Salman Mirza has been impressive. Batting remains Pakistan’s most volatile component. When openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan provide strong starts, the side can post competitive totals, but collapses remain a constant threat. Head coach Mike Hesson has added another layer of risk by leaving out experienced wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan because of poor form, opting instead for makeshift options in Usman Khan, Khawaja Nafay and Farhan. For Pakistan, the ingredients for a deep run are present, but with points potentially forfeited, there is little room left for error.",

      "summary_orig": "TRIPOLI: Saif al Islam, the most prominent son of the late Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi, was shot dead at his home on Tuesday. Abdullah Othman Abdul Rahim, a relative, told a TV channel that Saif al Islam was killed in his house by a group of four unidentified men. “Four armed men stormed the residence of Saif al Islam Qadhafi after disabling surveillance cameras, then executed him,” Abdul Rahim said. While Saif al Islam was well known in the north African country, especially for his role in shaping policy during his father’s rule, his public profile receded in recent years. In 2015, a Libyan court passed a death sentence in absentia on Saif al Islam for suppressing peaceful protests during the country’s 2011 revolution that ended his father’s rule. He was also provisionally charged by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity. In 2021, Saif al Islam registered as a presidential candidate for a December vote that eventually collapsed amid a political deadlock. Saif went from being his father’s heir apparent to a decade of captivity and obscurity in a remote hill town before launching a presidential bid that helped derail the attempted election in 2021. Despite holding no official position, he was once seen as the most powerful figure after his father, who ruled for more than four decades. He led talks on Libya abandoning its weapons of mass destruction and negotiated compensation for the families of those killed in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland in 1988.

      "summary_orig": "• Meets Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman as ties between ex-rival nations improve in last two years • State-run news agency reports Turkish president will travel to Egypt today RIYADH: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday, Saudi media said, his first visit to the kingdom in over two years as Saudi Arabia moves closer to its rival-turned-ally. Ties between Turkiye and Saudi Arabia have steadily recovered in recent years, with the countries cooperating on a range of diplomatic issues. This includes support for Gaza and backing Syria’s new government in the wake of the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in 2024. Erdogan met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh, Turkiye’s Comm­unications Director Burha­nettin Duran told Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu. Erdogan is accompanied by his wife, first lady Emine Erd­ogan, Foreign Minister Hak­an Fidan, Finance Minister Meh­met Simsek, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and other ministers. No further detail on the clos­ed-door meeting was provided. However, Anadolu has earlier reported that they would discuss the “deepening cooperation” between the countries, as well as regional and global developments. It added that Erdogan would then travel to Cairo on Wednesday. Following the meeting, Erdogan attended a closed-door dinner in his honour, hosted by the Saudi crown prince at the Yemame Palace. This is Erdogan’s first to the kingdom since July 2023, which was part of a Gulf trip aimed at drumming up investments. The visit comes days after two sources told AFP that Turkiye would not be joining a mutual defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan had said earlier this month that they had entered talks aimed at joining the alliance. ‘Balance thaw’ Experts like Umar Karim of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom warn that Turkiye will have to balance any thaw with Riyadh against relations with other regional rivals. “I think it’s in this visit that it will become clear what Turkiye can commit to Saudis in terms of this rivalry with UAE and in terms of the security threat from Israel,” Karim told AFP . Relations between Riyadh and Turkiye were enormously strained after Saudi agents murdered Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.

On Tuesday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office also confirmed that it had been invited to participate in the Iran-US talks aimed at de-escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington. According to earlier reports, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi were supposed to meet in Istanbul on Friday in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran’s nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war. The Reuters news agency, however, reported on Tuesday night that instead of Istanbul, Iranian officials are asking that the talks be held in Oman instead, and that the scope be narrowed to two-way talks on nuclear issues only. This latest uncertainty followed reports of escalatory moves in the Persian Gulf, where a US warplane shot down an alleged Iranian drone that was said to be approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. Earlier, a US-flagged tanker was approached and challenged by Iranian gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz, before continuing on its way, the British maritime security firm Vanguard Tech said. However, the White House reiterated that the proposed talks were still on, despite these hiccups. “I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks as of right now are still scheduled,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that they were due to happen “later this week.” Hectic diplomacy Iran’s president confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of talks with the US, provided they were free of threats, after his counterpart Donald Trump suggested “bad things” would happen without a deal. “I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X. He added that the talks followed requests “from friendly governments”. On Tuesday, Qatar’s foreign ministry said diplomacy with Iran was “continuing very intensively”, in “tandem with all our neighbours”. Earlier, a senior official from the UAE said Iran needed to reach a deal and “rebuild their relationship with the United States”. “I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don’t have these issues every other day,” said presidential adviser Anwar Gargash. Iran has repeatedly stressed that any talks should remain focused solely on the nuclear issue, rejecting the possibility of negotiations over its missile programme or defence capabilities. When asked about the upcoming talks, an Iranian diplomatic source told Reuters they were “neither optimistic nor pessimistic”, adding that Tehran would not negotiate over its defensive capabilities. Pakistan’s role “Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query on Tuesday. “Pakistan’s participation is seen as crucial to defusing tensions, as Islamabad has been quietly working to facilitate the talks,” a diplomatic source told Dawn. The diplomatic source added that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected to participate in the meeting. The priority of the talks is to avoid any conflict and de-escalate tensions between the two sides, a regional official told Reuters , adding that some regional powers were also invited. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the countries invited to the talks at the foreign ministers’ level included Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The person said the format of the meetings remained unclear, but that the “main meeting” would be on Friday. Last-minute change? According to Reuters , a regional diplomat said that Tehran wants to change the format of the talks. “They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans while the U.S. wants to include the ballistic missiles and the activities of Iran’s proxies in the region.” A source said that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.

On Tuesday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office also confirmed that it had been invited to participate in the Iran-US talks aimed at de-escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington. According to earlier reports, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi were supposed to meet in Istanbul on Friday in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran’s nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war. The Reuters news agency, however, reported on Tuesday night that instead of Istanbul, Iranian officials are asking that the talks be held in Oman instead, and that the scope be narrowed to two-way talks on nuclear issues only. This latest uncertainty followed reports of escalatory moves in the Persian Gulf, where a US warplane shot down an alleged Iranian drone that was said to be approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. Earlier, a US-flagged tanker was approached and challenged by Iranian gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz, before continuing on its way, the British maritime security firm Vanguard Tech said. However, the White House reiterated that the proposed talks were still on, despite these hiccups. “I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks as of right now are still scheduled,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that they were due to happen “later this week.” Hectic diplomacy Iran’s president confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of talks with the US, provided they were free of threats, after his counterpart Donald Trump suggested “bad things” would happen without a deal. “I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X. He added that the talks followed requests “from friendly governments”. On Tuesday, Qatar’s foreign ministry said diplomacy with Iran was “continuing very intensively”, in “tandem with all our neighbours”. Earlier, a senior official from the UAE said Iran needed to reach a deal and “rebuild their relationship with the United States”. “I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don’t have these issues every other day,” said presidential adviser Anwar Gargash. Iran has repeatedly stressed that any talks should remain focused solely on the nuclear issue, rejecting the possibility of negotiations over its missile programme or defence capabilities. When asked about the upcoming talks, an Iranian diplomatic source told Reuters they were “neither optimistic nor pessimistic”, adding that Tehran would not negotiate over its defensive capabilities. Pakistan’s role “Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query on Tuesday. “Pakistan’s participation is seen as crucial to defusing tensions, as Islamabad has been quietly working to facilitate the talks,” a diplomatic source told Dawn. The diplomatic source added that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected to participate in the meeting. The priority of the talks is to avoid any conflict and de-escalate tensions between the two sides, a regional official told Reuters , adding that some regional powers were also invited. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the countries invited to the talks at the foreign ministers’ level included Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The person said the format of the meetings remained unclear, but that the “main meeting” would be on Friday. Last-minute change? According to Reuters , a regional diplomat said that Tehran wants to change the format of the talks. “They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans while the U.S. wants to include the ballistic missiles and the activities of Iran’s proxies in the region.” A source said that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.
