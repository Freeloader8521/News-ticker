      "summary_orig": "The US military said Wednesday that eight people were killed in multiple new strikes on alleged drug boats, bringing the death toll in Washington’s campaign against what it says are narcotics traffickers to at least 115. US Southern Command, which is responsible for American forces operating in Central and South America, announced two sets of strikes, which were carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday, “three narco-trafficking vessels traveling as a convoy” were targeted in “international waters,” it said in a statement on X. “Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels,” it said. Accompanying the statement, posted on X, was a video showing the vessels traveling together at sea and then hit by a series of explosions. The exact location of the strikes was not immediately made clear. Previous strikes have taken place in the Caribbean or the eastern Pacific. The military said it had notified the Coast Guard to “activate the search and rescue system,” without offering more details about the fate of those aboard the other boats. Hours later, it issued a second statement about strikes on two more vessels conducted on Wednesday, killing five people. Again, it was not clear where the strikes took place. Since September, the US military has carried out more than 30 such strikes on what it says are boats used to smuggle drugs to the United States, without providing any concrete evidence that the targeted boats are involved in trafficking. International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings as they have apparently targeted civilians who do not pose an immediate threat to the United States. In recent months, US President Donald Trump has waged a pressure campaign against Venezuela’s leftist President Nicolas Maduro, accusing him of running a drug cartel. Maduro denies the allegation and has accused Washington of seeking regime change to gain access to the Latin American country’s massive oil reserves.",

      "summary_orig": "SO much has happened, yet so little seems to have changed since the Earth last circled the sun. Where does one begin? The year 2025 was a year of profound structural shifts in Pakistan, characterised by high-stakes political brinkmanship, a radical re-engineering of the judiciary, and a desperate struggle for stabilisation amidst unrelenting economic pressures. If previous years had been defined by the despair they spawned, the year 2025 was when powerful actors decided to enforce the ‘new normal’ through force of law and arms. By the end of it, it was abundantly clear that most of the errant vectors within the structure of the state had been polarised. Yet, the fruits of this monumental realignment of our state have yet to be seen. The outgoing year saw a modest economic recovery, amidst escalating security risks and the suffocation of civil and political liberties. Though macroeconomic indicators showed signs of stabilisation — inflation eased and foreign reserves recovered thanks to debt rollovers, increased remittances and IMF injections — the momentum needed for a meaningful, sustained recovery remained missing, giving the lie to sporadic claims of an economic turnaround from the government. Political imbroglio The omens were there from the start. In January, I mran Khan and Bushra Bibi were handed 14 and seven years , respectively, in the £190m Al Qadir Trust case. The sentencing would set the tone for the rest of 2025, with the state maintaining its hard line against the PTI, and the PTI, in return, hardening its stance and rhetoric against those it sees as responsible for its predicament. Access to Mr Khan would in the latter half of the year become a key challenge for the PTI, especially after the party made it clear it would not be taking any decision, big or small, without his express consent and involvement. Whether this was a strategic decision taken to preclude the possibility of the much-talked-about ‘minus-one formula’, only the party’s bigwigs can tell. Whatever the rationale, it seems to have proven useful in keeping Mr Khan at the front and centre of national political discourse. As in years past, the state seemed intent on demonstrating the logic of power over law, repeatedly blocking court orders, refusing the jailed ex-prime minister visitation rights or phone calls with his children, and breaking up opposition gatherings and protests with force. The heavy-handedness on display cemented the perception that the so-called ‘hybrid regime’ of yesteryear had evolved into something new, and that it now had a ‘zero tolerance’ policy for political dissent. Not all was hunky dory within the ruling coalition’s ranks either. A major dispute flared up early in the year between the PPP and PML-N over a proposal to irrigate the Cholistan desert. The PPP, which rules Sindh, accused the PML-N governments in the centre and Punjab of threatening the lower riparian province’s water rights. The proposal was eventually shelved. Another serious dispute arose when the PPP pushed for disbursal of relief and aid through the Benazir Income Support Programme after the devastating monsoon floods in Punjab, while the PML-N insisted on its own ‘relief card’ initiative. Matters turned ugly as the scions of both parties took jibes at each other. However, party elders intervened and the alliance remained intact, with the two parties even jointly contesting some by-elections in the latter part of the year. Another development of note on the political front was the o utlawing of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan . The far-right political party crossed one line too many by insisting on holding its ‘Gaza solidarity march’ in October, which was to start from Lahore and Faisalabad and culminate outside the US embassy in Islamabad. The state, still revelling in its newfound bonhomie with the Trump administration , would not have it, and made its intentions clear. Defying Section 144, internet suspensions, heavy policy deployment and road blockades, the TLP attempted to press ahead anyway. A violent confrontation ensued, which quickly turned deadly. The government was eventually successful in dispersing the party’s workers and arrested thousands in the ensuing crackdown. The party was officially banned by the federal cabinet on Oct 23, and its leaders remain absconding. The fruits of this monumental realignment of our state have yet to be seen. Judicial developments Things were no quieter on the judicial front. The year saw profound changes to Pakistan’s judicial landscape, sparking intense debate over independence and institutional balance. The seeds of the crisis were sown early in the year, when judges from other high courts were transferred to the Islamabad High Court. It quickly became clear that not only were the new judges being moved to ‘dilute’ the IHC’s ideological leaning, they would also displace its existing judges in the court’s seniority lists. Despite attempts to secure justice for the affected judges, the architects of this ‘reshuffle’ were ultimately successful in installing one of the transferred judges as the IHC chief justice. And then came the kicker. November brought with it the contentious 27th Amendment , which would completely upend the judiciary. Its enactment resulted in the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), and the reconstitution of key bodies like the Judicial Commission of Pakistan and the Supreme Judicial Council. There was considerable criticism. It was not without reason: the FCC stripped the Supreme Court of its original jurisdiction over constitutional matters, fundamental rights, and federal-provincial disputes. Even more problematic was the fact that the amendment granted the president (on the prime minister’s advice) the power to appoint the first batch of FCC judges, and to authorise the transfer of high court judges across provinces without their consent. It was clear to many that the existing judiciary had been completely neutralised. The amendment led to the immediate resignation of two senior Supreme Court judges on Nov 14, who regretted the “hollowing out” of the Supreme Court in their parting letters. Internal security The same year, Pakistan was grappling with the severest resurgence of terrorism in over a decade. By the end of the first three quarters of 2025, Pakistan looked set to surpass the previous year’s numbers. Through the first 11 months, independent monitoring by the Centre for Research and Security Studies had established at least 3,187 fatalities from violence-related incidents, surpassing the entire 2024 total of 2,546 deaths by more than 25pc. Close to 1,200 terrorism incidents had been recorded, with security forces killing close to 1,800 terrorists in response. Like the preceding year, most of this violence remained concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. KP bore the brunt, thanks to relentless TTP assaults on security forces in the form of ambushes, suicide bombings, and raids. Balochistan saw a parallel rise in separatist attacks, with groups targeting infrastructure, convoys and ‘non-locals’. The March hijacking of the Jaffar Express, which resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds held hostage, was the highest-profile example of terrorist violence in the outgoing year. The year saw the term ‘ fitna ’ feature more consistently in security parlance, with ‘ Fitna al-Khawarij ’ and ‘ Fitna al-Hindustan ’ used as umbrella references to actors believed to either be affiliated with religious militants (khawarij) or foreign-backed elements (specifically, India). Introduced a year earlier, the narrative strategy seems to reflect a desire to focus the national security narrative on two hostile fronts, Afghanistan and India. Major security-related incidents were therefore categorised according to where the threat was perceived to have emanated from. The making of a field marshal THE charred remains of a school bus after May’s suicide bombing in Khuzdar. — Dawn archive The most perilous moment of the year arrived in May during the “ Marka-i-Haq ” (The Battle of Truth). Following a dastardly attack in Occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam region in April, New Delhi continuously blamed Pakistan — without any proof — of orchestrating the incident. The Pakistani military leadership, to its credit, was well-prepared for any misadventure. When it eventually transpired, in the form of airstrikes launched in the dead of the night under ‘Operation Sindoor’, Pakistan retaliated with a stunning counterpunch that saw multiple Indian jets shot down by the Pakistan Air Force with the help of superior tactics and technologies. That marked the start of the first high-intensity drone and missile battle between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. On May 10, Washington finally stepped into the fray, to de-escalate what the US president would later describe as imminent nuclear armageddon. The imprint left by this military standoff bears a closer look. One of the most consequential decisions taken by the Pakistani leadership in the aftermath was the promotion of the then-Chief of Army Staff, General Asim Munir, to the rank of Field Marshal. This made him only the second person in Pakistan’s history to hold the title. The move paid off in more ways than one. The promotion seems to have been aimed at establishing FM Munir as more than just a ‘general’. Becoming the face of Pakistan’s military prowess, he seems to have successfully secured the attention of the American president. Mr Trump would later describe FM Munir as his “favourite field marshal” . The relationship between the two appears to have been cemented during their first meeting, a private lunch in Washington in June, shortly after which Pakistan would publicly nominate Mr Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. FM Munir was subsequently elevated further to Chief of Defence Forces of Pakistan through the 27th Amendment. The post, which abolishes the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, introduced a unified command structure across the armed forces of Pakistan, making the CDF the highest-ranking officer of the army, navy and air force combined. This has placed unprecedented power and authority in the hands of the field marshal, giving him authority in making strategic decisions on behalf of the entirety of the armed forces. Whether this will yield more benefits, like reducing friction between Pakistan and potential military partners where it comes to strategic agreements, remains to be seen. With the Middle East in turmoil and new arrangements being shaped to ‘manage’ its affairs, Pakistan has emerged as one of the frontline players in the regional power matrix. It will seek to capitalise on this opportunity under its new CDF. Conclusion: a hardened state Pakistan witnessed a notable regression in civil rights in 2025, particularly in the realm of digital freedoms. It began with the enactment of more amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act to expand government powers over online content and expression. Critics argued that the vague provisions would enable further suppression of dissent, journalism, and criticism of state institutions. Protests by media organisations, and legal challenges in courts couldn’t amount to much. As 2025 closes, Pakistan is a country with a vastly different institutional map than it had a year ago. With a newly minted field marshal and a government-friendly Constitutional Court, the state has centralised power more than at any point in the last two decades. However, with millions directly suffering amidst a simmering economic crisis and denied a voice in their future, the ‘stability’ claimed by the leadership remains a thin veneer over a nation under deep stress. It is imperative upon the national leadership to secure a political ceasefire and chart a collective course forward. Immense resources have been expended on maintaining the status quo, even though it is clear it isn’t viable in the long term. The history of this present dispensation doesn’t offer much room for optimism, yet the desire for normalcy still survives. Perhaps 2026 will be the year it is finally realised. One can only hope for the best.",

Access to Mr Khan would in the latter half of the year become a key challenge for the PTI, especially after the party made it clear it would not be taking any decision, big or small, without his express consent and involvement. Whether this was a strategic decision taken to preclude the possibility of the much-talked-about ‘minus-one formula’, only the party’s bigwigs can tell. Whatever the rationale, it seems to have proven useful in keeping Mr Khan at the front and centre of national political discourse. As in years past, the state seemed intent on demonstrating the logic of power over law, repeatedly blocking court orders, refusing the jailed ex-prime minister visitation rights or phone calls with his children, and breaking up opposition gatherings and protests with force. The heavy-handedness on display cemented the perception that the so-called ‘hybrid regime’ of yesteryear had evolved into something new, and that it now had a ‘zero tolerance’ policy for political dissent. Not all was hunky dory within the ruling coalition’s ranks either. A major dispute flared up early in the year between the PPP and PML-N over a proposal to irrigate the Cholistan desert. The PPP, which rules Sindh, accused the PML-N governments in the centre and Punjab of threatening the lower riparian province’s water rights. The proposal was eventually shelved. Another serious dispute arose when the PPP pushed for disbursal of relief and aid through the Benazir Income Support Programme after the devastating monsoon floods in Punjab, while the PML-N insisted on its own ‘relief card’ initiative. Matters turned ugly as the scions of both parties took jibes at each other. However, party elders intervened and the alliance remained intact, with the two parties even jointly contesting some by-elections in the latter part of the year. Another development of note on the political front was the o utlawing of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan . The far-right political party crossed one line too many by insisting on holding its ‘Gaza solidarity march’ in October, which was to start from Lahore and Faisalabad and culminate outside the US embassy in Islamabad. The state, still revelling in its newfound bonhomie with the Trump administration , would not have it, and made its intentions clear. Defying Section 144, internet suspensions, heavy policy deployment and road blockades, the TLP attempted to press ahead anyway. A violent confrontation ensued, which quickly turned deadly. The government was eventually successful in dispersing the party’s workers and arrested thousands in the ensuing crackdown. The party was officially banned by the federal cabinet on Oct 23, and its leaders remain absconding. The fruits of this monumental realignment of our state have yet to be seen. Judicial developments Things were no quieter on the judicial front. The year saw profound changes to Pakistan’s judicial landscape, sparking intense debate over independence and institutional balance. The seeds of the crisis were sown early in the year, when judges from other high courts were transferred to the Islamabad High Court. It quickly became clear that not only were the new judges being moved to ‘dilute’ the IHC’s ideological leaning, they would also displace its existing judges in the court’s seniority lists. Despite attempts to secure justice for the affected judges, the architects of this ‘reshuffle’ were ultimately successful in installing one of the transferred judges as the IHC chief justice. And then came the kicker. November brought with it the contentious 27th Amendment , which would completely upend the judiciary. Its enactment resulted in the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), and the reconstitution of key bodies like the Judicial Commission of Pakistan and the Supreme Judicial Council. There was considerable criticism. It was not without reason: the FCC stripped the Supreme Court of its original jurisdiction over constitutional matters, fundamental rights, and federal-provincial disputes. Even more problematic was the fact that the amendment granted the president (on the prime minister’s advice) the power to appoint the first batch of FCC judges, and to authorise the transfer of high court judges across provinces without their consent. It was clear to many that the existing judiciary had been completely neutralised. The amendment led to the immediate resignation of two senior Supreme Court judges on Nov 14, who regretted the “hollowing out” of the Supreme Court in their parting letters. Internal security The same year, Pakistan was grappling with the severest resurgence of terrorism in over a decade. By the end of the first three quarters of 2025, Pakistan looked set to surpass the previous year’s numbers. Through the first 11 months, independent monitoring by the Centre for Research and Security Studies had established at least 3,187 fatalities from violence-related incidents, surpassing the entire 2024 total of 2,546 deaths by more than 25pc. Close to 1,200 terrorism incidents had been recorded, with security forces killing close to 1,800 terrorists in response. Like the preceding year, most of this violence remained concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. KP bore the brunt, thanks to relentless TTP assaults on security forces in the form of ambushes, suicide bombings, and raids. Balochistan saw a parallel rise in separatist attacks, with groups targeting infrastructure, convoys and ‘non-locals’. The March hijacking of the Jaffar Express, which resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds held hostage, was the highest-profile example of terrorist violence in the outgoing year. The year saw the term ‘ fitna ’ feature more consistently in security parlance, with ‘ Fitna al-Khawarij ’ and ‘ Fitna al-Hindustan ’ used as umbrella references to actors believed to either be affiliated with religious militants (khawarij) or foreign-backed elements (specifically, India). Introduced a year earlier, the narrative strategy seems to reflect a desire to focus the national security narrative on two hostile fronts, Afghanistan and India. Major security-related incidents were therefore categorised according to where the threat was perceived to have emanated from. The making of a field marshal THE charred remains of a school bus after May’s suicide bombing in Khuzdar. — Dawn archive The most perilous moment of the year arrived in May during the “ Marka-i-Haq ” (The Battle of Truth). Following a dastardly attack in Occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam region in April, New Delhi continuously blamed Pakistan — without any proof — of orchestrating the incident. The Pakistani military leadership, to its credit, was well-prepared for any misadventure. When it eventually transpired, in the form of airstrikes launched in the dead of the night under ‘Operation Sindoor’, Pakistan retaliated with a stunning counterpunch that saw multiple Indian jets shot down by the Pakistan Air Force with the help of superior tactics and technologies. That marked the start of the first high-intensity drone and missile battle between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. On May 10, Washington finally stepped into the fray, to de-escalate what the US president would later describe as imminent nuclear armageddon. The imprint left by this military standoff bears a closer look. One of the most consequential decisions taken by the Pakistani leadership in the aftermath was the promotion of the then-Chief of Army Staff, General Asim Munir, to the rank of Field Marshal. This made him only the second person in Pakistan’s history to hold the title. The move paid off in more ways than one. The promotion seems to have been aimed at establishing FM Munir as more than just a ‘general’. Becoming the face of Pakistan’s military prowess, he seems to have successfully secured the attention of the American president. Mr Trump would later describe FM Munir as his “favourite field marshal” . The relationship between the two appears to have been cemented during their first meeting, a private lunch in Washington in June, shortly after which Pakistan would publicly nominate Mr Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. FM Munir was subsequently elevated further to Chief of Defence Forces of Pakistan through the 27th Amendment. The post, which abolishes the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, introduced a unified command structure across the armed forces of Pakistan, making the CDF the highest-ranking officer of the army, navy and air force combined. This has placed unprecedented power and authority in the hands of the field marshal, giving him authority in making strategic decisions on behalf of the entirety of the armed forces. Whether this will yield more benefits, like reducing friction between Pakistan and potential military partners where it comes to strategic agreements, remains to be seen. With the Middle East in turmoil and new arrangements being shaped to ‘manage’ its affairs, Pakistan has emerged as one of the frontline players in the regional power matrix. It will seek to capitalise on this opportunity under its new CDF. Conclusion: a hardened state Pakistan witnessed a notable regression in civil rights in 2025, particularly in the realm of digital freedoms. It began with the enactment of more amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act to expand government powers over online content and expression. Critics argued that the vague provisions would enable further suppression of dissent, journalism, and criticism of state institutions. Protests by media organisations, and legal challenges in courts couldn’t amount to much. As 2025 closes, Pakistan is a country with a vastly different institutional map than it had a year ago. With a newly minted field marshal and a government-friendly Constitutional Court, the state has centralised power more than at any point in the last two decades. However, with millions directly suffering amidst a simmering economic crisis and denied a voice in their future, the ‘stability’ claimed by the leadership remains a thin veneer over a nation under deep stress. It is imperative upon the national leadership to secure a political ceasefire and chart a collective course forward. Immense resources have been expended on maintaining the status quo, even though it is clear it isn’t viable in the long term. The history of this present dispensation doesn’t offer much room for optimism, yet the desire for normalcy still survives. Perhaps 2026 will be the year it is finally realised. One can only hope for the best.",

      "summary_orig": "THIS was the year of stabilisation, when Pakistan’s economy was pulled out from one of the worst bouts of instability it had ever seen; 2025 was also the year when the limits of stability were discovered. Stability of the sort that an IMF programme brings is a strange place for any country to be. One cannot stay in that state for very long. In the case of Pakistan, an estimated 2.5 to three million new entrants enter the labour force every year and creating jobs for them is one of the biggest challenges for economic managers. Economists have estimated that a GDP growth rate of six per cent per annum is needed at a minimum to create enough jobs to productively employ all these people. That is the minimum required to keep pace with the core requirements of Pakistan’s society. Anything less and the ranks of the unemployed start to swell and with that comes widespread disaffection in society. If the trend of low growth and rising unemployment persists for a few years, the society turns into a pressure cooker. Pakistan teetered on this edge all through 2025. The economy had just emerged from one of the biggest bouts of instability it had ever seen in its history. An inflationary fire raged from 2021 all through 2023, reaching a historic peak of 38pc year-on-year in May of that year before tapering off all through 2024. Foreign exchange reserves hit near default levels in the summer of 2022 and remained at that level until an emergency bailout from the IMF in July 2023, which pulled the country away from the edge of catastrophe. They remained around $12 billion till the opening months of 2025 when they began to climb slowly, recovering to a level sufficient to pay for 2.5 months of imports only in the second half of the year. Both hallmarks of the extended post-Covid crisis that gripped Pakistan’s economy — inflation and foreign exchange reserve depletion — were overcome in 2025. This was the year stability took root and the economy turned the corner out of what was decidedly one of the gravest crises it had ever been through. At the start of the year the current account was registering strong surpluses, reaching $2.1bn by June 2025 , what the IMF described as “Pakistan’s first surplus in 14 years”. This helped lift foreign exchange reserves to above two months of import cover after many years, and put it on course to hit the projected level of 2.7 months of import cover by the middle of 2026. Two critical catastrophes were averted — default and inflation. But the problems had not been solved. Inflation also receded in 2025. Having hit a peak of 38pc in May 2023, the fire died down by the end of 2024 to reach single digits. At the opening of 2025 inflation was at an all-time low of less than 1pc before starting to rise again and hit 6pc by year end. The most ferocious inflationary fire that ever raged in Pakistan’s history was finally extinguished, and 2025 was the first full year when the economy saw low inflation since Covid. Two critical catastrophes were finally averted — default and inflation. But the problems had not been solved. This feat, of stabilising the economy, was achieved the same way it had always been done: with an IMF programme that immediately choked off all growth. GDP growth fell to around 3pc and according to the IMF programme signed in late 2024, it cannot revive much beyond that level for at least another two years, while the programme is still on and in its immediate aftermath. And therein lay the most critical problem facing the government and the economy. Inflation was doused and default was averted by extinguishing growth, which killed the demand for imports and brought down the trade deficit, and threw the current account into surplus. The State Bank ran up high interest rates in preceding years, cutting them slowly as inflation fell but stopped once they hit 11pc, drawing howls of protest from the business community. And the tax effort was ramped up. Business was now reeling beneath the weight of high taxes and high interest rates. All year this state of affairs continued with no relief in sight. By the time 2025 ended the prospects for growth still seemed remote but the outline of how the government intends to pull itself out of this quagmire began to take shape. The May war with India had sent a strong signal to countries around the world that Pakistan had built able defences for itself, and done so using Chinese technology. In the second half of the year countries began lining up to ask if Pakistan could help build such defences for them as well. A defence agreement was signed with Saudi Arabia and towards the end of 2025 the President of the UAE, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, also came to Pakistan for a trip that was in large part official, and in small part personal. And the privatisation of PIA later in the year heralded not just the restart of the privatisation programme that had been stalled since 2005. The participation of Fauji Fertiliser Company in the consortium that bought out the airline signalled an interest in the military to start acquiring stakes in the economy. Following the departure of Sheikh Zayed, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that an agreement has been reached on a debt equity swap where the UAE will accept shares of companies owned by the Fauji Foundation in return for its $1bn deposit that is set to mature in March of 2026. The outlines of how growth could be restarted had begun to appear. A new model of public-private ownership of large assets in sectors like infrastructure, minerals and others is likely going to be used to either attract direct investment from bilateral partners, or undertake more debt equity swaps against the deposits placed in Pakistan’s central bank by Gulf countries. The year 2025 was when the tide turned in the economy. Pakistan suddenly found a new place in the eyes of important countries around the world following its performance in the May war against India, and leveraged this to put in place bilateral partnerships that its government began using to help underwrite its transition from stabilisation to growth. In short, 2025 was the year when a new opportunity for a geopolitical rent dawned on the country and a path out of a crippling stabilisation programme began to open up. Depending on how the government plays its cards in the first few months of the new year, the transition to growth could come about in 2026. And in the process, the shape of Pakistan’s economy could undergo a profound structural transformation, just not of the sort that reform-minded economists have been calling for.",

And the tax effort was ramped up. Business was now reeling beneath the weight of high taxes and high interest rates. All year this state of affairs continued with no relief in sight. By the time 2025 ended the prospects for growth still seemed remote but the outline of how the government intends to pull itself out of this quagmire began to take shape. The May war with India had sent a strong signal to countries around the world that Pakistan had built able defences for itself, and done so using Chinese technology. In the second half of the year countries began lining up to ask if Pakistan could help build such defences for them as well. A defence agreement was signed with Saudi Arabia and towards the end of 2025 the President of the UAE, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, also came to Pakistan for a trip that was in large part official, and in small part personal. And the privatisation of PIA later in the year heralded not just the restart of the privatisation programme that had been stalled since 2005. The participation of Fauji Fertiliser Company in the consortium that bought out the airline signalled an interest in the military to start acquiring stakes in the economy. Following the departure of Sheikh Zayed, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that an agreement has been reached on a debt equity swap where the UAE will accept shares of companies owned by the Fauji Foundation in return for its $1bn deposit that is set to mature in March of 2026. The outlines of how growth could be restarted had begun to appear. A new model of public-private ownership of large assets in sectors like infrastructure, minerals and others is likely going to be used to either attract direct investment from bilateral partners, or undertake more debt equity swaps against the deposits placed in Pakistan’s central bank by Gulf countries. The year 2025 was when the tide turned in the economy. Pakistan suddenly found a new place in the eyes of important countries around the world following its performance in the May war against India, and leveraged this to put in place bilateral partnerships that its government began using to help underwrite its transition from stabilisation to growth. In short, 2025 was the year when a new opportunity for a geopolitical rent dawned on the country and a path out of a crippling stabilisation programme began to open up. Depending on how the government plays its cards in the first few months of the new year, the transition to growth could come about in 2026. And in the process, the shape of Pakistan’s economy could undergo a profound structural transformation, just not of the sort that reform-minded economists have been calling for.",

Three alarm bells in particular are sounding off: resurgent terrorism, economic fragility, and a steady squeeze on fundamental rights. None of these is new. What is new is the growing sense that the state is treating each as a problem to be managed, not solved, and that habit is becoming unaffordable. Terrorism remains the most immediate danger. Suicide bombings on police and security installations in Bannu and North Waziristan , the deadly blast near Islamabad’s district courts , and continuing violence in Balochistan demonstrated the capacity of terrorist networks. These incidents showed how violence is no longer geographically contained, nor confined to symbolic targets. Yet our counterterrorism efforts value force rather than reform. Policing capacity, prosecution, local governance and political engagement in conflict-affected districts remain weak. Unless these gaps are addressed, 2026 risks becoming another year in which attacks are condemned, investigations announced and root causes ignored. The economy presents a slower-burning crisis. The sale of a majority stake in PIA was hailed as a major breakthrough after decades of delay. It also highlighted how rare decisive action has become. One transaction, however, cannot substitute for the harder work of broadening the tax net, fixing other loss-making state enterprises, and building credibility through predictable policy. Without that, 2026 risks repeating the cycle of short-term fixes, periodic external support, and long stretches of stagnation. The more corrosive issue is the steady narrowing of civic space. Over the past year, prolonged internet shutdowns, restrictions on public assembly, pressure on journalists, and legal action against dissenting voices became routine. Media outlets faced censorship, digital platforms were blocked, and human rights organisations reported intimidation and administrative obstruction. Such measures may silence criticism, but they also weaken accountability and deepen public mistrust, especially among younger citizens already sceptical of political institutions. A state that relies on control rather than consent reduces its own capacity to govern and invites the very instability it claims to prevent. Institutions will therefore matter greatly in 2026. Parliament must reclaim its role as a forum for debate where laws are scrutinised before enforcement, not justified after the fact, and committees are allowed to function without pressure or haste. The judiciary must demonstrate consistency and independence, not selective urgency, by upholding due process without fear or favour. Economic decisions need clarity, consistency and equal application if confidence is to return. Security policy, meanwhile, must rest on civilian authority rather than a permanent sense of emergency.

      "summary_orig": "• Pildat report finds democratic institutions intact in form but constrained in practice • Says civilian govt endorses security-centric approach as regional tensions grow ISLAMABAD: With security taking precedence over democracy, year 2025 was characterised by consolidation and normalisation of the hybrid governance model rather than its disruption. While the democratic institutions are intact in form, their functioning has become increasingly constrained by a security-driven governance paradigm. This has been observed in an Assessment of the Quality of Democracy in Pakistan 2025, released by Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) on the last day of an eventful year. The security-driven environment, particularly since the brief but intense Pakistan-India armed conflict in May 2025, has further entrenched the security establishment’s influence over all matters, including democratic institutions and governance in Pakistan. This “hybrid” model has the full endorsement of the civilian government, which inc­reasingly views democracy through the lens of state survival. Regional security de­­vel­opments, including tensions with India and Afghanistan, alongside persistent inte­rnal insurgencies and intense political pola­ri­sa­tion, have all contributed to Pakistan’s reversion to becoming a security-centric state. Pildat notes that rather than strengthening civilian institutions, the role of “hybrid” entities such as the SIFC continued to expand, which operate outside conventional ministerial and parliamentary oversight structures. At the same time, the appointment of serving and retired military officers to civilian administrative posts, including the appointment of a serving major general to a key interior ministry position in August 2025, also blur the boundary between civilian governance and security institutions. The Pildat assessment highlights that 2025 marked the institutionalisation of a hybrid governance model in which democratic institutions operate within parameters increasingly defined by security threats and priorities as they now override democratic norms and principles. 27th Amendment Highlighting some key institutional developments during 2025, Pildat report says the parliament passed the consequential 27th Constitutional Amendment with limited debate and consensus. It observed that parliamentary representativeness and oversight were also weakened by continuing vacancies in the offices of Leader of the Opposition in both houses. Executive authority remained formally civilian but substantively constrained. The prime minister and defence minister’s statements regarding governing in collaboration with the establishment exemplified the formalisation of the hybrid model. Judiciary experienced significant structural changes during 2025 as the constitutional amendment created a new Federal Constitutional Court, continued operation of military courts for civilians as well as high-profile accountability proceedings conduc­ted under exceptional conditions collecti­vely raised concerns regarding due process. The security establishment’s role in natio­­nal decision-making became even more pro­m­­inent after major terrorist incidents, continued instability along the western border, and the India-Pakistan confrontation in 2025. Restructuring This was reflected in the restructuring of the military command through constitutional amendment, the elevation of the chief of army staff (COAS) to the rank of field marshal and increasing commentary by representatives of security institutions on governance and political issues. The COAS was formally notified to the ad­­ditional role of chief of defence forces (CDF) in December 2025. Later, his term as COAS-cum-CDF was extended till December 2030, with the possibility of another extension till 2035. In practice, the security sector operated with limited parliamentary oversight in 2025. The civilian government openly embraced a hybrid governance model, publicly endorsing joint civilian-military decision-making. By late 2025, the military establishment was also increasingly vocal in commenting on governance failures. In November, the DG ISPR described lack of governance in certain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as partially responsible for resurgence of terror attacks. A month earlier, the DG ISPR had warned against bringing in “anti-state” political leadership in KP. This increasingly open participation in governance and political discourse also reflected formalisation of the hybrid model. This hybrid model was reflected in the prominent role of the field marshal in both governance and diplomacy. He was present at events such as the Mineral Investment Forum 2025 in April and held exclusive meetings with various foreign dignitaries — including US President Trump in June, whom he then again met with the prime minister by his side in September 2025. It referred to the court martial and sentencing to 14 years’ rigorous imprisonment of former DG of ISI, retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, saying it marked an unprecedented accountability action within the security establishment.

It observed that parliamentary representativeness and oversight were also weakened by continuing vacancies in the offices of Leader of the Opposition in both houses. Executive authority remained formally civilian but substantively constrained. The prime minister and defence minister’s statements regarding governing in collaboration with the establishment exemplified the formalisation of the hybrid model. Judiciary experienced significant structural changes during 2025 as the constitutional amendment created a new Federal Constitutional Court, continued operation of military courts for civilians as well as high-profile accountability proceedings conduc­ted under exceptional conditions collecti­vely raised concerns regarding due process. The security establishment’s role in natio­­nal decision-making became even more pro­m­­inent after major terrorist incidents, continued instability along the western border, and the India-Pakistan confrontation in 2025. Restructuring This was reflected in the restructuring of the military command through constitutional amendment, the elevation of the chief of army staff (COAS) to the rank of field marshal and increasing commentary by representatives of security institutions on governance and political issues. The COAS was formally notified to the ad­­ditional role of chief of defence forces (CDF) in December 2025. Later, his term as COAS-cum-CDF was extended till December 2030, with the possibility of another extension till 2035. In practice, the security sector operated with limited parliamentary oversight in 2025. The civilian government openly embraced a hybrid governance model, publicly endorsing joint civilian-military decision-making. By late 2025, the military establishment was also increasingly vocal in commenting on governance failures. In November, the DG ISPR described lack of governance in certain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as partially responsible for resurgence of terror attacks. A month earlier, the DG ISPR had warned against bringing in “anti-state” political leadership in KP. This increasingly open participation in governance and political discourse also reflected formalisation of the hybrid model. This hybrid model was reflected in the prominent role of the field marshal in both governance and diplomacy.

      "summary": "• Pildat report finds democratic institutions intact in form but constrained in practice • Says civilian govt endorses security-centric approach as regional tensions grow ISLAMABAD: With security taking precedence over democracy, year 2025 was characterised by consolidation and normalisation of the hybrid governance model rather than its disruption. While the democratic institutions are intact in form, their functioning has become increasingly constrained by a security-driven governance paradigm. This has been observed in an Assessment of the Quality of Democracy in Pakistan 2025, released by Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) on the last day of an eventful year. The security-driven environment, particularly since the brief but intense Pakistan-India armed conflict in May 2025, has further entrenched the security establishment’s influence over all matters, including democratic institutions and governance in Pakistan. This “hybrid” model has the full endorsement of the civilian government, which inc­reasingly views democracy through the lens of state survival. Regional security de­­vel­opments, including tensions with India and Afghanistan, alongside persistent inte­rnal insurgencies and intense political pola­ri­sa­tion, have all contributed to Pakistan’s reversion to becoming a security-centric state. Pildat notes that rather than strengthening civilian institutions, the role of “hybrid” entities such as the SIFC continued to expand, which operate outside conventional ministerial and parliamentary oversight structures. At the same time, the appointment of serving and retired military officers to civilian administrative posts, including the appointment of a serving major general to a key interior ministry position in August 2025, also blur the boundary between civilian governance and security institutions. The Pildat assessment highlights that 2025 marked the institutionalisation of a hybrid governance model in which democratic institutions operate within parameters increasingly defined by security threats and priorities as they now override democratic norms and principles. 27th Amendment Highlighting some key institutional developments during 2025, Pildat report says the parliament passed the consequential 27th Constitutional Amendment with limited debate and consensus.

This is the third time the police have used force to break up the sit-in outside the prison. Imran’s sisters Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan, and Noreen Niazi, besides scores of supporters, have been staging weekly protests outside the jail to demand a meeting with Mr Khan. TTAP says struggle to continue despite govt ‘heavy-handedness’ Videos shared by the PTI Punjab account on the social media platform X after 1am showed water cannons targeting protesters. “In the severe cold, an attack with water cannons was carried out on unarmed, peaceful children, women, and citizens,” the X post said. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan condemned the use of water cannons and the arrest of Imran’s sisters and other PTI workers. The police, in a late-night operation, used water cannon to disperse the protesters and also arrested the sisters. However, they were later released near Chakri on the motorway. In its statement, the opposition alliance alleged that the water used to scatter the PTI supporters was laced with a chemical and hundreds of supporters were “badly affected”. The TTAP spokesperson said that such tactics would not deter them from their stance that the violation of basic human rights should be stopped. They will continue the struggle, the statement added. On the other hand, the PTI shared another list of six persons with the Adiala Jail administration, requesting it to allow them to meet Imran Khan on Thursday. The letter, written to the Adiala jail superintendent and signed by Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, mentioned Dr Amjad, Sibghatullah, Usman Bhattani, Jamal Khan, Iqbal Khattak, and Shoaib Ameer Awan. A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 has mandated that meetings with Imran will be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has recorded a significant drop in cross-border terrorist attacks and violence-linked fatalities after it closed down the border to Afghanistan on October 11. Terrorist attacks went down by almost 17 per cent in December, preceded by 9pc decline in November. Terrorist violence-linked fatalities among civilians and security officials also fell in the last quarter of 2025, by nearly 4pc and 19pc each in November and December, shows data collected by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) as part of its annual security report 2025 . With an almost 34pc surge in overall violence, the year 2025 went by as the most violent year for Pakistan in a decade, says the report. The country has suffered a sustained escalation in violence for five consecutive years since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan; with almost 38pc in 2021, over 15pc in 2022, 56pc in 2023, nearly 67pc in 2024, and 34pc in 2025. The comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveals a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2555 in 2024 to 3417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34pc year-on-year surge in violence. CRSS report says most significant surge in violence recorded in KP The most significant surge in violence was recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the fatalities rose from 1620 in 2024 to 2331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province. Balochistan also had an upward trend, with fatalities increasing from 787 to 956; an additional 169 deaths, which are nearly 22pc higher than the previous year’s figures. Regional impact of violence Violence remained heavily concentrated in the country’s northwestern KP and southwestern Balochistan provinces, with both accounting for over 96pc of all fatalities and almost 93pc of violent incidents recorded during the entire 2025. KP was the worst-hit region, suffering over 68pc (2331) of the total violence-linked fatalities, and around 63pc (795) of the incidents of violence, followed by Balochistan, accounting for 28pc (956) of the fatalities and over 30pc (386) of the incidents of violence. In contrast, Punjab and Sindh experienced comparatively lower levels of violence. The former recorded 25 incidents of violence resulting in 40 fatalities and 24 injuries, representing just 1.15pc of total casualties, while the latter saw 51 incidents causing 56 fatalities and 40 injuries; 1.73pc of the total. In Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory though incidents numbers remained minimal, the injury figures were relatively high, with the former recording 103 injuries, and the latter registering 38, from just five incidents at each location. Gilgit-Baltistan remained the least affected region. Compared to last year, though small in absolute numbers, the region recorded a four-fold increase from one to four fatalities.

Midnight arrived first on the islands closest to the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean, including Kiritimati (Christmas Island), Tonga and New Zealand. In Australia, Sydney began 2026 with a spectacular fireworks display, as per tradition. Some 40,000 pyrotechnic effects stretched 7 kilometres across buildings and barges along its harbour and featured a waterfall effect from the Sydney Harbour Bridge. This year, it was held under an enhanced police presence, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city. Fireworks explode over Sydney Harbour Bridge to mark the New Year in Sydney, Australia on January 1, 2026. — Reuters Organisers held a minute’s silence for the victims of the attack at 11pm local time (5pm PKT), with the Harbour Bridge lit up in white and a menorah — a symbol of Judaism — projected onto its pylons. “After a tragic end to the year for our city, we hope that New Year’s Eve will provide an opportunity to come together and look with hope for a peaceful and happy 2026,” Sydney’s Lord Mayor Clover Moore said ahead of the event. In Croatia, revels got off to an early start. Since 2000, the town of Fuzine has held its countdown at noon, a tradition that has since spread across the country. Crowds cheered, toasted each other with champagne and danced to music - all in the middle of the day. Some brave souls in Santa hats took a plunge into the icy waters of Lake Bajer. People celebrate the new year early at noon, on New Year’s Eve, by Lake Bajer in Fuzine, Croatia on December 31. — Reuters Elsewhere, preparations got underway for the more traditional midnight toast. In subzero temperatures in New York, organisers began putting up security barriers and stages ahead of the crowds that will flock to Times Square for the annual ball drop. In Seoul, thousands gathered at the Bosingak bell pavilion, where a bronze bell is struck 33 times at midnight — a tradition rooted in Buddhist cosmology, symbolising the 33 heavens. The chimes are believed to dispel misfortune and welcome peace and prosperity for the year ahead. Laser lights illuminate the midnight sky over the Lotte World Tower, South Korea’s tallest building in Seoul, South Korea during New Year’s Day celebrations on January 1, 2026. — AFP",

      "summary_orig": "Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday warned that any violation of the country’s integrity will be met with a “firm and decisive” response. The CDF made these remarks during the 18th National Workshop on Balochistan at General Headquarters (GHQ), where he highlighted the continued efforts of Indian sponsored proxies to “propagate violence and disrupt development”, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The statement added that the field marshal reaffirmed that these groups’ plans would be thwarted through “stern actions” by the security forces to rid the province of terrorism and unrest. “Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability, the COAS & CDF also emphasised that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity, whether direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response,” the statement read. “[The] Pakistan Armed Forces remain committed to protect the lives and well-being of its citizens.” The ISPR said that today’s workshop focused on exploring Balochistan’s socio-economic development and its strategic importance for Pakistan. In an address, Field Marshal Munir appreciated the resilience of the people of Balochistan and highlighted their pivotal importance for Pakistan’s prosperity and development. “He lauded the wide-ranging initiatives being undertaken by the federal and provincial governments, underscoring a people-centric approach that aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of the province and unlock its vast economic potential for the benefit of its people,” the statement added. According to the ISPR, the CDF also hailed the role of civil society in his address, highlighting their role in countering disinformation and propaganda, as well as their driving sustainable development. “He stressed the importance of rejecting vested political agendas to ensure that Balochistan’s future is shaped by long-term prosperity for all its residents,” the statement read. In May and October this year, Pakistan saw violations of its sovereignty by neighbours India and Afghanistan, respectively. The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire . Meanwhile, in October, Pakistan – Afghanistan relations deteriorated amid tensions over the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), with Islamabad pressing Kabul to curb cross-border terrorism. After border clashes on October 11, a temporary ceasefire followed talks in Doha and later in Istanbul, but successive rounds of negotiations failed to produce a workable solution despite mediation by Turkiye and Qatar. Pakistan has also witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025 , published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.",

      "summary_orig": "Speaker of the National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka on Wednesday, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May of this year. Relations between Islamabad and New Delhi reached their lowest point this year following an attack in Pahalagam, in Indian-occupied Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan, while Islamabad denied any connection and offered — and continues to offer — an independent probe. A press release from the NA Secretariat stated that during Sadiq’s visit to Dhaka for former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia’s funeral, Jaishankar approached him for a handshake. “Indian External Minister Dr S Jaishankar approached the Speaker [of the] National Assembly and shaked hands,” the press release read. “During this interaction, Dr S Jaishankar introduced himself to the speaker and told the speaker that he had recognised him [ sic ].” The press release added that since the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation“. Following the Pahalgam incident, India took a raft of unilateral diplomatic measures against Pakistan. Among the Indian measures, the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) stood out as the most severe. The 1960 pact, brokered by the World Bank, has endured through wars and decades of hostility. Its suspension, therefore, marked a watershed moment in the already fraught relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbours. India further lowered diplomatic ties by closing down the main border transit point, framing the attack as a grave provocation that warranted significant diplomatic, economic, and logistical pressure on Pakistan. Pakistan called for an independent and transparent investigation into the attack, strongly denying India’s accusations. However, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of a four-day clash between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire . In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance. Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab. At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty.",
