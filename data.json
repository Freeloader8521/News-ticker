A judge at the Seoul Central District Court approved the warrant, citing concerns that the suspect could flee or destroy evidence. The 30-something student, surnamed Oh, faces charges of benefiting the enemy and violating aviation safety and military installation laws by flying drones to North Korea four times from September to January.

      "summary_orig": "Multiple Indian and Afghan users on social media platform X shared visuals on February 27, claiming that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet amid the current conflict between the two countries. However, the visuals are doctored. The iVerify Pakistan team investigated this content and determined that it is false. To reach this conclusion, iVerify Pakistan analysed the visuals for discrepancies, verified aircraft serial records and ran the content through multiple AI-detection tools. Multiple Indian and Afghan users on social media platform X shared visuals on February 27, claiming that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet amid the current conflict between the two countries. However, the visuals are doctored. Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban, after the neighbouring country opened fire on multiple locations across the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on February 26. Authorities in Kabul had called it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend. On Feb 27, a pro-Afghan account shared an alleged video showing a downed Pakistani F-16 engulfed in flames on X with the following caption: “Big breaking news. This is a Pakistani military F-16, American-made, that Afghan defensive forces have shot down.” The post gained 773,700 views. The video with similar claims was subsequently shared by other propaganda — both pro-Afghan and pro-Indian — accounts, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . These accounts also shared still images of the alleged fighter jet. A pro-Afghan account shared the image with the following caption: “Security sources reported that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani jet that had entered Afghan territory. Security sources have confirmed this news to several media outlets.” That post gained 257,600 views. Other shares can be seen here , here , here and here . Another video of the same downed F-16 aircraft was also shared on X with the following caption: “Here’s his latest video.” The post gained 80,200 views. A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the current conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan. A keyword search was conducted to corroborate whether any credible mainstream international or Pakistani media outlets had reported any such alleged downing of an F-16 jet, but yielded no results. A close analysis of the viral videos and images revealed discrepancies in the aircraft’s markings. The serial number visible on the tail of the jet in the viral video is “85510”. The same serial number is also printed on the body of the aircraft in the viral video, whereas the body of the original F-16 aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) does not contain any serial number. Additionally, the size and proportions of the aircraft appear inconsistent when compared to verified images of an F-16. Furthermore, in the viral video, a structure appears to be protruding from the tail of the aircraft and sits above the exhaust. However, upon closer inspection of actual F-16 aircraft images, this particular feature is noticeably absent, with the exhaust instead jutting out from the body. Running the video through multiple AI-detection tools flagged it as being AI-generated. Attestiv.video gave it a 61 per cent suspicion rate, while AI or Not indicated the video was 70pc AI-generated and flagged the text in the video as 100pc AI-generated. When iVerify Pakistan contacted a Pakistan Air Force officer for comment, they too identified key discrepancies about the viral F-16 aircraft video and said the exhaust appeared disproportionately large compared to genuine F-16 models. The officer also said that the tail number did not match any existing F-16 aircraft in the air force. Contacted for comment, Dawn news editor Ali Osman said the jet’s dimensions were “distorted”, adding that the burn marks on the tail fin also looked irregular. A search of aircraft records on the f-16.net database shows that the serial number “85510” belongs to a United States F-16 aircraft that crashed in Arizona in 1990. The viral circulating image was also analysed using AI-detection tools, with Fake Image Detector flagging it as computer-generated or modified. The image presents the same discrepancy of a protruding part above the jet’s exhaust, unlike what a real jet looks like. The serial number is different as well, showing “85610” instead of “85510”. The image also features a random and unexplained grey block at the top. The second video of the same alleged crash was also analysed via Attestiv.video , which returned an 83pc suspicion rate. It also presented the inconsistency of a different serial number from the first video. Moreover, the flames and smoke clouds in the video also appeared unnatural and looked inconsistent. Therefore, the fact check determined that the claim that viral visuals show a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet allegedly shot down by Afghanistan amid the current conflict between the two countries is false. The visuals are doctored, as evidenced by being flagged by AI-detection tools, and present numerous discrepancies from what an actual F-16 jet looks like. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

Attestiv.video gave it a 61 per cent suspicion rate, while AI or Not indicated the video was 70pc AI-generated and flagged the text in the video as 100pc AI-generated. When iVerify Pakistan contacted a Pakistan Air Force officer for comment, they too identified key discrepancies about the viral F-16 aircraft video and said the exhaust appeared disproportionately large compared to genuine F-16 models. The officer also said that the tail number did not match any existing F-16 aircraft in the air force. Contacted for comment, Dawn news editor Ali Osman said the jet’s dimensions were “distorted”, adding that the burn marks on the tail fin also looked irregular. A search of aircraft records on the f-16.net database shows that the serial number “85510” belongs to a United States F-16 aircraft that crashed in Arizona in 1990. The viral circulating image was also analysed using AI-detection tools, with Fake Image Detector flagging it as computer-generated or modified. The image presents the same discrepancy of a protruding part above the jet’s exhaust, unlike what a real jet looks like. The serial number is different as well, showing “85610” instead of “85510”. The image also features a random and unexplained grey block at the top. The second video of the same alleged crash was also analysed via Attestiv.video , which returned an 83pc suspicion rate. It also presented the inconsistency of a different serial number from the first video. Moreover, the flames and smoke clouds in the video also appeared unnatural and looked inconsistent. Therefore, the fact check determined that the claim that viral visuals show a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet allegedly shot down by Afghanistan amid the current conflict between the two countries is false. The visuals are doctored, as evidenced by being flagged by AI-detection tools, and present numerous discrepancies from what an actual F-16 jet looks like. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran said on Friday that in order to reach a deal, the United States will have to drop its “excessive demands”, tempering the optimism expressed after talks seen as a last-ditch bid to avert war. The Oman-mediated talks follow repeated threats from US President Donald Trump to strike Iran, and with the United States conducting its biggest military build-up in the region in decades. Trump, on February 19, gave Iran 15 days to reach a deal, and while Iran has insisted the discussions focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran’s missile programme and its support for armed groups curtailed. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Trump’s negotiating team would demand that Iran dismantle its three main nuclear sites and hand over all its remaining enriched uranium to the United States. Without specifying what demands he was referring to, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Friday told his Egyptian counterpart that “success in this path requires seriousness and realism from the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands”. Following the talks in Geneva on Thursday, Araghchi told state TV that the negotiations “made very good progress and entered into the elements of an agreement very seriously, both in the nuclear field and in the sanctions field”. He said the next round would take place in “perhaps less than a week”, with technical talks at the UN’s nuclear agency to begin in Vienna on Monday. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi also announced technical discussions were to be held next week in Vienna. “We have finished the day after significant progress in the negotiation between the United States and Iran,” he said in a post on X. Araghchi, in a post on X, called the latest round of talks “the most intense so far”. “It concluded with the mutual understanding that we will continue to engage in a more detailed manner on matters that are essential to any deal — including sanctions termination and nuclear-related steps,” he wrote. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi joined the negotiations, a source close to the talks told AFP. ‘Big lies’ US President Donald Trump said in his State of the Union address that Iran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”. He also accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes. The accusations were delivered in the same forum in which then-President George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Iran is “not enriching right now, but they’re trying to get to the point where they ultimately can”, adding that Tehran “refuses” to discuss its ballistic missile programme and “that’s a big problem”. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic Republic was not “at all” seeking a nuclear weapon. US Vice President JD Vance told the Washington Post on Thursday there was “no chance” that a long-threatened strike on Iran would result “in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight”. Parallel to the talks is a dramatic US military buildup in the region, with the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week. Washington currently has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier — the USS Abraham Lincoln — nine destroyers, and three other combat ships. It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers in the region. The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed. However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000 km — less than a third of the distance to the continental United States. A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that the US briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. In January, Tehran launched a mass crackdown on nationwide protests . Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.",

      "summary_orig": "When states escalate, they are usually clear about their capacity and objectives. The Afghan Taliban, however, appeared to abandon that principle at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border last night, triggering an intense military confrontation — including airstrikes and artillery exchanges — across the Durand Line as well as deep into Afghan territory. The immediate backdrop of these tensions is not new. Islamabad has for years maintained that the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a Pakistani terrorist group affiliated with the Afghan Taliban, operated from Afghan soil because of the official patronage it enjoys there. Only hours before the latest crisis erupted, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi plainly stated that Pakistan’s quarrel was not with the Afghan people but with terrorist safe havens that threaten Pakistani lives. That was the political setting; it emphasised the need for patient engagement and discreet signalling. The Afghan Taliban, however, chose to announce what it described as “large-scale offensive operations” along multiple border towns, in a language that was both public and declaratory. A miscalculation by Kabul? There may have been reasons why the Taliban regime opted for that course. Firstly, the border remains, in the Afghan political imagination, a colonial imposition. Secondly, the Taliban leadership sought to signal that it would not acquiesce to cross-border action, especially after Islamabad’s February 22 strikes against terrorist sanctuaries on the Afghan territory, and frame the move as a defence of territorial integrity. However misplaced that logic may be, given that the initial breach of Afghan sovereignty occurred when terrorist groups were allowed sanctuary there, the public mobilisation still serves a domestic purpose as it projects resolve to constituencies that expect the regime to defend Afghan soil. Another calculation may have been that the escalation would remain contained. There is precedent. In October last year, after intense clashes , back channels and Qatari-Turkiye mediation produced a ceasefire . Though the understanding was uneasy, it worked. Kabul may have assumed that another round of tit-for-tat exchanges would similarly be cooled by intermediaries once tempers had flared. But that assumption proved risky. Pakistan responded not with ambiguity but with a named operation — “ Ghazab lil-Haq ” or “Righteous Fury” — and carried out airstrikes that reached deep into Afghan territory, including targets around Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia and Nangarhar. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif spoke in unusually blunt terms , saying patience had reached its limit and characterised the situation as open war. Pakistan’s logic was clear. Terrorism inside the country surged after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021, and even more sharply over the past year and a half. As a result, there is zero tolerance in Islamabad for threats perceived to be emanating from Afghan soil. In that context, a declared offensive by Afghan forces against Pakistani positions was unlikely to go unanswered because any perception of restraint in the face of a televised provocation would have carried both morale and political costs. Resultantly, there was a spiral which neither side could easily control. Casualty figures differ widely, with claims and counterclaims dominating the official messaging. Beyond the battlefield But far from the borders and the war zones lies the question of strategic arithmetic. The Taliban’s strengths are rooted in unconventional and guerrilla-style warfare, whereas Pakistan’s advantages lie in its conventional force structure, air power and deterrent capability. It implies that a head-on military contest would therefore never favour Kabul. That is where the Taliban appear to have misstepped; by shifting the theatre from deniable sub-conventional activity to overt interstate confrontation, they exposed themselves to costs they were ill-equipped to absorb. Yet, force alone will not settle the underlying grievance. Islamabad’s central complaint is neither territorial expansion nor ideological contest; rather, it is the presence of terrorists who strike inside Pakistan while operating from Afghan soil. The concern is not merely rhetorical. Year after year, United Nations Security Council monitoring reports have documented the continued presence and activity of the TTP in Afghanistan and described linkages between the group and the Taliban regime. The international record, therefore, is also clear. Now that the issue is terrorist sanctuaries, the remedy cannot be spectacle. It has to be structural. First, Kabul will need to address, credibly and verifiably, the question of armed groups operating from its soil; mere denials will not suffice. Secondly, regional stakeholders with access to both capitals should be re-engaged at senior levels.Qatar and Saudi Arabia facilitated de-escalation in October last year. They are trying again. Others with leverage, including China and Turkey, can play quiet roles. Russia and Iran, too, have offered their good offices. Third, both sides must reduce the temperature of public rhetoric since declarations of open war may satisfy domestic audiences but would complicate compromise, which has to ultimately happen. There is no gainsaying the fact that there are no simple exits in such scenarios. Escalation acquires its own momentum, and each strike invites a reply, narrowing the space for discretion. As a result, economies suffer, border communities absorb the shock, and terrorist groups thrive. For durable security, Islamabad must convert its battlefield advantage into diplomatic leverage rather than allow it to harden into permanent hostility. Meanwhile, this conflict must drive home to Kabul that a policy of hosting terrorist sanctuaries carries strategic costs. If that lesson is not absorbed, what is now a crisis will solidify into a recurring pattern, and hostility will become entrenched.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Pakistan’s security forces carried out a robust retaliatory response following unprovoked aggression by Afghan Taliban in the border areas of South Waziristan Lower, security sources said on Friday. According to officials, an intense exchange of fire continued throughout the night along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. However, the situation has since calmed after the firing subsided by morning. Security sources stated that the Pakistan Army responded swiftly and in a coordinated manner by targeting multiple Afghan Taliban checkposts located across the border in Afghanistan’s Paktia province. During the operation, Pakistani forces reportedly took control of five key Afghan checkposts and raised the national flag at the captured locations. Among the posts brought under control were two opposite Shawal, two facing the Angoor Adda sector, and one located opposite Zarmilan, security sources confirmed. The operation, officials said, was aimed at restoring stability in the sensitive border region and effectively countering hostile activities. Sources further revealed that Pakistani forces also destroyed an Afghan terminal in the Angoor Adda area, which was allegedly being used for military-related purposes. As a result of the strong and coordinated response by Pakistani forces, Afghan Taliban elements reportedly suffered significant losses. Security officials confirmed that the Afghan Charlie Post and Afghan Babri Post in the Angoor Adda sector were completely destroyed during the engagement. Authorities described the military response as a defensive measure intended to safeguard Pakistan’s territorial integrity and preempt any potential threats arising from cross-border hostilities. While the situation remains tense, security forces are said to be on high alert and fully prepared to respond to any further aggression. Officials added that developments in the border belt are being closely monitored to prevent escalation and maintain stability in the region. Guns fall silent in Landi Kotal With guns falling silent on the border, authorities are busy ascertaining any damage caused by last night’s artillery firing from the Afghan side. Residents in Landi Kotal said they spent a sleepless night due to the continuous noise of heavy gunfire, which caused panic among the civilians located in the area. Residents in Landi Kotal also held a demonstration against what they called the unprovoked aggression from the Afghan side, calling for an early ceasefire.",

The action — dubbed ‘Ope­ration Ghazab Lil Haq’ — continued into the early hours of Friday, and by state media reports suggested the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had joined the response, targeting Afghan positions, including an ammunition depot in Nangarhar province, inflicting substantial damage. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) until going to press. Authorities in Kabul had claimed launching a large-scale offensive, calling it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend. Islamabad squarely blames Kabul for allowing terrorists aligned with the outlawed TTP and so-called Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) groups to use its soil as a safe haven. Earlier, in its weekly briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Office had said that the strikes against terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan were carried out to pre-empt imminent attacks inside Pakistan, and that utmost caution was exercised to avoid civilian casualties. ‘Heavy casualties inflicted’ According to the information ministry, Pakistani forces had inflicted heavy losses on the Afghan Taliban in the Chitral, Khyber, Mohmand, Kurram and Bajaur sectors. According to security sources, Afghan Taliban fired at various places on the Pak-Afghan border. A counter-attack saw their positions destroyed, forcing the Afghan fighters to flee, they said. Giving details, sources said that Afghan positions across the border from the Chitral and Bajaur sectors were destroyed, while forces responded with full force to excursions in the Nawagai sector of Bajaur, Tirah in Khyber, Mohmand district and the Arandu sector of Chitral. VISUALS broadcast by state media in the early hours of Friday show a suspected ammunition depot in Nangarhar province, which was reportedly destroyed in a Pakistan Air Force strike.— X / RadioPakistan and PTVNewsOfficial In a late night tweet, Info­rmation Minister Attaullah Tarar said that at least 36 Afghan Taliban attackers had been killed by Pakistani forces. However, subsequent reports by state-run Pakistan Television put the toll at 58. In a post on X, PTV News said over 100 Taliban fighters had been injured, at least 12 Afghan posts had been completely destroyed, while five of their positions had been captured Mr Tarar also said that two Pakistan Army personnel had been martyred, while three were injured, in the line of duty. He accused the Taliban regime of launching attacks in Pakistan’s border regions in defence of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) outlaws, adding that Kabul’s patronage of terrorists had been laid bare for the world to see. The information minister also refuted claims by Afghan and Indian media of killing or capturing dozens of Pakistani soldiers, asserting that the Taliban regime had resorted to “propaganda and lies to cover up its embarrassment”. Ground reports According to reports from areas along the border, Afghan fighters initiated hostilities around Iftar time near Torkham and Landi Kotal. Local sources said that artillery shells were fired from the Afghan side, at least two of which fell in open areas, causing no damage to life or property. In addition, Afghan families cleared by the authorities to return to their country — who were waiting at Zero Point for their departure — had been sent back to the Landi Kotal holding center as the security situation deteriorated at the border crossing point. The Torkham border has been closed since October 12 last year due to the diplomatic row between the two countries. Afghan shelling in Bajaur’s Lowi Mamund tehsil resulted in injuries to five people, including three women. The injured were being treated at DHQ Khar. State-run Pakistan TV also carried visuals from a mosque that was damaged after being targeted by Afghan fire. Witnesses in Mohmand also reported also reported intense fighting, but there was no word on casualties from the area. An exchange of fire was also reported from Kurram and the Angoor Adda border area. No quarrel with ordinary Afghans: FO Earlier, at his weekly media briefing, FO spokesman Tahir Andrabi said that Pakistan’s actions over the weekend “were proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence”. Military officials said the operation destroyed seven terrorist targets and killed between 70 and 80 terrorists. Afghan authorities, however, had alleged civilian casualties and condemned the strikes as a violation of their sovereignty. Responding to questions about civilian harm, Mr Andrabi said the “intelligence-based selective targeting” of these seven terrorist camps and hideouts, located in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, were “primarily to ensure safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions,” he said. Addressing bilateral tensions, he said Pakistan’s dispute was not with the Afghan people. “In terms of people-to-people relations, we have nothing against the people of Afghanistan. The contentious issue is the terrorist outfits that operate in Afghanistan, and the official support and impunity being offered to that terrorism. “As regards the people of Afghanistan, we respect them, and we have traditional historic linguistic ties with them. We do not wish any harm to the Afghan people,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "NARENDRA Modi is no stranger to genocides. He acquired the moniker ‘Butcher of Gujrat’ for presiding over anti-Muslim pogroms as chief minister in 2002. By undertaking a highly choreographed official visit to Tel Aviv, Modi is both rubber-stamping the Netanyahu regime’s genocidal assaults on Gaza and cementing the alliance between the fanatical creeds of Hindutva and Zionism. The Christian Right has already upended ‘normal’ politics in the US by projecting a millenarian vision of the world that can only be achieved by totalitarian and violent means. Trumpism is now an entrenched, grassroots phenomenon that will very likely outlive Donald Trump. Meanwhile, various shades of both secular and religious right are running riot across Europe, with fearmongering about cultural invasions by the proverbial immigrant. Despite their best pretensions, Muslim countries do not buck the trend. Reac­tio­n­a­­ry politics and repressive state nationalism are the order of the day across large swathes of the Arab world, Southwest Asia and the world’s largest Muslim state, Indonesia. The current hybrid regime in this country presents itself as a leader of this putatively coherent bloc of countries. Some believe that this notional ‘Muslim’ bloc, along with other constituent parts of the ‘Global South’, can become a bulwark against US imperialism, Zionism and Hin­dutva. An ostensibly pro-people group of countries can now even rely on a superpower, China, to both resist the US-Israel-India axis and even usher the world towards a new tomorrow. Reactionary politics and repressive state nationalism dominate. The hypothesis is backed up by reference to some recent developments. Most notable was Pakistan’s successful deployment of Chinese-made aircraft to down India’s French-made fleet (and its armoury of Israeli drones). The subsequent defence agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, as well as the former’s growing export of arms more generally, is also present as evidence of a burgeoning security alliance to resist Zionist aggression. There is even an argument that Iran has, as yet, not suffered a major assault because the ‘Muslim’ bloc, China and other countries have stood firm in its defence. The fundamental problem with this hy­­pothesis is that there are just as many, if not more, examples that disprove it. To begin with, the notional bloc is united in its desire to win the good graces of the Trump White House. The calamitous ‘ Board of Peace ’ is just the tip of the iceberg. Military contr­a­cts and cooperation between Muslim countries and the US are old news. Pakistan’s mi­­litarised ruling class, like many of its ‘Mus­­lim brethren’, is inking all sorts of minerals, crypto and other deals with the US. The Gulf states do big business with India, not to mention happily call it a strategic par­­tner. The UAE even boasts annual bilateral trade with Israel in excess of $3 billion. On the other end of the planet, Venezuela and Cuba are amongst the few states in our world that clearly articulate an anti-imperialist policy. How many countries stood up for Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro when he was kidnapped by US commandos in broad daylight? He still languishes in a New York jail. Then there is Cuba, which, for those who do not remember, sent a team of its inimitable doctors to lead the relief effort after the massive 2005 earthquake in Azad Kashmir. Subsequently, hundreds of Pakistani students have received Cuban government scholarships to study medicine in Havana. Cuba today is literally being strangulated by a vicious US oil embargo. How many of the world’s countries are demanding a lifting of both the oil blockade and other long-running economic sanctions? Global geopolitical change is happening. At the bro­a­dest level of ana­­­ly­-sis, we are living thr­­­­ough an age of intense reaction, the Hindutva-Zio­n­ist-Christian Right nexus amongst the most prominent em­­-bodiments of this global moment. But Pakistan, other Muslim countries and, frankly, most of the world’s states, are anything but bastions of anti-imperialism. The religious right remains highly influential here too — the Afghan Taliban fiasco yet again proves the disastrous consequences of state patronage for militant Islamism. More generally, money talks; ruling classes everywhere are increasingly using state nationalism as a ruse to camouflage the universal pretensions of capital, including the immense contradictions generated by neoliberal globalisation. The only silver lining is the many Indians who oppose Modi; the many Americans who oppose Trump; and the brave few within the Zionist entity who stand for Palestinian liberation. Progressive segments continue to resist state and class power in Pakistan too. It is these pro-people elements, across nation-state boundaries, that counter reactionaries in their own midst. This is why we can continue to hope. The writer teaches at Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad. Published in Dawn, February 27th, 2026",

To begin with, the notional bloc is united in its desire to win the good graces of the Trump White House. The calamitous ‘ Board of Peace ’ is just the tip of the iceberg. Military contr­a­cts and cooperation between Muslim countries and the US are old news. Pakistan’s mi­­litarised ruling class, like many of its ‘Mus­­lim brethren’, is inking all sorts of minerals, crypto and other deals with the US. The Gulf states do big business with India, not to mention happily call it a strategic par­­tner. The UAE even boasts annual bilateral trade with Israel in excess of $3 billion. On the other end of the planet, Venezuela and Cuba are amongst the few states in our world that clearly articulate an anti-imperialist policy. How many countries stood up for Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro when he was kidnapped by US commandos in broad daylight? He still languishes in a New York jail. Then there is Cuba, which, for those who do not remember, sent a team of its inimitable doctors to lead the relief effort after the massive 2005 earthquake in Azad Kashmir. Subsequently, hundreds of Pakistani students have received Cuban government scholarships to study medicine in Havana. Cuba today is literally being strangulated by a vicious US oil embargo. How many of the world’s countries are demanding a lifting of both the oil blockade and other long-running economic sanctions? Global geopolitical change is happening. At the bro­a­dest level of ana­­­ly­-sis, we are living thr­­­­ough an age of intense reaction, the Hindutva-Zio­n­ist-Christian Right nexus amongst the most prominent em­­-bodiments of this global moment. But Pakistan, other Muslim countries and, frankly, most of the world’s states, are anything but bastions of anti-imperialism. The religious right remains highly influential here too — the Afghan Taliban fiasco yet again proves the disastrous consequences of state patronage for militant Islamism. More generally, money talks; ruling classes everywhere are increasingly using state nationalism as a ruse to camouflage the universal pretensions of capital, including the immense contradictions generated by neoliberal globalisation. The only silver lining is the many Indians who oppose Modi; the many Americans who oppose Trump; and the brave few within the Zionist entity who stand for Palestinian liberation.

      "title": "Age of reaction",
      "summary": "NARENDRA Modi is no stranger to genocides. He acquired the moniker ‘Butcher of Gujrat’ for presiding over anti-Muslim pogroms as chief minister in 2002. By undertaking a highly choreographed official visit to Tel Aviv, Modi is both rubber-stamping the Netanyahu regime’s genocidal assaults on Gaza and cementing the alliance between the fanatical creeds of Hindutva and Zionism. The Christian Right has already upended ‘normal’ politics in the US by projecting a millenarian vision of the world that can only be achieved by totalitarian and violent means. Trumpism is now an entrenched, grassroots phenomenon that will very likely outlive Donald Trump. Meanwhile, various shades of both secular and religious right are running riot across Europe, with fearmongering about cultural invasions by the proverbial immigrant. Despite their best pretensions, Muslim countries do not buck the trend. Reac­tio­n­a­­ry politics and repressive state nationalism are the order of the day across large swathes of the Arab world, Southwest Asia and the world’s largest Muslim state, Indonesia. The current hybrid regime in this country presents itself as a leader of this putatively coherent bloc of countries. Some believe that this notional ‘Muslim’ bloc, along with other constituent parts of the ‘Global South’, can become a bulwark against US imperialism, Zionism and Hin­dutva. An ostensibly pro-people group of countries can now even rely on a superpower, China, to both resist the US-Israel-India axis and even usher the world towards a new tomorrow. Reactionary politics and repressive state nationalism dominate. The hypothesis is backed up by reference to some recent developments. Most notable was Pakistan’s successful deployment of Chinese-made aircraft to down India’s French-made fleet (and its armoury of Israeli drones). The subsequent defence agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, as well as the former’s growing export of arms more generally, is also present as evidence of a burgeoning security alliance to resist Zionist aggression. There is even an argument that Iran has, as yet, not suffered a major assault because the ‘Muslim’ bloc, China and other countries have stood firm in its defence. The fundamental problem with this hy­­pothesis is that there are just as many, if not more, examples that disprove it.

      "summary_orig": "CONSIDERING the relentless wave of terrorist attacks Pakistan has been facing over the past few weeks, the administration has done the right thing by bringing all stakeholders on board in order to formulate a comprehensive response. Moreover, keeping in mind the growing footprint of IS-K locally, it is all the more necessary to neutralise this terrorist group before it can cause further havoc. A meeting of federal and provincial officials, including senior police officers, on Wednesday decided to confront the wave of terrorism as a “top priority”, with the centre assuring the provinces of provision of resources and technical support. The minister of state for interior, who chaired the meeting, told this paper that the bases of terrorist groups responsible for bloodshed in Pakistan — including the Islamabad imambargah attack — were targeted in Afghanistan, and separately commented that retaliatory attacks were expected after Pakistan took military action. Afghanistan’s unprovoked firing at Pakistani positions on Thursday has confirmed these apprehensions. Just as the nation came together in the past in the aftermath of the APS tragedy to formulate the National Action Plan, a similar effort is required today to confront the menace of terrorism. Working in silos is not an option; all pillars of the state must work in tandem to defeat terrorism. In this regard, while political differences can exist between the centre and the provincial governments, all stakeholders need to be on the same page to ensure maximum security for all. The framework exists for a robust counterterrorism drive, such as NAP 2.0 as well as Nacta and the creation of the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre last year. Just as Pakistan was able to quell the wave of terrorist violence during previous years, it can do so again if holistic policies are pursued, with buy-in from all. The state cannot control what occurs beyond its borders; but internal security can certainly be better managed by cracking down on terrorists and their facilitators. In this regard, it has emerged that IS-K may prove to be a bigger security threat than the banned TTP — the latter group being at the forefront of the current wave of violence. As reported in this paper, following the Islamabad imambargah attack the mastermind of the atrocity was traced to Nowshera in KP. Subsequent investigations revealed that the suspect was leading an active IS-K cell in Bajaur. This gang had reportedly been responsible for several targeted killings and suicide bombings, while women were also active members of the cell. One of the women members had reportedly delivered the suicide vest to the capital for the Islamabad bombing. Further probes are required to break any connected cells, with thorough action against IS-K terrorists within the country. Published in Dawn, February 27th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "GENEVA: Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip seem aimed at creating “permanent demographic change”, UN rights chief Volker Turk said on Thursday. “Taken together, Israel’s actions appear aimed at making a permanent demographic change in Gaza and the West Bank, raising concerns about ethnic cleansing”, Turk said in a speech before the UN’s Human Rights Council in Geneva. Turk pointed in particular to an ongoing, year-long Israeli military operation in the West Bank’s north that has caused the displacement of 32,000 Palestinians. Elsewhere in the West Bank, entire Bedouin herder communities have been displaced by increasing harassment and violence from Israeli settlers, including near Mikhmas to the east of Ramallah, and Ras Ein al-Auja, in the Jordan Valley, since the start of the year. In addition to roughly three million Palestinians, more than 500,000 Israelis live in settlements and outposts in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law. Far-right minister Smotrich vows to encourage ‘emigration’ from Palestinian territories Israel has approved a series of initiatives this month backed by far-right ministers, including launching a process to register land in the West Bank as “state property” and allowing Israelis to purchase land there directly, in a move condemned by several countries as well as Hamas. Israel’s current government has accelerated settlement expansion, approving a record 54 settlements in 2025, according to Israeli settlement watchdog NGO Peace Now. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. ‘Maximum land, minimum Arabs’ In the Gaza Strip, most of the territory’s 2.2 million inhabitants have been displaced at least once since the start of the conflict on October 7, 2023. “Intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the denial of humanitarian assistance appeared to aim at a permanent demographic shift in Gaza”, the UN human rights office said in a report last week. Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also vowed to encourage “emigration” from the Palestinian territories in February. “We will finally, formally and in practical terms nullify the cursed Oslo Accords and embark on a path toward sovereignty, while encouraging emigration from both Gaza and Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the Biblical term for the West Bank. “There is no other long-term solution,” added Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank. “They want maximum land and minimum Arabs”, Fathi Nimer, a researcher with Palestinian think tank Al-Shabaka, said, referring to a commonly used phrase used to describe Israeli settlement tactics.

      "summary": "GENEVA: Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip seem aimed at creating “permanent demographic change”, UN rights chief Volker Turk said on Thursday. “Taken together, Israel’s actions appear aimed at making a permanent demographic change in Gaza and the West Bank, raising concerns about ethnic cleansing”, Turk said in a speech before the UN’s Human Rights Council in Geneva. Turk pointed in particular to an ongoing, year-long Israeli military operation in the West Bank’s north that has caused the displacement of 32,000 Palestinians. Elsewhere in the West Bank, entire Bedouin herder communities have been displaced by increasing harassment and violence from Israeli settlers, including near Mikhmas to the east of Ramallah, and Ras Ein al-Auja, in the Jordan Valley, since the start of the year. In addition to roughly three million Palestinians, more than 500,000 Israelis live in settlements and outposts in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law. Far-right minister Smotrich vows to encourage ‘emigration’ from Palestinian territories Israel has approved a series of initiatives this month backed by far-right ministers, including launching a process to register land in the West Bank as “state property” and allowing Israelis to purchase land there directly, in a move condemned by several countries as well as Hamas. Israel’s current government has accelerated settlement expansion, approving a record 54 settlements in 2025, according to Israeli settlement watchdog NGO Peace Now.

      "summary_orig": "GENEVA/BERLIN: A new decree from Afghanistan’s Taliban government is set to further crush rights and freedoms in the war-torn nation, especially for women, UN human rights chief Volker Turk said on Thursday. The Taliban has restricted women’s movements and barred girls from education beyond primary school since coming to power in 2021, via a series of morality laws that also limit expression and employment. Turk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said a decree signed by Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada last month “defines several crimes and punishments that contravene Afghanistan’s international legal obligations”. “It provides for the use of corporal punishment for numerous offences, including in the home, legitimising violence against women and children,” he told a Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva. Germany deports 20 convicted criminals to Afghanistan “The decree, which is expected to come into effect soon, extends the number of offences that carry the death penalty.” The decree also criminalises criticism of the de facto leadership and its policies, in violation of freedom of expression and assembly, he said. Detailed provisions of the decree have not been officially published by the Taliban’s Ministry of Justice or Supreme Court, and this news agency has not been able to obtain the text from officials. Turk urged the Taliban to rescind the decree, impose a moratorium on executions and end corporal punishment, saying women and girls face persecution under a system he likened to gender apartheid. The Taliban says women’s rights are internal matters and should be addressed locally. Afghans deported Germany on Thursday deported 20 convicted criminals to Afghanistan under a new agreement reached with the Taliban government to allow direct expulsions, the interior ministry said. Berlin had already resumed deporting criminals to Afghanistan in 2024, using Qatar as an intermediary. But the agreement reached to enable Thursday’s flight “creates a reliable basis for direct and permanent deportations to Afghanistan”, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said. Those deported were men who had committed crimes in Germany, including sexual offences, bodily harm and drug offences, according to the interior ministry. “Our society has an interest in ensuring that criminals leave our country. That is why we are acting consistently and expanding deportations step by step,” Dobrindt said. Germany stopped deportations to Afghanistan and closed its embassy in Kabul following the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. But it resumed them as part of efforts to take a tougher line on migration to counter the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Two deportation flights of convicted Afghans have left Germany since 2021: 28 were returned in autumn 2024 and 81 in July last year. Germany’s interior ministry had announced last year that direct discussions were taking place with the Taliban authorities. But the talks are controversial because Berlin does not recognise the Taliban administration in Kabul. Published in Dawn, February 27th, 2026",

They also testified that no announcement was made about the fire to alert the people present in the shopping centre as the fire engulfed it. One of the survivors also pointed out that apart from one or two gates, the rest of the exit points of the building were closed. The single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court was tasked with probing the devastating blaze and fixing responsibility for any acts of commission or omission committed prior to and subsequent to the tragic incident. Ali Haider turned up and deposed that he was working as a salesman at a luggage shop on the ground floor of Gul Plaza, and his workplace was located near a gate opening towards the M.A. Jinnah Road. Wonder why no fire alarm sounded, most exit points were found closed He stated that he was about to close the shop on Jan 17 at around 10:15pm and suddenly noticed smoke on the floor and thus, he left the shop and saw a fire erupting on the mezzanine floor. The witness also said that he came back to his shop at around 10:30pm to check if things were normal there, as thick smoke was rapidly spreading across the floor. His shop also caught fire in the next 10 minutes, since the luggage / items in it were flammable. Therefore, he further testified, he fell unconscious after two fibre luggage pieces burst close to him, and upon regaining consciousness, he found himself in a hospital. Mr Haider, in his statement, maintained that apart from one or two gates, the rest of the exits were closed, and he had not noticed any fire tenders or rescue agencies on the site before falling unconscious. “It is further added that until the time of my falling conscious, there was no announcement of the fire made, nor did any person come to rescue the trapped people inside the building, either from the management side or from any government agency,” his testimony concluded. Mohammad Junaid deposed that he had been working at a crockery shop on the mezzanine floor of the plaza for the last four years, and they were moving out after closing the shop at 10:15pm. However, the owner of the shop suddenly realised that he had forgotten his cellphone inside the shop, and at the same time they noticed thick smoke spreading in the building and thereafter they realised severity of the smoke and fire, he added. The witness also testified that he, along with two other persons who had worked in the same market / floor, attempted to escape at around 11:15pm and somehow managed to come out of the burning building through a bathroom’s side exit at around 11:30pm as there were no passages visible due to thick smoke. Therefore, he further said, an Edhi ambulance had shifted him to a hospital due to chest congestion and suffocation caused by the smoke. Mr Junaid deposed that no announcement was made about the fire until their evacuation, and nobody came to rescue the stranded people inside the building, either from the building’s management side or any government agency. Around 80 people had lost their lives in the deadly inferno which erupted on the night of Jan 17 and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished. The fire left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some of its sections collapsed. Published in Dawn, February 27th, 2026",

During his visit to the residence of Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz in Mansehra to offer condolences, the PM assured the officer’s family of the government and the Pakistan Army’s full support. “We, the federal government and the Pakistan Army, are with you and will never leave you alone, as Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz Tanoli is our pride and embraced martyrdom while gallantly commanding forces against the country’s enemies,” he assured the family members. The PM said that Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz laid down his life while safeguarding the country, setting an example of bravery and courage. “The entire nation and I are proud of our martyrs and their families and would never forget the sacrifices they rendered for our motherland,” PM Shehbaz added. He also announced the establishment of a Daanish school named after the slain officer to commemorate his martyrdom. He also visited the grave of the fallen officer to offer Fateha. On Feb 21, Lt Col Gul Faraz and sepoy Karamat Shah were martyred in the suicide bombing during an intelligence-based operation in Bannu district, the Inter-Services Public Relations had said. Ramazan package The PM formally launched the Rs38 billion Ramazan package to provide financial support to deserving families across the country. While chairing a meeting on the Ramazan Relief Package, PM Shehbaz termed the assistance package “the largest and most comprehensive”, saying that the amount per household had been increased from Rs5,000 to Rs13,000. According to the premier, the disbursement will follow a “transparent digital system successfully used last year”. Cash assistance is being delivered directly to beneficiaries through digital wallets, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and respect for recipients’ dignity by eliminating long queues, he added. The PM was briefed that 64 per cent of the eligible individuals had received financial assistance eight days into Ramazan, while the verification and distribution of money to the remaining beneficiaries had been underway. The briefing also noted that 12 banks and fintech companies were partnering with the government for distribution, and the beneficiaries had completed 1.1 million digital transactions and over 1.227 million automated calls had been made to inform people about the assistance package. The prime minister praised the performance of departments involved in the disbursement of the package, saying that the digital wallet system provided a convenient and transparent means of reaching beneficiaries.

      "title_orig": "Strikes in Afghanistan carried out to ensure safety of Pakistani citizens, prevent imminent terrorist attacks: FO",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday said that Pakistan’s recent strikes against neighbouring Afghanistan were carried out to ensure the “safety of Pakistani citizens” and to prevent “imminent terrorist attacks”. FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi made the statement while responding to a question during his weekly press briefing . Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year. During Thursday’s press briefing, the FO spokesperson was asked about civilian casualties in the strikes, the total number of terrorists killed, and the locations of the camps targeted. In his response, he said, “Let me begin by reiterating that the intelligence-based selective targeting of these seven terrorist camps and their hideouts in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, was primarily to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions”. Andrabi stressed that the strikes were “proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence and were directed solely against identified terrorist camps and hideouts”. “We exercised utmost caution to prevent any harm to civilians,” the spokesperson said. He recalled statements made by the UN Security Council in reaction to terrorist attacks against Pakistan, with the latest being about the February 6 attack on an imambargah in Islamabad. The spokesperson maintained that the UNSC had “repeatedly underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, abettors, sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”. He further added that the UNSC had also urged states to cooperate with Pakistan in the matter, stressing that Pakistan’s actions must be viewed through the above-mentioned context. He said that Pakistan “remained committed to peace in the region” and called on the Afghan Taliban government to “comply with these obligations”. However, FO maintained that Pakistan would take “all necessary measures in the exercise of the right to self-defence against terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan”. Responding to the third part of the question regarding the location of the terrorist camps, the spokesperson recalled the Feb 21 statement issued by the Ministry of Information in the aftermath of the strikes and said he had “nothing to further add in terms of either the location or numbers of terrorists killed”. During the briefing, the FO spokesperson was also asked about India’s response to the strikes, specifically the statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), wherein it had condemned Pakistan for the move. The FO spokesperson said that Pakistan “rejected” the statement and maintained that the statement vindicated Pakistan’s stance that “India continues to aid and abet terrorism” in the country through its support for Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist organisations in the region. The spokesperson further said that Pakistan held “concrete evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring and abetting terrorism”. The spokesperson maintained that the statement issued by the MEA and another issued after the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan , “reinforce this conclusion”. “These statements provide additional evidence, circumstantial evidence, of India’s complicity in promoting terrorism in Pakistan,” FO said. He maintained that the message that Pakistan “will respond swiftly, strongly in exercise of our right to self-defence” had been put across “through all international stakeholders”. He reiterated Pakistan’s demand for action against “terrorist outfits operating with impunity and with freedom from Afghan soil”. In response to another question, the FO spokesperson also said that he was not aware of “any structured dialogue” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Asked if Qatar was playing any diplomatic role between the two countries, given the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Doha, the FO spokesperson said: “On the role of Qatar, the issue may have come up in a broader context”. Referring to PM Shehbaz’s recent meeting with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, he said that the two leaders exchanged views on regional and national developments, emphasising the importance of dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful resolution of disputes. “To that extent, of course, we would welcome Qatar’s role in settling all these issues, including Afghanistan,” he said. The FO spokesperson was also asked to comment on the strengthening defence ties between India and Israel. In response, Andrabi said, “We remain seized of the defence ties between Israel and India, including systems and platforms used by India against Pakistan. We are alive to the threat that they pose to our security and our sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the regional peace and stability. “Pakistan remains cognisant of these threats. As regards the future threats emanating from India, let me reiterate that we have robust military preparedness to defend and deter any Indian aggression against Pakistan.” Pakistan demands fair trial for perpetrators of Samjhota Express attack In response to being asked to comment on the 19th anniversary of the Samjhota Express attack, the spokesperson said, “We express our severe disappointment at the Indian government’s callousness towards the plight of families of Pakistani nationals and others, including Indian nationals, I believe, who await justice even after the passage of so many years.” On February 18, 2007, two crude incendiary bombs exploded inside the security-sealed Samjhota Express train headed from Delhi to Lahore, killing 68 people, including 44 Pakistanis. Andrabi maintained that the Indian government’s response confirmed its “role as an official and political accomplice in the heinous terrorist attack carried out on its soil against innocent civilians, Pakistanis and others alike”. FO also condemned the “shameless acquittal and exoneration” of the four perpetrators behind the attack. He expressed concern that the “Hindutva extremism and saffron terror had motivated this inhumane attack 19 years ago, has intensified manifold under the current regime in India”. On that note, the spokesperson demanded a “fair trial” of the perpetrators, stressing that the “families of innocent Pakistani nationals mercilessly killed at the hands of the Hindutva-motivated extremists deserve justice”. He further added: “India routinely indulges in anti-Pakistan propaganda, including by exploiting the bogey of terrorism. And in this backdrop, India’s own systemic exoneration of the perpetrators of the Samjhauta terrorist attack is yet another example of Indian duplicity and state sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan.“",

      "summary_en": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday said that Pakistan’s recent strikes against neighbouring Afghanistan were carried out to ensure the “safety of Pakistani citizens” and to prevent “imminent terrorist attacks”. FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi made the statement while responding to a question during his weekly press briefing . Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year. During Thursday’s press briefing, the FO spokesperson was asked about civilian casualties in the strikes, the total number of terrorists killed, and the locations of the camps targeted. In his response, he said, “Let me begin by reiterating that the intelligence-based selective targeting of these seven terrorist camps and their hideouts in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, was primarily to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions”. Andrabi stressed that the strikes were “proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence and were directed solely against identified terrorist camps and hideouts”. “We exercised utmost caution to prevent any harm to civilians,” the spokesperson said. He recalled statements made by the UN Security Council in reaction to terrorist attacks against Pakistan, with the latest being about the February 6 attack on an imambargah in Islamabad. The spokesperson maintained that the UNSC had “repeatedly underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, abettors, sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”. He further added that the UNSC had also urged states to cooperate with Pakistan in the matter, stressing that Pakistan’s actions must be viewed through the above-mentioned context. He said that Pakistan “remained committed to peace in the region” and called on the Afghan Taliban government to “comply with these obligations”. However, FO maintained that Pakistan would take “all necessary measures in the exercise of the right to self-defence against terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan”. Responding to the third part of the question regarding the location of the terrorist camps, the spokesperson recalled the Feb 21 statement issued by the Ministry of Information in the aftermath of the strikes and said he had “nothing to further add in terms of either the location or numbers of terrorists killed”. During the briefing, the FO spokesperson was also asked about India’s response to the strikes, specifically the statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), wherein it had condemned Pakistan for the move. The FO spokesperson said that Pakistan “rejected” the statement and maintained that the statement vindicated Pakistan’s stance that “India continues to aid and abet terrorism” in the country through its support for Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist organisations in the region. The spokesperson further said that Pakistan held “concrete evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring and abetting terrorism”. The spokesperson maintained that the statement issued by the MEA and another issued after the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan , “reinforce this conclusion”. “These statements provide additional evidence, circumstantial evidence, of India’s complicity in promoting terrorism in Pakistan,” FO said. He maintained that the message that Pakistan “will respond swiftly, strongly in exercise of our right to self-defence” had been put across “through all international stakeholders”. He reiterated Pakistan’s demand for action against “terrorist outfits operating with impunity and with freedom from Afghan soil”. In response to another question, the FO spokesperson also said that he was not aware of “any structured dialogue” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Asked if Qatar was playing any diplomatic role between the two countries, given the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Doha, the FO spokesperson said: “On the role of Qatar, the issue may have come up in a broader context”.

      "title_orig": "TTAP decides to give ‘positive response’ to any offer of talks by the government",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) decided on Thursday to respond positively to any offers for dialogue by the government, sources told Dawn . The decision was taken as prominent members of the alliance met at an Iftar gathering at the residence of TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar in Islamabad, and later held a meeting over the prevailing situation in the country. The gathering was attended by National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) Sahibzada Hassan, and others. One of the leaders who attended the meeting told Dawn on condition of anonymity that during the discussion after Iftar, Abbas shared that a “key figure from the ruling PML-N” had contacted him and offered talks. He quoted Abbas saying that the person from the ruling party gave the assurance that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wanted to settle issues and resolve tensions between the government and the opposition. The sources further said that the person had also assured that the PM “will never backtrack from his words if anything is decided”. “It was then unanimously decided that the TTAP would give a positive response to any offer for talks by the government,” he said. He also said, “We want to see if the government will once again backtrack from its words. If the government backtracks, people will judge it and will know who is serious about the future of the country.” When Dawn contacted former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser regarding the matter, he said the TTAP had just one demand: that the government should allow incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s family to meet him and his personal physicians to examine him. “Now it is in the hands of the government whether it wants to cool down the temperature or not,” he said. Today’s development comes three days after PML-N Senator and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah, in a Senate address, extended an olive branch to the PTI to advance the ‘Charter of Democracy’, signed between the PPP and the PML-N in 2006, and asked opposition lawmakers to rejoin parliamentary standing committees to kick-start the political process for reconciliation. “Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the charter of democracy,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that the government was ready for a dialogue to strengthen democracy and avoid confrontation and deadlock. It was not the first time the ruling coalition has invited the PTI for talks. In November and December last year, the government leaders made similar proposals to the opposition to break the political deadlock; however, these offers did not lead to anything substantial. To break the political deadlock, the government and the opposition had earlier engaged in a dialogue , following the formation of respective committees in December 2024. However, the talks collapsed after multiple rounds, as both sides refused to soften their stance. In these talks, the PTI had demanded the formation of two separate judicial commissions to probe the May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, incidents, as well as the release of jailed PTI leaders and workers. TTAP’s warning The TTAP also issued a statement after the gathering in Islamabad and warned that any criminal negligence with regard to the health of Imran could further aggravate the political crisis in the country. According to a statement issued by the alliance on the social media platform X, the opposition leaders voiced their concerns during TTAP’s central committee meeting. The statement said TTAP leaders demanded that Imran be provided immediate medical treatment at Shifa International Hospital, be examined by his personal doctors, and that restrictions on his access to his lawyers and meetings with family members be lifted forthwith. It added that the ex-premier had been unjustly imprisoned and should be released. The TTAP leaders also condemned the “government’s continued illegal secrecy” regarding Imran’s health and medical treatment, and reiterated the demand that he be shifted to Shifa International Hospital for specialised treatment and be examined by his personal physicians, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf. “Opposition leaders expressed grave concern over the continued concealment of Imran’s medical reports and test results from his family, saying that such actions were further increasing doubts and fears about the PTI founder’s health condition,” the statement said. “The TTAP leaders further warned that criminal negligence regarding the former prime minister’s health could push the country’s political crisis onto an even more dangerous path,” it said. The statement reiterated that Imran Khan, who had been incarcerated in false cases, must be released, as this was the demand of the majority of the people of Pakistan. The statement also drew attention to incarcerated SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza, and demanded his release as well the release of other political prisoners, including Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry, Ali Wazir, and Mahrang Baloch. Meanwhile, the statement also expressed serious concerns over the “alarming increase” in terrorism across the country, deteriorating ties with Afghanistan, the prospects of war in the region, the worsening economy, and growing repression and lawlessness. Expressing deep concern over the increase in terrorist attacks across the country in recent weeks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the statement said that the federal government, in collaboration with provincial governments, all political stakeholders, and the public, should formulate a concrete national strategy to address the issue. The statement further urged the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to “avoid further confrontation and to initiate concrete, sincere, and meaningful negotiations to seriously address the problem of terrorism”. “They also demanded that contacts be made with neighbouring countries and friendly governments such as Saudi Arabia and Türkiye to find a solution to the crisis that would save Pakistan and the entire region from further bloodshed and sabotage by external and hostile forces,” it added. During the meeting, TTAP also expressed concern over the worsening economic conditions caused and drew attention to recently released figures showing that poverty in the country had risen to 29pc and unemployment has reached a 21-year high, the statement said. “Contrary to the government’s claims of major economic agreements, both foreign and domestic investment have declined sharply,” it said. “The exit of hundreds of major multinational companies from the Pakistani market in recent months was evidence of the country’s deteriorating risk profile,” it said. The statement said that the government had no concrete plan to deal with the economic crisis. It added that opposition leaders in the coming months would present an alternative budget and a series of economic and policy proposals with the help of experts, offering concrete solutions to the economic and legal crises facing the country. The statement also cautioned against threats of a US attack on Iran and termed any such move as a cause of devastation for the region. “The government should play a diplomatic role to prevent any such American action,” it said. It stated that US and Israel were attempting to encircle Iran and destroy and divide it through military attacks. “At this moment, Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran is the need of the hour in order to protect Pakistan and the region from the destructive consequences of Zionist aggression.” The TTAP leaders also condemned the current government’s joining of Donald Trump’s Board of Peace. “Board of Peace is an attempt by the US to establish a non-representative alternative to the United Nations, and the exclusion of Palestinians from the board exposes the sinister intentions behind the plan … something Pakistan must not be part of under any circumstances,” they said.",

The statement also cautioned against threats of a US attack on Iran and termed any such move as a cause of devastation for the region. “The government should play a diplomatic role to prevent any such American action,” it said. It stated that US and Israel were attempting to encircle Iran and destroy and divide it through military attacks. “At this moment, Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran is the need of the hour in order to protect Pakistan and the region from the destructive consequences of Zionist aggression.” The TTAP leaders also condemned the current government’s joining of Donald Trump’s Board of Peace. “Board of Peace is an attempt by the US to establish a non-representative alternative to the United Nations, and the exclusion of Palestinians from the board exposes the sinister intentions behind the plan … something Pakistan must not be part of under any circumstances,” they said.",
      "title": "TTAP decides to give ‘positive response’ to any offer of talks by the government",
      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) decided on Thursday to respond positively to any offers for dialogue by the government, sources told Dawn . The decision was taken as prominent members of the alliance met at an Iftar gathering at the residence of TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar in Islamabad, and later held a meeting over the prevailing situation in the country. The gathering was attended by National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) Sahibzada Hassan, and others. One of the leaders who attended the meeting told Dawn on condition of anonymity that during the discussion after Iftar, Abbas shared that a “key figure from the ruling PML-N” had contacted him and offered talks. He quoted Abbas saying that the person from the ruling party gave the assurance that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wanted to settle issues and resolve tensions between the government and the opposition. The sources further said that the person had also assured that the PM “will never backtrack from his words if anything is decided”. “It was then unanimously decided that the TTAP would give a positive response to any offer for talks by the government,” he said. He also said, “We want to see if the government will once again backtrack from its words. If the government backtracks, people will judge it and will know who is serious about the future of the country.” When Dawn contacted former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser regarding the matter, he said the TTAP had just one demand: that the government should allow incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s family to meet him and his personal physicians to examine him. “Now it is in the hands of the government whether it wants to cool down the temperature or not,” he said. Today’s development comes three days after PML-N Senator and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah, in a Senate address, extended an olive branch to the PTI to advance the ‘Charter of Democracy’, signed between the PPP and the PML-N in 2006, and asked opposition lawmakers to rejoin parliamentary standing committees to kick-start the political process for reconciliation. “Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the charter of democracy,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that the government was ready for a dialogue to strengthen democracy and avoid confrontation and deadlock. It was not the first time the ruling coalition has invited the PTI for talks. In November and December last year, the government leaders made similar proposals to the opposition to break the political deadlock; however, these offers did not lead to anything substantial. To break the political deadlock, the government and the opposition had earlier engaged in a dialogue , following the formation of respective committees in December 2024. However, the talks collapsed after multiple rounds, as both sides refused to soften their stance. In these talks, the PTI had demanded the formation of two separate judicial commissions to probe the May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, incidents, as well as the release of jailed PTI leaders and workers. TTAP’s warning The TTAP also issued a statement after the gathering in Islamabad and warned that any criminal negligence with regard to the health of Imran could further aggravate the political crisis in the country. According to a statement issued by the alliance on the social media platform X, the opposition leaders voiced their concerns during TTAP’s central committee meeting. The statement said TTAP leaders demanded that Imran be provided immediate medical treatment at Shifa International Hospital, be examined by his personal doctors, and that restrictions on his access to his lawyers and meetings with family members be lifted forthwith. It added that the ex-premier had been unjustly imprisoned and should be released. The TTAP leaders also condemned the “government’s continued illegal secrecy” regarding Imran’s health and medical treatment, and reiterated the demand that he be shifted to Shifa International Hospital for specialised treatment and be examined by his personal physicians, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf. “Opposition leaders expressed grave concern over the continued concealment of Imran’s medical reports and test results from his family, saying that such actions were further increasing doubts and fears about the PTI founder’s health condition,” the statement said. “The TTAP leaders further warned that criminal negligence regarding the former prime minister’s health could push the country’s political crisis onto an even more dangerous path,” it said. The statement reiterated that Imran Khan, who had been incarcerated in false cases, must be released, as this was the demand of the majority of the people of Pakistan. The statement also drew attention to incarcerated SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza, and demanded his release as well the release of other political prisoners, including Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry, Ali Wazir, and Mahrang Baloch. Meanwhile, the statement also expressed serious concerns over the “alarming increase” in terrorism across the country, deteriorating ties with Afghanistan, the prospects of war in the region, the worsening economy, and growing repression and lawlessness. Expressing deep concern over the increase in terrorist attacks across the country in recent weeks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the statement said that the federal government, in collaboration with provincial governments, all political stakeholders, and the public, should formulate a concrete national strategy to address the issue. The statement further urged the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to “avoid further confrontation and to initiate concrete, sincere, and meaningful negotiations to seriously address the problem of terrorism”. “They also demanded that contacts be made with neighbouring countries and friendly governments such as Saudi Arabia and Türkiye to find a solution to the crisis that would save Pakistan and the entire region from further bloodshed and sabotage by external and hostile forces,” it added. During the meeting, TTAP also expressed concern over the worsening economic conditions caused and drew attention to recently released figures showing that poverty in the country had risen to 29pc and unemployment has reached a 21-year high, the statement said. “Contrary to the government’s claims of major economic agreements, both foreign and domestic investment have declined sharply,” it said. “The exit of hundreds of major multinational companies from the Pakistani market in recent months was evidence of the country’s deteriorating risk profile,” it said. The statement said that the government had no concrete plan to deal with the economic crisis. It added that opposition leaders in the coming months would present an alternative budget and a series of economic and policy proposals with the help of experts, offering concrete solutions to the economic and legal crises facing the country. The statement also cautioned against threats of a US attack on Iran and termed any such move as a cause of devastation for the region. “The government should play a diplomatic role to prevent any such American action,” it said. It stated that US and Israel were attempting to encircle Iran and destroy and divide it through military attacks. “At this moment, Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran is the need of the hour in order to protect Pakistan and the region from the destructive consequences of Zionist aggression.” The TTAP leaders also condemned the current government’s joining of Donald Trump’s Board of Peace. “Board of Peace is an attempt by the US to establish a non-representative alternative to the United Nations, and the exclusion of Palestinians from the board exposes the sinister intentions behind the plan … something Pakistan must not be part of under any circumstances,” they said.",

      "summary_orig": "The military’s media affairs wing said on Thursday that 10 terrorists were killed by security forces during an operation in Balochistan’s Zhob. In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that after an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Zhob on February 24 , in which eight Indian-sponsored terrorists were killed, security forces conducted a comprehensive sanitisation operation on Wednesday to hunt down “hiding khwarij ” belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij . Fitna al Khwarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. “During the conduct of the operation, own forces tracked down Khwarij on multiple routes and effectively engaged their locations. After an ensuing fire exchange, ten Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement said. It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area,” it said. The statement added that the security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to act against terrorism at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country. According to state-run APP , Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to security forces over the successful operation in Zhob, noting that in line with the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security personnel “are achieving major successes against terrorism”. A statement carried by APP quoted the PM as saying that the entire nation was standing with the army in the fight against terrorism. “We are determined to eliminate all kinds of terrorism from the country,” he said. Separately, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said in a post on social media platform X that the successful operation in Zhib by security forces was proof their professional expertise and unwavering resolve against terrorism. “Azm-i-Istehkam will continue until stability is restored in Balochistan,” he said.",
