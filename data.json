      "summary_orig": "Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Monday warned that India will attempt a false flag operation in the maritime domain, during a closed-door briefing given to senior journalists from select media outlets. In a press release today, the Indian defence ministry stated that it was beginning the ‘Trishul’ military exercise in early November. The exercise, spearheaded by the Indian Navy, would also include the Indian Army and Air Force. Speaking about the possibility of Indian aggression, DG ISPR said, “Let India do whatever it wants — on land, in the sea, or in the air. India must know — this time, the response will be far more severe.” During his briefing, the military’s spokesperson highlighted that operations are underway against terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses to designate members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — with 1,667 terrorists killed. Giving some more details, DG ISPR said as many as “62,113 operations have been carried out this year, and 582 soldiers have been martyred. Most of these operations were carried out in Balochistan.” Kabul’s conditions ‘hold no significance’ Lt Gen Chaudhry also said that the conditions set by Afghanistan hold no significance and only the elimination of terrorism matters to Pakistan. On October 19, Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to an immediate ceasefire following high-level negotiations in Doha, where both countries pledged to respect each other’s sovereignty; they were expected to meet again on October 25 to discuss matters further.  The second round of talks on October 25 kicked off in Istanbul, with Islamabad eyeing a “ concrete ” mechanism to monitor Afghan Taliban actions aimed at preventing cross-border terrorist attacks. “The conditions set by Afghanistan hold no significance,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the journalists. “The important thing is the eradication of terrorism.” He added that the guarantors of Pakistani security are the armed forces, not Afghanistan and that Islamabad has “never celebrated” the arrival of the Taliban. “In Istanbul, the Afghan Taliban were clearly told that they need to control terrorism,” Lt Gen Chaudhry stated. “How they do it is their job. We conducted a counter-terrorism operation, and the terrorists fled to Afghanistan. Hand them over, we’ll deal with them according to the Constitution and the law. “There will be no talks with terrorists, and Pakistan gave the Afghan Taliban a befitting response, which yielded the results we wanted.” He added that during the recent Pakistan–Afghanistan border clashes, 206 Afghan Taliban and 112 khawarij were killed. “The TTP has pledged allegiance in the name of the emir of the Afghan Taliban,” Lt Gen Chaudhry stated, adding that the organisation was a “branch” of the Afghan Taliban. Senior journalist Hamid Mir, who attended the briefing, told Geo News that the journalists were presented with evidence of Afghan Taliban soldiers involved in terrorism in Pakistan. “We were presented with the same evidence shared with the Afghan Taliban in Doha,” Mir reported. “These soldiers had Afghan and Afghan Army identification cards. Crime-terror nexus DG ISPR highlighted the role of the nexus between criminals and terrorist organisations, noting that through opium cultivation, terrorists make between Rs1.8 and 2.5 million per acre. He added that terrorists collect money from people in the name of ushr (Islamic tithe). “The entire population joins them, even warlords join in, and they all work together,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. He added that drugs are being smuggled from Afghanistan into Pakistan and further. “Afghan drug smugglers are interfering in Afghan politics.” “If you have awakened love for Afghanistan, then you should go live there,” DG ISPR said. Border skirmishes and talks Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began last month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Türkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces.",

      "summary_orig": "Multiple people on social media platform X shared two separate videos on Friday and Monday, claiming to show Indian army officials criticising recent tri-military exercises as a political move to boost the image for the upcoming Bihar elections. However, the videos are dubbed over. India kicked off large-scale combined military exercises named ‘Trishul 2025’ near its western border on October 30 amid heightened regional tensions. The war games, involving armoured divisions, fighter aircraft and advanced drone systems, are being held across Rajasthan and Punjab to test rapid deployment capabilities. Indian defence officials have described the drills as routine preparedness measures. Meanwhile, upcoming elections are scheduled in Bihar , India, for the state’s legislative assembly from November 6-11, 2025. On Friday, an X account, that appears to be anti-Indian based upon its previous posts and is known for repeatedly sharing AI-altered videos, posted a clip with the following caption: “Breaking news: Bikaner, Rajasthan | South Western Army Commander Lt Gen Manjinder Singh says, ‘We all know these so called threshold exercises are being pushed for political optics to boost the image of incumbent government before Bihar elections but still we will give our best because we are professional soldiers, not saffron mobs.’” The post gained over 38,100 views. The transcript of the video is provided below: “Soldiers, we all know these so-called threshold exercises are being pushed for political optics to boost image for the Bihar elections. But remember, we serve India, not any party. Our duty is to defend the nation, not to become props in political theatre. They may try to saffronise our image, but the Indian army belongs only to the republic, not to Modi, not to any ideology. We will perform our duties with professionalism, go to these exercises with discipline, and show the world that the Indian army stands for India, not for politics. Jai Hind.” The same video with similar claims was shared by multiple pro-Pakistani accounts on X, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here , colelctively gaining 35,000 views. Separately today, an Indian account that appears to be anti-BJP, based upon its previous posts, shared a video of Indian Colonel Sofia Qureshi at a press briefing with the caption: “These Trishul exercises are nothing but a political gimmick to sway the Bihar elections. I’m done being used as a prop for Muslim support. I can’t stand the saffronisation of the Indian Army.” In the video, which had a watermark of Indian news agency ANI , the Indian military officer could be heard saying: “Today, I stand here not as a political pawn but as a soldier of the Indian army. For two and a half years, I have served my country with pride, until I realised we were being used as props to divide our own citizens. “The saffronisation of our ranks is a betrayal of every oath we took. Our job is to defend India, not the ideology of the BJP or RSS. These so-called Trishul exercises before the Bihar elections are nothing but a theatre to fool the nation. Uniforms are being printed in ideology, not honour. “This must stop now. If speaking the truth costs my uniform, so be it. I still stand with India, not with hate.” The post gained 47,000 views. The video and claim were also shared by a Pakistani propaganda account, based on its previous posts, with the caption: “Breaking News: Col Sofya Qureshi explodes on live TV, ‘These Trishul exercises are nothing but a political gimmick aimed at manipulating the Bihar Elections. I am sick and tired of being used as a prop for Muslim support. I can’t stand with saffronization of the Indian army’.” The post racked up 29,400 views. Others on X also shared the video along with the claim, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , and here , collectively garnering over 20,000 views. Fact-checks were initiated to determine the veracity of the claims due to their virality and keen public interest in the purported political statements attributed to Indian military officers amid regional tensions. Analysing the first video using the forensic tool Hive Moderation to determine the authenticity of the video shows it detected 99.8 per cent potential AI manipulation. A reverse-image search conducted to trace the original footage yielded an X video uploaded on October 30, 2025, by Indian news outlet IANS with the following caption: “Bikaner, Rajasthan: Sapta Shakti Command Manjinder Singh says, ’The Indian army is following the political direction of new normal, under which, any terror act in the country will be considered as act of war. And the military has to prepare for any such activities … A lot of technologies and capabilities have been introduced for this… Our focus is on maximum night training, hence we are carrying out 70 per cent of the training at night and 30pc of it during the day.“ In the video, Singh delivered an address during a press conference after witnessing an exercise codenamed “Sentinel Strike” at the Mahajan Field Firing Range (Thar Desert). At no point did he discuss Indian domestic politics or make any remarks about the politicisation of the Trishul exercises. The briefing was covered by multiple Indian media outlets such as WION news and The Economic Times , but did not mention any criticism of the Indian army’s alleged politicisation. Analysing the second video using the forensic tool AI Video Detector shows that the clip was flagged as “suspicious” with a 60pc deepfake probability score. Deepware, another tool, also detected it as suspicious with an 84pc deepfake score. Additionally, a reverse image search conducted to trace the original footage yielded an X video uploaded on October 31, 2025, by Indian news outlet ANI . It stated that Col Sofia spoke at the Young Leaders Forum in Delhi. “Colonel Sofiya Qureshi says … responsibilities for defending a nation are not just the military’s game; civilians also play a role in addressing external and internal threats … Over the years, the Indian army has trained officers and troops in ‘Saashtra’ and ‘Shashtra’,” the caption of the post read. It added: “‘Saashtra’ means knowledge, strategy, and wisdom, while ‘Shashtra’ means weaponry and warfare, representing a blend of intellect and strength … Every generation has carried the flame of patriotism, from baby boomers to Gen Z … Be it seven decades ago or Operation Sindoor, you all have witnessed it … You, the ‘Yuva Shakti of Bharat,’ you are the force of multipliers. You are not only trained in firepower, but also in the firewalls. You are ready to face kinetic and non-kinetic domains … War is not only fought in bunkers or with bullets, but also with bites and bandwidths.” The reverse image search also yielded the full video of Col Sofia’s speech uploaded on YouTube by ANI . In the clip, Col Sofia spoke about the Indian youth and the role they play in national security. However, at no point did she discuss Indian domestic politics or make any remarks about the politicisation of the Trishul exercises. Her speech was covered by multiple Indian media outlets such as WION News , Indian Economic Observer and Hindustan Times . None of the reports mentioned any criticism of the alleged politicisation of the Indian army or of the tri-military exercises as a political gimmick. Therefore, the fact-checks determined that the claims that two viral videos show Indian Southwestern Army Commander Lt Gen Manjinder Singh and military spokesperson Colonel Sofia Qureshi criticising the recent Trishul exercises as political optics to boost the image for the Bihar elections are false . The clips are doctored and have been dubbed over through AI-generated audio. These fact checks were originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

      "summary": "Multiple people on social media platform X shared two separate videos on Friday and Monday, claiming to show Indian army officials criticising recent tri-military exercises as a political move to boost the image for the upcoming Bihar elections. However, the videos are dubbed over. India kicked off large-scale combined military exercises named ‘Trishul 2025’ near its western border on October 30 amid heightened regional tensions. The war games, involving armoured divisions, fighter aircraft and advanced drone systems, are being held across Rajasthan and Punjab to test rapid deployment capabilities. Indian defence officials have described the drills as routine preparedness measures. Meanwhile, upcoming elections are scheduled in Bihar , India, for the state’s legislative assembly from November 6-11, 2025. On Friday, an X account, that appears to be anti-Indian based upon its previous posts and is known for repeatedly sharing AI-altered videos, posted a clip with the following caption: “Breaking news: Bikaner, Rajasthan | South Western Army Commander Lt Gen Manjinder Singh says, ‘We all know these so called threshold exercises are being pushed for political optics to boost the image of incumbent government before Bihar elections but still we will give our best because we are professional soldiers, not saffron mobs.’” The post gained over 38,100 views. The transcript of the video is provided below: “Soldiers, we all know these so-called threshold exercises are being pushed for political optics to boost image for the Bihar elections. But remember, we serve India, not any party. Our duty is to defend the nation, not to become props in political theatre. They may try to saffronise our image, but the Indian army belongs only to the republic, not to Modi, not to any ideology. We will perform our duties with professionalism, go to these exercises with discipline, and show the world that the Indian army stands for India, not for politics. Jai Hind.” The same video with similar claims was shared by multiple pro-Pakistani accounts on X, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here , colelctively gaining 35,000 views. Separately today, an Indian account that appears to be anti-BJP, based upon its previous posts, shared a video of Indian Colonel Sofia Qureshi at a press briefing with the caption: “These Trishul exercises are nothing but a political gimmick to sway the Bihar elections. I’m done being used as a prop for Muslim support. I can’t stand the saffronisation of the Indian Army.” In the video, which had a watermark of Indian news agency ANI , the Indian military officer could be heard saying: “Today, I stand here not as a political pawn but as a soldier of the Indian army. For two and a half years, I have served my country with pride, until I realised we were being used as props to divide our own citizens. “The saffronisation of our ranks is a betrayal of every oath we took. Our job is to defend India, not the ideology of the BJP or RSS. These so-called Trishul exercises before the Bihar elections are nothing but a theatre to fool the nation. Uniforms are being printed in ideology, not honour. “This must stop now. If speaking the truth costs my uniform, so be it. I still stand with India, not with hate.” The post gained 47,000 views. The video and claim were also shared by a Pakistani propaganda account, based on its previous posts, with the caption: “Breaking News: Col Sofya Qureshi explodes on live TV, ‘These Trishul exercises are nothing but a political gimmick aimed at manipulating the Bihar Elections. I am sick and tired of being used as a prop for Muslim support. I can’t stand with saffronization of the Indian army’.” The post racked up 29,400 views. Others on X also shared the video along with the claim, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , and here , collectively garnering over 20,000 views. Fact-checks were initiated to determine the veracity of the claims due to their virality and keen public interest in the purported political statements attributed to Indian military officers amid regional tensions. Analysing the first video using the forensic tool Hive Moderation to determine the authenticity of the video shows it detected 99.8 per cent potential AI manipulation. A reverse-image search conducted to trace the original footage yielded an X video uploaded on October 30, 2025, by Indian news outlet IANS with the following caption: “Bikaner, Rajasthan: Sapta Shakti Command Manjinder Singh says, ’The Indian army is following the political direction of new normal, under which, any terror act in the country will be considered as act of war. And the military has to prepare for any such activities … A lot of technologies and capabilities have been introduced for this… Our focus is on maximum night training, hence we are carrying out 70 per cent of the training at night and 30pc of it during the day.“ In the video, Singh delivered an address during a press conference after witnessing an exercise codenamed “Sentinel Strike” at the Mahajan Field Firing Range (Thar Desert). At no point did he discuss Indian domestic politics or make any remarks about the politicisation of the Trishul exercises. The briefing was covered by multiple Indian media outlets such as WION news and The Economic Times , but did not mention any criticism of the Indian army’s alleged politicisation. Analysing the second video using the forensic tool AI Video Detector shows that the clip was flagged as “suspicious” with a 60pc deepfake probability score. Deepware, another tool, also detected it as suspicious with an 84pc deepfake score. Additionally, a reverse image search conducted to trace the original footage yielded an X video uploaded on October 31, 2025, by Indian news outlet ANI . It stated that Col Sofia spoke at the Young Leaders Forum in Delhi. “Colonel Sofiya Qureshi says … responsibilities for defending a nation are not just the military’s game; civilians also play a role in addressing external and internal threats … Over the years, the Indian army has trained officers and troops in ‘Saashtra’ and ‘Shashtra’,” the caption of the post read. It added: “‘Saashtra’ means knowledge, strategy, and wisdom, while ‘Shashtra’ means weaponry and warfare, representing a blend of intellect and strength … Every generation has carried the flame of patriotism, from baby boomers to Gen Z … Be it seven decades ago or Operation Sindoor, you all have witnessed it … You, the ‘Yuva Shakti of Bharat,’ you are the force of multipliers. You are not only trained in firepower, but also in the firewalls. You are ready to face kinetic and non-kinetic domains … War is not only fought in bunkers or with bullets, but also with bites and bandwidths.” The reverse image search also yielded the full video of Col Sofia’s speech uploaded on YouTube by ANI . In the clip, Col Sofia spoke about the Indian youth and the role they play in national security. However, at no point did she discuss Indian domestic politics or make any remarks about the politicisation of the Trishul exercises. Her speech was covered by multiple Indian media outlets such as WION News , Indian Economic Observer and Hindustan Times . None of the reports mentioned any criticism of the alleged politicisation of the Indian army or of the tri-military exercises as a political gimmick. Therefore, the fact-checks determined that the claims that two viral videos show Indian Southwestern Army Commander Lt Gen Manjinder Singh and military spokesperson Colonel Sofia Qureshi criticising the recent Trishul exercises as political optics to boost the image for the Bihar elections are false . The clips are doctored and have been dubbed over through AI-generated audio. These fact checks were originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan, Muslim countries slam Israeli violations, demand immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces at Gaza ceasefire meeting: FO",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and other Muslim countries on Monday slammed Israeli violations of the fragile Gaza ceasefire and demanded the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territory, according to the Foreign Office (FO). Hamas and Israel signed a ceasefire agreement on October 9, agreeing to free the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. Pakistan was one of the eight Arab and Muslim countries to work with Trump on the plan. Despite occasional flare-ups , the fragile truce has been holding in Gaza. The truce, which left thorny issues like the disarmament of Hamas and a timeline for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza unresolved, has been tested by unilateral Israeli bombardment since coming into force. The foreign ministers of Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan — the same countries that met with Trump on Sept 23 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly — met at the Coordination Meeting of Arab-Islamic Foreign Ministers in Istanbul today to discuss the ceasefire. A statement from the FO said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and other Arab-Islamic diplomats deliberated on the way forward for a lasting ceasefire and sustainable peace in Gaza. “The leaders jointly called for urgent humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, condemned Israeli ceasefire violations, demanded Israel’s withdrawal from the Occupied Palestinian Territory and emphasised the rebuilding of Gaza. “Pakistan reaffirmed its principled stance for the establishment of an independent, viable and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in line with the UN and OIC resolutions.” The countries said that Gaza’s future must be Palestinian-led and avoid any new system of tutelage. Turkiye, which played a central role in forging the now shaky three-week-old ceasefire, is pushing for Muslim nations to bring their influence to bear on the reconstruction of the embattled territory. “Our principle is that Palestinians should govern the Palestinians and ensure their own security, the international community should support this in the best possible way — diplomatically, institutionally and economically,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said after the talks. “Nobody wants to see a new system of tutelage emerge,” he told a news conference. “We’ve now reached an extremely critical stage: we do not want the genocide in Gaza to resume,” Fidan added, saying all seven nations supported plans for the Palestinians to take control of Gaza’s security and governance. Fidan, who held talks at the weekend with a Hamas delegation led by its chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, said the movement was “ready to hand Gaza to a committee of Palestinians”. He also expressed hope that reconciliation efforts between Hamas and the rival West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, “will bear fruit as soon as possible”, saying inter-Palestinian unity would “strengthen Palestine’s representation in the international community”. Fidan said it was crucial that the emerging International Stabilisation Force (ISF) that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire under Trump’s plan, have a “mandate defined by a UN Security Council resolution and a framework for legitimacy”. Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” Fidan said. “First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council. “And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” he said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington. Israel has long viewed Turkiye’s diplomatic overtures with suspicion over Ankara’s close ties with Hamas and adamantly opposes it joining the task force that is meant to take over after Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. A Turkish disaster relief team, sent to help efforts to recover the remains of those trapped under the rubble — including Israelis seized by Hamas — has been stuck at the border because Israel refused to let them in, according to Ankara. Dar reaffirms commitment to deepen cooperation with Türkiye across spheres Earlier, FM Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to deepen cooperation with Türkiye across political, economic, and defence spheres in a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, while agreeing to continue working together on the issue of Palestine. Dar held a bilateral meeting with FM Fidan on the meeting’s sidelines, the FO said. “During the meeting, the ministers expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of Pakistan–Türkiye bilateral relations and reaffirmed their shared commitment to further deepening cooperation across political, economic, and defence spheres. “Both sides agreed to continue working together on the issue of Palestine, especially establishing sustainable peace in Gaza.” It added that both leaders reaffirmed the strong bonds of brotherhood and mutual support that continue to underpin Pakistan–Türkiye relations and agreed to maintain close coordination on regional and international issues. Earlier in the day, the FO posted on X that upon arrival, FM Dar was received by Ambassador Ahmet Cemil Miroğlu, Director General of Protocol, as well as officials of the Pakistan Embassy. Seems Hamas ‘determined’ to stick to truce: Erdogan Hamas is “determined” to stick to the truce, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said today, adding it was crucial that Muslim nations play a leading role in Gaza’s reconstruction. “It seems that Hamas is quite determined to adhere to the agreement,” Erdogan told delegates from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) gathered in Istanbul for their annual economic summit. He stressed it was “essential” that the OIC “play a leading role in the reconstruction of Gaza”. “At this point, we need to deliver more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza and then begin reconstruction efforts. […] The Israeli government is doing everything in its power to prevent this,” Erdogan said. On the eve of the meeting, FM Fidan welcomed a Hamas delegation led by its lead negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. “We must end the massacre in Gaza. A ceasefire in itself is not enough,” Fidan said, arguing for the two-state solution to the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “We should recognise that Gaza should be governed by the Palestinians, and act with caution,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "As many as 29,609 tickets have been issued for traffic rule violations since the newly implemented e-ticketing system was inaugurated in Karachi, according to data from the police. Sindh Chief Minister inaugurated the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (TRACS), commonly known as the e-ticketing system, at the Central Police Office (CPO) last week. He explained that the new system replaces the outdated manual ticketing process with a fully automated e-ticketing mechanism, utilising advanced AI-integrated CCTV cameras to detect violations such as speeding, red-light jumping, and helmet non-compliance. Of the 29,609 tickets issued, 17,639 of them were issued to drivers not wearing a seatbelt, while 6,362 were issued to motorcyclists not wearing helmets, the data shows. Another 1,967 tickets were issued for speeding, while 1,655 were issued for running through red lights. Meanwhile, 943 tickets were issued for using mobile phones while operating a vehicle and 298 were handed out for having tinted windows and glass. For parking in a ‘no-parking’ zone, 165 tickets were issued, while 162 were issued to motorists using the wrong side of the road; 44 tickets were handed to people going the wrong way on a one-way street. Additionally, 152 motorists were ticketed for having passengers on the roof of their vehicle, and 91 others were caught violating stop lines. An additional 65 tickets were handed out due to lane line violations, with 44 tickets issued to vehicles carrying an improper load and 37 for being overloaded. No tickets were issued for having “fancy number plates”, sudden lane changes or expired tax. In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred. The decision came amid Karachi witnessing a surge in traffic accidents , particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data. The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.",

      "summary_orig": "Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said on Monday that both the government and the PTI, along with Imran Khan, need to show flexibility in order to create space for engagement to decrease the political friction in the country. Fawad is one of the three former PTI leaders who say they have been engaging with the party’s incarcerated leadership to put an end to politics of confrontation as part of their political outreach initiative. They also visited PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, after he was taken to a hospital in Lahore from prison, on Thursday, to convince him to join their campaign. “I’ve said this from the first day, the government should move one step forward and the PTI and Imran Khan should move back one step so space is created,” said the former PTI leader while speaking during an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘News Wise’. He maintained that both sides would have to decide on the need to bring down the temperature, warning that if the PTI did not pursue engagement and talks, it would face similar treatment as the disbanding and ban on the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan. “The government needs this, because whatever international successes they have gained are not translating into Pakistan … so both sides need the temperature to come down. We think the leaders of Lahore should play the role of a pivot and take this forward.” Chaudhry added that the immediate need was to lower the political temperature, saying talks could not proceed if both sides could not even bear to see each other. Defending his former party’s obstinacy against engagement in talks, he said it was also due to the behaviour of the government, which had made a policy of “crushing and sidelining” the opposition. “The two ruling parties, the establishment and the PTI, are the four big players and the political temperature between them should come down. How will that happen? …you will have to give the leadership in Lahore’s jail the chance to talk to Imran Khan.” He further said that the establishment and the government needed to decide whether the country needed a reduction in political temperature or not. “I am very hopeful they have this view too.” Referring to the group’s recent activities, Chaudhry said they had a meeting of at least 45 minutes with Qureshi. He added that the proposal being carried by the group was not even their own, instead pointing to a letter by incarcerated PTI leaders in Lahore earlier this year, which called for a reduction in political friction and encouraged engagement. Chaudhry was not without criticism for the government, saying it had backed the PTI into a corner. “If you don’t engage with the PTI, the only way forward it has is to protest,” he said. The former federal minister added that in such a situation, the PTI could lead a protest to Islamabad and resign from the National Assembly, while the government would attempt to impose governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which would be resisted by the party. “Another event like November 26, 2024, will happen, and as a result of this, the tensions and political temperature in Pakistan will increase. The problem right now is that, we the people, living in Pakistan are being severely impacted by this,” he said, adding that the group had requested the incarcerated PTI leaders in Lahore that if there was no implementation of their earlier recommendation, it would lead to great loss for both the party and the government. He also said the fact that the group was allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI leadership in Kot Lakpat jail was an encouraging sign. “Senior government ministers called me and appreciated the effort,” he said, pointing to Information Minister Attaullah Tarar’s welcoming of the development in particular. “Senior PTI leadership also called and said that this is the only way.”",

      "summary_orig": "At least three terrorists were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Monday. “Movement of a group of khwarij, opposite general area Esham, North Waziristan District, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was picked up by the security forces.” The military’s media wing said troops effecttively engaged the group of khawarij . “As a result of precise and skillful engagement, two khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell.” In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. The ISPR added that one of the terrorists killed was identified as Qasim, and Afghan national who was serving in the Afghan Border Police. In another intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Tank district, security forces killed another terrorist, identified as Ikramuddin aka Abu Dajana, also an Afghan national. “These incidents reveal continued involvement of Afghan nationals in numerous terrorist activities against innocent civilians and security forces inside Pakistan.” “Pakistan has repeatedly been asking Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border and is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij and involvement of its citizens in terrorism inside Pakistan,” said the ISPR. The statement added that the security forces of Pakistan remain “resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers”. A sanitisation operation was launched in the area to eliminate any “other Indian sponsored Kharji”. Last week, the deputy chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Amjad alias Mazahim, was killed in an IBO. According to ISPR, Amjad was a deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.",

      "summary_en": "At least three terrorists were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Monday. “Movement of a group of khwarij, opposite general area Esham, North Waziristan District, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was picked up by the security forces.” The military’s media wing said troops effecttively engaged the group of khawarij . “As a result of precise and skillful engagement, two khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell.” In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. The ISPR added that one of the terrorists killed was identified as Qasim, and Afghan national who was serving in the Afghan Border Police. In another intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Tank district, security forces killed another terrorist, identified as Ikramuddin aka Abu Dajana, also an Afghan national. “These incidents reveal continued involvement of Afghan nationals in numerous terrorist activities against innocent civilians and security forces inside Pakistan.” “Pakistan has repeatedly been asking Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border and is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij and involvement of its citizens in terrorism inside Pakistan,” said the ISPR. The statement added that the security forces of Pakistan remain “resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers”. A sanitisation operation was launched in the area to eliminate any “other Indian sponsored Kharji”. Last week, the deputy chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Amjad alias Mazahim, was killed in an IBO. According to ISPR, Amjad was a deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.",

      "summary_orig": "Canada’s clampdown on international students has hit applicants from India particularly hard, government data shows, as what was once a preferred destination loses its allure for Indian students. Canada lowered the number of international student permits it issues for the second year in a row in early 2025 as part of a broader effort to reduce the number of temporary migrants and address fraud related to student visas. About 74 per cent of Indian applications for permits to study at Canadian post-secondary institutions in August — the most recent month available — were rejected, compared to about 32pc in August 2023, according to immigration department data provided to Reuters . By contrast, about 40pc of study permit applications overall in each of those months were refused. About 24pc of Chinese study permits in August 2025 were rejected. The number of Indian applicants has dropped as well, from 20,900 in August 2023 — when Indians formed just over one quarter of all applicants — to 4,515 in August 2025. India has been Canada’s top source of international students over the past decade. In August, it also had the highest study-permit refusal rate of any country with more than 1,000 approved applicants. The spike in refusals of would-be students comes as Canada and India seek to mend ties after more than a year of tension. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement in the 2023 murder of a Canadian in Surrey, British Columbia. India has repeatedly denied the allegations. An effort to crack down on fraud In 2023, Canadian authorities uncovered nearly 1,550 study permit applications linked to fraudulent letters of acceptance, most of which originated from India, Canada’s immigration department told Reuters in an email. Last year, its beefed-up verification system detected more than 14,000 potentially fraudulent letters of acceptance from all applicants, it said. Canada has implemented enhanced verification for international students and has increased its financial requirements for applicants, the immigration department spokesperson said. The Indian embassy in Ottawa said the rejection of study permit applications from students in India had come to its attention, but that the issuance of study permits is Canada’s prerogative. “However, we would like to emphasise that some of the best quality students available in the world are from India, and Canadian institutions have in the past greatly benefited from the talent and academic excellence of these students,” the embassy said in a statement. Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand told Reuters during an October visit to India that Canada’s government is concerned about the integrity of its immigration system but wants to continue having Indian students in Canada. A drop in Indian enrolment People who work with would-be international students say they are seeing a higher level of applicant scrutiny. Michael Pietrocarlo of Border Pass, which helps people apply for Canadian visas, said his firm prepares applicants to show their eligibility beyond what’s required on paper. He says, for example, when students must demonstrate they have sufficient funds to support themselves, “it’s not enough just to say, ‘Here are some bank statements.’ They may have to go the extra mile and say, ‘Here’s where the money came from.’” The University of Waterloo, home to Canada’s largest engineering school, has seen a two-thirds decline in the number of students from India entering its undergraduate and graduate programs over the past three to four years. Ian VanderBurgh, its associate vice president of strategic enrolment management, said the drop was largely due to a government cap on foreign student visas and had altered the composition of the student body. “We pride ourselves on being an international university,” he said. The University of Regina and the University of Saskatchewan have also reported a decline in the number of Indian students enrolled. When Jaspreet Singh, who founded the International Sikh Students Association, came to Canada from India in 2015 to study mechanical engineering, he remembers government posters exhorting newcomers to “Study, work, stay” in the country. That attitude has soured, he said. Singh is not surprised at the higher rejection rate for Indian study permit applicants, saying he knows fraud is a concern. But as it becomes harder to get permanent residency or a job in Canada, he says some of those recently rejected appear to not mind: “They are happy they didn’t come.”",

      "summary_orig": "Nigerians across the religious spectrum pushed back Monday on US President Donald Trump’s threats of military intervention over the killing of Christians in the country. Africa’s most populous country, which is roughly evenly split between a mostly Christian south and Muslim-majority north, is home to myriad conflicts, which experts say kill both Christians and Muslims without distinction. Claims of Christian “persecution” in Nigeria have found traction online among the US and European right in recent weeks. “Christians are being killed, we can’t deny the fact that Muslims are (also) being killed,” Danjuma Dickson Auta, a Christian and community leader, told AFP. Trump said on social media over the weekend that he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack. Asked by an AFP reporter aboard Air Force One if he was considering putting US troops on the ground or using air strikes, Trump replied: “Could be, I mean, a lot of things — I envisage a lot of things.” “They’re killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers,” he said Sunday. “We’re not going to allow that to happen.” Ethnic violence Auta, 56, hails from Plateau state, where Christians and Muslims have long lived side by side. The state has also seen explosions of violence — including deadly sectarian riots in the capital Jos in 2001 and 2008. In recent years, Plateau and other states in Nigeria’s “Middle Belt” have suffered deadly clashes between mostly Christian farmers and Fulani Muslim herders over dwindling land and resources. The conflict has often resulted in massive death tolls on the side of the farmers, with entire villages razed. Smaller-scale attacks on herders — including retaliatory killings of random ethnic Fulanis or their cattle — often generate fewer headlines in both the local and international press. Though the violence often falls across ethnic and religious lines, experts say the root causes lie in poor land management and policing in rural areas. Words like “genocide” have been thrown around by those in Plateau frustrated by the escalating violence, though typically in ethnic, not religious terms. Claims of a “Christian genocide”, meanwhile, have been pushed in recent years by separatist groups in the southeast. US-based firm Moran Global Strategies has been lobbying on behalf of separatists this year, advising congressional staff on what it said was Christian “persecution”, according to disclosure forms. Nigeria suggests Trump-Tinubu meeting Nigeria also faces a long-running jihadist conflict in its northeast, and “bandit” gangs in the northwest who conduct kidnappings and village raids. The north’s population is mostly Muslim — meaning most of the victims are, too. “Even those who sold this narrative of Christian genocide know it is not true,” said Abubakar Gamandi, a Muslim who heads a fishermen’s union in Borno state, the epicentre of the Boko Haram conflict. Chukwuma Soludo, the Christian governor of Anambra state, also pushed back against US intervention, saying Washington “must act within the realm of international law”. Others have used the controversy to point out long-festering insecurity in the country, and Trump’s rhetoric has resonated with some in Nigeria. Reverend Joseph Hayab, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria for the country’s north, said he rejected the framing of “farmer-herder violence” and called Trump’s comments a “wake-up call”. “People are twisting the story as if Trump said he is coming to fight Nigeria. No, he is coming to deal with terrorists,” he told AFP. Amid Trump’s ratcheted-up rhetoric, the Nigerian presidency suggested a meeting between the two leaders to resolve the issue. Daniel Bwala, spokesman for Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, said, “Donald Trump has his own style of communication”. Bwala suggested to AFP Sunday that Trump’s post was a way to “force a sit-down between the two leaders so they can iron out a common front to fight their insecurity”. Trump previously attacked South Africa over what he called a “genocide” against its Dutch-descended Afrikaner community, and has offered them refugee status. Critics of the president said the rhetoric was part of Trump’s hardline diplomatic strategy.",

Trump said on social media over the weekend that he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack. Asked by an AFP reporter aboard Air Force One if he was considering putting US troops on the ground or using air strikes, Trump replied: “Could be, I mean, a lot of things — I envisage a lot of things.” “They’re killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers,” he said Sunday. “We’re not going to allow that to happen.” Ethnic violence Auta, 56, hails from Plateau state, where Christians and Muslims have long lived side by side. The state has also seen explosions of violence — including deadly sectarian riots in the capital Jos in 2001 and 2008. In recent years, Plateau and other states in Nigeria’s “Middle Belt” have suffered deadly clashes between mostly Christian farmers and Fulani Muslim herders over dwindling land and resources. The conflict has often resulted in massive death tolls on the side of the farmers, with entire villages razed. Smaller-scale attacks on herders — including retaliatory killings of random ethnic Fulanis or their cattle — often generate fewer headlines in both the local and international press. Though the violence often falls across ethnic and religious lines, experts say the root causes lie in poor land management and policing in rural areas. Words like “genocide” have been thrown around by those in Plateau frustrated by the escalating violence, though typically in ethnic, not religious terms. Claims of a “Christian genocide”, meanwhile, have been pushed in recent years by separatist groups in the southeast. US-based firm Moran Global Strategies has been lobbying on behalf of separatists this year, advising congressional staff on what it said was Christian “persecution”, according to disclosure forms. Nigeria suggests Trump-Tinubu meeting Nigeria also faces a long-running jihadist conflict in its northeast, and “bandit” gangs in the northwest who conduct kidnappings and village raids. The north’s population is mostly Muslim — meaning most of the victims are, too. “Even those who sold this narrative of Christian genocide know it is not true,” said Abubakar Gamandi, a Muslim who heads a fishermen’s union in Borno state, the epicentre of the Boko Haram conflict. Chukwuma Soludo, the Christian governor of Anambra state, also pushed back against US intervention, saying Washington “must act within the realm of international law”. Others have used the controversy to point out long-festering insecurity in the country, and Trump’s rhetoric has resonated with some in Nigeria. Reverend Joseph Hayab, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria for the country’s north, said he rejected the framing of “farmer-herder violence” and called Trump’s comments a “wake-up call”. “People are twisting the story as if Trump said he is coming to fight Nigeria. No, he is coming to deal with terrorists,” he told AFP. Amid Trump’s ratcheted-up rhetoric, the Nigerian presidency suggested a meeting between the two leaders to resolve the issue. Daniel Bwala, spokesman for Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, said, “Donald Trump has his own style of communication”. Bwala suggested to AFP Sunday that Trump’s post was a way to “force a sit-down between the two leaders so they can iron out a common front to fight their insecurity”. Trump previously attacked South Africa over what he called a “genocide” against its Dutch-descended Afrikaner community, and has offered them refugee status. Critics of the president said the rhetoric was part of Trump’s hardline diplomatic strategy.",

      "summary_orig": "The former advocate general of the Israeli military, who had resigned last week after admitting to leaking a video to the media that allegedly showed Israeli soldiers raping a Palestinian prisoner, was arrested hours after she was reported to have gone missing, according to the The Times of Israel . Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi had resigned from the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) over a criminal inquiry into the leaking of a video that allegedly showed soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza conflict. She said that she was stepping down because she had approved the video’s leak in August last year. In a report on Sunday, the Times of Israel said that Tomer-Yerushalmi was reported missing by her family, which prompted a search by authorities. “The large search, involving police, rescue forces, and the military, was carried out after she was unreachable for several hours, and her car was later found at Hatzuk Beach near Tel Aviv. Hebrew media outlets reported that she had left a letter at home, which some characterised as a ‘suicide note’,” the publication said. However, Tomer-Yerushalmi made contact with her husband a few hours later and was found along a beach in the nearby city of Herzliya. She was reportedly taken for a health checkup before being arrested in connection with the video leak, the report added. The Times of Israel reported that the ex-IDF legal chief had been on leave since a criminal investigation was launched by police last week into the leaking of the surveillance video. In a separate report , the publication said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed fury about the video leak, declaring it the “most serious public-relations attack” against Tel Aviv to date. The incident “caused enormous reputational damage to Israel, to the IDF, and to our soldiers”, he was quoted as saying. “It is perhaps the most serious public relations attack Israel has experienced since its founding — I cannot recall one so concentrated and intense,” Netanyahu said. “This requires an independent and impartial inquiry, and I expect that such an investigation will indeed take place.” Video leak The abuse investigation led to criminal charges against five soldiers and stirred an uproar. The inquiry drew condemnation from right-wing politicians and prompted protesters to storm two military compounds after investigators sought troops for questioning in the case. A week after the break-in at the bases, a security camera video showing the moments of the alleged abuse was leaked to an Israeli television channel. It showed soldiers taking a prisoner aside and crowding around while holding a dog and blocking visibility of their actions with their riot gear. Tomer-Yerushalmi defended her action as an attempt to fend off propaganda against the military’s legal department entrusted with upholding the rule of law, and which she said had been subjected to smears throughout the Gaza conflict.

      "summary_orig": "Six cops were injured on Monday when gunmen opened fire at the North Waziristan district police officer’s (DPO) vehicle near Bannu district’s Mamash Khel town, an official said. Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan confirmed the details to Dawn , adding that the incident took place on Miranshah road, which connects Bannu and North Waziristan. “Armed men open fire at the vehicle of North Waziristan’s DPO,” RPO Khan said. “The DPO remained unhurt,” he added. He further said the injured police personnel were taken to the Bannu District Headquarters Hospital. “The unidentified attackers have hidden in nearby areas and a search operation is underway [to trace them],” the Bannu RPO said. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The past few months have seen an escalation in attacks on law enforcement agencies, with police forces in KP being targeted repeatedly . Yesterday, a station house officer and two other cops were injured in a blast caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) in KP’s Hangu district. Last week, terrorists kidnapped a police official from Bannu’s Havaid Adda area. Separately, the Bannu police on Friday also claimed to have recovered Constable Noor Zaman, who had been kidnapped by terrorists in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali town. The cop was on his way to attend the last rites of his brother, Constable Javed Khan, who had been martyred in a gun attack in Bannu. Faced with the heightened militancy, security forces have also intensified counter-terrorism operations in KP and Balochistan. Militants in Pakistan suffered their heaviest losses in 10 years during the month of October as security forces intensified operations against them, according to a report by the think-tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.",

      "summary_orig": "• Summit of Muslim bloc foreign ministers will ‘come down hard on Israel’ over ceasefire violations • Pakistan to demand complete Israeli withdrawal, unfettered provision of aid to Palestinians ISLAMABAD: Turkiye is expected to push for ensuring the security and administration of Gaza by Palestinians, as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar joins his counterparts from the eight-nation Muslim bloc, suing for peace in the besieged Palestinian territory, for a summit in Istanbul today (Monday). The Coordination Meeting of Arab-Islamic Foreign Ministers is expected to take up the Gaza ceasefire deal, piloted by US President Donald Trump. However, the truce, which left thorny issues like the disarmament of Hamas and a timeline for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza unresolved, has been tested by unilateral Israeli bombardment since coming into force. The Istanbul meeting is expected to bring together the foreign ministers of Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan — the same countries that met with US President Donald Trump on Sept 23, on the margins of the UN General Assembly. At the foreign ministers’ meeting, Turkiye’s Hakan Fidan is expected to “emphasise the importance of coordinated action by Muslim countries for the ceasefire to evolve into a lasting peace,” Reuters quoted a Turkish foreign ministry source as saying on Sunday. The source said Mr Fidan is set to tell the meeting that Israel is “making excuses” to end the ceasefire and emphasise the need for the international community to “take a resolute stance against Israel’s provocative actions”. He was also set to say that humanitarian aid entering Gaza is insufficient and Israel has not fulfilled its obligations in this regard. According to TRT World , Mr Fidan is anticipated to stress the need to swiftly implement arrangements that would allow Palestinians to assume responsibility for Gaza’s security and administration, while safeguarding their legitimate rights and upholding the vision of a two-state solution. He will also highlight the importance of maintaining consultations and close coordination on steps to be taken within UN platforms, the sources added. Relations between Turkiye and Israel have hit new lows during the Gaza war, with President Tayyip Erdogan harshly criticising Israel’s attacks. It was Turkiye that helped persuade Hamas to accept Trump’s peace plan, and Ankara has expressed willingness to take part in the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), proposed to monitor ceasefire implementation in Gaza. However, Israel has made it clear that it won’t accept the presence of Turkish armed forces in Gaza. Other nations part of troop contribution talks include Jordan, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan. Top-level consultations are said to be underway over the question of sending Pakistani troops for the proposed ISF, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the United Nations umbrella. On Saturday, the Jordanian and German foreign ministers had called for a UN mandate for the proposed ISF, saying it would “need a clear basis in international law”. Pakistan’s stance During the Istanbul meeting, Pakistan will emphasise the need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza, as well as the provision of unfettered humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and the reconstruction of Gaza, a statement from the Foreign Office said. Pakistan has remained engaged with the peace initiative that led to the signing of the Gaza Peace Agreement in Sharm El-Sheikh, the FO said. “Pakistan will also reiterate the need for collective efforts aimed at achieving an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders, in accordance with relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative,” the FO added. Pakistan has been, and will continue to be, committed to efforts to restore peace, justice, and dignity to the Palestinian people, as well as to ensure the realisation of their right to self-determination, the statement said.

      "title_orig": "Pakistan eyes 2026 launch for its first Chinese submarine",
      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Navy expects its first Chinese-designed submarine to enter active service next year, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf told Chinese state media. A deal under which Islamabad will take delivery of eight Hangor-class submarines by 2028 is “progressing smoothly,” Admiral Ashraf told the Global Times in an interview published on Sunday, adding that the successful launch of the second and third submarines in China earlier this year was a major milestone for naval collaboration between the two countries. Admiral Ashraf further said that the project was not only significant for the advancement of the Pakistan Navy’s submarine force capabilities, but would also contribute toward self-reliance through transfer of technology and skill development at Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works, according to the report. He said that the Type 054A/P frigates marked another major achievement in China-Pakistan naval cooperation. The publication reported that such multirole frigates were already in service with the Pakistan Navy, quoting Admiral Ashraf as saying that they are “among the most advanced surface combatants”. Admiral Ashraf also told the Global Times that these Chinese-made frigates had greatly strengthened the navy’s multi-mission capability, particularly in air defence, anti-submarine warfare and maritime surveillance. “These platforms are playing a key role in ensuring maritime security in the North Arabian Sea and the broader Indian Ocean region, which is critical for global economy,” he was quoted as saying. The update on the Chinese submarine deal follows the Pakistan Air Force using Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets in May to shoot down an Indian Air Force Rafale aircraft, made by France. The altercation between the nuclear-armed neighbours surprised many in the military community and raised questions over the superiority of Western hardware over Chinese alternatives. Under the terms of the submarine agreement — reportedly worth up to $5 billion — the first four diesel-electric attack submarines will be built in China, with the remaining vessels assembled in Pakistan to improve the nation’s technical capabilities. Pakistan has already launched three of the submarines into China’s Yangtze River from a shipyard in the central province of Hubei. “Chinese-origin platforms and equipment have been reliable, technologically advanced and well-suited to Pakistan Navy’s operational requirements,” Admiral Ashraf told the Global Times , adding that the navy’s experience with them had been positive, both in terms of performance and technical support. “As modern warfare evolves, emerging technologies such as unmanned systems, artificial intelligence and advanced electronic warfare systems are becoming increasingly important. The Pakistan Navy is focusing on these technologies and exploring collaboration with China,” Ashraf was quoted as saying. Islamabad has long been Beijing’s top arms customer, and over the 2020-2024 period bought over 60 per cent of China’s weapons exports, data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows. On the topic of China-Pakistan naval cooperation in the future, Admiral Ashraf said the Pakistan Navy’s partnership with China was built on deep-rooted friendship, mutual respect, trust and shared strategic interests. “In the coming decade, we expect this relationship to grow, encompassing not only shipbuilding and training, but also enhanced interoperability, research, technology sharing and industrial collaboration,“ he was quoted as saying. “There is immense potential for cooperation in advanced technologies, unmanned systems, marine scientific research and maritime industry development. Together, we aim to ensure a secure and stable maritime environment that supports regional peace and prosperity,” he further said, adding that China has been a “trusted partner in the Pakistan Navy’s modernisation journey”.

      "summary_en": "The Pakistan Navy expects its first Chinese-designed submarine to enter active service next year, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf told Chinese state media. A deal under which Islamabad will take delivery of eight Hangor-class submarines by 2028 is “progressing smoothly,” Admiral Ashraf told the Global Times in an interview published on Sunday, adding that the successful launch of the second and third submarines in China earlier this year was a major milestone for naval collaboration between the two countries. Admiral Ashraf further said that the project was not only significant for the advancement of the Pakistan Navy’s submarine force capabilities, but would also contribute toward self-reliance through transfer of technology and skill development at Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works, according to the report. He said that the Type 054A/P frigates marked another major achievement in China-Pakistan naval cooperation. The publication reported that such multirole frigates were already in service with the Pakistan Navy, quoting Admiral Ashraf as saying that they are “among the most advanced surface combatants”. Admiral Ashraf also told the Global Times that these Chinese-made frigates had greatly strengthened the navy’s multi-mission capability, particularly in air defence, anti-submarine warfare and maritime surveillance. “These platforms are playing a key role in ensuring maritime security in the North Arabian Sea and the broader Indian Ocean region, which is critical for global economy,” he was quoted as saying. The update on the Chinese submarine deal follows the Pakistan Air Force using Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets in May to shoot down an Indian Air Force Rafale aircraft, made by France. The altercation between the nuclear-armed neighbours surprised many in the military community and raised questions over the superiority of Western hardware over Chinese alternatives. Under the terms of the submarine agreement — reportedly worth up to $5 billion — the first four diesel-electric attack submarines will be built in China, with the remaining vessels assembled in Pakistan to improve the nation’s technical capabilities. Pakistan has already launched three of the submarines into China’s Yangtze River from a shipyard in the central province of Hubei. “Chinese-origin platforms and equipment have been reliable, technologically advanced and well-suited to Pakistan Navy’s operational requirements,” Admiral Ashraf told the Global Times , adding that the navy’s experience with them had been positive, both in terms of performance and technical support. “As modern warfare evolves, emerging technologies such as unmanned systems, artificial intelligence and advanced electronic warfare systems are becoming increasingly important. The Pakistan Navy is focusing on these technologies and exploring collaboration with China,” Ashraf was quoted as saying. Islamabad has long been Beijing’s top arms customer, and over the 2020-2024 period bought over 60 per cent of China’s weapons exports, data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows. On the topic of China-Pakistan naval cooperation in the future, Admiral Ashraf said the Pakistan Navy’s partnership with China was built on deep-rooted friendship, mutual respect, trust and shared strategic interests. “In the coming decade, we expect this relationship to grow, encompassing not only shipbuilding and training, but also enhanced interoperability, research, technology sharing and industrial collaboration,“ he was quoted as saying. “There is immense potential for cooperation in advanced technologies, unmanned systems, marine scientific research and maritime industry development. Together, we aim to ensure a secure and stable maritime environment that supports regional peace and prosperity,” he further said, adding that China has been a “trusted partner in the Pakistan Navy’s modernisation journey”. He further said that the introduction of advanced frigates and submarines had significantly enhanced the Pakistan Navy’s operational reach, multi-domain war fighting capabilities, and deterrence posture, the publication reported. He said that these platforms, along with joint training and exercises with China, had deepened the two sides’ professional synergy and strengthened interoperability at sea, noting that “this cooperation goes beyond hardware; it reflects a shared strategic outlook, mutual trust, and a long-standing partnership”.",

      "summary_orig": "• Fawad claims over a dozen lawmakers agree with him on need to ‘open channel with govt’; concedes he ‘doesn’t represent PTI’ • Qaiser says party ‘willing to talk to anyone’ if fair polls assured • Ismail says no ‘minus-Imran formula’ LAHORE/ISLAM­ABAD: Even as its founder remains locked up, and the party continues to lose ground, some former PTI members seem to have taken it upon themselves to end the isolation faced by their erstwhile party, proposing talks with the government and other parties to bring down political temperatures and pave the way for Imran Khan’s release. Only a day ago, a number of ex-PTI leaders, including former information minister Fawad Chaudhry and ex-Sindh governor Imran Ismail, had called on party vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a Lahore hospital, ostensibly to seek his blessing for their campaign — an offer Mr Qureshi did not endorse, as per his lawyer. On Sunday, Mr Chaudhry doubled down on his quest to revive the fortunes of the PTI, even as senior party leaders like Asad Qaiser maintained that both the party and its founder “will not compromise on their principles” even if they engage in a dialogue. Speaking to Dawn , Fawad Chaudhry acknowledged that he and his colleagues did not have a mandate to engage with the government on behalf of the PTI. However, as a concerned citizen, he said he wanted the volatile political climate to stabilise. According to the ex-PTI leader, his group will meet the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman next week to ask them to play a role in defusing political tensions. He claimed that most seasoned PTI politicians and more than 15 MPAs had approached him to express their agreement that a government-PTI engagement was “highly necessary”. He urged the government to take the first step towards de-escalation by offering relief to imprisoned senior PTI leaders. “If the government gives relief to the incarcerated Lahore and Gujranwala leaders, then these leaders could engage with the jailed Khan and lead a process of engagement,” he explained. “Imran Khan’s mandate is with the party leaders, who have been in jails for the past two years,” he acknowledged, referring to people like Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Dr Yasmin Rashid. “If the government does not leave any stake for the opposition in the system, the opposition will be left with no option but to hold long marches, resign from assemblies and resort to other modes of protest,” he rued. It may be noted that the government and opposition held a series of talks in the recent past, which did not prove fruitful. “Until the three major players —Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari – and the establishment engage with the incarcerated seasoned politicians, no political engagement will be possible in a volatile situation,” he added. Speaking about his “meeting” with Mr Qureshi and Ejaz Chaudhry, he said he planned to take these leaders on board in light of their letters from jail in which they had urged the party chief for dialogue to break the political deadlock. The incarcerated leaders had written a letter to their jailed chief to consider a dialogue with other political parties instead of insisting on only talking to the military establishment. Downplaying overtures On the other hand, former NA speaker and PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser played down the recent overtures by his former party colleagues, saying they would be prepared to talk only if the “stolen mandate” was returned to the “true representatives”. “The fact is that we have been suggesting for years that the PTI is ready to talk to everyone only if justice is provided to the party without creating any hurdles,” Mr Qaiser told Dawn . “We just want the court cases to be decided on merit. We are willing to talk with anyone about deciding the modalities of the next election and assurances that the next election will be free and fair,” he said. When asked if it was correct that some party leaders wanted to “streamline” the issues with the establishment, but were reluctant due to Imran Khan, Mr Qaiser said that some individuals may have their personal opinions, but it was not the party policy. “During party meetings, it is categorically stated that there will not be any compromise on principles,” he said. However, Fawad Chaudhry said the PTI leadership had failed to create any breakthrough to get Imran Khan out of jail during the past two years. He claimed that he had told Mr Khan that many politicians in the party had vested interests attached to his imprisonment and they would make no efforts to help him get out of jail. No ‘minus formula’ His colleague Imran Ismail dispelled the impression that they were working on a ‘minus Imran formula’ and termed their outreach campaign an “effort to move Pakistan’s politics away from confrontation”. “We privately consulted a number of PTI stalwarts. Almost all admitted that confrontation has failed and that reconciliation is the only way forward,” he said in a lengthy statement posted on X (formerly Twitter). “When we met Chaudhry Ejaz in Kot Lakhpat Jail and Shah Mehmood Qureshi at PKLI, both — while firmly standing with Khan — agreed that the stalemate must end. They sought normal political breathing space, not surrender,” he said. He said if any PTI leader believed that “continuing agitation and confrontation is the right path, he should come forward and convince the rest of us who think otherwise”.

This was the most powerful storm to strike the island nation, packing winds of up to 185mph at its peak. Western parts of Jamaica were worst hit, with 90% of homes in the town of Black River losing their roof or being destroyed entirely.
