      "summary_orig": "After Sri Lanka’s win against Ireland on Sunday night in Colombo, Ramiz Raja declared that a win is a win, whether it is against “minnows”, or the “big boys”. The term “minnow”, in the cricketing context especially, refers to a smaller, ‘less serious’ opposition. Despite being a test-playing nation, Ireland tends to often be categorised under this moniker. However, the term is also heavily used to refer to associate cricketing nations – those teams that do not yet have permanent ICC membership or test-playing status. While one could argue that Ramiz Raja meant well, his choice of words came across as patronising and dismissive of the effort associate nations put into cricket. The opening weekend of the ongoing T20 World Cup offered ample evidence to the contrary. T20 opens with edge-of-seat contests The opening days of the tournament featured games across venues in India and Sri Lanka. Notably, many of these games were closely contested — especially the opening weekend fixtures — with the matches ebbing and flowing, and rarely was one team distinctly ahead in the contest than the other. The closest of these to home was of course the opening fixture between Pakistan and the Netherlands. While Pakistan was relatively comfortable in the chase, a spectacular middle-order collapse left the team reeling, requiring 29 runs off the final two overs. It was a penultimate-over cameo by Faheem Ashraf, complemented by a fortuitous dropped catch that got Pakistan over the line. For all intents and purposes, the match should have been an easier one to win for Pakistan, with the team being just 2 wickets down when they needed 50 to win off the same number of balls. However, Netherlands’ performance established a trend that developed in the games to follow: associate nations showing up as exceptionally competent, competitive sides, making the contests much different than the one-sided affairs the uninitiated might have expected. It should also be noted that the Netherlands are hardly strangers to success at ICC tournaments. In 2022, they defeated South Africa (to the considerable benefit of Pakistan’s qualification scenarios) in a spectacular upset, and followed it up by an even more impressive win against the same opponent in the 2023 ODI World Cup. Later in the day, the USA put India under pressure in the powerplay, reducing them to 46 for four . A solid captain’s knock by Suryakumar Yadav ensured India ended up with a close-to-par score that the bowlers defended convincingly — but USA had done enough to prove that they are a side to be taken seriously in theT20 World Cup. Perhaps the most convincing of these associate performances came when evening. The atmosphere at the Wankhede was electric as Nepal took on England on Sunday, the stands packed with hundreds of Nepal fans roaring their team on as they came agonisingly close to chasing down England’s 183. In the end, Nepal fell just four runs short, with England barely escaping jail — and only after being tested to the absolute limit. On Monday morning, Italy faced Scotland in a historic first World Cup appearance for the European nation, having qualified for the tournament by finishing second in the 2025 Europe Qualifiers. T20: Cricket’s great equaliser While the scheduling of the T20 World Cups attracts its fair share of criticism — for being held every two years instead of four and for over-saturating the sport’s calendar — it is undeniable that the 20-team format is the closest cricket has come to a truly global tournament. T20 cricket itself is often criticised for diluting the essence of the game: for being too fast-paced, for driving over-commercialisation, and for indirectly undermining international formats due to the financial pull of franchise leagues. What is often overlooked, however, is that the brevity and volatility of the shortest format enable something the longer formats do not: they narrow the gap created by disparities in skill, resources, and financial strength between associate nations and established teams. At times, Test and ODI cricket serve more as displays of endurance than of outright skill. Teams operating with limited financial and administrative resources often face corresponding limitations in infrastructure: inadequate cricketing grounds and wickets, insufficient equipment, and sparse training facilities. As a result, even associate cricketing nations with abundant talent may struggle to develop players into durable all-format cricketers. Furthermore, the current ICC calendar is heavily oriented around full-member nations playing each other, with associate nations rarely getting the opportunity to face stronger opponents in bilateral series that could strengthen their game. The lack of consistent match practice and training resources can lead to the raw talent of these players diminishing over the extended durations of Tests or one-day matches. T20 cricket, however, presents a different scenario. Played over just four hours, it allows associate nations to compete within a timeframe that lets them showcase their full strength, even against much stronger teams. T20 cricket is also the most accessible format. Permanent Test and ODI status is reserved for full-member nations, and temporary ODI status is often contingent on performance and other criteria. For many associate nations, T20 cricket remains the primary format in which they can consistently participate. As the T20 game has evolved, so too has the arsenal of format-specific skills available to players. This allows teams to concentrate their development on this particular format, fostering a clear understanding of player roles, management strategies, and tactical approaches tailored specifically to T20 cricket. In the games played so far, the craft of associate spinners has been particularly noteworthy, with standout performances by Nepal’s Dipendra Singh Airee and the Netherlands’ Aryan Dutt against England and Pakistan serving as proof. Add to this the increasingly fast-paced (and therefore precarious and volatile) nature of T20 cricket, and the possibilities multiply. While teams with greater time and structural investment naturally maintain an advantage, it is not as decisive as it would be in the longer formats. This is also why many “upsets” in cricket occur during T20 matches. A shorter game allows unlikely winners to emerge by sustaining moments of brilliance and consistency long enough to tip the balance. Notable examples from recent years include the Netherlands defeating South Africa in 2022, the USA beating Pakistan in 2024, Namibia overcoming Sri Lanka in 2022, and Nepal winning 2-1 against the West Indies in a three-match series in 2025. Cricket still has a long way to go before it becomes a truly global sport. The disparities in resources and decision-making autonomy remain stark — both within some full-member nations and, more dramatically, between them and associate nations. Some teams, like the Netherlands, have competed as associate nations for many years across multiple tournaments, often attracting criticism for stagnation. An opponent is an opponent However, through T20 cricket, especially world cups, associate nations are making a mark for themselves by producing powerful performances more consistently than they did in previous years. Problems of materials and resources aside, what also needs to change in the broader cricketing fraternity is the way associate nations are talked about and approached as sporting entities. Words like “minnows” and “small teams” diminishes the spirit and skill that these teams show up with to compete against opponents who have an advantage of decades and millions in front of them. On paper, fans of established teams might rightly expect their sides to win. But there needs to be a breakdown in the sense of shame created around losing, or almost losing, to associate teams. Recognising and awarding merit to their successes, viewing them as genuine victories rather than mere “upsets,” would be a crucial step toward granting associate nations the legitimacy they deserve as serious competitors rather than formalities. An opponent is an opponent is an opponent. An cricket is so close to understanding why.",

Perhaps the most convincing of these associate performances came when evening. The atmosphere at the Wankhede was electric as Nepal took on England on Sunday, the stands packed with hundreds of Nepal fans roaring their team on as they came agonisingly close to chasing down England’s 183. In the end, Nepal fell just four runs short, with England barely escaping jail — and only after being tested to the absolute limit. On Monday morning, Italy faced Scotland in a historic first World Cup appearance for the European nation, having qualified for the tournament by finishing second in the 2025 Europe Qualifiers. T20: Cricket’s great equaliser While the scheduling of the T20 World Cups attracts its fair share of criticism — for being held every two years instead of four and for over-saturating the sport’s calendar — it is undeniable that the 20-team format is the closest cricket has come to a truly global tournament. T20 cricket itself is often criticised for diluting the essence of the game: for being too fast-paced, for driving over-commercialisation, and for indirectly undermining international formats due to the financial pull of franchise leagues. What is often overlooked, however, is that the brevity and volatility of the shortest format enable something the longer formats do not: they narrow the gap created by disparities in skill, resources, and financial strength between associate nations and established teams. At times, Test and ODI cricket serve more as displays of endurance than of outright skill. Teams operating with limited financial and administrative resources often face corresponding limitations in infrastructure: inadequate cricketing grounds and wickets, insufficient equipment, and sparse training facilities. As a result, even associate cricketing nations with abundant talent may struggle to develop players into durable all-format cricketers. Furthermore, the current ICC calendar is heavily oriented around full-member nations playing each other, with associate nations rarely getting the opportunity to face stronger opponents in bilateral series that could strengthen their game. The lack of consistent match practice and training resources can lead to the raw talent of these players diminishing over the extended durations of Tests or one-day matches. T20 cricket, however, presents a different scenario. Played over just four hours, it allows associate nations to compete within a timeframe that lets them showcase their full strength, even against much stronger teams. T20 cricket is also the most accessible format. Permanent Test and ODI status is reserved for full-member nations, and temporary ODI status is often contingent on performance and other criteria. For many associate nations, T20 cricket remains the primary format in which they can consistently participate. As the T20 game has evolved, so too has the arsenal of format-specific skills available to players. This allows teams to concentrate their development on this particular format, fostering a clear understanding of player roles, management strategies, and tactical approaches tailored specifically to T20 cricket. In the games played so far, the craft of associate spinners has been particularly noteworthy, with standout performances by Nepal’s Dipendra Singh Airee and the Netherlands’ Aryan Dutt against England and Pakistan serving as proof. Add to this the increasingly fast-paced (and therefore precarious and volatile) nature of T20 cricket, and the possibilities multiply. While teams with greater time and structural investment naturally maintain an advantage, it is not as decisive as it would be in the longer formats. This is also why many “upsets” in cricket occur during T20 matches. A shorter game allows unlikely winners to emerge by sustaining moments of brilliance and consistency long enough to tip the balance. Notable examples from recent years include the Netherlands defeating South Africa in 2022, the USA beating Pakistan in 2024, Namibia overcoming Sri Lanka in 2022, and Nepal winning 2-1 against the West Indies in a three-match series in 2025. Cricket still has a long way to go before it becomes a truly global sport. The disparities in resources and decision-making autonomy remain stark — both within some full-member nations and, more dramatically, between them and associate nations. Some teams, like the Netherlands, have competed as associate nations for many years across multiple tournaments, often attracting criticism for stagnation. An opponent is an opponent However, through T20 cricket, especially world cups, associate nations are making a mark for themselves by producing powerful performances more consistently than they did in previous years. Problems of materials and resources aside, what also needs to change in the broader cricketing fraternity is the way associate nations are talked about and approached as sporting entities. Words like “minnows” and “small teams” diminishes the spirit and skill that these teams show up with to compete against opponents who have an advantage of decades and millions in front of them. On paper, fans of established teams might rightly expect their sides to win. But there needs to be a breakdown in the sense of shame created around losing, or almost losing, to associate teams. Recognising and awarding merit to their successes, viewing them as genuine victories rather than mere “upsets,” would be a crucial step toward granting associate nations the legitimacy they deserve as serious competitors rather than formalities. An opponent is an opponent is an opponent. An cricket is so close to understanding why.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: There was an outcry in the upper house of Parliament on Tuesday against changes by the power regulator in the contracts for solar consumers, with the government defending the move. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network. The notification effectively terminated the existing net-metering regime and replaced it with net-billing for all. Speaking on a motion in the Senate on Tuesday, PTI Senator Syed Ali Zafar strongly criticised the government’s decision to withdraw net metering benefits for solar consumers, calling it a grave breach of trust and a cruel act against the people of Pakistan. Senator Zafar stated that a promise, once made, must be honoured and when that promise came from the state, it became sacrosanct. He recalled that the government had assured citizens that if they invested in solar energy, they would be provided net metering on equitable terms. This policy, he said, was presented not only as a personal financial benefit but as a national cause — reducing dependence on imported fuel, lowering energy costs, and moving Pakistan towards clean and sustainable energy. He said the government made a solemn commitment to the people, urging them to invest for their own benefit and for the future of Pakistan, while assuring that issues with independent power producers (IPPs) would be addressed as citizens shifted to self-generation through solar power. Acting on this assurance, people across the country invested heavily in solar panels, he said. He further stated that families diverted their life savings, sold assets, and even took loans, which they were still repaying, to install solar systems. Senator Zafar said that solar energy was present in nearly every household, commercial building, and agricultural operation. Despite this, the government abruptly turned around and sought to cancel its commitment retrospectively, he regretted. He termed retrospective withdrawal and retrospective imposition as a grave injustice. He also pointed out that under established law, the doctrine of promissory estoppel — a legal doctrine allowing enforcement of a promise lacking formal consideration to prevent injustice — applied. Calling the decision “the most cruel act of the government”, Senator Zafar said it was akin to throwing a bomb into the already burdened lives of Pakistani citizens, who were struggling with soaring electricity bills and economic hardship. He questioned how the government could expect foreign investment when it failed to honour commitments made to its own people. Addressing the claim that the decision rested with Nepra, supposedly an independent authority, Senator Zafar categorically rejected this assertion. He said that Nepra did not act independently but followed government directives. Any suggestion to the contrary, he said, would be misleading. He challenged the government to prove its sincerity by making a clear commitment to ensure that the decision was withdrawn. He warned that the decision was disastrous, undermined public trust, damaged Pakistan’s investment climate, and punished those who acted in good faith for the betterment of the country. In her remarks, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said that the decision by Nepra was beyond understanding. She said that the middle class was questioning why the government provided incentives for solar power in the first place, if this decision was to be taken. “How can you do this to your country and citizens who are being affected the most by climate change?” she asked. She said that the problem lay with the distribution system, asking what message was being sent to investors by changing tariffs again and again. “You have made electricity bills an instrument through which various taxes are being imposed,” she said. She said that instead of setting up artificial intelligence centres like other countries, Pakistan was increasing the power bills of consumers. “Manufacturing companies and domestic consumers should be provided with cheap electricity,” she said, adding that major manufacturing industries were leaving Pakistan due to heavy taxes and expensive energy. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam — Fazl Senator Kamran Murtaza and PTI Senator Zeeshan Khanzada also spoke on similar lines. However, Power Minister Awais Leghari defended the move, stating that Nepra was within its remit to do so and that it had been done to take the burden off consumers. “Changing regulations according to the law and the Constitution is a regulator’s job,” he said, adding that he refused to step back from this. “This is not policy; there should be clarity on that,” he maintained. “This is a change in regulations, which was conducted according to the Constitution and Pakistan’s laws,” he said. The minister added that seminars were held involving solar associations, consumers and all other stakeholders, and that matters were settled with them last June. “The Solar Association of Pakistan — whose bread and butter is installing and investing in these systems — conveyed to us that what the government was doing was not just necessary, but without it, public interests could not be saved,” the minister emphasised. Leghari added that the solar association warned that up to 95 per cent of people would suffer “greater damages and increased burdens”. “They said in June, don’t do this now, wait at least five or six months and carry out a proper transition,” he stated. “Nepra, a regulator with the responsibility of maintaining its consumers’ interests, was formed to watch consumer interest and protect people from increases in electricity prices.” The minister noted that PTI Senator Ali Zafar spoke about retrospective effects, but said that there were none in this regulation. “I am proud to say that in this regulation, our regulator did not reverse one clause on these contracts, which used to last seven years,” Leghari said. He added that Zafar mentioned that these contracts would last 20 years, before assailing the PTI government. “Under that, Imran Niazi, electricity prices were touching the sky and we are trying to deal with it right now,” he added. The minister emphasised that there were no 20-year contracts. “It was a seven-year contract and until it expires, nobody in this country has dared to insert new terms and conditions in the contract. Nepra has not done this either,” he stated. He added that of the over 30 million consumers, 466,506 of them had net-metering. “These 466,506 consumers have put 7,000 megawatts (mW) of electricity on net-metering,” the minister stated. “Other than these 466,000 consumers, there are 30.04m who live in flats or slums, where they cannot install solar systems, or they cannot afford them. “If Nepra allowed electricity to be bought at these rates, then the 30.04m consumers — who are the true public — would have to shoulder a Rs200 billion burden left by net-metering consumers, which would increase to Rs550bn,” Leghari added. The minister further said that nothing would happen to the existing contracts of the 466,000 consumers, but that these were regulations for future consumers. “What we are saying is that we will buy electricity from you based on the average rate of the grid,” he explained. Leghari added that consumer regulations were evolving. “These are policies formed by innovative thinking which evolve with time, and these aren’t even policies, they are just regulations,” he added. “This is not the first time regulations have been changed, or rates have been revised.”",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) on Monday completed the ‘Golden Eagle’ training exercise, where artificial intelligence (AI) and the use of new indigenous technology were focused on, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. According to the statement, the exercise took place in “Southern Air Command’s area of responsibility”, to “validate combat readiness and operational agility through the synchronised employment of PAF’s complete combat potential”. “The exercise was executed under unified command and control from the Next-Generation All-Domain Command and Control Centre, [at] Air Headquarters, Islamabad,” the statement said. It added that the exercise was conducted on a two-force construct and particularly focused on AI-enabled and net-centric operations, while integrating indigenous niche, disruptive and smart technologies, in line with evolving regional security dynamics. ISPR said that while operating within a robust integrated air defence system, participants seamlessly combined kinetic, cyber, space and electromagnetic spectrum operations. “The kinetic phase featured first-shoot, first-kill swing-role combat aircraft equipped with long-range beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, extended-range stand-off weapons and precision strike capabilities, supported by airborne early warning and control platforms and air-to-air refuellers,” the statement said. It added that the key highlight of the exercise was “manned-unmanned teaming”, where drones and loitering munitions were sent to operate in a highly contested, congested and degraded environment, to validate the PAF’s capability to conduct high-tempo operations. “The successful conduct of exercise ‘Golden Eagle’ reaffirms PAF’s unwavering commitment to maintaining a high state of operational preparedness, leveraging indigenous innovation and effectively countering emerging and future security challenges,” the statement concluded.",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Tuesday paid a visit to Quetta, where she met with her Balochistan counterpart CM Sarfraz Bugti and assured him of her full support. CM Maryam’s visit comes in the wake of a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days . Security forces had responded by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 ” in the province. “As the chief minister of Punjab, as a Pakistani and as your sister, all services and resources of Punjab, whatever cooperation or support you need — whether in operations against khawarij here or any kind of challenges in the government — we are with you,” Maryam said. She further assured Bugti, “Whatever kind of support you need, I am just a call away. I will be very glad if I can assist you or do something for the people of Balochistan.” Noting that this was her first visit to another province after assuming the office of Punjab CM in February 2024 , Maryam said she was glad it was to Quetta. “You have rightly said that you do not have fitna , but you have Fitna al Khawarij , which is your own unique set of challenges that Balochistan is facing,” she further remarked, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “A lot of courage and firmness is needed for it, which you are demonstrating by governing Balochistan in such situations, so hats off to you, CM sahib ,” Maryam said. The Punjab chief minister said she visited the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in the morning, where the “commitment” she saw was very “promising and encouraged” her. She prayed that may God help “Balochistan move forward and very soon eradicate the menace of terrorism” from the province. “May Balochistan be a cradle of peace, safety and happiness,” she added. According to her PML-N, CM Maryam held a meeting with Bugti and Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail. She also attended an event at the FC headquarters. Punjab gives Rs10bn for Balochistan forces Separately, CM Bugti also lauded Rs10 billion in “assistance for security forces” from the Punjab government. A post on X by the CM Office quoted Bugti as welcoming Maryam to Quetta, adding: “The assistance of Rs10bn for security forces is a positive and commendable step.” Bugti further affirmed, “The Balochistan government and the opposition is united for the people’s welfare. According to the post, the Punjab chief minister also met with members of the provincial cabinet and leaders of allied parties. Speaking to reporters after their meeting, CM Bugti lauded the Punjab chief minister’s visit to Quetta, saying her visit was “very respectful for us, especially during a time when we are confronting a situation”. “And helping our security forces, which required Rs10 billion […] she gave the entire Rs10bn,” he said, lauding CM Maryam’s announcement and terming it a “great justice” to Balochistan.",

Security forces had responded by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 ” in the province. “As the chief minister of Punjab, as a Pakistani and as your sister, all services and resources of Punjab, whatever cooperation or support you need — whether in operations against khawarij here or any kind of challenges in the government — we are with you,” Maryam said. She further assured Bugti, “Whatever kind of support you need, I am just a call away. I will be very glad if I can assist you or do something for the people of Balochistan.” Noting that this was her first visit to another province after assuming the office of Punjab CM in February 2024 , Maryam said she was glad it was to Quetta. “You have rightly said that you do not have fitna , but you have Fitna al Khawarij , which is your own unique set of challenges that Balochistan is facing,” she further remarked, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “A lot of courage and firmness is needed for it, which you are demonstrating by governing Balochistan in such situations, so hats off to you, CM sahib ,” Maryam said. The Punjab chief minister said she visited the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in the morning, where the “commitment” she saw was very “promising and encouraged” her. She prayed that may God help “Balochistan move forward and very soon eradicate the menace of terrorism” from the province. “May Balochistan be a cradle of peace, safety and happiness,” she added. According to her PML-N, CM Maryam held a meeting with Bugti and Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail. She also attended an event at the FC headquarters. Punjab gives Rs10bn for Balochistan forces Separately, CM Bugti also lauded Rs10 billion in “assistance for security forces” from the Punjab government. A post on X by the CM Office quoted Bugti as welcoming Maryam to Quetta, adding: “The assistance of Rs10bn for security forces is a positive and commendable step.” Bugti further affirmed, “The Balochistan government and the opposition is united for the people’s welfare. According to the post, the Punjab chief minister also met with members of the provincial cabinet and leaders of allied parties. Speaking to reporters after their meeting, CM Bugti lauded the Punjab chief minister’s visit to Quetta, saying her visit was “very respectful for us, especially during a time when we are confronting a situation”. “And helping our security forces, which required Rs10 billion […] she gave the entire Rs10bn,” he said, lauding CM Maryam’s announcement and terming it a “great justice” to Balochistan.",

      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari welcomed Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s invitation to visit the country and emphasised strengthening ties between Islamabad and Tashkent, the president’s media wing said on Tuesday. According to a press release by the President’s Secretariat, the president met with Uzbek Ambassador Alisher Tukhtaev, who called on him at Aiwan-e-Sadr and handed over a letter from the Uzbek president, who had visited Pakistan for two days last week. In his letter, Mirziyoyev thanked President Zardari, the government and the people of Pakistan for the extraordinary hospitality and warm welcome extended to him during his visit. He also expressed gratitude for being conferred the Nishan-e-Pakistan, Pakistan’s highest civil award, as well as the honorary professorship and doctorate, according to the statement. “President Mirziyoyev reiterated his invitation to President Zardari, earlier conveyed during their tête-à-tête,” it added, referring to the Uzbek president’s invitation to President Zardari to visit Uzbekistan “at a convenient time in order to further develop comprehensive cooperation”. “President Zardari accepted the invitation and directed the concerned authorities from the Pakistani side to coordinate with their Uzbek counterparts to finalise the visit later this year.” The president said that Pakistan attached great significance to its close brotherly relations with Uzbekistan, while underscoring the importance of effective follow-up on the outcomes of Mirziyoyev’s recent “historic and result-oriented” state visit to Pakistan, the statement said. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening cooperation with Uzbekistan in “key sectors including food and agriculture, mining, information technology, tourism, health and banking”. The president also welcomed Uzbekistan’s interest in importing halal meat, fruits and potatoes from Pakistan as a positive step towards enhancing bilateral trade, it added. “President Zardari also conveyed his gratitude to Mirziyoyev for his message of solidarity and support following the recent terrorist attack in Islamabad,” the statement said. Zardari reaffirmed the shared resolve of Pakistan and Uzbekistan to “continue their joint journey of peace, stability and development”. During Mirziyoyev’s two-day visit to Pakistan, the two sides signed a protocol for enhancing bilateral trade between the two countries to $2 billion within the next five years. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his delight that the Uzbek president and his delegation visited Islamabad, his “second home”, for the second time in four years. Meanwhile, Mirziyoyev declared that Pakistan was Uzbekistan’s “time-tested, reliable partner and closest friend” in South Asia.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran on Tuesday warned of “destructive” influence on diplomacy ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington for talks expected to focus on US negotiations with Tehran. “Our negotiating party is America. It is up to America to decide to act independently of the pressures and destructive influences that are detrimental to the region,” said Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei in a weekly press briefing. “The Zionist regime has repeatedly, as a saboteur, shown that it opposes any diplomatic process in our region that leads to peace.” Tehran and Washington resumed talks in Muscat on Friday, months after earlier negotiations collapsed following Israel’s unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June, which triggered a 12-day war. During the conflict, Israel targeted senior Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists and nuclear sites, as well as residential areas. The United States later joined the campaign, launching its own strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran responded with drone and missile attacks on Israel and by targeting the largest US military base in the Middle East, located in Qatar. “The June experience was a very bad experience. Therefore, taking these experiences into account, we are determined to secure Iran’s national interests through diplomacy,” Baqaei said. He insisted that Iran’s focus would remain strictly on the nuclear file in return for sanctions relief. Tehran has repeatedly said it rejects any negotiations that extend beyond that issue. On Saturday, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that the Israeli premier “believes any negotiations must include limitations on ballistic missiles and a halting of the support for the Iranian axis”. The talks followed threats from Washington and the deployment of a US aircraft carrier group to the region after Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month. Iranian authorities said the protests, which erupted in late December over the rising cost of living, began as peaceful demonstrations before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, which they said were inflamed by the United States and Israel.",

      "title_orig": "REGION: A RESURGENT JAMAAT IN BANGLADESH",
      "summary_orig": "Ramesh Chandra, 44, from Gopalganj district in Bangladesh’s southwest, 127 kilometres from the capital Dhaka, has been making sculptures for over two decades. He is a voter in the Gopalganj-3 constituency, from where former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was elected for eight consecutive terms. Chandra has long supported Hasina’s Awami League. But this time, the situation is different. Following the mass student-led uprising on August 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina fled to India. On May 10, 2025, the interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, banned the political activities of the Awami League and all its affiliates, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, a domestic judicial body founded by Hasina in 2010, is currently prosecuting Awami League leaders for “genocide” and “crimes against humanity”, related to the 2024 movement. Ironically, the same tribunal sentenced Hasina to death for ordering a crackdown on the 2024 protesters. Previously, the tribunal had awarded death sentences to several Jamaat-i-Islami leaders for ‘war crimes’ during the 1971 war and supporting Pakistan, resulting in the execution of Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mujahid in 2015 and Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami in 2016. Once banned and vilified in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-i-Islami is now polling neck-and-neck with the country’s mainstream opposition. As the country prepares for its first election since the 2024 uprising, voters disillusioned with corruption are turning to an unexpected alternative… The current government has stated that the Awami League will not be able to resume political activities until the trial is completed. As a result, the Awami League will not participate in the upcoming February 12 elections, the first national polls since the mass uprising. Despite being banned, the Awami League is campaigning against the polls on social media. When asked if he would be voting this time, Chandra tells Eos, “Why wouldn’t I vote? I will vote and, this time, I will vote for the Jamaat. Everyone has had a chance. This time, Jamaat should be given a chance,” he continues. “Besides, none of them [Jamaat leaders] engage in corruption and extortion,” he claims. Like Chandra, many other voters are now also leaning towards the Jamaat-i-Islami, reflecting a broader electoral transformation sweeping Bangladesh. A SURGING POLITICAL FORCE A December survey by the US-based International Republican Institute (IRI) showed 30 percent of voters backing the party of the late former PM Khaleda Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP); 26 percent supporting the Jamaat-i-Islami; and six percent supporting the National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student activists involved in the August 2024 popular uprising. Another mid-January joint poll by Projection BD, IILD, Jagoron Foundation and NarratiV indicates a tighter race, with BNP at 34.7 percent, Jamaat close behind at 33.6 percent and NCP at 7.1 percent. It’s a remarkable turnaround for both the leading parties, whose leaders had been incarcerated and executed and particularly for the Jamaat, which was banned under the Sheikh Hasina regime. Analysts say the Jamaat is competing closely with the BNP due to growing public dissatisfaction with corruption and extortion at the grassroots level, following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Jamaat has sought to capitalise on this sentiment by presenting itself as a disciplined alternative. Its initiatives, including digital tools to track extortion complaints and monitor government spending, have drawn widespread attention. The party’s rising popularity among young voters is also evident. According to Election Commission data from November 2025, Bangladesh has around 127.7 million registered voters, including roughly 45 million aged 18 to 35. In recent student union elections at several universities, including Dhaka University, the Jamaat’s student wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir, won decisively across contested positions, while the BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal failed to secure any significant posts. Many experts believe the student parliament elections could influence the next national polls, though others disagree. The Jamaat-i-Islami has formed an 11-party electoral alliance for the upcoming elections, including with the NCP, the student-led party. With the Awami League absent, the BNP and the Jamaat-led coalition are poised to be the main contenders. Nahid Islam, convener of the NCP, tells Eos that the alliance is electoral rather than ideological. “Our political views differ from those of Jamaat-i-Islami, but we align on reform, justice and anti-corruption agendas,” he says. “That is why we formed this alliance.” Islam is confident that their 11-party coalition will get the votes. “If given the chance to form the government, decisions will be made on common principles and will not be dominated by any single party,” he adds. The JI chief, or ameer, Dr Shafiqur Rahman tells Eos that his party is receiving “overwhelming support” from across the country, citing independent surveys by, what he termed, credible pollsters. Dr Rahman says that, since the official campaign began on January 22, he has travelled to nearly half of Bangladesh, visiting more than two dozen districts and addressing around 100 public rallies. “At each rally, the crowds were overwhelming,” he says, claiming that large numbers of supporters had turned out in favour of Jamaat candidates. “The country has not witnessed such political euphoria in more than two and a half decades,” believes Dr Rahman. According to political analysts, the upcoming election, held after the 2024 popular uprising, could be the most important in the party’s history, with it potentially winning more seats than ever before. Last month, The Washington Post reported that US diplomats were seeking closer engagement with the Jamaat, expecting it to perform strongly. The publication said it has audio recordings that reveal a US diplomat describing the Jamaat as a potential “friend” and stating that it cannot impose Sharia-rule in the country due to Western economic pressure. The prospect of a Jamaat-led government has raised concerns in India, Bangladesh’s largest neighbour and Sheikh Hasina’s longtime ally. New Delhi views the Jamaat as pro-Pakistan, citing the party’s opposition to Bangladesh’s 1971 war that led to the country’s creation and alleged historical ties to Islamabad. Indian officials worry that the Jamaat coming to power could reorient Bangladesh’s traditionally India-friendly foreign policy. BNP supporters gather for a rally ahead of the upcoming national election, in Sylhet on Jan 22, 2026 THE QUESTION OF CAPABILITY Jamaat chief Dr Rahman is confident that his party is ready to govern. “If Allah wills it and the people give us the mandate on February 12, we are ready,” he tells Eos. “Over the past half-century, Jamaat has built a talented and honest pool of leaders, capable of managing every sector.” He recalled the 2001 BNP-Jamaat alliance government, noting that ministers such as Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mujahid efficiently managed key portfolios, introduced programmes that boosted employment, utilised taxpayers’ money for development, and rooted out corruption. “Now, after more than 20 years, we are even more confident our leaders will govern effectively across all ministries,” Dr Rahman adds. Dr Rahman’s thoughts are echoed by one of his party candidates, lawyer Mohammad Shishir Monir. “I alone am capable of running 10 ministries,” he tells Eos. “We have dozens more in our party like me, who are capable of running the country.” However, Dhaka University professor and political analyst Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan says that, while Jamaat had some experience in the BNP government from 2001 to 2006, they lack the experience of administration and running the government. Dilara Chowdhury, a former professor and political analyst at Jahangirnagar University, points out that capability and honesty matter more than experience when it comes to running the country. “Currently, Jamaat has more educated and qualified people in its ranks than other parties,” she adds. An analysis of candidates’ affidavits by Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo shows that, of the 224 candidates contesting under the JI’s scales symbol, 201 are highly educated, including 10 with PhD degrees. Among the 287 BNP candidates contesting under the rice sheaf symbol, 229 are highly educated, including eight PhDs. The analysis indicates that the percentage of highly educated and PhD-holding candidates among Jamaat’s ranks is slightly higher than that of the BNP. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM Jamaat-i-Islami chief Dr Rahman says the party’s goal is to establish a country based on insaaf [justice], where the majority are not ruled by a chosen few, public wealth is not plundered and no one remains above the law. “Is this not the basic tenet of a model Islamic society?,” he asks. “Is this not the demand of Gen Z, who overthrew a corrupt and fascist regime?” Dr Rahman emphasises that Bangladesh’s multicultural and multi-ethnic population would continue to enjoy equal rights as enshrined in the constitution. “We believe in the rule of law, transparency, accountability, democracy and shura [consultation],” he says. “These principles are already embedded in our constitution and we do not view them as contradictory to Islamic values. You may call it ‘Sharia’ or any other name.” Dr Rahman adds that any elements contradicting Islamic principles would be addressed through parliament, not by force. “Our opponents often use scare tactics, suggesting that ‘Sharia law’ would force women into strict dress codes or deny them education or careers,” he continues. “We have repeatedly clarified that no such measures will be enforced. Women will enjoy equity and fairness in all spheres of life,” Dr Rahman asserts. The party chief also addresses concerns over a Jamaat-led government’s adherence to national laws and UN human rights standards. “As a democratic party that has participated in every election since its inception, no one can deny that Jamaat-i-Islami is committed to the people’s mandate,” he says. Dr Rahman adds that the party sees democratic nations in the West and East as strategic partners and aims to build a stable, pluralistic society based on freedom of expression, rule of law, equity and justice. The Jamaat chief also points out that, despite attempts by the previous Awami League government to portray the Jamaat as militant, “they were never able to produce a single piece of evidence of Jamaat leaders or workers being involved in terrorism.” Bangladesh's Jamaat-i-Islami supporters shout slogans during a campaign rally in Mirpur on January 22, 2026 | AFP FROM PARIAH TO CONTENDER The Jamaat-i-Islami was founded in 1941 in Lahore, British India, by Islamist scholar Abul Ala Maududi. The party advocates Islam as the foundation for the state and society. During the 1971 war, JI opposed Bangladesh’s independence, and its leaders were accused of collaborating with the Pakistani army and committing war crimes. The party was banned after independence, but the ban was lifted following political changes in 1975, and it returned to politics in 1979. The Jamaat won 18 seats in the 1991 elections, three in 1996, 17 in 2001, and two in 2008 — a modest to poor showing in previous elections. A high court cancelled the party’s registration in 2013, while JI also boycotted the 2014 elections. In 2018, with the party still declared illegal, some of its candidates ran under BNP tickets while others contested as independents. The party remained ineligible for the 2024 election, with the ban only overturned after Hasina’s ouster. Dr Rahman, its chief, attributes the party’s growing current support to greater public exposure after the student-led July 2024 revolution and wider social media visibility, following decades of what he called “unfair” media portrayal. Dr Rahman thinks that the party’s suffering under the previous government, including the execution of its leaders and the imprisonment of its members, has earned it public sympathy. Unlike other parties, he claims, the Jamaat has avoided revenge or corruption. Instead, he says, the Jamaat cooperated with the interim government and the judiciary following Hasina’s ouster, demonstrating moral integrity that has won the party public support. Analysts say another key factor is public frustration with corruption and extortion involving BNP leaders and activists, while the Jamaat has relatively avoided such allegations. “People are fed up with BNP leaders and activists because of extortion,” says analyst Dilara Chowdhury. She adds that corruption and extortion lie at the root of most crises in Bangladesh and effective curbs could significantly reduce the country’s problems. Dr Khan of Dhaka University says that, with the marginalisation of the Awami League, the Jamaat has emerged as an alternative for some voters. “Public sympathy for the Jamaat has increased to some extent due to repression over the past 15 years,” he tells Eos. Like the Jamaat, the BNP is also campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. Speaking at a rally in Chittagong on January 25, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman said the party would crack down on corruption if elected. Analyst Dilara Chowdhury points out, however, that the public has greater trust in the Jamaat than the BNP on corruption. “During BNP’s time in power from 2001 to 2006, corruption was not reduced. That is why many people do not trust the BNP,” she adds. The Jamaat has also announced plans to launch a mobile app aimed at tackling extortion. At a recent election rally in Dhaka, Dr Rahman revealed that the app would allow individuals to anonymously file complaints against extortionists. By contrast, since August 5, 2024, numerous BNP leaders and activists have been implicated in cases relating to extortion and other allegations. Following media reports, the party expelled several thousand members. On September 18, 2025, BNP chairman Tarique Rahman said organisational action had been taken against more than 7,000 party members in response to various allegations. Analysts also point to internal conflict within BNP, which they say has not been evident within Jamaat. According to an October 2025 report by Dhaka-based Human Rights Support Society (HRSS), at least 85 people were killed and 5,017 were injured in internal BNP clashes between September 2024 and September 2025. Another factor behind the JI’s growing popularity is the party’s charitable activities, including welfare and social assistance programmes. Through disaster relief, financial support for low-income families, and educational and medical assistance, the party has expanded its engagement at the local level. In addition, institutions associated with the Jamaat, including banks, hospitals, coaching centres, schools and colleges, have helped create employment opportunities for party workers and supporters, while also providing education and healthcare services to the wider public. It is no surprise, then, that voters such as Gopalganj’s Ramesh Chandra are planning to stamp their vote on the scales symbol in the upcoming elections. But whether the Jamaat can translate polling numbers into actual seats, navigate coalition politics and govern a diverse nation of 170 million remains to be seen. What is certain is that the February 12 elections will reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape in ways unimaginable just 18 months ago — when Hasina still ruled and Jamaat was still fighting for political survival. For a party that opposed the country’s founding, the possibility of now leading it represents perhaps the most dramatic political reversal in Bangladesh’s history.

      "summary_en": "Ramesh Chandra, 44, from Gopalganj district in Bangladesh’s southwest, 127 kilometres from the capital Dhaka, has been making sculptures for over two decades. He is a voter in the Gopalganj-3 constituency, from where former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was elected for eight consecutive terms. Chandra has long supported Hasina’s Awami League. But this time, the situation is different. Following the mass student-led uprising on August 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina fled to India. On May 10, 2025, the interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, banned the political activities of the Awami League and all its affiliates, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, a domestic judicial body founded by Hasina in 2010, is currently prosecuting Awami League leaders for “genocide” and “crimes against humanity”, related to the 2024 movement. Ironically, the same tribunal sentenced Hasina to death for ordering a crackdown on the 2024 protesters. Previously, the tribunal had awarded death sentences to several Jamaat-i-Islami leaders for ‘war crimes’ during the 1971 war and supporting Pakistan, resulting in the execution of Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mujahid in 2015 and Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami in 2016. Once banned and vilified in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-i-Islami is now polling neck-and-neck with the country’s mainstream opposition. As the country prepares for its first election since the 2024 uprising, voters disillusioned with corruption are turning to an unexpected alternative… The current government has stated that the Awami League will not be able to resume political activities until the trial is completed. As a result, the Awami League will not participate in the upcoming February 12 elections, the first national polls since the mass uprising. Despite being banned, the Awami League is campaigning against the polls on social media. When asked if he would be voting this time, Chandra tells Eos, “Why wouldn’t I vote? I will vote and, this time, I will vote for the Jamaat. Everyone has had a chance. This time, Jamaat should be given a chance,” he continues. “Besides, none of them [Jamaat leaders] engage in corruption and extortion,” he claims. Like Chandra, many other voters are now also leaning towards the Jamaat-i-Islami, reflecting a broader electoral transformation sweeping Bangladesh. A SURGING POLITICAL FORCE A December survey by the US-based International Republican Institute (IRI) showed 30 percent of voters backing the party of the late former PM Khaleda Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP); 26 percent supporting the Jamaat-i-Islami; and six percent supporting the National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student activists involved in the August 2024 popular uprising. Another mid-January joint poll by Projection BD, IILD, Jagoron Foundation and NarratiV indicates a tighter race, with BNP at 34.7 percent, Jamaat close behind at 33.6 percent and NCP at 7.1 percent. It’s a remarkable turnaround for both the leading parties, whose leaders had been incarcerated and executed and particularly for the Jamaat, which was banned under the Sheikh Hasina regime. Analysts say the Jamaat is competing closely with the BNP due to growing public dissatisfaction with corruption and extortion at the grassroots level, following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Jamaat has sought to capitalise on this sentiment by presenting itself as a disciplined alternative. Its initiatives, including digital tools to track extortion complaints and monitor government spending, have drawn widespread attention. The party’s rising popularity among young voters is also evident. According to Election Commission data from November 2025, Bangladesh has around 127.7 million registered voters, including roughly 45 million aged 18 to 35. In recent student union elections at several universities, including Dhaka University, the Jamaat’s student wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir, won decisively across contested positions, while the BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal failed to secure any significant posts.

Dr Rahman’s thoughts are echoed by one of his party candidates, lawyer Mohammad Shishir Monir. “I alone am capable of running 10 ministries,” he tells Eos. “We have dozens more in our party like me, who are capable of running the country.” However, Dhaka University professor and political analyst Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan says that, while Jamaat had some experience in the BNP government from 2001 to 2006, they lack the experience of administration and running the government. Dilara Chowdhury, a former professor and political analyst at Jahangirnagar University, points out that capability and honesty matter more than experience when it comes to running the country. “Currently, Jamaat has more educated and qualified people in its ranks than other parties,” she adds. An analysis of candidates’ affidavits by Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo shows that, of the 224 candidates contesting under the JI’s scales symbol, 201 are highly educated, including 10 with PhD degrees. Among the 287 BNP candidates contesting under the rice sheaf symbol, 229 are highly educated, including eight PhDs. The analysis indicates that the percentage of highly educated and PhD-holding candidates among Jamaat’s ranks is slightly higher than that of the BNP. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM Jamaat-i-Islami chief Dr Rahman says the party’s goal is to establish a country based on insaaf [justice], where the majority are not ruled by a chosen few, public wealth is not plundered and no one remains above the law. “Is this not the basic tenet of a model Islamic society?,” he asks. “Is this not the demand of Gen Z, who overthrew a corrupt and fascist regime?” Dr Rahman emphasises that Bangladesh’s multicultural and multi-ethnic population would continue to enjoy equal rights as enshrined in the constitution. “We believe in the rule of law, transparency, accountability, democracy and shura [consultation],” he says. “These principles are already embedded in our constitution and we do not view them as contradictory to Islamic values. You may call it ‘Sharia’ or any other name.” Dr Rahman adds that any elements contradicting Islamic principles would be addressed through parliament, not by force. “Our opponents often use scare tactics, suggesting that ‘Sharia law’ would force women into strict dress codes or deny them education or careers,” he continues. “We have repeatedly clarified that no such measures will be enforced. Women will enjoy equity and fairness in all spheres of life,” Dr Rahman asserts. The party chief also addresses concerns over a Jamaat-led government’s adherence to national laws and UN human rights standards. “As a democratic party that has participated in every election since its inception, no one can deny that Jamaat-i-Islami is committed to the people’s mandate,” he says. Dr Rahman adds that the party sees democratic nations in the West and East as strategic partners and aims to build a stable, pluralistic society based on freedom of expression, rule of law, equity and justice. The Jamaat chief also points out that, despite attempts by the previous Awami League government to portray the Jamaat as militant, “they were never able to produce a single piece of evidence of Jamaat leaders or workers being involved in terrorism.” Bangladesh's Jamaat-i-Islami supporters shout slogans during a campaign rally in Mirpur on January 22, 2026 | AFP FROM PARIAH TO CONTENDER The Jamaat-i-Islami was founded in 1941 in Lahore, British India, by Islamist scholar Abul Ala Maududi. The party advocates Islam as the foundation for the state and society. During the 1971 war, JI opposed Bangladesh’s independence, and its leaders were accused of collaborating with the Pakistani army and committing war crimes. The party was banned after independence, but the ban was lifted following political changes in 1975, and it returned to politics in 1979. The Jamaat won 18 seats in the 1991 elections, three in 1996, 17 in 2001, and two in 2008 — a modest to poor showing in previous elections. A high court cancelled the party’s registration in 2013, while JI also boycotted the 2014 elections. In 2018, with the party still declared illegal, some of its candidates ran under BNP tickets while others contested as independents. The party remained ineligible for the 2024 election, with the ban only overturned after Hasina’s ouster. Dr Rahman, its chief, attributes the party’s growing current support to greater public exposure after the student-led July 2024 revolution and wider social media visibility, following decades of what he called “unfair” media portrayal. Dr Rahman thinks that the party’s suffering under the previous government, including the execution of its leaders and the imprisonment of its members, has earned it public sympathy. Unlike other parties, he claims, the Jamaat has avoided revenge or corruption. Instead, he says, the Jamaat cooperated with the interim government and the judiciary following Hasina’s ouster, demonstrating moral integrity that has won the party public support. Analysts say another key factor is public frustration with corruption and extortion involving BNP leaders and activists, while the Jamaat has relatively avoided such allegations. “People are fed up with BNP leaders and activists because of extortion,” says analyst Dilara Chowdhury. She adds that corruption and extortion lie at the root of most crises in Bangladesh and effective curbs could significantly reduce the country’s problems. Dr Khan of Dhaka University says that, with the marginalisation of the Awami League, the Jamaat has emerged as an alternative for some voters. “Public sympathy for the Jamaat has increased to some extent due to repression over the past 15 years,” he tells Eos. Like the Jamaat, the BNP is also campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. Speaking at a rally in Chittagong on January 25, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman said the party would crack down on corruption if elected. Analyst Dilara Chowdhury points out, however, that the public has greater trust in the Jamaat than the BNP on corruption. “During BNP’s time in power from 2001 to 2006, corruption was not reduced. That is why many people do not trust the BNP,” she adds. The Jamaat has also announced plans to launch a mobile app aimed at tackling extortion. At a recent election rally in Dhaka, Dr Rahman revealed that the app would allow individuals to anonymously file complaints against extortionists. By contrast, since August 5, 2024, numerous BNP leaders and activists have been implicated in cases relating to extortion and other allegations. Following media reports, the party expelled several thousand members. On September 18, 2025, BNP chairman Tarique Rahman said organisational action had been taken against more than 7,000 party members in response to various allegations. Analysts also point to internal conflict within BNP, which they say has not been evident within Jamaat. According to an October 2025 report by Dhaka-based Human Rights Support Society (HRSS), at least 85 people were killed and 5,017 were injured in internal BNP clashes between September 2024 and September 2025. Another factor behind the JI’s growing popularity is the party’s charitable activities, including welfare and social assistance programmes. Through disaster relief, financial support for low-income families, and educational and medical assistance, the party has expanded its engagement at the local level. In addition, institutions associated with the Jamaat, including banks, hospitals, coaching centres, schools and colleges, have helped create employment opportunities for party workers and supporters, while also providing education and healthcare services to the wider public. It is no surprise, then, that voters such as Gopalganj’s Ramesh Chandra are planning to stamp their vote on the scales symbol in the upcoming elections. But whether the Jamaat can translate polling numbers into actual seats, navigate coalition politics and govern a diverse nation of 170 million remains to be seen. What is certain is that the February 12 elections will reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape in ways unimaginable just 18 months ago — when Hasina still ruled and Jamaat was still fighting for political survival. For a party that opposed the country’s founding, the possibility of now leading it represents perhaps the most dramatic political reversal in Bangladesh’s history.
