      "summary_orig": "SGN Partners with Indonesian Embassy for ‘Scotnesia’ Games Ecosystem Exchange The Scottish Games Network is delighted to announce the Scotnesia Game Exchange 2025 , a special online event designed to build bridges between the Scottish and Indonesian games ecosystems. The event will take place this Thursday, 7th August 2025 , from 10:30 – 14:00 BST. This is a valuable and timely opportunity for Scottish developers, studios, and educators to connect with one of the world’s most exciting and rapidly growing emerging markets. With a population of over 280 million people, Indonesia represents a huge potential audience and a vibrant, creative development community. The Scotnesia event will feature panels covering topics including: Unlocking Growth: The Game Industry as a Catalyst for Creative Economies Co-op Mode: International Education Partnerships in Game Development As well as streamers from both Indonesia and Scotland, playing games created by local developers. From Scotland this includes Farewell North (Kyle Banks) and – fingers crossed – Observation by our friends at Screen Burn Interactive. The Scotnesia event, hosted by the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in London, will feature speakers from both countries, including: Nick Poole OBE , CEO, Ukie Cipto Adiguno , President, Indonesian Game Association (AGI) Risman Adnan , Telkomsel Brian Baglow , Scottish Games Network Ryan Locke , Abertay University Steven Drost , Techscaler Joelle Nieuwenhuis , Abertay University, ScotCreate The exchange aims to foster collaboration, share insights, and explore new opportunities for partnership between the two nations. The timing of this event is particularly significant. The Indonesian government recently enacted Presidential Order No. 19 , a national strategy designed to accelerate the growth and support of the country’s domestic games industry. This forward-thinking policy has clear parallels with the ongoing work to create a Games Action Plan for Scotland , demonstrating a shared global understanding of the need for strategic government support to unlock the sector’s immense potential. This is a fantastic, last-minute opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the Indonesian market and make new connections with its key players. We strongly encourage everyone across the Scottish games ecosystem to join in.

      "summary_orig": "Please read the following announcement before posting or commenting. Violations of these rules may result in a permanent ban. Changes to Rule 2: Rule 2 has been changed to include the use of AI. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of AI in writing comments and posts or generating images. This also includes presenting AI theories or arguments, even if you explicitly state they are generated by AI. AI-generated content regarding aviation is frequently wrong and is incredibly low effort. The use of AI may result in a ban. Introduction of Rule 10: Even though we have been restricting NSFW content and gore before this, we have added it as an official rule and will be strongly enforcing it from now on. Rule 10 bans any gore being posted to this subreddit , even if it is a link to an outside source. This includes as a post or a comment. Violations of this will result in a permanent ban from r/aviation . In addition to this, we are also limiting NSFW content that is not explicitly gore. This content will be decided on a case by case basis. Content involving incidents like the one that was seen at Milan Bergamo Airport will always be marked as NSFW, and we will provide details in pinned comments and the flair to elaborate on how NSFW the content is, so that everyone can make their own choice on what they want to see. Geopolitics: Please remember to keep discussion in this subreddit focused on aviation. While geopolitics will frequently be a part of discussion, please remain respectful and avoid getting in arguments about this. Do not bring geopolitics into posts where they don’t belong. Air India Related Content Before posting Air India related content, please do the following. Search through the 4 megathreads below to see if your content has already been discussed; Megathread 1 (day of crash) Megathread 2 (2 days after crash) Megathread 3 (week after crash) Preliminary Report Megathread - Search this subreddit to see if it has already been posted. - Check if there are any active megathreads about the Air India crash, and if so, post there instead. These will be found pinned on the subreddit homepage. - Check if the content you are posting is up to date, original, and adds to the discussion. - If you are posting news, check if it is from a reputable source. Do not post speculation from news sources. Thank you for your understanding. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out through modmail.
