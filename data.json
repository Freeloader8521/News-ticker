      "summary_orig": "LAHORE/ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR/QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lahore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections. The PTI — a part of the TTAP — had announced a strike today to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024 general elections , which it alleges were marred by rigging . The party also said it will observe a day of mourning following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives . A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar , while a complete shutdown strike was reported in Quetta . In Lahore , all major markets remained closed, primarily due to Sunday and the ongoing Basant festival . In the evening, the TTAP could not hold a torch-bearing rally outside Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque as planned, claiming road closures and the arrest of over two dozen workers. Despite the alleged arrests of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmed, as well as TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site. Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown against the party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located. However, police sources did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker. Speaking to the media, Abbas criticised the Punjab government for “supporting Basant and dance parties” in the wake of the Islamabad imambargah attack . Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had cancelled her Basant-related activities following the incident. “The law enforcement agencies failed badly to provide security to the masses, and that is why such a huge number of people lost their lives,” Abbas added. Meanwhile, Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.” He asserted that the movement will soon gain further momentum and stated that the whole nation was worried about PTI founder Imran Khan’s health. In his remarks, Ahmed termed Pakistan’s possible participation in the upcoming meeting of the United States-led Board of Peace as “unfortunate”. Yousafzai claimed that the shutter-down strike was successful in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and interior Sindh. “However, it was partially successful in Punjab, Karachi and Hyderabad,” he acknowledged. Earlier in the day, the TTAP and PTI shared purported visuals of shops shut in various cities, including KP’s Peshawar , Abbottabad , Balakot , Haripur , Bajaur , Upper Chitral and Lakki Marwat ; Sindh’s Hyderabad , Mirpurkhas , Umerkot , Badin and Nawabshah ; Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin , Mianwali , Muzaffargarh ; and Balochistan’s Quetta , Chaman , Zhob , and Kuchlak . It also posted videos showing PTI workers and supporters gathered in KP’s Kohat , as well as Balochistan’s Nasirabad , Qila Saifullah , Chaman and Pishin . KP In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A Dawn correspondent reported a partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. He expressed his gratitude to “all traders associations and transport associations of Haripur for their cooperation in showing solidarity” with TTAP’s call. PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders. PTI’s chapter arranged a gathering at Chowk Yadgar in the afternoon. Seating arrangement and panaflex boards could be seen at the venue prior to the event, with PTI banners hanging in front of closed shops. PTI KP Deputy Information Secretary Ikram Khatana had said party workers would gather at Hashtnagri Chowk around 12pm and later march through Rampura Bazaar to reach Chowk Yadgar. All the district chapters across the province were to arrange events, according to Khatana. In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests. PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under the MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found. Sindh All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. The PTI’s Karachi chapter also claimed that markets in Safoora Town , North Nazimabad , Landhi , Shah Faisal Colony , Model Town and Malir were shut by traders to record their protest silently. In another post, Sheikh contended, “This strike is not just a strike, it’s a referendum! Today’s nationwide strike has set a new precedent. “Historically, strikes in this province were enforced with sticks, threats, roadblocks, burning tyres, even bullets and arson.” He claimed, “This may be the first strike in Pakistan’s history where workers were not on the streets — yet the public itself shut everything down. That is not a strike; that is a referendum.” Punjab In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”. However, a Dawn correspondent in Lahore reported that markets exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with routine traffic movement observed. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival , which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level. Party leaders in the province also criticised police raids and arrests of workers on Saturday, alleging harassment of families during search operations. Islamabad, Rawalpindi Meanwhile, most of the markets in the federal capital remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Fawad Khan, a PTI supporter who was selling garments, said that he and other traders cannot afford to close their shops. “We are already hand-to-mouth, and I cannot starve my family. I am a follower of Imran Khan and even voted for his candidate, but I cannot afford to close the stall,” he said. People shop at the H-9 Sunday bazaar in Islamabad on Feb 8, 2026. — Ikram Junaidi Muhammad Faiq, a resident who had come for shopping, said that although they have sympathy for PTI, it was not possible for him to remain limited to his house on a Sunday. “I get only one day in a week to purchase grocery and I must do it,” he said. However, resident Muhammad Danish said that all the political parties were the same and they never cared about the masses. “When PTI was in power, they did not care about the masses and Imran Khan has been facing charges that he sold the [state] gifts. He used to give examples of different premiers that they come to office on bicycles but he himself travelled on a helicopter to go to office,” he said. “No one, including the establishment, cares about Pakistan; otherwise, we would not be suffering and facing such a situation,” he lamented. PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal had said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities. A local district administration official confirmed that the metro bus service that runs between the twin cities was suspended. The electric bus service operated by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was also suspended. However, traffic on the capital’s roads was reported to be the same as usual. Balochistan A complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in the provincial capital Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin in Quetta, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic. Mobile internet services have been suspended again , a Dawn correspondent reported. Workers of the PTI and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — which is headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — staged demonstrations in some areas of the city. Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. Police were reported to have used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and removed the barricades and the burning tyres to open the road for traffic. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. A small demonstration also took place near Airport Road, but police dispersed the participants and cleared the route for traffic. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. Protesters attempted to block inter-provincial roads, but police dispersed them, reportedly resorting to baton charges in Qila Saifullah. In Chaman, political workers pelted stones at the police, injuring one constable who was taken to a hospital. In an exchange on X, Balochistan government official Shahid Rind said in a reply to Achakzai that the Quetta Airport road usually displayed similar scenes as today on “a Sunday in winters”. In his post, Achakzai had shared a picture showing a deserted road. In a post, the TTAP said its workers had “blocked all roads” in Balochistan’s Loralai and Harnai . Tyres were also burned to block the road near Duki’s Eidgah Chowk, it said . PTI hails public ‘response’ In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. “It is a day of mourning over the stolen vote and terrorism in Balochistan and Islamabad,” he added. Recalling the Feb 8, 2024 elections, Raja termed it a “historic moment of the Pakistani nation’s democratic expression”. He highlighted that the people voted for PTI in support of its founder, Imran Khan despite “months-long oppression and snatching the electoral symbol”. He further said, “On that dark evening, the wolves who looted the votes of those young people and of the entire nation across the country, they negated the very existence of millions of human beings.” Meanwhile, KP CM Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for what he called a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike. In a social media post on X, he wrote: “I thank all Pakistanis for once again sending a clear message today to those who robbed them of their mandate that we stood with Imran Khan, we are standing with him today, and we will continue to stand with him. “Across Pakistan, people participated wholeheartedly in the shutter-down and wheel-jam strike, which is both encouraging and also fearsome for our opponents,” he claimed. “Today, Pakistanis once again rejected the imposed group and those who brought them to power,” the KP CM said. Furthermore, he said that “each small or big event holds great importance” in the opposition’s movement for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, and for the restoration of an independent judiciary. “We must neither abuse nor resort to bullets. We must continue our peaceful struggle within the framework of the Constitution and the law, so that no one gets an excuse to open fire,” CM Afridi said. He reiterated the PTI’s allegation that its supporters were fired upon during the Nov 26, 2024 protest in Islamabad. “Yet even today, Pakistanis are fearless and are not stepping back from any sacrifice,” the chief minister said, hailing the supporters’ courage. On the other hand, CM Maryam said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.” Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the public had “rejected the politics of incitement and division”, quipping that the “wheel-jam [strike] itself was jammed”. “The public is tired of protest politics and the PTI’s call was badly dismissed. There is hustle and bustle despite a Sunday,” he said on X. Minister for States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam also asserted that the public rejected the TTAP’s call for a wheel-jammed and shutter-down strike. “The people of KP have realised how long they can keep believing the false narrative that has been pushed for the last 13 years,” he said in a statement. Muqam said the people of KP wanted progress, peace and development. He claimed this was the first time he had seen a chief minister calling for businesses to be shut down. On Saturday, PTI leader Asad Qaiser had told Dawn the party had neither postponed nor cancelled its protest programme in the wake of the Islamabad attack. “The day will be observed as a National Day of Mourning and, at the same time, protests will be held across the country against rigging in the general election,” he said. Qaiser said the party would hold protests and a shutter-down strike “with the masses” against the alleged electoral manipulation. Additional input from Irfan Raza, Imtiaz Ali",

He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located. However, police sources did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker. Speaking to the media, Abbas criticised the Punjab government for “supporting Basant and dance parties” in the wake of the Islamabad imambargah attack . Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had cancelled her Basant-related activities following the incident. “The law enforcement agencies failed badly to provide security to the masses, and that is why such a huge number of people lost their lives,” Abbas added. Meanwhile, Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.” He asserted that the movement will soon gain further momentum and stated that the whole nation was worried about PTI founder Imran Khan’s health. In his remarks, Ahmed termed Pakistan’s possible participation in the upcoming meeting of the United States-led Board of Peace as “unfortunate”. Yousafzai claimed that the shutter-down strike was successful in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and interior Sindh. “However, it was partially successful in Punjab, Karachi and Hyderabad,” he acknowledged. Earlier in the day, the TTAP and PTI shared purported visuals of shops shut in various cities, including KP’s Peshawar , Abbottabad , Balakot , Haripur , Bajaur , Upper Chitral and Lakki Marwat ; Sindh’s Hyderabad , Mirpurkhas , Umerkot , Badin and Nawabshah ; Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin , Mianwali , Muzaffargarh ; and Balochistan’s Quetta , Chaman , Zhob , and Kuchlak . It also posted videos showing PTI workers and supporters gathered in KP’s Kohat , as well as Balochistan’s Nasirabad , Qila Saifullah , Chaman and Pishin . KP In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A Dawn correspondent reported a partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. He expressed his gratitude to “all traders associations and transport associations of Haripur for their cooperation in showing solidarity” with TTAP’s call. PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders. PTI’s chapter arranged a gathering at Chowk Yadgar in the afternoon. Seating arrangement and panaflex boards could be seen at the venue prior to the event, with PTI banners hanging in front of closed shops. PTI KP Deputy Information Secretary Ikram Khatana had said party workers would gather at Hashtnagri Chowk around 12pm and later march through Rampura Bazaar to reach Chowk Yadgar. All the district chapters across the province were to arrange events, according to Khatana. In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests. PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under the MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found. Sindh All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. The PTI’s Karachi chapter also claimed that markets in Safoora Town , North Nazimabad , Landhi , Shah Faisal Colony , Model Town and Malir were shut by traders to record their protest silently. In another post, Sheikh contended, “This strike is not just a strike, it’s a referendum! Today’s nationwide strike has set a new precedent. “Historically, strikes in this province were enforced with sticks, threats, roadblocks, burning tyres, even bullets and arson.” He claimed, “This may be the first strike in Pakistan’s history where workers were not on the streets — yet the public itself shut everything down. That is not a strike; that is a referendum.” Punjab In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”. However, a Dawn correspondent in Lahore reported that markets exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with routine traffic movement observed. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival , which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level. Party leaders in the province also criticised police raids and arrests of workers on Saturday, alleging harassment of families during search operations. Islamabad, Rawalpindi Meanwhile, most of the markets in the federal capital remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Fawad Khan, a PTI supporter who was selling garments, said that he and other traders cannot afford to close their shops. “We are already hand-to-mouth, and I cannot starve my family. I am a follower of Imran Khan and even voted for his candidate, but I cannot afford to close the stall,” he said. People shop at the H-9 Sunday bazaar in Islamabad on Feb 8, 2026. — Ikram Junaidi Muhammad Faiq, a resident who had come for shopping, said that although they have sympathy for PTI, it was not possible for him to remain limited to his house on a Sunday. “I get only one day in a week to purchase grocery and I must do it,” he said. However, resident Muhammad Danish said that all the political parties were the same and they never cared about the masses. “When PTI was in power, they did not care about the masses and Imran Khan has been facing charges that he sold the [state] gifts. He used to give examples of different premiers that they come to office on bicycles but he himself travelled on a helicopter to go to office,” he said. “No one, including the establishment, cares about Pakistan; otherwise, we would not be suffering and facing such a situation,” he lamented. PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal had said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities. A local district administration official confirmed that the metro bus service that runs between the twin cities was suspended. The electric bus service operated by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was also suspended. However, traffic on the capital’s roads was reported to be the same as usual. Balochistan A complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in the provincial capital Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin in Quetta, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic. Mobile internet services have been suspended again , a Dawn correspondent reported. Workers of the PTI and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — which is headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — staged demonstrations in some areas of the city. Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. Police were reported to have used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and removed the barricades and the burning tyres to open the road for traffic. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. A small demonstration also took place near Airport Road, but police dispersed the participants and cleared the route for traffic. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. Protesters attempted to block inter-provincial roads, but police dispersed them, reportedly resorting to baton charges in Qila Saifullah. In Chaman, political workers pelted stones at the police, injuring one constable who was taken to a hospital. In an exchange on X, Balochistan government official Shahid Rind said in a reply to Achakzai that the Quetta Airport road usually displayed similar scenes as today on “a Sunday in winters”. In his post, Achakzai had shared a picture showing a deserted road. In a post, the TTAP said its workers had “blocked all roads” in Balochistan’s Loralai and Harnai . Tyres were also burned to block the road near Duki’s Eidgah Chowk, it said . PTI hails public ‘response’ In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. “It is a day of mourning over the stolen vote and terrorism in Balochistan and Islamabad,” he added. Recalling the Feb 8, 2024 elections, Raja termed it a “historic moment of the Pakistani nation’s democratic expression”. He highlighted that the people voted for PTI in support of its founder, Imran Khan despite “months-long oppression and snatching the electoral symbol”. He further said, “On that dark evening, the wolves who looted the votes of those young people and of the entire nation across the country, they negated the very existence of millions of human beings.” Meanwhile, KP CM Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for what he called a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike. In a social media post on X, he wrote: “I thank all Pakistanis for once again sending a clear message today to those who robbed them of their mandate that we stood with Imran Khan, we are standing with him today, and we will continue to stand with him. “Across Pakistan, people participated wholeheartedly in the shutter-down and wheel-jam strike, which is both encouraging and also fearsome for our opponents,” he claimed. “Today, Pakistanis once again rejected the imposed group and those who brought them to power,” the KP CM said. Furthermore, he said that “each small or big event holds great importance” in the opposition’s movement for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, and for the restoration of an independent judiciary. “We must neither abuse nor resort to bullets. We must continue our peaceful struggle within the framework of the Constitution and the law, so that no one gets an excuse to open fire,” CM Afridi said. He reiterated the PTI’s allegation that its supporters were fired upon during the Nov 26, 2024 protest in Islamabad. “Yet even today, Pakistanis are fearless and are not stepping back from any sacrifice,” the chief minister said, hailing the supporters’ courage. On the other hand, CM Maryam said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.” Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the public had “rejected the politics of incitement and division”, quipping that the “wheel-jam [strike] itself was jammed”. “The public is tired of protest politics and the PTI’s call was badly dismissed. There is hustle and bustle despite a Sunday,” he said on X. Minister for States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam also asserted that the public rejected the TTAP’s call for a wheel-jammed and shutter-down strike. “The people of KP have realised how long they can keep believing the false narrative that has been pushed for the last 13 years,” he said in a statement. Muqam said the people of KP wanted progress, peace and development. He claimed this was the first time he had seen a chief minister calling for businesses to be shut down. On Saturday, PTI leader Asad Qaiser had told Dawn the party had neither postponed nor cancelled its protest programme in the wake of the Islamabad attack. “The day will be observed as a National Day of Mourning and, at the same time, protests will be held across the country against rigging in the general election,” he said. Qaiser said the party would hold protests and a shutter-down strike “with the masses” against the alleged electoral manipulation. Additional input from Irfan Raza, Imtiaz Ali",

      "summary": "LAHORE/ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR/QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lahore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections. The PTI — a part of the TTAP — had announced a strike today to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024 general elections , which it alleges were marred by rigging .

      "summary_orig": "• PM aide’s contention that ‘innocents may get caught up’ in the wake of action following terror attacks prompts heckling, walkout • Dr Malik, Akhtar Mengal stress need for political, not military-based solutions LAHORE: At a charged discussion about the situation in Balochistan, PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah ignited controversy when he implied that innocent civilians were bound to get caught up in the fallout of attacks such as the ones witnessed across the province on Jan 31. The PM’s aide was speaking during a session, titled ‘Is There a Political Will to Solve the Crisis in Balochistan’, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday. The minister was part of a distinguished panel, which also incl­uded BNP-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal and National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, and was moderated by Mujahid Barelvi. PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday. The controversy reared its head when Mr Sanaullah was responding to points raised by the other speaker regarding the treatment meted out to the people from Balochistan. Referring to demands such as the abolition of checkpoints from across the province, he said that this could not happen unless terrorism and violence were rooted out. “If incidents like Jan 31 happen, then security forces will take act­ion, and there is a possibility that some of the people taken into custody could be innocent,” he said. This prompted a reaction from the audience, and some — like rights activist Sheema Kermani — got up from her seat and began to heckle the minister. He responded by chiding the hecklers, saying that their refusal to listen to him had ‘exposed them’. Ms Kermani then walked out of the venue, with many people following suit. Speaking to Dawn outside the hall, she said: “Asma Jahangir must be turning in her grave”. “Asma’s name is a symbol for people’s rights, for resistance, defiance and justice. If in this conference, you give a platform to such people who justify state violence, then we will not sit and hear it… If [Asma] had been here, she herself would have walked out and wouldn’t have let such persons speak.” ‘Political people’ Earlier, in his remarks, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch termed insurgency and enforced disappearances as the two major issues facing the province, which did not seem to have a solution. “Whenever I go to my area, four or five people come [up to me] daily, complaining about a missing person.” The state and political leadership should find a solution to these issues, he demanded. “If you deal with Balochistan as a security issue, then conditions would get worse by the day. If you involve political people and parties, then the situation may improve,” he suggested. “For parties which have roots among the masses, in Balochistan as well as [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa, space is shrinking on a daily basis,” he regretted. He also regretted how those who got the votes from the people were not allowed to enter parliament, but others were sent there ‘symbolically’. Dr Baloch, who was also part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, recalled that they had agreed on a number of points, including an end to enforced disappearances. He called for political reforms and the handover of resources to the province, and stressed the need to protect the 1972 Constitution, the 18th Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award. ‘Military solution to a political issue’ At the outset, BNP-M leader Akhtar Mengal posited that while the Balochistan issue was a political one, successive rulers had tried to solve it through military means, and warned that continued reliance on the coercive approach could lead to further tensions. Going into history, he recalled the original arrangement between the Khan of Kalat and the Quaid-i-Azam, where it was agreed that most administrative powers would remain with Balochistan. However, he regretted that this and subsequent pacts were not implemented. He also referred to past periods of conflict, including operations under different governments, the killing of Nawaz Akbar Bugti and the issue of enforced disappearances, which he said had deeply affected many families, including his own. He also criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined, while expressing concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties. He also referred to jailed human rights lawyers and activists, Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying that they had been jailed for 17 years over a mere tweet, while those who had harmed the country and looted had not spent a single day behind bars, or were accorded A or B class prison facilities. Sanaullah’s response Responding to these grievances, Mr Sanaullah said nothing could be done about the past, as it could not be changed. “Right now Balochistan had two crises, one is being represented by Akhtar Mengal and Dr Malik, and the other side being Bashir Zaib and his accomplices,” he said, referring to one of the leaders of the banned BLA. “In my view, both these crises have different solutions and different demands. We are making a mistake by taking them as one.” He also maintained that enforced disappearances and violence in Balochistan started simultaneously, calling it a ‘chicken and egg story’, adding that they would also end together, just as they had started.

The PM’s aide was speaking during a session, titled ‘Is There a Political Will to Solve the Crisis in Balochistan’, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday. The minister was part of a distinguished panel, which also incl­uded BNP-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal and National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, and was moderated by Mujahid Barelvi. PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday. The controversy reared its head when Mr Sanaullah was responding to points raised by the other speaker regarding the treatment meted out to the people from Balochistan. Referring to demands such as the abolition of checkpoints from across the province, he said that this could not happen unless terrorism and violence were rooted out. “If incidents like Jan 31 happen, then security forces will take act­ion, and there is a possibility that some of the people taken into custody could be innocent,” he said. This prompted a reaction from the audience, and some — like rights activist Sheema Kermani — got up from her seat and began to heckle the minister. He responded by chiding the hecklers, saying that their refusal to listen to him had ‘exposed them’. Ms Kermani then walked out of the venue, with many people following suit. Speaking to Dawn outside the hall, she said: “Asma Jahangir must be turning in her grave”. “Asma’s name is a symbol for people’s rights, for resistance, defiance and justice. If in this conference, you give a platform to such people who justify state violence, then we will not sit and hear it… If [Asma] had been here, she herself would have walked out and wouldn’t have let such persons speak.” ‘Political people’ Earlier, in his remarks, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch termed insurgency and enforced disappearances as the two major issues facing the province, which did not seem to have a solution. “Whenever I go to my area, four or five people come [up to me] daily, complaining about a missing person.” The state and political leadership should find a solution to these issues, he demanded. “If you deal with Balochistan as a security issue, then conditions would get worse by the day. If you involve political people and parties, then the situation may improve,” he suggested. “For parties which have roots among the masses, in Balochistan as well as [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa, space is shrinking on a daily basis,” he regretted. He also regretted how those who got the votes from the people were not allowed to enter parliament, but others were sent there ‘symbolically’. Dr Baloch, who was also part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, recalled that they had agreed on a number of points, including an end to enforced disappearances. He called for political reforms and the handover of resources to the province, and stressed the need to protect the 1972 Constitution, the 18th Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award. ‘Military solution to a political issue’ At the outset, BNP-M leader Akhtar Mengal posited that while the Balochistan issue was a political one, successive rulers had tried to solve it through military means, and warned that continued reliance on the coercive approach could lead to further tensions. Going into history, he recalled the original arrangement between the Khan of Kalat and the Quaid-i-Azam, where it was agreed that most administrative powers would remain with Balochistan. However, he regretted that this and subsequent pacts were not implemented. He also referred to past periods of conflict, including operations under different governments, the killing of Nawaz Akbar Bugti and the issue of enforced disappearances, which he said had deeply affected many families, including his own. He also criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined, while expressing concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties. He also referred to jailed human rights lawyers and activists, Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying that they had been jailed for 17 years over a mere tweet, while those who had harmed the country and looted had not spent a single day behind bars, or were accorded A or B class prison facilities. Sanaullah’s response Responding to these grievances, Mr Sanaullah said nothing could be done about the past, as it could not be changed. “Right now Balochistan had two crises, one is being represented by Akhtar Mengal and Dr Malik, and the other side being Bashir Zaib and his accomplices,” he said, referring to one of the leaders of the banned BLA. “In my view, both these crises have different solutions and different demands. We are making a mistake by taking them as one.” He also maintained that enforced disappearances and violence in Balochistan started simultaneously, calling it a ‘chicken and egg story’, adding that they would also end together, just as they had started.

      "summary_orig": "A Hong Kong court sentenced pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison on Monday for national security crimes, a punishment rights groups condemned as “effectively a death sentence” and a symbol of the city’s shrivelling press freedoms. The 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper was found guilty in December on two counts of foreign collusion under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing, as well as one count of seditious publication. His sentence is by far the harshest handed out under the national security law, surpassing the previous record of 10 years given to legal scholar Benny Tai in 2024. A summary document from the judges said they had settled on 20 years’ imprisonment “after considering the serious and grave criminal conduct of Lai”. Two of those years will overlap with Lai’s existing prison term, meaning that he will serve an additional 18 years, the judges wrote. Lai, who has been behind bars since 2020, sat impassively in the dock as his sentence was read out, an AFP journalist in the court saw. As he was led away, he waved solemnly to people in the public gallery, including his wife Teresa, former Hong Kong bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen, and former Apple Daily reporters. His defence lawyer Robert Pang, declined to comment on whether Lai would lodge an appeal, which can be done in the next 28 days. Asked if the sentence was in line with expectations, Pang told AFP : “In these times I don’t know what to expect.” Teresa Lai was grim-faced during the hearing and made no comment as she left the court, but the family condemned the sentence in a statement. “Sentencing my father to this draconian prison sentence is devastating for our family and life-threatening for my father,” Lai’s son Sebastien said. His daughter Claire called it “a heartbreakingly cruel sentence” given his declining health in prison, and if carried out, “he will die a martyr behind bars”. ‘Effectively a death sentence’ Rights groups also said Lai’s punishment amounted to a grave injustice. “The harsh 20-year sentence against 78-year-old Jimmy Lai is effectively a death sentence. A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. Amnesty International called the case “another grim milestone in Hong Kong’s transformation from a city governed by the rule of law to one ruled by fear”. Jodie Ginsberg, the CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said “today’s egregious decision is the final nail in the coffin for freedom of the press in Hong Kong”. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously said he had raised the issue of Lai, a British citizen, during his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing last month, while US President Donald Trump has also called for his release. Beijing has dismissed critics as smearing Hong Kong’s judicial system, while Hong Kong authorities say Lai’s case “has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press”. Staunch supporters Dozens of former Apple Daily employees and others braved the cold to queue overnight outside the West Kowloon court for a spot in court, while journalists gathered outside the building’s entrance. The mood was tense as police deployed dozens of officers, an armoured car and a bomb disposal van to the area. “I think this is equivalent to sentencing Lai to life imprisonment,” Lam Ying-kit, a former history teacher in his 50s, told AFP . Lai’s supporters, children, lawyers and rights groups have all raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison. Lai was kept in solitary confinement at his own request to avoid harassment, according to prosecutors, while authorities maintain he receives “adequate” care. Long a thorn in Beijing’s side, Lai was prosecuted under the national security law imposed by China on Hong Kong in 2020, following huge pro-democracy protests in the finance hub. Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 following police raids. Eight other defendants, including six Apple Daily executives, are due to be sentenced alongside Lai on Monday, all of whom pleaded guilty. As of the start of the month, Hong Kong had arrested a total of 386 people for various national security crimes, with 176 of them being convicted.",

And these reactions, when they do become apparent, can be stunning. Take, for example, the sight of F-16 jets patrolling the skies above Mogadishu — not on a bombing run as may have been the case in the past, but as part of a ‘gift’ to Somalia from their Turkish allies. This means that Somalia, which has not had an air force since 1991, is now one of only three African countries to field F-16s. Speaking of opposites, the last week also saw Saudi Arabia and Turkiye sign a far-reaching accord encompassing everything from economic ties to strategic cooperation, which is quite something considering the low ebb that relations sank to after the blockade of Qatar in 2017 and the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Now these erstwhile rivals are on the proverbial same page when it comes to Yemen, Sudan and — crucially — Somalia. Why is Somalia important? Situated on the Horn of Africa on the Red Sea coast, Somalia stands at the crossroads of critical maritime trade routes that connect Europa, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. This means that whoever has a foothold in Somalia can effectively choke trade and interdict vessels, much as the Houthis managed to do in the recent past. What added urgency to Turkish and Saudi efforts to shore up Somalia militarily and diplomatically was in large part the Israeli recognition of Somaliland last year. Somaliland, a breakaway province of Somalia, has effectively been independent since 1991, and has since cooperated deeply with the UAE to develop its port of Berbera, which was intended as yet another node in the UAE’s network of ports and bases, all located at strategic choke points. The possibility of an Israeli deployment in Somaliland raises alarms in Saudi Arabia, which rightly fears an encirclement of sorts. Riyadh is now willing to act against any such possibility, as evidenced by the rout of the Southern Transitional Council in Yemen last year, a group that Riyadh claims is a UAE proxy. Had the STC succeeded in grabbing a large part of Yemen, Riyadh would be faced with the untenable scenario of a potentially hostile proxy in power on its terrestrial southern border and also across the Red Sea in Somaliland. Since then, Saudi-UAE ties have taken a serious downturn, with the latest signal of this being the withdrawal of several UAE defence firms from the Riyadh-based World Defence Show to be held this week. This realignment brings Riyadh closer to Ankara, overcoming decades of mistrust and confrontation. Turkiye’s involvement makes sense not only due to its old antipathy towards the UAE’s strategic designs — a feud that dates at least as far back as the Arab Spring — but also its increased wariness of and confrontation with Israel, which views Turkiye as one of the only regional powers capable of checking its ambitions. Whoever has a foothold in Somalia can effectively choke trade. With the backing of two powerful regional nations, Somalia then acted against the UAE by annulling all agreements with that country, bringing Somali-UAE ties to their lowest ebb ever. Nevertheless, Somaliland stands defiant, and while the UAE has not officially recognised them as an independent state, the president of Somaliland was prominently in attendance at the recent World Governments Summit in Dubai, an appearance that naturally drew condemnation from Mogadishu. Now, with both Riyadh and Ankara loudly condemning Somaliland and reaffirming Somalia’s territorial integrity, the outlines of a new regional order, and of rival camps, can clearly be seen. It is also worth noting that the Somali air chief and interior ministers were both in Pakistan recen­t­­ly, and while So­­m­ali commentators and analysts are hinting at the prospect of military co­­operation and def­ence deals with Pa­­kistan, nothing is official at the moment. But the ripples of this regional alignment are being felt as far as Libya and Sudan. In Libya, we can see clear efforts being made to wean off Gen Khalifa Haftar, the de facto ruler of large parts of Libya, from the UAE and while these efforts are largely being made by Turkiye, we should also note (again) that Khalifa Haftar was also recently in Pakistan. Then there’s Sudan, where the Sudanese army has scored some recent successes against the UAE-backed Rapid Support Force, and they have Turkish and growing Egyptian military support to thank for that. The lines have been drawn. The axes and alliances are broadly coalescing. And the reason all this is happening is because this is a reaction to unbridled Israeli aggression coupled with the UAE’s growing reach and influence. Moves and countermoves are in play and you shouldn’t be surprised if you hear of Ethiopian involvement soon. But that’s a topic for another day. The writer is a journalist.

While China dominates the global supply of these minerals, the US is trying to catch up by rushing to strike mineral resources deals with several countries and taking other initiatives. Over the decades, China built a near-monopoly in the extraction and processing capacity of rare earth minerals, which are used in electronics, electric cars, radars and military weapon systems. Last year, President Donald Trump saw how China pushed back against his tariffs by imposing curbs on exports of rare earth minerals. This threatened US industry and forced Washington to back down. He has since stepped up efforts to reduce dependence on China by seeking to develop alternate sources of supply and make new investments. His stated aim to seize Greenland is mostly driven by this. Trump has also announced the establishment of a strategic critical-minerals stockpile, named ‘Project Vault’ worth $12 billion, in an effort to reduce the risk to manufacturers from supply disruptions, while his administration tries to deal with China’s dominance in rare earths and other metals. Last week, Washington hosted a critical minerals ministerial to which delegations from 50 countries were invited with the aim of forming a preferential trade bloc and seeking collaboration to diversify supply chains. An insightful new book describes how China came to establish its ascendancy in the batteries sector by making strategic investments much earlier, while the US focused on oil and the technologies of the past. The Elements of Power by journalist Nicolas Niarchos is a fascinating tour de force of the development of the battery industry, evolution of the demand for lithium and cobalt, the scientific advances that were made and who profited from all of this. His story about the ‘age of batteries’ focuses on its innovative aspects, companies that spearheaded technological progress and the geopolitical implications. But it exposes its perils and moral dilemmas as well. For him, this is also a tragic saga “whose protagonists are some of the poorest people in the world” exploited by wealthy countries and predatory companies. The global competition for critical minerals and metals is set to intensify. The 20th century, Niarchos says, was powered by oil. But lithium-ion batteries make the modern world possible, being the “foot soldiers of the digital revolution”. They make powerful tech available for every aspect of life, powering cellphones, laptops, medical devices, electric vehicles, drones and jet engines among other things. The metals and materials that go into these batteries come from countries across the world. He argues that understanding these batteries and how they are made are key to understanding how a new form of power is being created, “one that is measurable in dollars, strategic influence and volts”. He reminds the reader that 70 to 90 per cent of lithium-ion batteries are made in China. And “as with oil, battery power has become political power”. Indeed, the acquisition of critical minerals is driving geostrategic shifts and competition for resources not seen since the time of the Cold War. Several chapters delve into the colonial history of exploitation and scramble for resources by powerful outsiders. Much of the book’s focus is on the Democratic Republic of Congo, which possesses around half of the world’s supply of metals. Faced with exploitation, conflict, corruption, intrigue and the miserable conditions in which miners work, its people live in poverty while others in far-off lands benefit and enrich themselves from the country’s mineral resources. This highlights a key theme of the book — how rich countries use these resources for their green energy transition (as they produce no emissions) to get away from reliance on fossil fuels and find an answer to climate change. But it comes at the expense of environmental damage and abuses, including child labour, where these resources are mined. As the author puts it, at the bottom of the supply chain “people have toiled in squalid conditions, in poverty and human bondage to extract the minerals needed to make these batteries”. The chapters on how China achieved major milestones in the development of the battery industry are particularly insightful. They zero in on how Chinese companies such as BYD succeeded in producing devices to store power. The country’s production of electric vehicles surged by leaps and bounds. By 2024, it was able to produce a million cars in a single month. Describing Chinese investment activity in Africa, Niarchos highlights the surge in its investments by the early 2010s. This filled a void left by the US and Europe who myopically gave the continent the cold shoulder. Meanwhile in 2023, China’s CATL became the world’s largest producer of lithium-ion batteries. Niarchos notes that Washington, a late starter with modest investment, began to take serious interest after Trump’s return to power. He appointed his daughter Tiffany’s father-in-law, Massad Boulos, as senior adviser for Africa. Although his book doesn’t cover this, one of Trump’s major initiatives is Pax Silica. This is designed to build reliable supply chains for technologies needed for AI, especially silicon and critical minerals. While trying to boost domestic production aided by state intervention and capital, Trump has sought bilateral deals with many countries to gain access to resources. For Niarchos it is important to address the moral dilemma concerning the detrimental effects of the new ‘energy revolution’. There is no easy answer to this, but he argues that investing in environmentally responsible mining should be encouraged to meet climate goals. Above all, it is necessary to listen to the people from whose land minerals are acquired, to their needs, pollution concerns and aspirations for a better, healthier world. “Such people,” he writes, “are commonly erased thanks to big-stakes financial dealings and complex, often deadly geopolitical games in the cutthroat competition of resources.” He is, of course, right. But whether or not this message of his book reaches the corridors of power of big countries and is ever acted upon is an open question. What is certain, however, is that the global competition and battle for mineral resources is set to intensify. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.

Faced with exploitation, conflict, corruption, intrigue and the miserable conditions in which miners work, its people live in poverty while others in far-off lands benefit and enrich themselves from the country’s mineral resources. This highlights a key theme of the book — how rich countries use these resources for their green energy transition (as they produce no emissions) to get away from reliance on fossil fuels and find an answer to climate change. But it comes at the expense of environmental damage and abuses, including child labour, where these resources are mined. As the author puts it, at the bottom of the supply chain “people have toiled in squalid conditions, in poverty and human bondage to extract the minerals needed to make these batteries”. The chapters on how China achieved major milestones in the development of the battery industry are particularly insightful. They zero in on how Chinese companies such as BYD succeeded in producing devices to store power. The country’s production of electric vehicles surged by leaps and bounds. By 2024, it was able to produce a million cars in a single month. Describing Chinese investment activity in Africa, Niarchos highlights the surge in its investments by the early 2010s. This filled a void left by the US and Europe who myopically gave the continent the cold shoulder. Meanwhile in 2023, China’s CATL became the world’s largest producer of lithium-ion batteries. Niarchos notes that Washington, a late starter with modest investment, began to take serious interest after Trump’s return to power. He appointed his daughter Tiffany’s father-in-law, Massad Boulos, as senior adviser for Africa. Although his book doesn’t cover this, one of Trump’s major initiatives is Pax Silica. This is designed to build reliable supply chains for technologies needed for AI, especially silicon and critical minerals. While trying to boost domestic production aided by state intervention and capital, Trump has sought bilateral deals with many countries to gain access to resources. For Niarchos it is important to address the moral dilemma concerning the detrimental effects of the new ‘energy revolution’. There is no easy answer to this, but he argues that investing in environmentally responsible mining should be encouraged to meet climate goals. Above all, it is necessary to listen to the people from whose land minerals are acquired, to their needs, pollution concerns and aspirations for a better, healthier world. “Such people,” he writes, “are commonly erased thanks to big-stakes financial dealings and complex, often deadly geopolitical games in the cutthroat competition of resources.” He is, of course, right. But whether or not this message of his book reaches the corridors of power of big countries and is ever acted upon is an open question. What is certain, however, is that the global competition and battle for mineral resources is set to intensify. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.

      "summary": "RARE earth and critical minerals are the newest arena of competition between the big powers. While China dominates the global supply of these minerals, the US is trying to catch up by rushing to strike mineral resources deals with several countries and taking other initiatives. Over the decades, China built a near-monopoly in the extraction and processing capacity of rare earth minerals, which are used in electronics, electric cars, radars and military weapon systems. Last year, President Donald Trump saw how China pushed back against his tariffs by imposing curbs on exports of rare earth minerals. This threatened US industry and forced Washington to back down. He has since stepped up efforts to reduce dependence on China by seeking to develop alternate sources of supply and make new investments. His stated aim to seize Greenland is mostly driven by this. Trump has also announced the establishment of a strategic critical-minerals stockpile, named ‘Project Vault’ worth $12 billion, in an effort to reduce the risk to manufacturers from supply disruptions, while his administration tries to deal with China’s dominance in rare earths and other metals. Last week, Washington hosted a critical minerals ministerial to which delegations from 50 countries were invited with the aim of forming a preferential trade bloc and seeking collaboration to diversify supply chains. An insightful new book describes how China came to establish its ascendancy in the batteries sector by making strategic investments much earlier, while the US focused on oil and the technologies of the past. The Elements of Power by journalist Nicolas Niarchos is a fascinating tour de force of the development of the battery industry, evolution of the demand for lithium and cobalt, the scientific advances that were made and who profited from all of this. His story about the ‘age of batteries’ focuses on its innovative aspects, companies that spearheaded technological progress and the geopolitical implications. But it exposes its perils and moral dilemmas as well. For him, this is also a tragic saga “whose protagonists are some of the poorest people in the world” exploited by wealthy countries and predatory companies. The global competition for critical minerals and metals is set to intensify. The 20th century, Niarchos says, was powered by oil. But lithium-ion batteries make the modern world possible, being the “foot soldiers of the digital revolution”. They make powerful tech available for every aspect of life, powering cellphones, laptops, medical devices, electric vehicles, drones and jet engines among other things. The metals and materials that go into these batteries come from countries across the world. He argues that understanding these batteries and how they are made are key to understanding how a new form of power is being created, “one that is measurable in dollars, strategic influence and volts”. He reminds the reader that 70 to 90 per cent of lithium-ion batteries are made in China. And “as with oil, battery power has become political power”. Indeed, the acquisition of critical minerals is driving geostrategic shifts and competition for resources not seen since the time of the Cold War. Several chapters delve into the colonial history of exploitation and scramble for resources by powerful outsiders. Much of the book’s focus is on the Democratic Republic of Congo, which possesses around half of the world’s supply of metals.

      "summary_orig": "A white supremacist who shot and killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in 2019 launched an appeal Monday seeking to overturn his conviction. Brenton Tarrant, an Australian former gym instructor, admitted carrying out New Zealand’s deadliest modern-day mass shooting before being sentenced to life in jail in August 2020. Now, the convicted killer argues that his “torturous and inhumane” detention conditions during his trial made him incapable of making rational decisions when he pleaded guilty, according to a court synopsis of the case. Tarrant is being held in a specialist unit for prisoners of extreme risk at Auckland Prison, seldom interacting with inmates or other people. “I did not have the mind frame or mental health required to be making informed decisions at that time,” Tarrant told the court, according to the New Zealand Herald. Tarrant said his state of mind was such that he had considered trying to implicate President Donald Trump in the crime. Life without parole “What I said at the time is ‘perhaps I could go out and say there was a second shooter on the roof, perhaps I could say it was Donald J Trump’,” he said, according to national broadcaster RNZ. If the Court of Appeal in Wellington upholds Tarrant’s conviction, it would hold a separate hearing later in the year to consider an appeal against his sentence. His penalty of life imprisonment without parole was the stiffest in New Zealand history. Armed with an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons, Tarrant attacked worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019. He published an online manifesto before the attacks and then livestreamed the killings for 17 minutes. His victims were all Muslim and included children, women and the elderly. ‘Not prepared’ There are heavy restrictions on who can be in court during Monday’s appeal hearing, with only counsel, media and court officials allowed. Families and friends of those killed or wounded in the attacks have been invited to watch proceedings in Christchurch remotely by video with a one-hour delay. Members of the public are also able to watch the hearing by video link with a one-hour delay at a separate courtroom in Wellington. Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed by Tarrant inside the Linwood mosque, told Christchurch’s The Press newspaper she had thought “this is the end of it” when Tarrant was sentenced. “Little did you know that you are allowed to do this six years later. I was not prepared to do this,” she said. The hearing is being held before three Court of Appeal judges. In most Court of Appeal hearings the judges reserve their decision to be published at a later date, meaning a verdict is unlikely this week. After Tarrant’s livestream, Facebook said it removed 1.5 million videos that proliferated within the first 24 hours showing the harrowing viral footage. Then-prime minister Jacinda Ardern quickly moved to tighten gun laws in the aftermath and put pressure on social media giants to curb online extremism. In 2021, Tarrant’s former lawyer, Tony Ellis, said his client had believed “the simplest way out was to plead guilty”, arguing the plea was made under duress. The names of Tarrant’s current lawyers have been suppressed by the court.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The Washington Post said on Saturday its CEO and publisher Will Lewis was leaving effective immediately, just days after the storied newspaper owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made drastic job cuts that angered readers. Though newspapers across the United States have been facing brutal industry headwinds, Lewis’s management of the outlet was sharply criticised by subscribers and employees alike during his two-year tenure as he tried to reverse financial losses at the daily. Lewis, who is English, has been replaced by Jeff D’Onofrio, a former CEO of social media platform Tumblr who had joined the Post as chief financial officer last year, the paper announced. In an email to staff shared on social media by one of the newspaper’s reporters, Lewis said it was “the right time for me to step aside.” A statement from the Post said only that D’Onofrio was succeeding Lewis “effective immediately”. Hundreds of Post journalists — including most of its overseas, local and sports staff — were let go in the sweeping cuts announced on Wednesday. The Post did not disclose the number of jobs being eliminated, but The New York Times reported approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off. The paper’s entire Middle East roster was let go as was its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent as the war with Russia grinds on. Sports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports , was suspended, local media reported. Hundreds turned out Thursday at a protest in front of the paper’s headquarters in downtown Washington. Newspapers across the country have cratered under falling revenues and subscriptions as they compete for eyeballs with social media, and as internet revenue pales in comparison to what print advertising once commanded.

      "summary_orig": "• Opposition claims Modi surrendered to Trump over Epstein files • Growers fears the disastrous impact of the agreement; nationwide protests set for Feb 12 NEW DELHI: Indian farmers on Monday slammed a new US trade deal as “a surrender to multinational agricultural giants”, calling for the commerce minister’s resignation as Congress accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of capitulating to US President Donald Trump over the “Epstein files ” release. Congress leaders claimed an Indian minister, a businessman and individuals close to the prime minister were mentioned in the files, along with Modi. According to a report in The Hindu , the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) demanded Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s immediate resignation as soon as he explained the details of the bilateral pact. Leaders of the union representing apple and cotton growers said any relaxation on the import of cotton would be disastrous for the economies of Jammu and Kashmir, Him­­­­achal Pradesh, Mah­ar­ashtra and Gujarat. Talking to reporters at a press conference on Saturday, SKM leaders called the framework for the interim agreement on bilateral trade a “total surrender” to America’s agriculture sector. They cited the inclusion of dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits in the joint statement. The leaders warned that the animal feed market would be completely monopolised by US companies. SKM leaders urged farmers across the country to join protest demonstrations on Feb 12 and to support a general strike of workers as a “befitting reply to the anti-people Modi government”. The leaders said Goyal’s claim that the agriculture and dairy sectors were excluded from the agreement was incorrect. “Dairy products are part of the FTAs signed with the UK, New Zealand and European Union and the fresh revelations have undoubtedly proved the Commerce Minister is consciously propagating falsehood and betraying the farmers and the entire people,” the SKM statement said. “SKM considers the role of Commerce Minister as a traitor and demands his immediate resignation.” The organisation demanded that Prime Minister Modi desist from signing the India-US Free Trade Agreement or face “massive pan-India united mass struggles”. Farmers’ leaders highlighted tariff disparities, noting that US tariffs on Indian goods rose from zero in 2023-24 to 18pc, while Indian tariff rates on US agriculture products dropped from between 30pc and 150pc to zero. They said this would make Indian agriculture hang by the noose of US MNCs. The SKM also questioned Goyal’s position that the animal husbandry sector had requested imported feed. The group said poultry groups were the ones demanding feed based on maize and soybean to reduce minimum support prices for domestic crops. “We have heard that the animal feed in US may contain non-vegetarian items too. Why does the government want our cows to eat non-vegetarian food?” asked Rakesh Tikait, a prominent SKM leader. The statement also targeted the ruling party’s ideological parent organisation. “The RSS had been claiming no import of milk of animals fed with meat. That was a non-tariff barrier,” the statement said. “Now, the RSS has been made to eat its own claim by ‘Master’ Donald Trump and they have cowed down completely.” M.Y. Tarigami, leader of the Apple Farmers Federation of India and a Jammu and Kashmir lawmaker, said the trade deal would devastate regional economies. “We have been facing problems in apple cultivation due to lack of marketing facilities and climatic challenges,” Tarigami said. “Farmers in both the states are already in distress. This announcement will be a huge setback for apple and tree nut growers.” “In a state like Jammu and Kashmir, where there are no other economic avenues such as industry, the only source of income was cultivation of apples and dry fruits,” Tarigami added. “The Union government does not care about farmers here and is working for their masters in the United States.” Protesting against the government’s lack of transparency regarding the deal, the Congress party on Friday displayed a poster reading “Trap Deal” at the main entrance of the Parliament complex. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters that President Trump pressured Modi into signing the deal because of the Epstein files. “The truth is that over the past few days, Narendra Modi has been troubled because matters related to him have come up in the Epstein files. After that, Narendra Modi surrendered before Trump and struck a trade deal,” Kharge said. “He sacrificed the country’s farmers. Modi is making our people poor and making America’s farmers rich.” Published in Dawn, February 9th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Partial shutdown in Peshawar, complete shutter-down in Quetta • Markets in Lahore, Islamabad remain open • Roads blocked in Karachi ‘to deter protests’ • Torch rally outside Faisal Mosque scuttled due to ‘road closures, arrests’ • PTI leaders hail public response; Punjab CM claims ‘zero’ strike in Punjab LAHORE / ISLAMABAD / PESHAWAR / QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lah­ore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections. A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported from Quetta. The PTI, a part of the TTAP, had announced a strike for Sunday to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, which it alleges were marred by rigging. The party also said it will observe a day of mourning following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives. In the evening, the TTAP could not hold a torch-bearing rally outside Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque as planned, claiming road closures and the arrest of over two dozen workers. Despite the alleged arre­sts of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, former senator Mushtaq Ahmed, and other TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhu­nzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site. Mr Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.” Mr Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown on party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located. QUETTA: Supporters of Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan block a road to protest alleged rigging in the February 8, 2024 general elections.—PPI However, police did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker. Mixed response In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. PTI workers from across the city gathered at Hash­tnagri Bazaar from where they took out a protest. Upon reaching the historic Chowk Yadgar, the rally’s venue, the procession converted into a public gathering, which was addressed by the PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan and others. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. Meanwhile, daily life in Karachi and other parts of Sindh remained largely unaffected on Sunday. How­ever, police blocked many roads across the city, especially in the areas leading to the Karachi Press Club and the Election Commission of Pakistan, to thwart any protest by the opposition alliance. All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. In Punjab, markets in Lah­ore exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with rou­tine traffic movement obse­rved. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival, which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. Meanwhile, most markets in Islamabad and Rawalpindi remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Strike in Balochistan Meanwhile, a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic. Mobile internet services have been suspended again, a Dawn correspondent reported. Workers of the PTI and the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, staged demonstrations in some areas of the city. Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. PTI hails public ‘response’ In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike. PTI leader Asad Qaiser also congratulated the nation on the “successful” observance of Feb 8 as a “black day”. Talking to Dawn , he claimed that at a number of places, including Swabi, “powers that be forced people to open their shops and also threatened transporters that strict action will be taken if they do not bring their vehicles on the road”. On the other hand, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.” Imtiaz Ali and Imran Ayub in Karachi also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, February 9th, 2026",

Despite the alleged arre­sts of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, former senator Mushtaq Ahmed, and other TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhu­nzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site. Mr Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.” Mr Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown on party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located. QUETTA: Supporters of Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan block a road to protest alleged rigging in the February 8, 2024 general elections.—PPI However, police did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker. Mixed response In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. PTI workers from across the city gathered at Hash­tnagri Bazaar from where they took out a protest. Upon reaching the historic Chowk Yadgar, the rally’s venue, the procession converted into a public gathering, which was addressed by the PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan and others. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. Meanwhile, daily life in Karachi and other parts of Sindh remained largely unaffected on Sunday. How­ever, police blocked many roads across the city, especially in the areas leading to the Karachi Press Club and the Election Commission of Pakistan, to thwart any protest by the opposition alliance. All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. In Punjab, markets in Lah­ore exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with rou­tine traffic movement obse­rved. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival, which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. Meanwhile, most markets in Islamabad and Rawalpindi remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Strike in Balochistan Meanwhile, a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic. Mobile internet services have been suspended again, a Dawn correspondent reported. Workers of the PTI and the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, staged demonstrations in some areas of the city. Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. PTI hails public ‘response’ In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike. PTI leader Asad Qaiser also congratulated the nation on the “successful” observance of Feb 8 as a “black day”. Talking to Dawn , he claimed that at a number of places, including Swabi, “powers that be forced people to open their shops and also threatened transporters that strict action will be taken if they do not bring their vehicles on the road”. On the other hand, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.” Imtiaz Ali and Imran Ayub in Karachi also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, February 9th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket boards was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to boycott the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15. The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion. After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that. Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told Dawn that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan. They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.” The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source. They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.” The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.” Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings. Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport. Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said. The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter. Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting. Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials. The high-level visits come a day after the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup commenced. The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland. Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the ICC rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka. After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo. In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”. It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of. “The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated. A government source told Dawn at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh. “The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added. Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue. It was reported earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses. Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown . Pakistan, who edged out the Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate. Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.",

      "summary_en": "A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket boards was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to boycott the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15. The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion. After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that. Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told Dawn that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan. They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.” The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source. They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.” The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.” Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings. Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport. Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said. The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter. Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting. Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials. The high-level visits come a day after the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup commenced. The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland. Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the ICC rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka. After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo. In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”. It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of. “The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB.

Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmed told Dawn that “the militants attacked a police post  and an exchange of fire also took place, but the policemen, deployed at the facility, retaliated, forcing the militants to escape.” The CCPO added that the situation was “under control”. No casualties or injuries were reported as a result of the attack; however, the nature of the attack and physical losses are yet to be ascertained. On November 26, unidentified persons blew up a gas pipeline in Hameed Khan Machine area, some five miles south of the police post in Passani. Residents said that an explosion had triggered a fire from the pipeline. A police official said that the pipeline was blown up for the second time. “The same pipeline was blown up two years ago by terrorists,” he added. On August 15 last year, police and security forces repulsed three midnight militant attacks at as many locations in the jurisdiction of Mattani police station. Police officials said that militants attacked the Hameed Khan police checkpoint using the latest weaponry from a nearby forest. However, they said that the militants could not hit the police post since they were firing from a distance. They added that the personnel returned the fire, repulsing the attack. They said that there were no casualties reported. In a similar attack on Fort Mackson, commonly known as Kishangar post, the militants fired from a distance, which too was repulsed. The third attack was carried out at the Azakhel Dam post. However, the attack was repulsed when the personnel fired back.",

      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday issued renewed warnings about the threats to global peace due to “terrorist organisations operating in Afghanistan”, and criticised the Taliban regime’s policies, which he said created conditions “similar to or worse than pre-9/11”. He made the remarks in a statement thanking world leaders for showing solidarity with Pakistan over the recent attack on an imambargah in Islamabad , which killed 36 people and injured more than 160. The militant group Islamic State (IS) had claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat, Zardari reiterated the Pakistani nation’s resolve to combat terrorism and violent ideology. “Pakistan has long maintained that terrorism cannot be confronted by a single country in isolation,” he was quoted as saying. Citing Pakistan’s experience, he said in the statement that whenever “terrorist groups are allowed space, facilitation or impunity beyond national borders, the consequences are borne by innocent civilians all over the world.” Under such a context, he continued, certain neighbouring countries had become partners in crime by allowing terrorist elements to operate against Pakistan from their soil, while some not only finance them directly but also provide them with technical and military means. “This is a reality that has shaped the regional developments in recent years. Pakistan takes strong exception to the situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime has created conditions similar to or worse than pre-9/11, when terror organisations posed threats to global peace, ending in the 9/11 tragedy,” the statement quoted him as saying. The Sept 11, 2001 , attacks, also known as 9/11, refer to a series of coordinated plane hijackings by the armed Al Qaeda group, which claimed almost 3,000 lives. Zardari also accused India of “assisting the Taliban regime and threatening not only Pakistan but also the regional and global peace.” Following Friday’s mosque attack in Islamabad, government officials, including the Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, had also blamed “Indian-backed proxies” for carrying out the attack. President Zardari appreciated the international community for expressing solidarity with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism. “Pakistan is humbled by the strong and sincere outpouring of support and solidarity from world leaders, governments and international organisations,” he said in the statement. “The messages of sympathy and solidarity had brought comfort to the people of Pakistan and strength to the families who mourned.” Islamabad has reiterated that Afghanistan’s soil has been continuously used by terrorists against Pakistan and urged the Taliban regime to rein in the terror groups’ operations in its land to target civilians and military personnel in Pakistan.",

The military is carrying out large-scale counter-offensives across the country to reclaim territory seized by pro-democracy rebels of various ethnic and religious backgrounds In Tanintharyi, the southernmost region of Myanmar, the local resistance has managed to contain the military. After five years of guerrilla warfare, the revolutionary youth there remain determined to restore democracy through armed struggle.
