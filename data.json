      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Friday said PTI leaders were seeking dialogue with the government, but jailed party founder Imran Khan opposed the move even as the party remained firm on its call for protests on February 8. In December, the PTI had denied dialogue with the government until “ensuring a level-playing field” was provided to the party through its ongoing “street movement” — an agitation campaign against the government. Speaking during Geo News ’s programme Naya Pakistan with Shahzad Iqbal , Sanaullah said that the government had been in contact with PTI leaders for dialogue, stating that “several of them are in favour of negotiations with the government.” “Whenever politicians come to the table for talks, problems get solved, and a way gets paved,” he said. Sanaullah reiterated that many PTI leaders were in favour of dialogue, but  “whenever they meet us, they say that the PTI founder is not in favour of any sort of dialogue with the government,” he added. He further said that PTI’s arrangement, speeches, and mobilisation efforts for the upcoming protest on Feb 8 indicated that they were “standing firm on their decision and wouldn’t step back as per the government’s assessment”. “However,” he added, “the PTI leaders think that if they get to meet Imran, they could convince him to postpone the protest and initiate dialogue with the government.” When asked about the meeting of PTI leaders with Imran, Sanaullah said: “They have gone too far now; any initiation of dialogues or meeting with Imran Khan can be possible only after Feb 8.” “They are preparing for the protest at full throttle, so meeting them before that would not be possible,” he said. The former interior minister also implied that the government would deal with the protests “administratively”, and PTI would emerge “unsuccessful”. He advised the PTI to “play its role” in the parliamentary processes and return to the committee proceedings from which they had abstained. Earlier, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar had said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with Imran. It further maintained that it would not engage in negotiations with the government, as the stance it followed was in line with the directions passed on by Imran. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: At least 20 containers, mostly containing electrical batteries, were destroyed as a huge fire erupted at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) on Friday afternoon, but no casualties were reported as workers were away for Friday prayer, according to officials and rescue services officials. South-DIG, Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the police “immediately responded to the fire that broke out in a container at Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT), West Wharf, within the limits of Docks police”, while rescue and fire teams also reached there for fire extinguishing efforts. Rescue 1122 Spokesperson, Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan, said that the central command and control room “received information of the outbreak of fire in a container at West Wharf, gate-20 at around 1:45pm”. “Another container caught the fire by the time the team reached the spot,” he told Dawn , adding, “The teams then called for back-up rescue teams.” “The container carrying electrical, dry chemical and lithium batteries spontaneously triggered the fire, which spread and engulfed 19 other containers carrying batteries, clothes and other goods,” the Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding all 20 containers were completely destroyed, causing massive financial losses. He noted that his teams faced difficulties in putting out the fire as it did not require water to extinguish it, but a specialised powder to control it. Khan further said, “The Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation had provided water tankers, while 20 fire tenders of the rescue service, fire brigade of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), KPT and Pakistan Navy managed to control the fire by 4:50pm.” Regarding the possible cause of the fire, Khan said, “This is an emerging challenge for firefighters in the metropolis as such batteries being used in electrical vehicles spontaneously trigger fire due to certain temperature and emerging as a new health hazard.” He recalled that last year, a luxury electronic vehicle parked at a showroom in Defence Housing Authority had triggered a fire because of its battery, resulting in death of two women and injuries to several others. Khan suspected the same thing might have happened in today’s incident at the KPT, as the container which caught fire was carrying a similar type of batteries. Khan said their rescue teams were collaborating with rescue teams in Punjab and Islamabad to deal with the new challenge of spontaneous fire that is emerging due to the batteries being used in electric vehicles. However, Raza told Dawn that during the initial probe, it transpired that the fire broke out due to a short circuit in the container filled with clothes, which spread and engulfed other containers. “The fire was completely controlled by 4:30pm, however, cooling work continued.” He said so far, no injury was reported, while further information about the incident and financial losses was being obtained. According to a KPT public relations officer (PRO), Shariq Ameen Farooqi, “Fire erupted in a container at KICT Terminal, Karachi Port, West Wharf. The fire was spreading quickly in the closely placed set of containers, which were also placed on one another.” “An immediate and well-coordinated emergency response was carried out, led by Karachi Port Trust Fire Brigade Service,” he added. He said that a total of 8 fire tenders from KPT were deployed on-site, supported by 4 fire tenders from the Pakistan Navy, one from Karachi Shipyard & Engineering Works, and two fire tenders from Karachi Metropolitan Corporation. “Through swift action, effective coordination, and professional handling by all responding teams, the fire was successfully brought under control, preventing its spread and ensuring the safety of port infrastructure and operations.” He said that KPT acknowledged and appreciated the timely support, professionalism, and teamwork of all participating agencies in safeguarding Karachi Port. In 2020, two people were burned to death , and three others were injured when a huge fire broke out at an oil terminal in Keamari.",

      "title_orig": "Mahmood Khan Achakzai, a Bhutto-era political figure, steps in as new NA opposition leader",
      "summary_orig": "It was the afternoon of October 7, 1983, and former dictator General Ziaul Haq’s martial law was in effect, when a young man decided to lead a procession in Quetta to demand the restoration of democracy. Despite grave life threats, his stance remained firm, even when four of his supporters were shot dead, and dozens were injured by the authorities. Today, the man, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, has been appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly. His name for the slot was recommended by incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan last year. In the past few years, Mehmood Khan’s name has appeared in the mainstream media one time too many. But who is this man, and what is his story? Entry into politics Mehmood Khan, whose name and face have been a mainstay of the opposition benches for decades, was born in the village of Inayatullah Karez, Gulistan, in Balochistan’s Killa Abdullah Khan, which at the time was part of the Quetta-Pishin district. He received his early education in Gulistan and completed his F.Sc. from Science College, Quetta, before graduating with a degree in Civil Engineering from the Peshawar University of Engineering. A major but tragic turning point in his life came on December 2, 1973, when his father, Khan Abdul Samad Khan, was martyred in Quetta because of his political stance. Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai had parted ways with the National Awami Party (NAP) after the abolition of One Unit, when instead of forming a united Pashtun province by merging the Southwestern Pashtun belt with the Northwestern Pashtun belt — or restoring British Balochistan (the Pashtun-majority province) — the party accepted the merger of British Balochistan with the Brahui confederacy or states union to constitute what is today Balochistan. This decision was taken after General Ayub’s resignation, when NAP leaders had already been released, but Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai was still in prison. In protest, Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai formed a new party called the Pashtunkhwa National Awami Party — a decision that ultimately led to his assassination. Ironically, the strongest opposition did not come from the NAP leadership or the Pakistani establishment but also from Afghan President Daoud Khan, who disliked Abdul Samad Khan’s argument of forming a separate “Pashtunistan province” by uniting all Pashtun areas. It was during this period, after completing his education, that young Mehmood Khan was thrust directly into a political storm. Following his father’s assassination, he was nominated in the subsequent by-election, which was not just a political contest. It was painted as a clash between Afghan President Daoud and then-prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The rise of the maverick In January 1974, just a few days before the election, Mehmood Khan received a message that a senior Afghan official wanted to meet him. Along with two companions — one of whom had been his slain father’s deputy — he went to a border village near Chaman, where the governor of Kandahar arrived in a Mercedes. The conversation began politely, but when Mehmood Khan refused to change his stance, he was bluntly warned that this election was actually a contest between Daoud and Bhutto, and that he should withdraw and rejoin the NAP. While his colleague could not withstand the pressure, the young and fiery Mehmood Khan displayed what has been described as remarkable courage. “This is the political legacy of my leader and father. It is the principled stance for which he was martyred. If President Daoud considers this a contest with Bhutto, then tell Daoud he has already lost,” he had said. At a time when fear prevented anyone else from taking up the party’s leadership, this heavy responsibility fell on the young shoulders of Mehmood Khan. From the very beginning, he swam against the tides, one reason why he remains the only politician in the country who, without the support or patronage of any domestic or foreign establishment, has sustained his political existence solely through his own resilience and the sacrifices of his workers. One purpose In fact, Mahmood Khan Achakzai has played a central role in shaping and leading various opposition political movements in Pakistan, consistently standing for democratic rights, constitutionalism and federalism. During General Ziaul Haq’s dictatorship, he was an active participant in the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD), where he allied with progressive and democratic forces to resist military rule. In the late 1990s, he co-founded the Pakistan Oppressed Nations Movement (PONAM), uniting nationalist parties from smaller provinces to struggle for provincial autonomy and equal rights within the federation. Later, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement (APDM), he joined mainstream political forces in opposing General Pervez Musharraf’s military regime and demanding free and fair elections. More recently, Mehmood Khan was seen as a prominent figure in the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a broad alliance of opposition parties formed to challenge authoritarianism, uphold parliamentary supremacy, and ensure the sanctity of the Constitution. In 2025, he launched the Tehreek Tahafuz-e-Aain-e-Pakistan, a new political platform aimed at uniting diverse political and social forces to safeguard the 1973 Constitution, strengthen democratic institutions, and promote civilian supremacy. His continuous involvement in these movements reflects his lifelong commitment to democracy, provincial rights, constitutionalism and rule of law in Pakistan’s political landscape.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces have killed 12 terrorists and effectively thwarted their attempt to create a hostage situation in Balochistan’s Kharan district during multiple operations, the military’s media wing said in a statement. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR),  on January 15, “approximately fifteen to twenty Indian-sponsored terrorists of Fitna Al Hindustan carried out multiple terrorist activities in Kharan City, District Kharan.” The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. It said that during the operations, “terrorists attacked [the] City Police Station, National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank Limited.” They also looted Rs3.4 million from the banks. “Security forces effectively responded and engaged the terrorists, prompting them to retreat. During the ensuing clearance operation, twelve terrorists were sent to hell in three different engagements,” the ISPR said. “Terrorists’ design to create a hostage situation at the police station was also effectively thwarted.” It added that a sanitisation operation is underway in the surrounding areas of Kharan to eliminate any other terrorists. “A relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision “Azm-e-Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” it said. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. On January 6, ISPR Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared during a press conference that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025. Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas. On January 13, the ISPR said four terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district.",

      "summary_orig": "X, formerly known as Twitter, on Friday faced a global outage, the second in a week, as users from across the world reported having difficulties accessing the platform. According to a report by The Independent , the website and its app failed to load for users across the globe, with many visitors saying they saw a blank screen. “Some users also saw Cloudflare error pages – though the issue was at X itself, and the problem did not seem to be a repeat of recent Cloudflare technical issues that did take X offline,” the report said. Staffers at Dawn also saw a Cloudflare error page when they tried accessing the website, while the app did not load at all and showed posts from hours ago. Screenshot of a Cloudflare error a staffer at Dawn saw when they tried accessing the website at 8:52pm PKT. Tracking website Downdetector showed a massive uptick in reports of problems at X at 8:15pm, with 315 complaints, before they fell to 245 at 8:45pm. Screenshot showing as spike in reports of problems at X at around 8:15pm in Pakistan. According to Reuters , there were more than 41,000 reports of issues with the social media platform as of 10:35 am ET in the United States  (8:35pm PKT), according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources. The actual number of affected users may differ from what is shown on Downdetector, as the reports are submitted by users. Users in the UK reported around 8,000 incidents, and over 2,400 issues were reported in India. X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. On Tuesday, thousands of users worldwide reported issues with accessing the X, with the outage beginning around 9am Eastern (7:38pm PKT), peaking at more than 28,300 logged issues with Elon Musk’s platform in the US before cooling to about 700 reports, according to Downdetector. In the UK, reports fell to roughly 130 from a high of more than 8,000, while Canada saw issues decline after topping 3,200 earlier in the day, according to the website that tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources. In Pakistan, complaints peaked at 93 at 7:38pm, falling to four by 8:23pm. In November 2025, a Cloudflare outage had briefly prevented access to X after a faulty security configuration crashed its traffic system. A few days later, a separate disruption took X offline for thousands of US users. On March 10 last year, users in Pakistan and around the world experienced an outage on X. At the time, platform owner Elon Musk said the disruption was the result of a cyberattack.",

Afridi visited Karachi and other cities of Sindh last week as part of the PTI’s renewed anti-government agitation campaign called the “ street movement ”. The chief minister decried the treatment meted out to him by the Sindh government during his visit, alleging that the police tried to stop his motorcade and PTI supporters from staging a peaceful protest at Mazar-i-Quaid. The Sindh government denied the allegations, stating that the Jinnah Ground was under the control of the Centre, so it was not entitled to issue a no-objection certificate to the party. Speaking to reporters in Karachi, Governor Tessori said that the PTI had “turned the whole country upside down, but the agitation was confined to social media and had no value on the ground.” Referring to KP CM’s Karachi visit, Tessori said, “You must come here, we will welcome you again, but come with positive work to do”. He suggested that CM Afridi should meet with traders and industrialists and ask them to invest in his province instead of mobilising people to take to the streets. “If you talk about establishing new industries, expanding inter-provincial trade, the future of people, giving health and educational opportunities, people will definitely welcome you,” Tessori said. “However, incendiary political narrative, incitement to vandalism, blockades, causing trouble to people — these things will not be welcomed.” The governor added that putting this city to a halt caused losses worth billions of rupees, because “Karachi is the financial and economic hub of Pakistan,” he stated. “For God’s sake, don’t do this,” Tessori pleaded. He reminded the chief minister that Pakistan was now at the centre of the “global lens”, making progress through diplomatic efforts. “Why don’t you understand that we are a triumphant nation and the time has come to pull ourselves out of the problems we have been facing for the last 70 years,” he said. He said that repeating the incidents of May 9 — when PTI supporters staged violent nationwide protests, vandalising state-owned institutions and military installations following Imran Khan’s arrest — at this stage would be “equivalent to a foreign conspiracy and a foreign agenda.” “We have to provide educational opportunities because I believe that ignorance is the biggest reason for terrorism,” the governor said. Speaking in favour of the armed forces and calling the chief minister out for criticising them, Tessori said that politicians might disappoint the nation, but the army would never do that. “Didn’t we see what happened on May 10 ?” he questioned. Tessori added that the world was praising the Pakistani Army and acknowledging the country’s defence capabilities, but the PTI was doing the opposite. “Rather than lauding your army, you started abusing it.” “Is there any country or leader in the world who talks against his own army?” He was referring to Imran’s recent social media comments against the leadership of the armed forces on the X platform, in response to which the Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations had called him a “ national security threat ”. “There are countries where presidents can be picked up, and their armies can’t do anything”, Tessori said, “but India couldn’t even seize an inch of land of Pakistan because of our army.” “Politicians may disappoint you, but not your army.” He accepted that the country was facing economic difficulties, though the world was handing orders to Pakistan’s defence industries to manufacture aircraft. “Our economy will improve by this,” he stated. Further criticising the PTI, Governor Tessori said that Karachi city gave the PTI a president, Arif Alvi, who was a citizen of this city. “Tell me how many projects he gave to Karachi,” he asked. “Karachi gave the MNA seat to Imran Khan, but he hadn’t even spent a night in this city.” “Tell us what your performance was?” he asked. “How many industries had he [Imran] inaugurated in Karachi?” “What have you done for Pashtuns, Balochs, Sindhis, Urdu-speaking, and other communities in this city?” he questioned. “But you made speeches to incite violence like May 9.” “Name a single project,” he challenged. “Even if some time is given to you now, you still can’t do anything.” Governor Tessori added that PTI could only incite innocent people on social media and sold them a narrative that had neither rendered them any favour nor could it now. “We have to choose whether we want to strengthen our country economically and educationally, or go after the people who would just make you chant slogans and hold flags,” he stated.",

      "summary_orig": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that his country’s relations with Pakistan are “genuinely mutually beneficial” and that Moscow maintains close relations with Islamabad. “We maintain close cooperation with Pakistan, a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the largest regional organisation in terms of economic, technological, and human potential. Russia-Pakistan relations are genuinely mutually beneficial,” the Embassy of Russia in Pakistan quoted President Putin as saying on X. The statement came as Pakistan’s Ambassador to Russia, Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, formally presented his credentials to President Putin during a ceremony held on Thursday at Moscow’s Grand Kremlin Palace, according to the Pakistani Embassy in Russia . In recent years, Pakistan and Russia have significantly strengthened their economic ties, driven by mutual necessity. Following Western sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict, Moscow turned toward new energy outlets, while Islamabad simultaneously sought more affordable fuel sources to reduce national import expenses. This diplomatic shift culminated in 2023, when Pakistan officially integrated Russian crude oil into its energy portfolio. Last month , Finance Mini­ster Muhammad Aur­a­ngzeb said Islamabad and Moscow were in talks regarding a new potential oil-sector agreement. Pakistan, which imports 70 per cent of its crude oil, is mainly dependent on Russian crude exports. Despite this, Pakis­tan has enjoyed lower tariffs from Washington and close relations with its current administration, even as India recently saw a punitive 25pc tariff impo­sed on its goods. In November last year — as Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev visited Islamabad to participate in the 10th Russia-Pakistan Intergovernmental Commission — the two countries reaffirmed their resolve to deepen bilateral cooperation in diversified trade, energy, business-to-business engagements and social sectors like health and education.",

      "summary_orig": "A high-level European Union delegation on Friday visited the Sialkot International Airport to monitor the immigration processes and measures to prevent irregular migration, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) spokesperson said in a statement. The move comes after around 66,154 passengers were offloaded last year despite holding valid documents, particularly at Lahore and Karachi airports, amid a post-2024 Greece boat tragedy crackdown on migrant smuggling, which claimed several Pakistani lives. According to the spokesperson, the delegation was given a comprehensive briefing on the “working, performance, and achievements of the FIA Immigration at the Sialkot airport, with particular emphasis on the progress made over the last five months.” The delegation comprised the Frontex officer to Pakistan, an official from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, a representative from the Embassy of Hungary in Pakistan, and the International Centre for Migration Policy Development’s official. “The briefing was focused on measures taken to prevent irregular migration, including the effective implementation of risk indicators, enhanced profiling mechanisms, and optimal utilisation of the Second Line Border Control Office,” the spokesperson added in the statement. The spokesperson stated that the EU delegation was further apprised of the pre-departure facilitation mechanisms established at both the zonal level and the airport, aimed at strengthening border management, improving operational efficiency, and creating a passenger-friendly environment. Last week, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi announced that the FIA had set up pre-departure facilitation desks at all its zonal offices nationwide to assist international travellers. “The delegation appreciated and acknowledged the professionalism and commitment in ensuring effective, secure, and robust border control operations at Sialkot International Airport,” he said. In December, the immigration authorities of FIA offloaded four passengers , belonging to Sialkot and Gujranwala, from flights to Indonesia and Turkiye. An FIA official told Dawn that the passengers had been in contact with the human smugglers, who had to send them to Italy through illegal means. The authorities also offloaded two passengers at the Sialkot International Airport for allegedly attempting to illegally migrate to Europe in the guise of Umrah pilgrims. Over the past year, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The immigration border management system (IBMS) data analysis of the July-December 2024 period revealed the trend of passengers travelling to at least 15 countries. The data analysis showed that most of the passengers travelling to these transit destinations are mainly from nine districts of Punjab, including Sialkot.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad district and sessions court on Friday issued directions to law enforcement authorities to arrest lawyer and activist Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, “within 24 hours”, warning them of contempt in case of non-compliance. Mazari and Chattha have been facing legal proceedings in a case on accusations of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. During today’s hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka issued strict orders to the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Islamabad, Jawad Tariq, to arrest Mazari and her husband within 24 hours. “Take them from Pakistan, India or Afghanistan. You have 24 hours. I don’t know whether they are at sea or in the sky. Wherever they are, arrest Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha within 24 hours, otherwise contempt of court proceedings will be initiated,” the judge remarked during the hearing. A day earlier, the court cancelled the interim bail granted to the accused after they failed to appear before the court despite repeated directions. Judge Majoka directed the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCIA) to arrest both accused and keep them in lockup upon arrest. Additionally, the court ordered that the statements of Mazari and Chattha be recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) via video link, should their physical presence not be immediately possible. On January 7, Mazari and her husband submitted an application seeking to summon the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general (DG ISPR) as a witness in the case. The duo claimed that during a recent presser by the military spokesperson, an attempt was made to influence the ongoing criminal trial, as the press briefing was broadcast “on all national media, and the content is readily available online”. The case The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the NCCIA, Islamabad. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.",

Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas signed off in October on Trump’s plan, which says the Palestinian technocratic body will be overseen by an international so-called “Board of Peace” that is meant to supervise Gaza’s governance for a transitional period. In another post, Trump said the “Board of Peace,” of which Trump himself is the chair, was formed, and its members would be announced shortly. Israel and Hamas have accused each other of ceasefire violations in Gaza, where, since the start of the truce in October, over 440 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed. The ceasefire has also been tested by the failure to retrieve the remains of one last Israeli hostage, Israeli delays in reopening Gaza’s border crossing with Egypt, and Hamas’ refusal so far to disarm. By pressing on with the second phase of the ceasefire, Washington and its mediator partners will need to tackle the vexing challenges of disarming Hamas, further Israeli withdrawal tied to the disarmament and deploying an international peacekeeping force. The Palestinian technocratic body will have 15 members and will be led by Ali Shaath , a former deputy minister in the Western-backed Palestinian Authority who had been in charge of developing industrial zones, according to a statement by mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. “These Palestinian leaders are unwaveringly committed to a PEACEFUL future,” Trump said. Many experts say that Trump being the chair of the board meant to supervise Gaza’s governance resembled a colonial structure. He also said Egypt, Qatar and Turkey will help to secure what he called a “comprehensive demilitarisation agreement” with Hamas. Israel’s assault on Gaza since late 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis, and internally displaced Gaza’s entire population. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel has said it took action in self-defence after Hamas killed 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages in their 2023 attack.",

      "title_orig": "At UN, Pakistan voices hope for early normalisation of situation in Iran, rejects any external interference",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has told the UN Security Council that it hopes for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, warning that the UN Charter and international law prohibit external interference in the internal affairs of states. “The UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against other states’ territorial integrity or political independence, or interference in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of states,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told an emergency meeting of the 15-member Council on Thursday evening. The United States convened the Security Council meeting to discuss the situation in Iran, with the country’s Ambassador Mike Waltz criticising the actions taken against Iranian protesters and assuring them of President Donald Trump’s support. In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy said, “We have been carefully observing developments in Iran and the region in recent days,” pointing out that new threats to regional peace and stability remain a serious cause of concern. Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds. A stable and peaceful Iran is in the interests of Pakistan, the region and beyond, he said, adding that his country has full confidence in the wisdom of the Iranian people and leadership, rooted in the country’s culture, history and resilience. Ambassador Asim Ahmad highlighted that the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct, noting that the Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states. Any external interference in the internal affairs of states, he added, is inconsistent with international law and the principles of the UN Charter. “We strongly believe that all disputes must be resolved through peaceful means and in accordance with international law,” the Pakistani envoy affirmed, warning that continued hostilities, use of force and unilateral actions would only deepen crises and cause unnecessary suffering. “We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure, and that all relevant parties will return to the negotiating table to find a lasting solution to their differences, based on mutual respect and understanding,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad said in conclusion. Opening the debate, UN Assistant Secretary-General Martha Pobee, briefing the Security Council members, called for restraint by all parties to prevent further escalation. Pobee described the situation in Iran as fluid and deeply concerning, noting that protests continue, albeit reportedly at a smaller scale than last week. She voiced alarm, however, over public statements suggesting possible military strikes on the country. “This external dimension adds volatility to an already combustible situation. All efforts must be undertaken to prevent any further deterioration,” she said. Moreover, UN Secretary-General António Guterres remains convinced that all concerns regarding Iran, including those related to the nuclear issue and ongoing protests, are best addressed through diplomacy and dialogue. He also urged maximum restraint at this sensitive moment and called on all actors to refrain from any actions that could lead to further loss of life or ignite a wider regional escalation. The protests erupted on December 28 after shopkeepers in the Iranian capital, Tehran, took to the streets to rail against the collapse of the national currency, soaring inflation and worsening living conditions. Ambassador Waltz, the US envoy, accused the Iranian government of actions against its own citizens that have repercussions for international peace and security. “President Donald J. Trump and the United States of America stand by the brave people of Iran,” he said. “Regardless of its excuses, the regime is solely responsible for the economic misery of the Iranian people and will be held accountable.” Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia hit back, saying the world has been watching as the United States continues to escalate tensions and fuel hysteria around Iran. He said that the current Security Council meeting, requested by the United States, is nothing more than yet another attempt to justify blatant aggression and interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. “And if, as Washington puts it, Iran’s authorities do not come to their senses, then Washington will solve the Iranian problem in its favourite way: through strikes aimed at overthrowing an undesirable regime in order to lend credibility to and justify its actions,” the Russian envoy said. China’s Ambassador, Sun Lei, said the United States has openly issued threats of the use of force against Iran. Stressing that China has always advocated adherence to UN Charter principles and international law, he said sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are the most fundamental norms of international affairs. “The use of force can never solve problems,” the Chinese envoy said, noting that military adventurism would push the region towards an abyss. “No action that defies international law can be tolerated,” he added. Ambassador Gholamhossein Darzi, Deputy Permanent Representative of Iran, said he was speaking on behalf of a nation in mourning. “It is deeply regrettable that the representative of the United States, which requested this meeting, has today resorted to lies, distortions of facts and deliberate disinformation to conceal his country’s direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran towards violence,” he said. He added that the United States requested the meeting in order to conceal its direct complicity in the crimes its mercenaries have committed against Iran. “The United States is attempting to portray itself as a friend of the Iranian people, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for political destabilisation and military intervention under a so-called humanitarian narrative,” he said. He described these claims as particularly cynical in light of what he called the United States’ long and well-documented record of unlawful military interventions, regime-change operations and systematic violations of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.",

The rocket was fired from an unknown direction, resulting in a several-feet-deep crater and the collapse of the house’s ceiling. Fortunately, no casualties were reported. Earlier, on the night of December 31, 2025, Bannu Cantonment was also targeted in a rocket attack when a rocket landed in vacant houses near the CMH. While no loss of life occurred in that incident, property damage was reported. According to initial information, the same type of rocket was used in both attacks, which militants have named the “Al-Farooq 2”. Following the December 31 attack, the model of the fired rocket was also widely circulated on social media. Security agencies have launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident, while evidence is being collected from the site to determine the motives behind the attack and identify those responsible. In another incident, militants launched an attack on the Fateh Khel police check post in Bannu. According to Bannu Police spokesman Asif Hassan, an intense exchange of fire continued for quite some time. The police successfully repulsed the attack, forcing the attackers to flee. However, a search operation is currently underway in the area.",
