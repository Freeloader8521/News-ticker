      "summary_orig": "South Korea's cybersecurity watchdog is facing a workforce shortage amid the soaring number of cyber threats reported by local businesses, a lawmaker said Sunday. Citing data submitted by the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), Rep. Kim Jang-kyom of the main opposition People Power Party said the watchdog received 1,887 reports of security breaches from South Korean companies in 2024, up 47 percent from a year earlier. During the January-August period of 2025, the number of breach reports stood at 1,501, the data showed. Despite the surge in cyberattacks reported by businesses, the number of response personnel came to just 132, up only nine from 2022. Over the same period, South Korea's budget for hacking and virus response systems rose 22 percent to 73.6 billion won ($52.4 million), according to the lawmaker. \"The fact that the number of investigators at KISA increased by a single digit over the years indicates the country lacks readiness against such threats,\" Kim said.",

At the time of the May 9 riots, a caretaker government with Mohammad Azam Khan as the chief minister was in power in KP, after the PTI had dissolved the provincial assembly as rifts with the Centre grew. “For the public’s information, I want to inform that 29 false cases were registered on May 9, 2023 in anti-terrorism courts that were based on political victimisation, lack of evidence and misuse of authority,” said KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel in a video statement seen by Dawn.com . Uthmankhel said KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur took notice of the matter as “courts had already acquitted all suspects in most of the cases”, while some suspects were discharged and some cases were sent to ordinary civil courts. It could not be confirmed whether the cabinet had recommended withdrawing all 29 cases mentioned by the advocate general or some of them. “This proves that all the anti-terrorism cases were illegal, unconstitutional and based on political victimisation,” he said, adding that the KP cabinet decided that the home department will withdraw the cases.

The video clip also included screenshots of letters sent by the KP Home and Tribal Affairs Department to the advocate general’s office. They included a recommendation of withdrawal for a case filed in Mardan on May 9, 2023 at the City police station. A letter dated October 3 showed that the KP cabinet wrote to its home department, saying that the matter of withdrawal was placed before the cabinet on an “urgent basis” after Uthmankhel wrote to CM Gandapur, who approved taking up the matter.

      "title_orig": "Muslim countries that worked with Trump on Gaza plan welcome Hamas’s ‘steps regarding proposal’: FO",
      "summary_orig": "The eight Muslim countries that worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza have welcomed the “steps taken by Hamas” in this connection, the Foreign Office said on Sunday. On Friday, Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan — which was announced on Monday after a meeting between the US president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and seek further negotiations. While the Trump administration worked with eight Muslim countries last month to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end, reservations have been expressed from that latter’s side that the plan unveiled by the White House was not the one originally agreed upon. Nevertheless, they see Hamas’s partial agreement to the plan as an opportunity for a ceasefire in Gaza after an onslaught of around two years. “The Foreign Ministers of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Republic of Turkiye, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Qatar and the Arab Republic of Egypt, today welcomed the steps taken by Hamas regarding US President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the war on Gaza, release all hostages, alive or deceased, and the immediate launch of negotiations on implementation mechanisms,” a FO statement said. The foreign ministers also welcomed Trump’s call on Israel to immediately stop the bombing in Gaza and begin implementation of the prisoner-hostage exchange agreement, it added. “They expressed appreciation for his commitment to establishing peace in the region. They also affirmed that such developments represent a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire, and to address the critical humanitarian conditions facing people in Gaza Strip,” the FO statement read. According to the FO, the foreign ministers also welcomed the announcement by Hamas of its “readiness to hand over the administration of Gaza to a transitional Palestinian Administrative Committee of independent technocrats”. They also emphasised the need for the immediate launch of negotiations to agree on mechanisms to implement the proposal and address all of its aspects. “The foreign ministers reiterated their joint commitment to support efforts towards the implementation of the proposal to work for the immediate end of the war in Gaza and achieve a comprehensive agreement that ensures unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of the Palestinian people, that no measures are taken that threaten the security and safety of civilians, the release of hostages, the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank, reaching a security mechanism that guarantees the security of all sides in a manner that leads to the full Israeli withdrawal […] the rebuilding of Gaza and that […] a path [is created] for just peace on basis of the two-state solution,” the statement said. From Gaza invasion to Trump’s plan Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced. Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement. After multiple attempts to mediate a truce between Palestine’s Hamas and  Israeli, a significant development came last month when Trump engaged eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, to end the onslaught in Gaza. Merely days later, the White House revealed the US president’s 20-point plan for Gaza. Simultaneously, Trump held a meeting with the Israeli prime minister and held a press conference alongside him, announcing his agreement to the proposal. But, some Muslim countries engaged on the matter have said that Trump’s plan was not the one they originally agreed to. Meanwhile, US news outlet Axios reported that the deal now before Hamas was significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention. The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process. Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”. Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported. According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios . On Monday, Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas following which Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal or meet “a very sad end”. Later, he gave Hamas until 2200 GMT on Sunday (3am PKT on Monday) to accept his plan for peace in Gaza, warning that the Palestinian resistance group would face “all hell” if it did not agree to the terms. On Friday, Hamas — which had not been included in negotiations about the proposal — said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan to end the Gaza invasion, including releasing hostages, but avoided addressing more vexing issues like disarmament and said it would seek further negotiations.

      "summary_en": "The eight Muslim countries that worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza have welcomed the “steps taken by Hamas” in this connection, the Foreign Office said on Sunday. On Friday, Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan — which was announced on Monday after a meeting between the US president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and seek further negotiations. While the Trump administration worked with eight Muslim countries last month to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end, reservations have been expressed from that latter’s side that the plan unveiled by the White House was not the one originally agreed upon. Nevertheless, they see Hamas’s partial agreement to the plan as an opportunity for a ceasefire in Gaza after an onslaught of around two years. “The Foreign Ministers of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Republic of Turkiye, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Qatar and the Arab Republic of Egypt, today welcomed the steps taken by Hamas regarding US President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the war on Gaza, release all hostages, alive or deceased, and the immediate launch of negotiations on implementation mechanisms,” a FO statement said. The foreign ministers also welcomed Trump’s call on Israel to immediately stop the bombing in Gaza and begin implementation of the prisoner-hostage exchange agreement, it added. “They expressed appreciation for his commitment to establishing peace in the region. They also affirmed that such developments represent a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire, and to address the critical humanitarian conditions facing people in Gaza Strip,” the FO statement read. According to the FO, the foreign ministers also welcomed the announcement by Hamas of its “readiness to hand over the administration of Gaza to a transitional Palestinian Administrative Committee of independent technocrats”. They also emphasised the need for the immediate launch of negotiations to agree on mechanisms to implement the proposal and address all of its aspects. “The foreign ministers reiterated their joint commitment to support efforts towards the implementation of the proposal to work for the immediate end of the war in Gaza and achieve a comprehensive agreement that ensures unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of the Palestinian people, that no measures are taken that threaten the security and safety of civilians, the release of hostages, the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank, reaching a security mechanism that guarantees the security of all sides in a manner that leads to the full Israeli withdrawal […] the rebuilding of Gaza and that […] a path [is created] for just peace on basis of the two-state solution,” the statement said. From Gaza invasion to Trump’s plan Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced. Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement. After multiple attempts to mediate a truce between Palestine’s Hamas and  Israeli, a significant development came last month when Trump engaged eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, to end the onslaught in Gaza. Merely days later, the White House revealed the US president’s 20-point plan for Gaza. Simultaneously, Trump held a meeting with the Israeli prime minister and held a press conference alongside him, announcing his agreement to the proposal. But, some Muslim countries engaged on the matter have said that Trump’s plan was not the one they originally agreed to. Meanwhile, US news outlet Axios reported that the deal now before Hamas was significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention. The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process. Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”. Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported. According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios . On Monday, Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas following which Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal or meet “a very sad end”. Later, he gave Hamas until 2200 GMT on Sunday (3am PKT on Monday) to accept his plan for peace in Gaza, warning that the Palestinian resistance group would face “all hell” if it did not agree to the terms. On Friday, Hamas — which had not been included in negotiations about the proposal — said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan to end the Gaza invasion, including releasing hostages, but avoided addressing more vexing issues like disarmament and said it would seek further negotiations. Yesterday, Trump called on Israel to stop bombing Gaza immediately and he believes Hamas was ready for peace. However, reports of bombing in Gaza continue to come .",

Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks , particularly targeting police personnel. Spokesperson for Bannu Police Kashif Nawaz told Dawn.com , “A security personnel was killed and another was injured when they were attacked by unknown assailants near the Ayub fuel station on Miranshah road.” He added that the body and the injured were rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital in Bannu, while a police team was dispatched to the site of the incident to collect information. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies. Last month, a police constable was shot dead by unknown assailants in Bannu while he was on his way to work.  On September 2, six soldiers were martyred , while five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in Bannu. According to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Indian sponsored kharjis (seceders) attempted to breach the perimeter security; however, “their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response of the Pakistani troops.” In August, a police constable was martyred in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Bannu, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.",

According to a statement from Sussex Police, emergency services were called to the fire at the building in Phyllis Avenue at about 9.50pm UK time on Saturday (1:50am PKT, Sunday). “This is a fast-moving investigation, and we are urging anyone with relevant information to report it to us. This includes anyone with CCTV, Ring Doorbell, dashcam, and mobile phone footage in the area at the time,” Sussex Police Detective Superintendent Karrie Bohanna said in the statement. “We understand the concerns this has caused within the community, and the impact that will be felt by the Muslim community as a result. “There is already an increased police presence at the scene, and there are also additional patrols taking place to provide reassurance at other places of worship across the county.” Bohanna added that the Sussex Police had a “zero-tolerance approach to hate crime”, adding there was no place for hate across the county. A volunteer working at the mosque, who chose not to be named, told the BBC that “two people tried to enter through the front door, only to find it locked.” “They then poured a liquid at the entrance and near a car parked outside, which was set alight. It could have been murder,” the man said. He added that two people inside the mosque managed to escape, per the report. Member of the Scottish Parliament and ex-first minister Humza Yousaf said in a post on X that such incidents were taking place because all Muslims were blamed for the actions of a few extremists. “We warned you. Many politicians & media outlets have put a target on every Muslim’s back by blaming all of us, and Islam, for the horrific Synagogue attack,” he said. “Thursday’s attack was the actions of one deranged extremist. This is what happens when you blame an entire community.” The fire follows Thursday’s attack on a synagogue in northern Manchester in which two people died and three others were seriously injured. British police later they accidentally shot a victim, as well as one of the survivors, as they attempted to stop an attacker who appeared to be wearing an explosive belt. The attacker, shot dead by officers at the scene, was not carrying a firearm, said Greater Manchester Police chief constable Steve Watson, though one of those killed suffered a gunshot wound.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump authorised the deployment of troops to Chicago after a federal agent shot an allegedly armed motorist there on Saturday. At the same time, a judge blocked the Republican leader’s attempt to send the military into Portland , another Democratic-run city. The escalating crisis across the country pits Trump’s increasingly militarised anti-crime and migration crackdown against opposition Democrats who accuse him of an authoritarian power grab. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement that “President Trump has authorised 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets” in Chicago. This comes after weeks of Republican threats to send troops to the Midwestern city over the wishes of local leaders. “President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.” Illinois Senator Dick Durbin called the move a “shameful chapter in our nation’s history”, adding that the “president is not intent on fighting crime. He is intent on spreading fear.” Chicago and Portland are the latest flashpoints in the Trump administration’s rollout of raids, following the deployment of troops to Los Angeles and Washington . The raids have seen groups of masked, armed men in unmarked cars and armoured vehicles target residential neighbourhoods and businesses, sparking protests. Trump has repeatedly called Portland “ war-ravaged ” and riddled with violent crime, but in Saturday’s court order, US District Judge Karin Immergut wrote “the President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts.” Although the city has seen scattered attacks on federal officers and property, the Trump administration failed to demonstrate “that those episodes of violence were part of an organised attempt to overthrow the government as a whole,” Immergut wrote in granting a temporary restraining order. Protests in Portland did not pose a “danger of rebellion,” and “regular law enforcement forces” could handle such incidents, Immergut said. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden applauded the order, saying the “victory supports what Oregonians already know: we don’t need or want Donald Trump to provoke violence by deploying federal troops in our state.” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller wrote on social media that the judge’s order was “legal insurrection” and accused local leaders in Oregon of conducting an “organised terrorist attack on the federal government.” ‘Operation Midway Blitz’ Earlier on Saturday, a federal officer in Chicago shot a motorist after law enforcement agents were “boxed in by 10 cars,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said. “Agents were unable to move their vehicles and exited the car. One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen,” she said. AFP could not independently verify the DHS version of the event. The agency said the motorist “drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” but Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Merritt told the Sun-Times newspaper that she was found in fair condition and taken to a local hospital. McLaughlin also accused Chicago police of “leaving the shooting scene” with officers refusing “to assist us in securing the area”. Chicago police told local broadcaster Fox 32 that officers responded to the scene, but the department “is not involved in the incident or its investigation. Federal authorities are investigating this shooting.” Following the shooting, protesters who had gathered, chanting “ICE go home!” were met with tear gas and pepper balls, temporarily dispersing before returning, the Sun-Times reported. Protesters left after federal agents vacated the scene. Trump’s “Operation Midway Blitz” was launched in Chicago last month, and Saturday’s shooting is not the first time federal agents have opened fire. Department of Homeland Security officials said ICE officers shot and killed 38-year-old immigrant Silverio Villegas Gonzalez during a traffic stop on September 12, accusing him of allegedly trying to flee the scene and dragging an ICE officer with the vehicle.",

      "summary_orig": "A lion kept at a private home in Thailand got loose and attacked a young boy, leaving him in hospital, the wildlife department said Sunday. The lion attacked the child, who was hospitalised with unspecified injuries, while he was walking on a public road Saturday night in western Kanchanaburi province, about a two-hour drive from the capital Bangkok, the department said in a statement. Local media said the boy was on his way home from playing with other children when the big cat pounced on him. Lion ownership is legal in Thailand, where the captive population has exploded in recent years, with nearly 500 registered in zoos, breeding farms, petting cafes and homes. But experts have warned the trend endangers animals and humans, and likely fuels illicit trade domestically and abroad. The lion’s owner, who the wildlife department identified only as Parinya, was charged with violating wildlife protection laws and faces up to six months in prison and a 50,000 baht ($1,500) fine if convicted. The lion was seized by authorities, the department said, adding that a wildlife breeding centre had prepared a new home for it. Parinya told local TV he was “shocked” when he learned of the attack, saying the female lion got loose after it was removed from its cage while it was being renovated. “I apologise for what happened, it was an accident,” he said, adding that he will pay compensation and for the boy’s medical treatment. In its statement, the wildlife department urged people who “keep wild animals to be aware of the potential dangers, as all animals have a ferocious instinct”.\n“Any unforeseen incident that affects the life and property of others will be punished and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” it added. Since 2022, Thai law has required owners to register and microchip lions, and inform authorities before moving them, but there are few enclosure or welfare requirements. Last month, a zookeeper was mauled to death by several lions at a safari park on the outskirts of Bangkok, raising scrutiny of the facility, which offers lion- and tiger-feeding trips for about $40 per person.",

      "title_orig": "Failed attempt at restoring lost reputation: Khawaja Asif reacts to Indian military, political leadership’s statements",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Sunday reacted to statements made by the Indian military and political leadership, terming them a “failed attempt” to restore their “lost reputation”. While he did not specify any particular statement that he was reacting to, his remarks follow recent aggressive comments from the Indian side, mentioning terrorism and warning of action. India has long accused Pakistan of cross-border terrorism, an allegation that Islamabad has repeatedly refuted and termed baseless . “The statements made by the Indian army and its political leadership are a failed attempt to restore its lost reputation,” Asif said on X. He also referred to a four-day escalation between India and Pakistan in May, during which Islamabad says it downed at least six Indian jets. Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the escalation,  and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”. “The way the public opinion in India turned against the government after the worst defeat in history, and the way [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and his group have lost their reputation, it is apparent from their statements that they [are feeling] the pressure,” Asif added. “This time, God willing, India will get buried under the rubble of its own jets,” the minister asserted. ‘Cataclysmic devastation’ Asif’s remarks come a day after the military warned that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and Pakistan would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) came in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in case of a fresh round of hostilities. “In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,” the ISPR said. Indian media outlet NDTV reported on Friday that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion. The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed , without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.” In response, the ISPR said in its statement that the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”. It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia. The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.” May conflict The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles , artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people , before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale . New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command , that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India. The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army. The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.",

Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the escalation,  and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”. “The way the public opinion in India turned against the government after the worst defeat in history, and the way [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and his group have lost their reputation, it is apparent from their statements that they [are feeling] the pressure,” Asif added. “This time, God willing, India will get buried under the rubble of its own jets,” the minister asserted. ‘Cataclysmic devastation’ Asif’s remarks come a day after the military warned that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and Pakistan would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) came in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in case of a fresh round of hostilities. “In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,” the ISPR said. Indian media outlet NDTV reported on Friday that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion. The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed , without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.” In response, the ISPR said in its statement that the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”. It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia. The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.” May conflict The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles , artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people , before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale . New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command , that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India. The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army. The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Security forces killed 14 terrorists of the Indian proxy group Fitna al-Hindustan in an operation conducted in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district on Saturday. The state designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Security officials said the forces launched the operation on the basis of intelligence reports about the presence of the group’s militants in the mountainous area of Zehri tehsil. According to the officials, the area was cordoned off before the action was launched. Heavy firing took place between the security forces and the terrorists, which continued for several hours. “As many as 14 terrorists were killed in the gun battle, while 20 others were injured,” the officials said, adding that a large quantity of arms, ammunition, and other equipment was seized from their possession. The Zehri operation, they added, was carried out days after security forces killed seven India-sponsored terrorists in an intelligence-based operation in Sherani district of Balochistan. They said several hideouts established by the militants in the mountainous terrain were destroyed during the operation. “Residents of the Zehri area praised the operation, acknowledging the efforts of the security forces in restoring peace and order to the region, which had been disturbed for a long time,” the officials said, adding that the terrorists had been harassing and blackmailing local residents. Officials reaffirmed that the security forces remain fully committed to elimina­ting the remaining milita­nts of Fitna al-Hindustan. On Oct 1, security forces had killed 13 other alleged terrorists in separate operations in Quetta and Kech districts of Makran. The operation in Aghbarg, on the outskirts of Quetta, was conducted a day after a car suicide attack on the headquarters of Frontier Corps (North) that claimed 10 lives, including four security personnel, and left 33 others injured. Security forces foiled the attackers’ attempt to enter the FC headquarters and killed all five terrorists. FIR registered Meanwhile, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Balochistan Police has registered an FIR against the terrorists involved in the car suicide attack outside the FC headquarters and has lau­nched an investigation. Official sources said the CTD has identified two terrorists who were killed by security forces as they attempted to enter the FC headquarters. According to CTD sources, one of the terrorists belonged to the Mazai Adha area of Qila Abdullah district, bordering Afghanistan, and was identified as Sharifullah. The other terrorist was a resident of Chagai district, but his name has not yet been established. Sources said CTD officials, along with other investigators, have been questioning Sharifullah’s family members. “The terrorist from Mazai Adha was also wanted by security forces in Karachi for his involvement in a previous terrorist attack there,” an official said. Investigators have also approached the family of the other terrorist from Chagai. Security officials said the CTD identified both terrorists with the help of Nadra’s fingerprint records. “The remains of the other terrorists killed in the gun battle with security forces have been sent to the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore for analysis,” the official added. Meanwhile, security forces have sealed the area where the FC headquarters is located. Buildings badly damaged by the powerful explosions have also been sealed, and no one is being allowed to enter to access their offices. The offices of Daily Mashriq and the private TV channel HUM were among those badly damaged and have been sealed by security forces. Heavy traffic congestion was reported on several key roads due to the closure of routes passing near the FC headquarters. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

The incident occurred during a protest by journalists and demonstrators from Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), some of whom were reportedly fleeing from police action when officers stormed into the club. A joint action committee has been formed that includes all key media associations and various factions of the NPC. In its first meeting headed by the acting NPC president Ehteshamul Haq, the action committee was given the mandate to prepare a charter of demands. The chairmanship of the committee was unanimously handed over to NPC President Azhar Jatoi, while Nayar Ali was given the responsibility of its secretary. The committee members include President PFUJ Afzal Butt, President RIUJ Tariq Virk, President PFUJ (Dastur) Haji Nawaz Raza, President RIUJ (Dastur) Rana Kausar Ali, President PFUJ (Workers) Sadia Kamal and Javed Malik, Secretary General PFUJ (Rana Azeem Group) Shakeel Ahmed, President RIUJ (Rana Azeem Group) Tariq Usmani, President Azad Group Shakeel Qarar and Mehboobur Rehman Tanoli, President Parliamentary Reporters Association M.B. Soomro and General Secretary Naveed Akbar. The members of the committee will forward their suggestions for preparing a charter of demands against the police action on the press club, so that no such act takes place in future. Meanwhile, the acting president NPC said that they were discussing the situation with other press clubs and with their coordination a strategy will be devised. “The most important point is that we do not want any such action at any press club anywhere in the country,” he added. The leader of Azad Panel Shakeel Qarar said: “We have suggested that a notification be issued to the federal and provincial governments that in future the police or any law enforcement agency will not be allowed to enter any press club even after prior permission.” He added that an inquiry should be conducted by an officer of interior ministry and people from the ruling and opposition parties.

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Just a day before leaving for Malaysia on a two-day official visit , Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his elder brother and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on Saturday and discussed with him the ‘ growing tensions ’ between the PPP and PML-N, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers. The meeting that took place at their Jati Umra residence covered governance issues, including the ongoing acrimony with the PPP-led Sindh government over flood and canal issues. “The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn. The source said PM Shehbaz wanted his elder brother to speak to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and convince her “to let go and reconcile with the PPP”. He said the premier “urged Nawaz Sharif to ask Maryam Nawaz to adopt a reconciliatory approach and end the ongoing acrimony with the PPP leadership over flood and canal issues. Shehbaz, Dar to leave for Malaysia today “Nawaz Sharif was also briefed on the PPP’s grievances over administrative and development-related matters, with both leaders agreeing that unity within the coalition was essential to sustain the government’s stability.” However, in its official statement, the PML-N said the prime minister briefed the party chief on his recent foreign visits and provided a detailed update on the situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including the outcome of successful negotiations with the protesters. The war of words between the two coalition partners began over flood compensation , expanded to water rights on the Indus River (six canals issue). Maryam Nawaz told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself, while the latter had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sessions to protest her diatribe and demanded apology from her. However, CM Maryam declared she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst over flood and canal issues. As the tensions escalated further, the PPP publicly repeated Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) allegations that Maryam Nawaz did not represent the people of Punjab stating that her government was a “by product of Form 47”. PPP’s central information secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan said Maryam Nawaz, who called those raising public issues ‘the enemies of Punjab’, was herself the real problem of Punjab. “The CM Punjab is demonstrating racist thinking to hide her failure to save the people from floodwaters,” he remarked. PM’s Malaysia visit Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz would leave for Malaysia for a two-day visit at the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim from Oct 5 to 7, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday. The FO said PM Shehbaz, Foreign Minister and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, federal ministers and senior government officials will depart for Malaysia on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” it added. A PML-N statement said Mr Ibrahim had also extended an invitation to party chief and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif to visit Malaysia, but he said he would consider the visit at a more suitable time.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The import of used cars in Pakistan is much higher than its regional peers and other countries. However, different countries have implemented various strategies to balance consumer demand, environmental concerns, and industrial priorities. Experiences from India, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines provide practical insights. Measures such as age limits, pre-export inspections, phased implementation, fiscal incentives, and administrative controls can guide Pakistan in maintaining quality, safeguarding the environment, and balancing consumer access with industrial protection. As per a report of the Institute of Cost and Management (ICMA), Pakistan’s average import of used cars per year stood at 34,000 units followed by 21,802 by Thailand, 532 by Vietnam and 235 units by India. Bangladesh permits the import of used cars under specific conditions to balance consumer demand with quality control and revenue generation. As of June 2025, vehicles must be no more than four years old, imported directly from the country of origin, and accompanied by a previous registration or de-registration certificate. The importation process involves customs duties, VAT, and mandatory inspections to ensure compliance with national standards. Neighbours curb influx of old vehicles through age caps and safety checks Sri Lanka lifted its five-year ban on private car and motorcycle imports in February 2025, allowing personal use vehicle imports under specific conditions. Individuals are permitted to import one vehicle per year, provided they use a registered vehicle importer. This phased reopening aims to stabilise the market and manage foreign exchange reserves while meeting consumer demand. India enforces stringent regulations on the importation of used vehicles to protect its domestic automotive industry and ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards. As of 2024, used vehicles must be under three years old, right-hand drive, and meet specific engine capacity restrictions. The import ­process involves extensive documentation, high import duties (up to 125pc for used cars), and mandatory compliance testing. Additionally, a minimum ­roadworthiness period of five years is required from the date of ­importation. Kenya has implemented a controlled liberalisation approach to used car imports, aiming to balance affordability with environmental and safety considerations. As of July 2025, only vehicles manufactured from July 2018 onward are eligible for import, effectively enforcing a rolling seven-year age limit. This policy is designed to improve air quality, reduce reliance on older vehicles, and support local vehicle assembly. Importers must comply with pre-export inspection requirements and domestic roadworthiness certification. South Africa restricts used car imports to protect its domestic automotive manufacturing sector. Importation is generally allowed only under specific circumstances, such as for returning nationals or immigrants with permanent residence status. These individuals may import one vehicle per family, subject to compliance with import duties and VAT. The importation process requires obtaining a permit and adhering to documentation requirements. Nigeria has tightened its used vehicle import regulations to reduce the influx of older, potentially polluting cars. As of May 2025, only vehicles manufactured in 2015 or later are eligible for import without facing punitive duties. Vehicles older than 10 years are either barred or subjected to heavy import penalties. The import process requires specific documentation, including a bill of lading, bill of entry, marine insurance, and evidence of VAT payment. In the Philippines, only qualified individuals may import used vehicles, and they must secure a Certificate of Authority to Import (CAI) from the Fair-Trade Enforcement Bureau (FTEB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) before the actual importation. Imported vehicles are subject to a 40pc customs duty, 10pc VAT, and an ad valorem tax ranging from 15pc to 100pc, depending on the vehicle’s piston displacement. In the early 1990s, commercial imports of cars were largely prohibited to protect local assemblers. This resulted in fewer cars in the market, higher prices, and limited options for buyers. In the early 2000s, growing demand for affordable cars led the government to allow imports under special schemes such as the Gift Scheme, Baggage Scheme, and Transfer of Residence Scheme, mainly for overseas Pakistanis. While these cars were meant for personal use, many entered the local market through dealers. Consumers gained more choice and prices dropped slightly, but local carmakers protested, saying these imports hurt their sales and investment. In 2,005, the government reduced duties, making it easier to import used cars. Consumers accessed small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars, and imports rose quickly. By 2,008, local carmakers lobbied for tighter restrictions, leading to increased duties and a lower age limit for imports. This reduced imports and strengthened local manufacturer protection. In 2012, the maximum age of imported used cars was cut from five years to three years, sharply reducing inflows. Simultaneously, the Automotive Development Policy (ADP) encouraged investment in local assembly. Some new entrants joined, but car prices remained high and choice limited. During 2012-2020s, ongoing push and pull consumers continued to complain about high prices, limited choice, and lower safety standards than regional peers. Industry groups warned that too many imports could reduce local investment, slow parts production, and increase pressure on foreign exchange. The government alternated between relaxing and restricting imports, creating a cycle of\npolicy shifts. In September 2025, the federal government had allowed commercial imports of used cars up to five years old. Duties will be reduced gradually. The policy aims to protect local manufacturers, offer consumers more affordable choices, and ensure imported cars meet safety and environmental standards. This is a key step toward a more balanced automotive market. Passenger vehicles under five years old can be imported commercially until June 30, 2026. A 40pc regulatory duty applies in the first year, reducing by 10pc each year until it reaches zero by FY30. This phased approach helps balance consumer benefits with protection for local manufacturers. All imported vehicles must meet safety and emission standards, ensuring that older, unsafe, or inefficient vehicles do not enter the market. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
