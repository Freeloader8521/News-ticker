      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday said that the people of PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were living in the stone age, critising the province’s government for not taking steps for development in the age of technology. Addressing a laptop distribution scheme at a Gujrat university, CM Maryam highlighted that students in Punjab had access to Honhaar scholarships , laptop schemes, Parwaz Card , green buses and technical training programmes. “So there is Honhaar here, and incitement there, but this is nothing to rejoice about,” she said, adding that she was extremely upset that the “people of KP were still living in the stone age”. Maryam stated: “They do not know what development is. They do not realise that Honhaar scholarships also exist if one does not have the resources for their child’s studies. “They do not know that you must have a gadget or a laptop or an iPad or a computer in your hands if you are to meet global standards in today’s age.” Indirectly noting that the PTI had been in power in KP for the past “13 years”, she said the public there “does not even know what development is”. The chief minister quipped that the KP government’s response to every need was that it was providing them “awareness”. Maryam emphasised that blocking major roads in KP did not affect the businesses in Punjab but rather the economic activity of KP itself. During her address, Maryam also recalled the time when her mother Kulsoom Nawaz was hospitalised due to cancer in 2017 and 2018 , as well as when her father and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif was ill during his imprisonment in 2019. Noting that Nawaz was in his 70s when he was jailed, the Punjab CM said, “He got sick after multiple heart attacks and his platelets dropped. He had cardiac pain [but] such a joke was made out of his ailment.” She continued: “When my father and I were in jail, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and her disease was ridiculed so much; it was even said that she was not sick and it is all a drama.” Maryam then recalled that Kulsoom was on a ventilator in a London hospital when certain individuals “ entered the ICU through deception by wearing doctors’ uniforms to verify whether it was true or false”. “When my mother passed away, my father said, ‘One has to die to prove their innocence here’,” she said, adding that she was in a jail cell when Nawaz informed her about Kulsoom’s death. The PML-N leader then played some old video clips of ex-premier Imran Khan from when he was in power. In the clips, the PTI founder threatened to get the TV and air conditioner removed from the prisons of the PML-N leadership. Maryam asserted: “I am swearing by God that till today, neither I nor Nawaz Sharif or Shehbaz Sharif even thought of removing his AC or shutting off his food and TV. “In fact, Nawaz Sharif said one day that he (Imran) has one AC, give him two ACs as he should not face any problems.” She further said she was the “first woman” to be locked in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) jail and a cell had to be vacated for her as they did not have a dedicated women’s prison. The Punjab CM then played another video of ex-PM Imran, wherein he commented on the “long list” of health issues Nawaz was facing. “You can have differences on policies and policies, but you cannot turn political disagreements into personal enmities,” Maryam emphasised. “My children, you must never do this,” she told the audience, referring to the actions taken by the PTI government of jailing PML-N leadership and “making fun” of the ailments. “The time circles back, but my father was telling me at dinner the other day to never wish bad for even one’s political opponents,” she said. “You all must not do what he or his party is doing,” the politician stressed. “Those who are ill, we pray that God may give them recovery soon,” she added. Speaking on Imran’s current health issues , Maryam said, “The kind of facilities and the doctors he needs are being provided to him, and I am telling you this on oath that no one wishes ill for him.” She called for lies, accusations, incitement, vandalism and fitna to be “thrown out” of politics.",

Maryam asserted: “I am swearing by God that till today, neither I nor Nawaz Sharif or Shehbaz Sharif even thought of removing his AC or shutting off his food and TV. “In fact, Nawaz Sharif said one day that he (Imran) has one AC, give him two ACs as he should not face any problems.” She further said she was the “first woman” to be locked in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) jail and a cell had to be vacated for her as they did not have a dedicated women’s prison. The Punjab CM then played another video of ex-PM Imran, wherein he commented on the “long list” of health issues Nawaz was facing. “You can have differences on policies and policies, but you cannot turn political disagreements into personal enmities,” Maryam emphasised. “My children, you must never do this,” she told the audience, referring to the actions taken by the PTI government of jailing PML-N leadership and “making fun” of the ailments. “The time circles back, but my father was telling me at dinner the other day to never wish bad for even one’s political opponents,” she said. “You all must not do what he or his party is doing,” the politician stressed. “Those who are ill, we pray that God may give them recovery soon,” she added. Speaking on Imran’s current health issues , Maryam said, “The kind of facilities and the doctors he needs are being provided to him, and I am telling you this on oath that no one wishes ill for him.” She called for lies, accusations, incitement, vandalism and fitna to be “thrown out” of politics.",

      "summary": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday said that the people of PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were living in the stone age, critising the province’s government for not taking steps for development in the age of technology. Addressing a laptop distribution scheme at a Gujrat university, CM Maryam highlighted that students in Punjab had access to Honhaar scholarships , laptop schemes, Parwaz Card , green buses and technical training programmes. “So there is Honhaar here, and incitement there, but this is nothing to rejoice about,” she said, adding that she was extremely upset that the “people of KP were still living in the stone age”. Maryam stated: “They do not know what development is. They do not realise that Honhaar scholarships also exist if one does not have the resources for their child’s studies. “They do not know that you must have a gadget or a laptop or an iPad or a computer in your hands if you are to meet global standards in today’s age.” Indirectly noting that the PTI had been in power in KP for the past “13 years”, she said the public there “does not even know what development is”. The chief minister quipped that the KP government’s response to every need was that it was providing them “awareness”. Maryam emphasised that blocking major roads in KP did not affect the businesses in Punjab but rather the economic activity of KP itself. During her address, Maryam also recalled the time when her mother Kulsoom Nawaz was hospitalised due to cancer in 2017 and 2018 , as well as when her father and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif was ill during his imprisonment in 2019. Noting that Nawaz was in his 70s when he was jailed, the Punjab CM said, “He got sick after multiple heart attacks and his platelets dropped. He had cardiac pain [but] such a joke was made out of his ailment.” She continued: “When my father and I were in jail, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and her disease was ridiculed so much; it was even said that she was not sick and it is all a drama.” Maryam then recalled that Kulsoom was on a ventilator in a London hospital when certain individuals “ entered the ICU through deception by wearing doctors’ uniforms to verify whether it was true or false”. “When my mother passed away, my father said, ‘One has to die to prove their innocence here’,” she said, adding that she was in a jail cell when Nawaz informed her about Kulsoom’s death. The PML-N leader then played some old video clips of ex-premier Imran Khan from when he was in power. In the clips, the PTI founder threatened to get the TV and air conditioner removed from the prisons of the PML-N leadership. Maryam asserted: “I am swearing by God that till today, neither I nor Nawaz Sharif or Shehbaz Sharif even thought of removing his AC or shutting off his food and TV. “In fact, Nawaz Sharif said one day that he (Imran) has one AC, give him two ACs as he should not face any problems.” She further said she was the “first woman” to be locked in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) jail and a cell had to be vacated for her as they did not have a dedicated women’s prison.

      "summary_orig": "Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Monday allayed concerns over PTI founder Imran Khan’s vision loss, saying that there was “nothing as such to worry about”. The statement comes days after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that Imran had only 15pc vision left in his right eye, prompting the apex court to form a medical team to examine him before February 16 (today). Subsequently, a team of five doctors arrived at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday, where the ex-premier is incarcerated, and carried out a detailed eye examination, took blood samples and checked his blood pressure. However, the PTI rejected the check-up conducted without his family and personal physicians. Addressing Bar Association Ferozewala in Punjab’s Shahdara on Monday, Tarar referred to the “latest report that had to be submitted” regarding Imran’s health. The minister added that he discussed it with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan and the “relevant” individuals before coming to the bar association. Tarar stated: “They said thanks to God, the examination was carried out again on the Supreme Court’s order and there is no such thing about 35 or 25 [per cent]. “If he uses glasses for his eyesight, then one eye is approximately 70pc fine and the other eye is 6/6. There is nothing as such to worry about.” According to the Cleveland Clinic, having 6/6 vision or 20/20 vision means you see the world with normal clarity and sharpness. Before commenting on Imran’s health, Tarar stressed the need to “pay attention to our national issues”. “We took difficult financial decisions, but the fruits of those can be seen now,” he stated, asserting that Pakistan was now “performing way better economically”. The law minister stressed that political stability was crucial for economic stability. “There is a lot of noise these days that what is about happen and what has been done to the PTI founder,” he noted. Addressing the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, Tarar said it was the “first time that a government was taking official measures to deprive the citizens of their rights”. He then referred to the blockades of major roads and KP’s entry and exit points by PTI protests, which have cut off the province from the rest of the country. “Article 15 [of the Constitution] allows freedom of movement, but the blockage of motorways and GT Road on the official level is unconstitutional,” the law minister pointed out. He expressed the hope that the PTI would “rectify” the situation itself after looking at the latest report. “Otherwise, the federal government will have to take some action,” Tarar warned. He further said it was the responsibility of PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, as well as the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, to “ensure that the KP government adheres to the Constitution”. Imran’s physician urges authorities to allow access Meanwhile, Imran’s long-time personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf released a video statement, saying that last night he spoke on the telephone to the two Islamabad-based eye doctors who were treating the ex-premier for his eye condition. He said he asked his colleague, Dr Khurram Azam Mirza, a Lahore-based retinal specialist, to join the phone call. Dr Yusuf said that the phone call lasted 40 minutes, during which the doctors provided a background of when they first examined Imran, what his symptoms were, details of the treatment prescribed and what the future treatment plan. “Their latest assessment was yesterday afternoon … they told us that, in their view, Imran had shown significant improvement as a result of treatment and his vision had improved significantly as well,” he said. “I would be extremely happy if I was able to confirm that this was the case. Unfortunately, because I have not seen him myself and have not been able to participate in his care or talk to him, I am unable to either confirm or deny the veracity of what we have been told,” he said. Dr Yusuf appealed to the authorities to allow him or Dr Faisal Sultan, ideally both of them, and physicians nominated by Imran’s family to examine the ex-premier and participate in his care. He also called for Imran to be treated at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, saying that it was “appropriately equipped and of a suitable standard” for treating the PTI founder. CRVO in Imran’s right eye Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family. Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 10, last week submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living conditions in the prison. In his report, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”. Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6/6 vision in both eyes”. While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying. A medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC. It stated that a qualified ophthalmologist from Pims conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiala jail of Imran and a “diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made”. This was then followed by Imran undergoing medical treatment at Pims. The ex-premier’s family and the PTI have been demanding that he be moved to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital for a comprehensive check-up, with the opposition even staging a sit-in at Parliament House for the past four days.",

      "summary_orig": "My travelogue has had a recent makeover. The itinerary now insists on including clean bathrooms, feeding areas, and a prospective diaper change station. Even though these recent life developments had me apprehensive to venture back out into the world, I slowly started to identify and appreciate how family-friendly most cities in the world had become when I was not paying attention. It was a bit like that car spotting phenomenon. You know the one where, when you notice a particular brand and model of a car, they start to appear everywhere. Similarly, once I braved back out into the world, I started to realise how much the world had to offer to travelling parents with children. It’s still a work-in-progress, but at least it was much better than what my fears had me convinced. As the first international travel location, my personal preference was to start with a place that was already familiar. I could not look past Thailand. On a global scale, when you do the math for budget, accommodation, food and shopping and build a travel itinerary, I think anyone in any stage in life would find it hard pressed to find a better alternative to Thailand. When you add children to the mix, it becomes even more appealing. Firstly, let’s tackle where to go in Thailand. Bangkok or one of the islands, or both? I would recommend Bangkok as the first stop to ease into the holiday season with modern facilities and an endless supply of 7-Elevens for any need at any hour of the day. A couple of days to get your bearings before you shoot off to your island holiday. Although any number of island combinations could work as your first holiday, my recommendation includes two options. One for families with really young children and zero energy to plan or think. Another option for families on the path to recovery is some off the off-the-beaten-track adventures. Let’s go! BKK + Phuket Let’s face it, Bangkok has a reputation. If a certain portrayal in the Hangover movie is to be believed, what would have been its entertaining and exciting prospect pre-children would now terrorise the same adults and make them want to stay away. In my opinion, though, the movie underestimates Bangkok’s diversity and capability to segregate trouble and keep it tied to specific locations only. Most of this city actually offers a safe passage to most on a quick stopover, as also indicated by female solo travellers, marking it as one of the safer cities that can be enjoyed on your own. I place tremendous value on female and marginalised lenses on travel, especially when it comes to safety. With that in mind, let’s scope out the general must-sees! Wherever you start in Bangkok, and I do hope you can find a suitable accommodation as close to the Nana MRT as possible, as most attractions pan out from that area. I would start my day by purchasing an MRT ticket, get off at Asok and make my way to Terminal 21, a more spread-out shopping mall. The various exits also offer additional walking time while staying within air-conditioned zones, an important requirement on your first day, to acclimatise. The food options inside the mall are also varied and include some of the best hygienic dessert options. If you are like me and cannot walk inside a mall without some kind of bubble, boba or sago drink in hand, then look no further and head straight to YenlyYours in Terminal 21. This is an absolute mango heaven! Besides its smoothies and floats, the dessert options include mango sticky rice, of course, but also the lesser-promoted “treasures” such as mango mochi, mango cheese tart, and mango crepe. Once you have checked mango off your list, move on to Pier 21 for a pad Thai with prawn wrapped in egg. If you are a pram-pushing daredevil, by all means tick off the mandatory locations such as Khao San Road, the Floating Market and Arab Street; all the more power to you! However, if you would like to play it safe on your first trip while continuing to partake in the best of the city, I would suggest an alternate route to old BKK. Rattanakosin is the historic heart of Bangkok. Most people associate it with all the Wats or temples it has to offer, but for me, this is where the real hidden charm of Bangkok lies, like the old parts of most cities, I suppose, being the source of origin. The bank of the Chao Phraya is magical, and the cafes and restaurants lining this part of the city are unforgettable. Each restaurant has a history and old photographs you can peruse while you eat. A full day spent in this part of Bangkok, traversing between the many Wats, ferried across in one of the canal boats and ending the day, watching the sunset from the Eagle Nest rooftop, can easily make one forget about the chaos of the city centre. Once you and your baby have recovered from the flight, it’s time for island hopping! A scenic view from a beach in Phuket.  — Mike Swigunski / Unsplash via The Daily Star Phuket I chose Phuket because, whilst there are plenty of other secluded islands that can offer an experience a thousand times better than here, it is the sheer convenience of Phuket that I find unmatchable. Here, you don’t have to forego the natural beauty to satisfy comfort. Nearly all resorts are built to attract families with children. You can choose any number of resorts along that coastline, whether it be Centara, Marriott, or Holiday Inn, suiting your budget; you are guaranteed a world within a world. With a variety of children’s activities offered through the kids’ clubs, several splash pools and most restaurants catering to children, some offering freshly prepared meals specific to toddlers, whilst tired mummies are whisked away for the perfect foot massage or backrub next to the ocean, this is the family holiday we all deserve. Whilst I have been busy blowing Phuket’s horn, the memory of another island begs to be mentioned. This is Koh Lanta, where I had once disappeared to during a challenging work assignment and had left after a couple of days feeling like a new person. This island feels like being cradled into nature’s arms like no other, ushering in peace, tranquillity and safety. Please look it up if that’s the need of the hour. Otherwise, the newly reenergised army of parents, look this way with your slightly older kids, for an adventure away to Chiang Mai! Wat Chiang Man, the oldest temple in Chiang Mai, Thailand. —  Cheese Yang / Unsplash via The Daily Star Chiang Mai Head to the Elephant Parade with your kiddy entourage and learn the story about the father and son duo, who brought this place into existence when they fell in love with a certain baby elephant called Mosha during their holiday in Thailand. Have you heard of cocoon farms, no? Then your next stop should be to the Thai Silk Village for a hands-on workshop on silk weaving. A visit to Chiang Mai is not complete without at least a day spent at Baan Kang Wat, a tucked away art village, yes, guilty as charged — also in the Old Town streets of Chiang Mai. Every inch of this place is Instagram-worthy and one of the best family day outs you can have. While the kiddos can enjoy a painting workshop, you can take your tired feet across for a cup of joe and a slice of cake at Graph. If you happen to peek inside one of the art studios, coffee in hand, some of the artists might let you watch as they work. If you are anything like me, an out-and-out urban parent, Chiang Mai also offers a wonderful opportunity at glamping! You have heard me right, this is the newest stage in your camping journey, for those who are taken by the idea without being equipped with the logistics (and let’s face it, the guts!) that camping demands. Once you have had your fair share of café hopping, night markets and kayaking adventures, you might want to end your trip by taking a stroll to the Thapae Gate of the Old City Walls to take to the shores of the Ping River to watch thousands of people release their krathongs or paper-based lanterns into the water. Alternatively, arrange for a day-trip to Nong Bua Pra Chao Luang lotus lake to watch thousands do the same, but in this case, releasing the lanterns into the sky, and totally for free!

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained cut off from rest of the country on Sunday as activists of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf continued their protest on third consecutive day and blocked all entry and exit points of the province. The PTI activists have blocked Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway. Protesters remained present all the time at exit and entry points and did not allow a single vehicle to enter the province, causing serious problems to passengers and motorists destined to Islamabad and other parts of the country. Former governor Shah Farman, PTI Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem, deputy secretary information Ikram Khattana and other leaders of the party were present at Khairabad Bridge, connecting Attock district of Punjab with KP. Commuters, motorists face hardships Protesters have been demanding of the government to shift PTI founder Imran Khan from jail to hospital for treatment of his eye by doctors of his choice. Speaking on the occasion, Shah Farman said that under Article-4 of the Constitution, no authority could deny treatment of his choice to a patient. He said that the people, who were not allowing treatment of Imran Khan through doctors of his choice, would be responsible if his eye was further damaged. PTI workers blocked Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway near Swabi Interchange to all types of traffic, vowing to stay on roads till Imran Khan was shifted to hospital for medical treatment. Vendors were seen selling various eatables while setting up stalls on motorway, converting it into a market. PTI Swabi general secretary Afsar Khan told journalists that they were not ready to go back homes under any circumstances. “We will continue to sit here and if our demand is not accepted. This protest will continue. The federal government is responsible for the prevailing mess in the country,” he said. Stranded commuters said that government should take action against PTI workers to open the motorway to traffic because people, especially patients, were facing difficulties. “Where should we go, who should we beg, who should we ask and who should we request to open the motorway,” questioned Shahzad Khan, a resident of Peshawar. Uzair Khan, a resident of Gundam who was seriously injured in a firing incident on Saturday, was not allowed to reach a hospital in Peshawar through motorway. The circumstances forced his family to pass through Swabi and Mardan but he did not reach hospital and passed away. His relatives said that PTI workers were responsible for his death. During the last three days, it has been observed, that there is no rush at daytime at the venue of protest. In the afternoon youth start to arrive at rest area and in the evening there is a lot of crowd on motorway. PTI workers blocked roads at four key points in Dera Ismail Khan district on Sunday, suspending traffic and causing inconvenience to commuters and motorists. The sit-ins were held on Bhakkar Road, Multan Road, Chashma Road and CPEC route, bringing vehicular movement to a standstill at these locations. As a result, long queues of vehicles were seen on major arteries. Witnesses said that several commuters remained stranded for hours, while alternative routes also experienced heavy congestion due to diverted traffic. The protest is being held on the call of PTI central leaders, who have urged workers to demonstrate over the deteriorating health of Imran Khan and demand his immediate release. The district administration was monitoring the situation while residents called for restoration of traffic flow to ease their hardships. PTI activists continued protest demonstrations in Lakki Marwat and Karak districts on the second consecutive day on Sunday. A good number of party workers led by former district nazim Ishfaq Ahmad Khan Minakhel gathered at Darra Tang Point where they closed Bannu-Mianwali road, linking KP with Punjab and Islamabad via CPEC route. The closure of road on the second consecutive day troubled transporters and commuters as passenger and good transport vehicles queued up on both sides of the main artery. On the occasion, the former district nazim said that denial of access to healthcare and maltreatment by federal government had led to loss of Imran’s vision. He said that PTI activists had come on roads to hold peaceful protests against the PML-N government, which was responsible for the poor health of their party leader. In Karak, the PTI workers gathered outside Nashapa oil and gas field and staged a sit-in there. They stopped supply from the oil and gas field as oil tankers could not enter or come out of the area. An official of district administration confirmed disruption of oil supply from the field. PTI district president Inayat Khattak said that leaders and workers of the party decided in a meeting to shut down oil and gas fields in Makori, Nashapa and Gurguri to record their protest against non-provision of treatment facilities to Imran Khan.

The PTI activists have blocked Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway. Protesters remained present all the time at exit and entry points and did not allow a single vehicle to enter the province, causing serious problems to passengers and motorists destined to Islamabad and other parts of the country. Former governor Shah Farman, PTI Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem, deputy secretary information Ikram Khattana and other leaders of the party were present at Khairabad Bridge, connecting Attock district of Punjab with KP. Commuters, motorists face hardships Protesters have been demanding of the government to shift PTI founder Imran Khan from jail to hospital for treatment of his eye by doctors of his choice. Speaking on the occasion, Shah Farman said that under Article-4 of the Constitution, no authority could deny treatment of his choice to a patient. He said that the people, who were not allowing treatment of Imran Khan through doctors of his choice, would be responsible if his eye was further damaged. PTI workers blocked Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway near Swabi Interchange to all types of traffic, vowing to stay on roads till Imran Khan was shifted to hospital for medical treatment. Vendors were seen selling various eatables while setting up stalls on motorway, converting it into a market. PTI Swabi general secretary Afsar Khan told journalists that they were not ready to go back homes under any circumstances. “We will continue to sit here and if our demand is not accepted. This protest will continue. The federal government is responsible for the prevailing mess in the country,” he said. Stranded commuters said that government should take action against PTI workers to open the motorway to traffic because people, especially patients, were facing difficulties. “Where should we go, who should we beg, who should we ask and who should we request to open the motorway,” questioned Shahzad Khan, a resident of Peshawar. Uzair Khan, a resident of Gundam who was seriously injured in a firing incident on Saturday, was not allowed to reach a hospital in Peshawar through motorway. The circumstances forced his family to pass through Swabi and Mardan but he did not reach hospital and passed away. His relatives said that PTI workers were responsible for his death. During the last three days, it has been observed, that there is no rush at daytime at the venue of protest. In the afternoon youth start to arrive at rest area and in the evening there is a lot of crowd on motorway. PTI workers blocked roads at four key points in Dera Ismail Khan district on Sunday, suspending traffic and causing inconvenience to commuters and motorists. The sit-ins were held on Bhakkar Road, Multan Road, Chashma Road and CPEC route, bringing vehicular movement to a standstill at these locations. As a result, long queues of vehicles were seen on major arteries. Witnesses said that several commuters remained stranded for hours, while alternative routes also experienced heavy congestion due to diverted traffic. The protest is being held on the call of PTI central leaders, who have urged workers to demonstrate over the deteriorating health of Imran Khan and demand his immediate release. The district administration was monitoring the situation while residents called for restoration of traffic flow to ease their hardships. PTI activists continued protest demonstrations in Lakki Marwat and Karak districts on the second consecutive day on Sunday. A good number of party workers led by former district nazim Ishfaq Ahmad Khan Minakhel gathered at Darra Tang Point where they closed Bannu-Mianwali road, linking KP with Punjab and Islamabad via CPEC route. The closure of road on the second consecutive day troubled transporters and commuters as passenger and good transport vehicles queued up on both sides of the main artery. On the occasion, the former district nazim said that denial of access to healthcare and maltreatment by federal government had led to loss of Imran’s vision. He said that PTI activists had come on roads to hold peaceful protests against the PML-N government, which was responsible for the poor health of their party leader. In Karak, the PTI workers gathered outside Nashapa oil and gas field and staged a sit-in there. They stopped supply from the oil and gas field as oil tankers could not enter or come out of the area. An official of district administration confirmed disruption of oil supply from the field. PTI district president Inayat Khattak said that leaders and workers of the party decided in a meeting to shut down oil and gas fields in Makori, Nashapa and Gurguri to record their protest against non-provision of treatment facilities to Imran Khan.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Roads leading to the Parliament House were cleared on Monday morning as the PTI and opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP)’s sit-in over Imran’s health entered its fourth day. The sit-in, which began on Friday, was announced hours after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting a strong response from the opposition alliance. TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Yousafzai, speaking to Dawn , said it was a surprising step that all the routes had been cleared. On Friday, roads leading to Parliament House were blocked ahead of the sit-in. “First of all, we are going to have breakfast after four days, as previously we were eating only dates and biscuits and were being forced to drink tap water. It has been decided to merge the sit-in at the Parliament lodges with the one at Parliament House,” he said. The opposition’s sit-in was initially held at three places, including the Parliament House, led by TTAP head Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. The protest outside the Parliament lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, KP CM Sohail Afridi led the demonstration. “Moreover, as the government is going to file a report regarding Imran Khan’s health in the Supreme Court, we will examine it and will take a further decision,” Yousafzai told Dawn. Yousafzai stated that the sit-in was going to continue until all demands were accepted by the government. On Sunday, a team of doctors examined the PTI founder at Adiala Jail and left the premises after around an hour, sources said. The party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”. Speaking to reporters earlier on Sunday, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital. “We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party. “We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. Moreover, we have also decided to approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday to get justice and the right to medical treatment for Imran,” he told Dawn . A TTAP leader, speaking on condition of anonymity on Sunday, said they had been told the previous night that Imran would be shifted to Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, but later received messages suggesting the sit-in should be called off first. The TTAP had also alleged that access to food, water and medicines had been blocked for protesters inside Parliament House for a third consecutive day, a day earlier, calling it a violation of democratic and constitutional values.",

      "summary_orig": "On the banks of Manchhar Lake, near Jhangara, stands the dargah [shrine] of Ghaaib Pir, a saint whose name evokes disappearance, invisibility and passage into the unseen. In Sindhi and South Asian Sufi traditions, ghaaib does not simply mean absence, it refers to that which has slipped beyond human perception, into a realm that exists but is no longer accessible. Saints associated with the ghaaib phenomenon are believed not to have died in the conventional sense, but to have withdrawn quietly and mysteriously from the material world. Manchhar Lake itself is now in the process of becoming ghaaib and, consequently, so are the Mohanna people who live on it. Once Pakistan’s largest freshwater lake and a shimmering expanse of sustenance and song, Manchhar Lake’s waters expanded and contracted with the seasons, swelling to over 250 square kilometres during the monsoon and retreating in the drier months. Fed by hill torrents from the Kirthar range and freshwater flows from the Indus, the lake functioned as a natural reservoir that sustained fish, birds, reeds and people. But now, its waters are increasingly saline and toxic, no longer signifying abundance. “This lake raised us,” says Mai Jindan, a Mohanna woman seated on the edge of her houseboat. “Our mothers washed babies in its water. Our fathers cast their nets at dawn. Now we tell our children not to touch it.” Once a pristine freshwater lake, home to the thriving Mohanna fishing community and their houseboats, Manchhar Lake is now polluted and toxic due to decades of state neglect. As the lake grows increasingly inhospitable, the dwindling Mohanna culture of the lake creeps closer and closer towards extinction. While efforts, such as those by NED’s Heritage Cell, are underway to preserve the Mohanna way of life, can the lake that sustains it still be saved? For generations, the Mohannas lived not beside Manchhar but within it. Their houseboats, known as galiyo, approximately 38 feet long and 10 feet wide, formed floating villages that drifted with the seasons, clustering and dispersing according to water levels, fish movements and the wind. Children learned to swim before they learned to walk properly, because water was their first language. For these indigenous fisherfolk, the boats were homes, workplaces and social spaces. A Mohanna man pictured with a bird he has captured: hunting birds is a routine way to pass time at Manchhar Lake, but migratory birds now arrive in far fewer numbers | Mohammad Ali/White Star The Mohanna life has long been centred around three seasons: sawan (monsoon: July-September), machhi maran (fishing season: October-March) and sukkal (dry season: April-June). Oral historians among the Mohannas, often referred to as the “Bird People”, recall ancestral fishing grounds by name, particular bends in the lake where certain fish would gather, or seasons when birds arrived so densely that the sky itself appeared to darken. Manchhar was a cultural landscape, shaped through intimate knowledge and reciprocal care. Over 200 species of freshwater fish were recorded here in the mid-20th century. Tens of thousands of migratory birds — pelicans, ducks, cormorants and egrets— arrived each winter. Reeds grew thick along the edges, providing material for mats, shelters and boats. Fishing techniques were refined over generations, sometimes involving trained birds. Time itself was organised not by calendars but by water levels, fish migrations and monsoon winds. The lake taught the Mohannas where to move, when to wait and when to leave. In this way, Manchhar functioned as both classroom and archive, holding generations of ecological intelligence that never entered official records. “The lake was our market, our school, our mosque,” recalls Ghulam Mustafa Mirbahar, a Mohanna elder. “Everything we needed came from it.” But now, due to Manchhar Lake’s reduced freshwater inflows and increased toxicity, the Mohannas are under threat — much like the lake itself. In an article titled ‘How a Polluted Lake is Endangering Life in and Around It’ published in Dawn’s Herald magazine in September 2018, Namrah Zafar Moti quotes a Mohanna fisherman who recalled that, around 14 years earlier (circa 2004), there were nearly 2,000 houseboats on the lake. The Mohannas, whose lives were inseparable from the water, are now disappearing from it, pushed ashore by necessity rather than choice. At present, around 375 people, comprising 65 families, continue to live on Manchhar Lake. The number of galiyos has now dwindled to just 44. Migratory birds also still arrive, but in fewer numbers. “When ecosystems collapse,” one Mohanna elder observes, “even flight changes.” This is a slow disappearance that has been unfolding over decades. And, like Ghaaib Pir’s disappearance, it is happening in plain sight. Boats parked at the western edge of Manchhar Lake: due to Manchhar Lake’s reduced freshwater inflows and increased toxicity, the Mohannas are under threat — much like the lake itself |Mohammad Ali/White Star MANCHHAR LAKE’S HISTORY OF NEGLECT Located about 18 kilometres west of Sehwan Sharif in Sindh, Manchhar Lake spreads to the foot of the Kirthar mountain range. Historically, Manchhar’s health depended on regular freshwater inflows from the Indus River and hill torrents. This natural flushing kept salinity low and ecosystems resilient. But over the last two centuries, a series of interventions began to sever these lifelines. Following the introduction and expansion of the railway system during British rule in the Subcontinent, there was a reduced reliance on river navigation, diminishing the traditional role of the Mohannas as riverine transporters. Later on, the building of the Sukkur Barrage in 1923 and the Kotri Barrage in 1955 across the Indus obstructed natural river routes, making navigation difficult and disrupting traditional water-based livelihoods. While these projects expanded agriculture elsewhere through their tightly controlled irrigation channels, they reduced the freshwater reaching Manchhar, altering its chemistry and seasonal rhythms. Yet, the most devastating blow came with the introduction of large-scale drainage schemes intended to carry saline and wastewater away from agricultural lands and urban centres. The Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD), started in 1980, was designed to divert polluted water safely to the sea. Instead, due to chronic delays, incomplete infrastructure and poor regulation, it began disgorging untreated industrial effluent, municipal sewage, pesticides and fertilisers directly into Manchhar Lake. As freshwater inflows declined and toxic discharges increased, Manchhar’s natural flushing mechanisms failed. Salinity increased, fish died, bird populations collapsed or altered their migratory routes altogether and water once drinkable became hazardous to touch. “The water was sweet before,” says the Mohanna Allah Dino Mallah. “You could drink it straight from your hands. But today, even the fish cannot survive in the water.” Sedimentation carried by the drains further reduced the lake’s depth and storage capacity, concentrating pollutants and shrinking habitats. What had once been a vast, dynamic ecosystem became a stagnant basin of contamination. Peeran Mallah, a Mohanna fisherman, says, “We know when the lake is sick. The smell tells us before the tests do.” The damage unfolded incrementally, making it easy to normalise, difficult to reverse and almost impossible to attribute to any single authority. Each intervention framed itself as development while, collectively, they dismantled the lake’s capacity to sustain life. An aerial view of a floating houseboat village on Manchhar Lake: at present, around 65 families continue to live on Manchhar Lake and the number of galiyos [houseboats] has now dwindled to just 44 | Heritage Cell-DAPNED THE MOHANNAS UNDER THREAT For the Mohannas, the consequences were immediate and brutal. Fishing yields fell from thousands of tonnes annually to a fraction of that. Health problems multiplied: skin diseases, respiratory illnesses and waterborne infections became common. With no access to clean water, sanitation, healthcare or consistent schooling, survival itself grew uncertain. Fish, formerly both food and currency, became scarce, small and, often, unsafe to eat. The Mohanna woman Zarina Mallah notes, “When the fish died, everything else followed.” As a result, many families were forced to abandon their floating homes and move ashore, often into informal settlements, where they were neither recognised as landowners nor supported as displaced communities. Hence, cultural identity eroded alongside ecological collapse. Women bore a disproportionate share of this rupture. With declining fish stocks and worsening water quality, domestic labour intensified. Water had to be sourced from farther away, illnesses cared for without medical access, children kept safe in increasingly hostile conditions. For the youngest Mohannas, born into a lake already poisoned, the idea of water as a sustainer rather than a threat is no longer intuitive. Drying fish was once a seasonal rhythm tied to surplus. But now, “the dried fish goes to Karachi and Hyderabad to be turned into poultry feed,” explains Abdul Wahab. “The catch is mostly small fish. This is not what we used to eat.” The disappearance here is incremental — fish by fish, boat by boat, family by family. Among the most fragile survivors of this collapse are the galiyo. Each galiyo is an archive of vernacular design, adaptive architecture and environmental intelligence. Built from local wood and reeds, these boats respond to changing water levels, winds and seasonal temperatures. Their interiors encode social organisation, gendered spaces and everyday rituals. To lose them is not merely to lose shelter but to lose an entire philosophy of dwelling on water. (Left) Newly built houseboats. (Right) A bamboo floating structure built for schooling and community activities | Heritage Cell-DAPNED In architectural terms, the galiyo represent a rare example of climate-responsive design, developed outside formal institutions. Their low freeboard and flexible joints allowed them to adapt to fluctuating water levels long before resilience entered professional vocabulary. To let them disappear would be to erase evidence that sustainable futures can emerge from vernacular knowledge rather than imported models. This very knowledge and way of life is under threat. “Government people come,” says the Mohanna fisherman Sain Bakhsh Mallah. “They take photos and write reports, but the water stays the same.” He says that children still listen to elders recount information and stories about routes, seasons and signs, but many already imagine their lives elsewhere. But, without any formal training or education, what will the lives of the Mohanna youth look like elsewhere? When the Mohannas are displaced on to land, their skills become unreadable to policy, irrelevant to markets and invisible to planning frameworks. What makes this disappearance particularly devastating is that it has unfolded through decisions made elsewhere due to engineering choices, bureaucratic delays and institutional indifference. So what can be done to safeguard the Mohanna community? TRYING TO PRESERVE A WAY OF LIFE The 2024 launch of the UK-Pakistan Cultural Protection Fund (CPF) pilot was an attempt at a holistic intervention that combined the restoration of Manchhar’s remaining houseboats with a deeper commitment to the survival of the community itself. The project ‘Manchhar Lake Mohannas — Safeguarding the Last Surviving Houseboat Village from Extinction’, led by Professor Dr Anila Naeem and Farida Abdul Ghaffar, assistant professor at the Department of Architecture and Planning of Karachi’s NED University (DAPNED), sought to document, conserve and reimagine these floating structures as cultural heritage. Professor Naeem is the chairperson of DAPNED and a heritage conservation specialist. During the first phase of the project, undertaken on an exacting 10-month timeline (April 2024-January 2025), NED’s Heritage Cell team helped repair 44 severely deteriorated houseboats. After undertaking a detailed assessment of the houseboats, a plan for repairs was made. Locals were engaged in boat-building techniques, repairs and maintenance, as the project placed architectural research in dialogue with community knowledge, conservation ethics and environmental advocacy. It was also important to facilitate the community with drinking water and toilet facilities. Skill development and tourism initiatives were piloted to create sustainable income opportunities. Many of these houseboats were close to collapse, with rotting bases and compromised structures that made daily life unsafe. Repairs extended their lifespan by decades, allowing families to remain on water rather than being forced ashore. “If the boats had gone,” one elder says, “we would have gone with them.” (Left) Newly built houseboats. (Right) A bamboo floating structure built for schooling and community activities | Heritage Cell-DAPNED A pilot restoration of Muhammad Ashraf’s houseboat, for example, involved sourcing local wood, carefully cutting it and transporting it to Manchhar Lake under gruelling weather conditions, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees. A rotting base was also replaced, and the houseboat was relaunched with the collective effort of over 50 community members, after a month of painstaking labour and experimentation. This first success restored not only the structure but also community confidence and faith in the project’s promise. Beyond housing, the intervention also addressed urgent health needs. A mobile water filtration unit provided access to safe drinking water in a place where the lake itself had become toxic. Eco-toilets improved sanitation in a community that had long lived without such infrastructure. Solar-powered systems reduced dependence on fuel and external supply lines. Fishing, the economic backbone of Mohanna life, was also supported through the construction of new fishing boats [hurro], replacing those lost to decay. While fish stocks remain depleted, mobility restored some measure of agency, allowing families to continue working rather than abandoning the lake altogether. Children, too, were drawn into the orbit of learning. A temporary learning centre was established, initially operated on newly repaired houseboats, and later shifting to a floating bamboo structure that doubled as a communal space. For families accustomed to displacement, the sight of education taking place on water carries symbolic weight. The second phase of the project (April 2025-January 2026) involved a series of community interactive activities, including tours, workshops and a five-day art residency. It culminated in a performative-curatorial event, ‘Manchhar Lake Mohannas – Sailing Towards Revival’, which framed Manchhar not as a closed chapter but as an unfolding story, foregrounding dialogue and visual narratives from the Mohanna community’s lived realities. Yet even as these changes took hold, their limits were clear. No number of repaired boats or community programmes can neutralise untreated sewage. No water filter can compensate for a lake that no longer flushes itself clean. Tree saplings planted along the Manchhar Bund and a bamboo pavilion offer shade to visitors, but they cannot alter the lake’s chemistry. Heritage tourism pilots create momentary income and visibility, but they remain fragile, dependent on conditions beyond local control. Ultimately, these efforts were holding ground and buying time in a landscape where time has been running out. CAN MANCHHAR BE BROUGHT BACK FROM THE BRINK? The question that hangs over Manchhar now is no longer whether it has been damaged — that reality is visible, measurable and lived daily — but whether it can still be saved. Restoration, in Manchhar’s case, requires a return to first principles: water that moves, water that cleans itself and governance that treats ecological systems as living entities rather than as disposal sites. At the heart of Manchhar’s decline lies the severing of freshwater inflows. For centuries, the lake remained viable because it was periodically flushed by clean water from the Indus and hill torrents. This dilution kept salinity in check and allowed pollutants to disperse. Once that flow was throttled, first by barrages, then by diversions, Manchhar became a terminal basin, receiving waste but unable to release it. Stopping the poisoning, therefore, begins upstream. Untreated industrial effluent and municipal sewage entering the lake through the RBOD and the Main Nara Valley Drain must be intercepted and treated before reaching Manchhar. This is not a technological mystery, as wastewater treatment systems exist and have existed for decades. What has been missing is enforcement, maintenance and political will. Without functional treatment plants and strict regulation of industrial discharge, every other intervention remains cosmetic. Freshwater inflows must also be restored. Environmental flow, water released specifically to sustain ecosystems, is a measurable requirement. Without it, salinity will continue to rise, fish will fail to reproduce and birds will not return in meaningful numbers. Restoring this flow will require coordination between provincial and federal authorities, irrigation departments and environmental agencies — a level of cooperation that has historically been elusive. Sedimentation presents another challenge. Decades of accumulated silt have reduced Manchhar’s depth and storage capacity, intensifying pollution and shrinking habitats. Dredging, combined with the creation of wetlands and sediment traps upstream, could help restore the lake’s ability to hold and cleanse water. Nature-based solutions, such as planting aquatic vegetation that absorb pollutants, offer additional pathways, but only if water quality improves enough to support life. It was hence a welcome sight that, in 2025, the Sindh government partnered with WWF-Pakistan for an $8 million Manchar Lake revival initiative, aimed at combatting rising salinity and pollution in the lake, restoring its ecological balance, reducing environmental threats and uplifting the livelihoods of local communities impacted by the lake’s decline. However, whether or not this endeavour succeeds remains to be seen. Earlier efforts, such as the Supreme Court’s directive in 2017, calling on provincial authorities to ensure regular monitoring and revival of water filtration plants, disposal of solid waste and efforts to control the pollution level in Manchhar Lake, fell on deaf ears. Of course, no meaningful change can be brought without the participation of the people who know the lake best. Community-led monitoring, where Mohanna observations are treated as important data rather than anecdotes, could transform how the lake is managed. Their knowledge of seasonal changes, fish behaviour and water conditions represents an archive of environmental intelligence that no satellite image can replace. SAILING INTO AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE Manchhar’s crisis is not an isolated failure. Across Sindh, other water bodies are showing the same early symptoms of reduced inflows, untreated waste, creeping salinity and ecological thinning. Haleji Lake and Keenjhar Lake, both critical sources of drinking water and once-thriving ecosystems, face mounting pressure from pollution and over-extraction. They are displaying warning signs that are similar to what Manchhar Lake has experienced. If lessons are not learned here, they will be repeated — lake by lake, creek by creek — until disappearance becomes the default outcome of water governance. By extension, Mohanna culture can only be preserved if stringent measures are taken to rehabilitate Manchhar Lake. The reality is that one of Pakistan’s most vibrant indigenous communities has long had a sword dangling over both their means of livelihood and way of life. If targeted efforts are not made to safeguard the Mohanna community and the well-being of Manchhar Lake, both the lake and the community that resides on it will become another permanent victim of Pakistan’s wounded ecology. The question, then, is not whether Manchhar will become ghaaib. The question is whether disappearance will once again be explained as inevitability rather than consequence.

      "summary_en": "On the banks of Manchhar Lake, near Jhangara, stands the dargah [shrine] of Ghaaib Pir, a saint whose name evokes disappearance, invisibility and passage into the unseen. In Sindhi and South Asian Sufi traditions, ghaaib does not simply mean absence, it refers to that which has slipped beyond human perception, into a realm that exists but is no longer accessible. Saints associated with the ghaaib phenomenon are believed not to have died in the conventional sense, but to have withdrawn quietly and mysteriously from the material world. Manchhar Lake itself is now in the process of becoming ghaaib and, consequently, so are the Mohanna people who live on it. Once Pakistan’s largest freshwater lake and a shimmering expanse of sustenance and song, Manchhar Lake’s waters expanded and contracted with the seasons, swelling to over 250 square kilometres during the monsoon and retreating in the drier months. Fed by hill torrents from the Kirthar range and freshwater flows from the Indus, the lake functioned as a natural reservoir that sustained fish, birds, reeds and people. But now, its waters are increasingly saline and toxic, no longer signifying abundance. “This lake raised us,” says Mai Jindan, a Mohanna woman seated on the edge of her houseboat. “Our mothers washed babies in its water. Our fathers cast their nets at dawn. Now we tell our children not to touch it.” Once a pristine freshwater lake, home to the thriving Mohanna fishing community and their houseboats, Manchhar Lake is now polluted and toxic due to decades of state neglect. As the lake grows increasingly inhospitable, the dwindling Mohanna culture of the lake creeps closer and closer towards extinction. While efforts, such as those by NED’s Heritage Cell, are underway to preserve the Mohanna way of life, can the lake that sustains it still be saved? For generations, the Mohannas lived not beside Manchhar but within it. Their houseboats, known as galiyo, approximately 38 feet long and 10 feet wide, formed floating villages that drifted with the seasons, clustering and dispersing according to water levels, fish movements and the wind. Children learned to swim before they learned to walk properly, because water was their first language. For these indigenous fisherfolk, the boats were homes, workplaces and social spaces. A Mohanna man pictured with a bird he has captured: hunting birds is a routine way to pass time at Manchhar Lake, but migratory birds now arrive in far fewer numbers | Mohammad Ali/White Star The Mohanna life has long been centred around three seasons: sawan (monsoon: July-September), machhi maran (fishing season: October-March) and sukkal (dry season: April-June). Oral historians among the Mohannas, often referred to as the “Bird People”, recall ancestral fishing grounds by name, particular bends in the lake where certain fish would gather, or seasons when birds arrived so densely that the sky itself appeared to darken. Manchhar was a cultural landscape, shaped through intimate knowledge and reciprocal care. Over 200 species of freshwater fish were recorded here in the mid-20th century. Tens of thousands of migratory birds — pelicans, ducks, cormorants and egrets— arrived each winter. Reeds grew thick along the edges, providing material for mats, shelters and boats. Fishing techniques were refined over generations, sometimes involving trained birds. Time itself was organised not by calendars but by water levels, fish migrations and monsoon winds. The lake taught the Mohannas where to move, when to wait and when to leave. In this way, Manchhar functioned as both classroom and archive, holding generations of ecological intelligence that never entered official records. “The lake was our market, our school, our mosque,” recalls Ghulam Mustafa Mirbahar, a Mohanna elder. “Everything we needed came from it.” But now, due to Manchhar Lake’s reduced freshwater inflows and increased toxicity, the Mohannas are under threat — much like the lake itself. In an article titled ‘How a Polluted Lake is Endangering Life in and Around It’ published in Dawn’s Herald magazine in September 2018, Namrah Zafar Moti quotes a Mohanna fisherman who recalled that, around 14 years earlier (circa 2004), there were nearly 2,000 houseboats on the lake. The Mohannas, whose lives were inseparable from the water, are now disappearing from it, pushed ashore by necessity rather than choice. At present, around 375 people, comprising 65 families, continue to live on Manchhar Lake. The number of galiyos has now dwindled to just 44. Migratory birds also still arrive, but in fewer numbers. “When ecosystems collapse,” one Mohanna elder observes, “even flight changes.” This is a slow disappearance that has been unfolding over decades. And, like Ghaaib Pir’s disappearance, it is happening in plain sight. Boats parked at the western edge of Manchhar Lake: due to Manchhar Lake’s reduced freshwater inflows and increased toxicity, the Mohannas are under threat — much like the lake itself |Mohammad Ali/White Star MANCHHAR LAKE’S HISTORY OF NEGLECT Located about 18 kilometres west of Sehwan Sharif in Sindh, Manchhar Lake spreads to the foot of the Kirthar mountain range. Historically, Manchhar’s health depended on regular freshwater inflows from the Indus River and hill torrents. This natural flushing kept salinity low and ecosystems resilient. But over the last two centuries, a series of interventions began to sever these lifelines. Following the introduction and expansion of the railway system during British rule in the Subcontinent, there was a reduced reliance on river navigation, diminishing the traditional role of the Mohannas as riverine transporters. Later on, the building of the Sukkur Barrage in 1923 and the Kotri Barrage in 1955 across the Indus obstructed natural river routes, making navigation difficult and disrupting traditional water-based livelihoods. While these projects expanded agriculture elsewhere through their tightly controlled irrigation channels, they reduced the freshwater reaching Manchhar, altering its chemistry and seasonal rhythms. Yet, the most devastating blow came with the introduction of large-scale drainage schemes intended to carry saline and wastewater away from agricultural lands and urban centres. The Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD), started in 1980, was designed to divert polluted water safely to the sea. Instead, due to chronic delays, incomplete infrastructure and poor regulation, it began disgorging untreated industrial effluent, municipal sewage, pesticides and fertilisers directly into Manchhar Lake. As freshwater inflows declined and toxic discharges increased, Manchhar’s natural flushing mechanisms failed. Salinity increased, fish died, bird populations collapsed or altered their migratory routes altogether and water once drinkable became hazardous to touch. “The water was sweet before,” says the Mohanna Allah Dino Mallah. “You could drink it straight from your hands. But today, even the fish cannot survive in the water.” Sedimentation carried by the drains further reduced the lake’s depth and storage capacity, concentrating pollutants and shrinking habitats. What had once been a vast, dynamic ecosystem became a stagnant basin of contamination. Peeran Mallah, a Mohanna fisherman, says, “We know when the lake is sick. The smell tells us before the tests do.” The damage unfolded incrementally, making it easy to normalise, difficult to reverse and almost impossible to attribute to any single authority. Each intervention framed itself as development while, collectively, they dismantled the lake’s capacity to sustain life. An aerial view of a floating houseboat village on Manchhar Lake: at present, around 65 families continue to live on Manchhar Lake and the number of galiyos [houseboats] has now dwindled to just 44 | Heritage Cell-DAPNED THE MOHANNAS UNDER THREAT For the Mohannas, the consequences were immediate and brutal. Fishing yields fell from thousands of tonnes annually to a fraction of that. Health problems multiplied: skin diseases, respiratory illnesses and waterborne infections became common. With no access to clean water, sanitation, healthcare or consistent schooling, survival itself grew uncertain. Fish, formerly both food and currency, became scarce, small and, often, unsafe to eat. The Mohanna woman Zarina Mallah notes, “When the fish died, everything else followed.” As a result, many families were forced to abandon their floating homes and move ashore, often into informal settlements, where they were neither recognised as landowners nor supported as displaced communities. Hence, cultural identity eroded alongside ecological collapse. Women bore a disproportionate share of this rupture. With declining fish stocks and worsening water quality, domestic labour intensified. Water had to be sourced from farther away, illnesses cared for without medical access, children kept safe in increasingly hostile conditions. For the youngest Mohannas, born into a lake already poisoned, the idea of water as a sustainer rather than a threat is no longer intuitive. Drying fish was once a seasonal rhythm tied to surplus. But now, “the dried fish goes to Karachi and Hyderabad to be turned into poultry feed,” explains Abdul Wahab. “The catch is mostly small fish. This is not what we used to eat.” The disappearance here is incremental — fish by fish, boat by boat, family by family. Among the most fragile survivors of this collapse are the galiyo. Each galiyo is an archive of vernacular design, adaptive architecture and environmental intelligence.

Salinity increased, fish died, bird populations collapsed or altered their migratory routes altogether and water once drinkable became hazardous to touch. “The water was sweet before,” says the Mohanna Allah Dino Mallah. “You could drink it straight from your hands. But today, even the fish cannot survive in the water.” Sedimentation carried by the drains further reduced the lake’s depth and storage capacity, concentrating pollutants and shrinking habitats. What had once been a vast, dynamic ecosystem became a stagnant basin of contamination. Peeran Mallah, a Mohanna fisherman, says, “We know when the lake is sick. The smell tells us before the tests do.” The damage unfolded incrementally, making it easy to normalise, difficult to reverse and almost impossible to attribute to any single authority. Each intervention framed itself as development while, collectively, they dismantled the lake’s capacity to sustain life. An aerial view of a floating houseboat village on Manchhar Lake: at present, around 65 families continue to live on Manchhar Lake and the number of galiyos [houseboats] has now dwindled to just 44 | Heritage Cell-DAPNED THE MOHANNAS UNDER THREAT For the Mohannas, the consequences were immediate and brutal. Fishing yields fell from thousands of tonnes annually to a fraction of that. Health problems multiplied: skin diseases, respiratory illnesses and waterborne infections became common. With no access to clean water, sanitation, healthcare or consistent schooling, survival itself grew uncertain. Fish, formerly both food and currency, became scarce, small and, often, unsafe to eat. The Mohanna woman Zarina Mallah notes, “When the fish died, everything else followed.” As a result, many families were forced to abandon their floating homes and move ashore, often into informal settlements, where they were neither recognised as landowners nor supported as displaced communities. Hence, cultural identity eroded alongside ecological collapse. Women bore a disproportionate share of this rupture. With declining fish stocks and worsening water quality, domestic labour intensified. Water had to be sourced from farther away, illnesses cared for without medical access, children kept safe in increasingly hostile conditions. For the youngest Mohannas, born into a lake already poisoned, the idea of water as a sustainer rather than a threat is no longer intuitive. Drying fish was once a seasonal rhythm tied to surplus. But now, “the dried fish goes to Karachi and Hyderabad to be turned into poultry feed,” explains Abdul Wahab. “The catch is mostly small fish. This is not what we used to eat.” The disappearance here is incremental — fish by fish, boat by boat, family by family. Among the most fragile survivors of this collapse are the galiyo. Each galiyo is an archive of vernacular design, adaptive architecture and environmental intelligence. Built from local wood and reeds, these boats respond to changing water levels, winds and seasonal temperatures. Their interiors encode social organisation, gendered spaces and everyday rituals. To lose them is not merely to lose shelter but to lose an entire philosophy of dwelling on water. (Left) Newly built houseboats. (Right) A bamboo floating structure built for schooling and community activities | Heritage Cell-DAPNED In architectural terms, the galiyo represent a rare example of climate-responsive design, developed outside formal institutions. Their low freeboard and flexible joints allowed them to adapt to fluctuating water levels long before resilience entered professional vocabulary. To let them disappear would be to erase evidence that sustainable futures can emerge from vernacular knowledge rather than imported models. This very knowledge and way of life is under threat. “Government people come,” says the Mohanna fisherman Sain Bakhsh Mallah. “They take photos and write reports, but the water stays the same.” He says that children still listen to elders recount information and stories about routes, seasons and signs, but many already imagine their lives elsewhere. But, without any formal training or education, what will the lives of the Mohanna youth look like elsewhere? When the Mohannas are displaced on to land, their skills become unreadable to policy, irrelevant to markets and invisible to planning frameworks. What makes this disappearance particularly devastating is that it has unfolded through decisions made elsewhere due to engineering choices, bureaucratic delays and institutional indifference. So what can be done to safeguard the Mohanna community? TRYING TO PRESERVE A WAY OF LIFE The 2024 launch of the UK-Pakistan Cultural Protection Fund (CPF) pilot was an attempt at a holistic intervention that combined the restoration of Manchhar’s remaining houseboats with a deeper commitment to the survival of the community itself. The project ‘Manchhar Lake Mohannas — Safeguarding the Last Surviving Houseboat Village from Extinction’, led by Professor Dr Anila Naeem and Farida Abdul Ghaffar, assistant professor at the Department of Architecture and Planning of Karachi’s NED University (DAPNED), sought to document, conserve and reimagine these floating structures as cultural heritage. Professor Naeem is the chairperson of DAPNED and a heritage conservation specialist. During the first phase of the project, undertaken on an exacting 10-month timeline (April 2024-January 2025), NED’s Heritage Cell team helped repair 44 severely deteriorated houseboats. After undertaking a detailed assessment of the houseboats, a plan for repairs was made. Locals were engaged in boat-building techniques, repairs and maintenance, as the project placed architectural research in dialogue with community knowledge, conservation ethics and environmental advocacy. It was also important to facilitate the community with drinking water and toilet facilities. Skill development and tourism initiatives were piloted to create sustainable income opportunities. Many of these houseboats were close to collapse, with rotting bases and compromised structures that made daily life unsafe. Repairs extended their lifespan by decades, allowing families to remain on water rather than being forced ashore. “If the boats had gone,” one elder says, “we would have gone with them.” (Left) Newly built houseboats. (Right) A bamboo floating structure built for schooling and community activities | Heritage Cell-DAPNED A pilot restoration of Muhammad Ashraf’s houseboat, for example, involved sourcing local wood, carefully cutting it and transporting it to Manchhar Lake under gruelling weather conditions, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees. A rotting base was also replaced, and the houseboat was relaunched with the collective effort of over 50 community members, after a month of painstaking labour and experimentation. This first success restored not only the structure but also community confidence and faith in the project’s promise. Beyond housing, the intervention also addressed urgent health needs. A mobile water filtration unit provided access to safe drinking water in a place where the lake itself had become toxic. Eco-toilets improved sanitation in a community that had long lived without such infrastructure. Solar-powered systems reduced dependence on fuel and external supply lines. Fishing, the economic backbone of Mohanna life, was also supported through the construction of new fishing boats [hurro], replacing those lost to decay. While fish stocks remain depleted, mobility restored some measure of agency, allowing families to continue working rather than abandoning the lake altogether. Children, too, were drawn into the orbit of learning. A temporary learning centre was established, initially operated on newly repaired houseboats, and later shifting to a floating bamboo structure that doubled as a communal space. For families accustomed to displacement, the sight of education taking place on water carries symbolic weight. The second phase of the project (April 2025-January 2026) involved a series of community interactive activities, including tours, workshops and a five-day art residency. It culminated in a performative-curatorial event, ‘Manchhar Lake Mohannas – Sailing Towards Revival’, which framed Manchhar not as a closed chapter but as an unfolding story, foregrounding dialogue and visual narratives from the Mohanna community’s lived realities. Yet even as these changes took hold, their limits were clear. No number of repaired boats or community programmes can neutralise untreated sewage. No water filter can compensate for a lake that no longer flushes itself clean. Tree saplings planted along the Manchhar Bund and a bamboo pavilion offer shade to visitors, but they cannot alter the lake’s chemistry. Heritage tourism pilots create momentary income and visibility, but they remain fragile, dependent on conditions beyond local control. Ultimately, these efforts were holding ground and buying time in a landscape where time has been running out. CAN MANCHHAR BE BROUGHT BACK FROM THE BRINK? The question that hangs over Manchhar now is no longer whether it has been damaged — that reality is visible, measurable and lived daily — but whether it can still be saved. Restoration, in Manchhar’s case, requires a return to first principles: water that moves, water that cleans itself and governance that treats ecological systems as living entities rather than as disposal sites. At the heart of Manchhar’s decline lies the severing of freshwater inflows. For centuries, the lake remained viable because it was periodically flushed by clean water from the Indus and hill torrents. This dilution kept salinity in check and allowed pollutants to disperse. Once that flow was throttled, first by barrages, then by diversions, Manchhar became a terminal basin, receiving waste but unable to release it. Stopping the poisoning, therefore, begins upstream. Untreated industrial effluent and municipal sewage entering the lake through the RBOD and the Main Nara Valley Drain must be intercepted and treated before reaching Manchhar. This is not a technological mystery, as wastewater treatment systems exist and have existed for decades. What has been missing is enforcement, maintenance and political will. Without functional treatment plants and strict regulation of industrial discharge, every other intervention remains cosmetic. Freshwater inflows must also be restored. Environmental flow, water released specifically to sustain ecosystems, is a measurable requirement. Without it, salinity will continue to rise, fish will fail to reproduce and birds will not return in meaningful numbers. Restoring this flow will require coordination between provincial and federal authorities, irrigation departments and environmental agencies — a level of cooperation that has historically been elusive. Sedimentation presents another challenge. Decades of accumulated silt have reduced Manchhar’s depth and storage capacity, intensifying pollution and shrinking habitats. Dredging, combined with the creation of wetlands and sediment traps upstream, could help restore the lake’s ability to hold and cleanse water. Nature-based solutions, such as planting aquatic vegetation that absorb pollutants, offer additional pathways, but only if water quality improves enough to support life. It was hence a welcome sight that, in 2025, the Sindh government partnered with WWF-Pakistan for an $8 million Manchar Lake revival initiative, aimed at combatting rising salinity and pollution in the lake, restoring its ecological balance, reducing environmental threats and uplifting the livelihoods of local communities impacted by the lake’s decline. However, whether or not this endeavour succeeds remains to be seen. Earlier efforts, such as the Supreme Court’s directive in 2017, calling on provincial authorities to ensure regular monitoring and revival of water filtration plants, disposal of solid waste and efforts to control the pollution level in Manchhar Lake, fell on deaf ears. Of course, no meaningful change can be brought without the participation of the people who know the lake best. Community-led monitoring, where Mohanna observations are treated as important data rather than anecdotes, could transform how the lake is managed. Their knowledge of seasonal changes, fish behaviour and water conditions represents an archive of environmental intelligence that no satellite image can replace. SAILING INTO AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE Manchhar’s crisis is not an isolated failure. Across Sindh, other water bodies are showing the same early symptoms of reduced inflows, untreated waste, creeping salinity and ecological thinning. Haleji Lake and Keenjhar Lake, both critical sources of drinking water and once-thriving ecosystems, face mounting pressure from pollution and over-extraction. They are displaying warning signs that are similar to what Manchhar Lake has experienced. If lessons are not learned here, they will be repeated — lake by lake, creek by creek — until disappearance becomes the default outcome of water governance. By extension, Mohanna culture can only be preserved if stringent measures are taken to rehabilitate Manchhar Lake. The reality is that one of Pakistan’s most vibrant indigenous communities has long had a sword dangling over both their means of livelihood and way of life. If targeted efforts are not made to safeguard the Mohanna community and the well-being of Manchhar Lake, both the lake and the community that resides on it will become another permanent victim of Pakistan’s wounded ecology. The question, then, is not whether Manchhar will become ghaaib. The question is whether disappearance will once again be explained as inevitability rather than consequence.
