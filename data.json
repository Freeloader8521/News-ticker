      "summary_orig": "A US immigration officer shot and killed an American woman on the streets of Minneapolis on Wednesday, leading to huge protests and outrage from local leaders who rejected White House claims she was a domestic terrorist. The woman, identified in local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was hit at point blank range as she apparently tried to drive away from agents who were crowding around her car, which they said was blocking their way. Footage of the incident shows a masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fire three times into the Honda SUV, which then hurtles out of control and smashes into stationary vehicles, as horrified onlookers hurl abuse at the federal officers. Her bloodied body is then seen slumped in the crashed vehicle. US President Donald Trump’s administration moved quickly to claim Good had been trying to kill the agents, an assertion Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called “bullsh**” and urged ICE to get out of his city. Thousands of protesters took to the frigid streets of Minneapolis after the shooting, holding signs reading “ICE out of MPLS”, a common abbreviation for the city. ICE’s federal agents have been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s immigrant deportation drive, despite the objections of local officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched an aggressive recruitment campaign last summer to add 10,000 additional ICE agents to the existing 6,000-strong contingent. That sparked criticism that new officers in the field were insufficiently trained. DHS chief Kristi Noem said “any loss of life is a tragedy” but called the incident “domestic terrorism” and said Good “had been stalking and impeding (ICE’s) work all throughout the day”. “She then proceeded to weaponise her vehicle,” she said. Wednesday’s incident came during protest action against immigration enforcement in the southern part of Minneapolis, located in the midwestern state of Minnesota. The Department of Homeland Security, which runs ICE, said on X the victim had tried to run over its officer who fired “defensive shots”. Grisly scene Minnesota’s Governor Tim Walz called the federal government’s response to the incident “propaganda” and vowed his state would “ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation”. Witness Brandon Hewitt heard “three shots”. “I got a bunch of video of them carrying the body to the ambulance,” he told MS NOW . Another witness interviewed by local station FOX9 described a grisly scene. “The surviving passenger got out of the car covered in blood,” the witness said. He recounted seeing a man who identified himself as a doctor attempting to reach Good but being refused access by officers. Anti-ICE protests There have been passionate protests against immigration operations of the Trump administration, which has vowed to arrest and deport what it says are “millions” of undocumented migrants. The DHS called the violence a “direct consequence of constant attacks and demonisation of our officers”. The officer who opened fire, who was released from the hospital following the incident, was rammed and dragged along a road by an anti-ICE protester in June, Noem said. The victim’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper that her daughter “was probably terrified”. Good was “not part of anything like” challenging ICE officers, Ganger added. Trump has made preventing unlawful immigration and expelling undocumented migrants priorities during his second term, and has tightened conditions for entering the United States and obtaining visas. ICE — which critics accuse of transforming into a paramilitary force under Trump — has been tasked with deporting an unprecedented number of undocumented migrants. US authorities said up to 2,000 officers were in Minneapolis for immigration sweeps. A US immigration enforcement officer shot dead an undocumented immigrant in Chicago in September after federal authorities alleged the man tried to resist detention by driving his car into the official.",

      "summary_orig": "A delegation of the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Aain-i-Pakistan (TTAP) headed from Islamabad to Lahore on Thursday as part of the opposition’s street mobilisation campaign. The alliance’s spokesperson said on Wednesday that the delegation would depart on a three-day visit to Lahore as part of the opposition’s “street mobilisation”. He said the TTAP leaders will organise “political and social meetings” in Lahore, adding that the politicians will also hold meetings at Zaman Park, Imran Khan’s residence in the provincial capital. A post shared by the TTAP on X said that the delegation, headed by the alliance’s head Mahmood Khan Achakzai, had left for Lahore. A separate video showed Achakzai speaking to the media before the departure. “We are not going to Lahore to conquer, curse at anyone or throw rocks at them; our slogan is that we are setting out to end oppression and cruelty,” he said. Achakzai, who has been nominated as the next opposition leader in the National Assembly, called on the public to stand with the opposition against a Parliament “thrust upon” Pakistan. Achakzai stressed that the country was suffering from “endless issues because of ill-intended decisions”. “The government itself knows that it is invalid,” he said. “In this regard, the TTAP has appealed to people from all walks of life to protest on Feb 8 and come stand with us,” he said, calling on people to “close their shops, rickshaws, and taxis”. “We are starting a peaceful movement and we are here to end oppression,” he reiterated. Standing alongside Achakzai was the opposition leader of the Punjab Assembly, Moeen Qureshi, who extended his welcome to the TTAP chief. “There are a lot of MPAs present here who will accompany Achakzai sahib to Lahore,” he said. He warned Punjab authorities against treating the TTAP delegation the same as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was treated during his visit to Lahore last month. He also reiterated that the movement would be peaceful. In a separate post on TTAP‘s X account, the alliance’s spokesperson, Hussain Yousafzai, said the convoy was heading towards Lahore via GT Road, terming the visit a “practice match for the larger movement”. Yousafzai voiced optimism that the visit would give “hope to the PTI workers in Punjab”. The spokesperson also added that PTI leader Asad Qaiser would hold a press conference later today. At a recent national conference organised by the TTAP alliance, KP CM Afridi had announced the observation of a “black day” at the national and international levels on Feb 8, which will mark the second anniversary of the general elections under which the existing parliament has been functioning. The conference had also highlighted the need for a new Charter of Democracy — agreeing that the option of talks should never be closed — and put forth demands including an “independent” judiciary and election commission, as well as the release of “political prisoners”, which it believed were necessary for restoring stability in the country. Meanwhile, as proposals for talks between the government and the opposition remain in limbo, a clique of politicians — under the banner of the ‘National Dialogue Committee’ (NDC) — on Wednesday called for the release of all political prisoners to reduce acrimony and pave the way for reconciliation.",

The statement said CDF Field Marshal Munir made the remarks while addressing officers during a visit to Lahore Garrison. He also reaffirmed the military’s resolve to respond to evolving challenges with professionalism and determination, it added. “He said the armed forces remained committed to safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and internal stability, while promoting discipline, excellence and selfless national service,” ISPR said. During the visit, where he was received by the Lahore corps commander, CDF Field Marshal Munir was given a comprehensive briefing on the formation’s operational preparedness, training standards and key initiatives to enhance combat efficiency, it said. The statement added that he witnessed a “specialised field training exercise showcasing the latest technologies, underscoring the army’s emphasis on innovation, adaptability to match the dynamic future battlefield”. He also inspected sports and recreational facilities being provided to troops, highlighting their importance in maintaining physical fitness, morale, and overall well-being, it said. CDF Field Marshal Munir also visited a care centre at Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Lahore, lauding the efforts of the medical staff and administration in establishing a fully equipped, state-of-the-art healthcare facility, it added. The CDF‘s remarks come after the military’s spokesperson stated that Afghan­istan had become a hub of terrorists and non-state actors, declaring the ruling Taliban “the mother organisation” which had been harbouring such groups since 2021. In a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, he also spoke at length about souring relations with Afghanistan, the belligerence being witnessed from India, as well as levelling criticism against the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Imran Khan, without explicitly naming the latter. Last month, the army’s top leadership had also warned political forces against undermining national unity through agitation or rhetoric, besides vowing to deal sternly with what it described as India-sponsored proxies involved in terrorism.",

      "summary_orig": "• Questions whether critics comprehend the suffering caused by dog attacks • Says a small group should not dictate stray dog policy, which must reflect majority’s will KARACHI: Amid a surge in dog-bite cases across Karachi, Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday signalled that the situation was approaching a tipping point and openly suggested culling as a possible option if the people demanded immediate relief. Responding to questions during an interaction with the media in Ittehad Town, the mayor said public opinion on the issue varied sharply across neighbourhoods, but warned against allowing a small group to dictate policy for a city of over 25 million people. “If I ask people here in Ittehad Colony what should be done about stray dogs, they will say that the dogs should be killed. But if I go to Clifton, there are 10 to 15 people who say, ‘No, this should not happen.’ Those 10 to 15 people impose their way of thinking on 25 million people,” he said. Emphasising the democratic will, Mr Wahab said he believes that “the will of all the people must be considered,” adding, “a handful of individuals cannot be given supremacy over everyone else.” Highlighting the limitations of neutering, he said the method requires time to show results and questioned the criticism faced by authorities when attacks continue during that period. “If neutering is to be done, its impact will take time to appear. Then people should not criticise when dogs bite,” he said. “If the city wants quick results, then culling will have to be carried out. “We are prepared for both options. Hundreds of people have been bitten in just a few days. I appeal to critics to listen to victims and their families before objecting to decisive measures.” Mayor Wahab also pointed to legal hurdles, saying that a small group repeatedly approaches courts to block action and then cited an example from India. “This issue also came up in the Indian Supreme Court, and it resolved it. The court said that instead of neutering, culling should be done,” he said. He questioned whether those opposing culling truly understand the suffering caused by dog attacks. “Ask those people who have actually gone through this experience what they want — culling or neutering?,” he said. Uplift work initiated in West, Keamari districts Earlier, the mayor laid the foundation stones for two major infrastructure development projects in district West and district Keamari, aimed at improving road connectivity, drainage and overall civic facilities in the city. In district West, he inaugurated a mega infrastructure project for the rehabilitation of Hub River Road to Tori Bangash Road in Ittehad Town. The project, with an estimated cost of Rs8 billion, is one of the largest road development initiatives in the area. Speaking at the ceremony, attended by city council members, elected representatives and a large number of locals, the mayor said the project reflects the Karachi Metro­poli­tan Corporation’s (KMC) commitment to inclusive and sustainable urban development. Under the project, Hub River Road will be converted into a 12,500-foot-long dual carriageway, a move expected to significantly ease traffic congestion in District West. A modern drainage system spanning 8,000 feet has been incorporated into the design, along with the installation of more than 21,000 feet of RCC drainage pipelines to improve stormwater management. The completion of the project will eliminate flooding issues in the area, he added. Separately, the mayor also laid the foundation stone for the reconstruction of Sparco Road in District Keamari. The project is being executed at a cost of approximately Rs56m and is described as an important milestone in the city’s urban development efforts. The scheme includes 48,000 square feet of paver blocks and 65,000 square feet of asphalt wearing course, along with a modern sewerage system and a high-quality road structure.

      "summary_en": "• Questions whether critics comprehend the suffering caused by dog attacks • Says a small group should not dictate stray dog policy, which must reflect majority’s will KARACHI: Amid a surge in dog-bite cases across Karachi, Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday signalled that the situation was approaching a tipping point and openly suggested culling as a possible option if the people demanded immediate relief. Responding to questions during an interaction with the media in Ittehad Town, the mayor said public opinion on the issue varied sharply across neighbourhoods, but warned against allowing a small group to dictate policy for a city of over 25 million people. “If I ask people here in Ittehad Colony what should be done about stray dogs, they will say that the dogs should be killed. But if I go to Clifton, there are 10 to 15 people who say, ‘No, this should not happen.’ Those 10 to 15 people impose their way of thinking on 25 million people,” he said. Emphasising the democratic will, Mr Wahab said he believes that “the will of all the people must be considered,” adding, “a handful of individuals cannot be given supremacy over everyone else.” Highlighting the limitations of neutering, he said the method requires time to show results and questioned the criticism faced by authorities when attacks continue during that period. “If neutering is to be done, its impact will take time to appear. Then people should not criticise when dogs bite,” he said. “If the city wants quick results, then culling will have to be carried out. “We are prepared for both options. Hundreds of people have been bitten in just a few days. I appeal to critics to listen to victims and their families before objecting to decisive measures.” Mayor Wahab also pointed to legal hurdles, saying that a small group repeatedly approaches courts to block action and then cited an example from India. “This issue also came up in the Indian Supreme Court, and it resolved it. The court said that instead of neutering, culling should be done,” he said. He questioned whether those opposing culling truly understand the suffering caused by dog attacks. “Ask those people who have actually gone through this experience what they want — culling or neutering?,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he wanted to increase the US defence budget by half next year to a giant $1.5 trillion to deal with “troubled and dangerous times”. Trump has frequently employed the US military — which is currently funded at record spending levels — since returning to office, including strikes on Yemeni rebels, Iranian nuclear sites and alleged drug-smuggling boats, as well as a brazen special forces raid to abduct Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. “I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars,” Trump said on Truth Social. “This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,” the US president said. Trump said the increase is possible due to revenue from the sweeping tariffs he has imposed on friend and foe alike. The United States is already by far the world’s biggest military spender, and a hike to $1.5 trillion would push Washington’s financial outlay on its armed forces even farther ahead of its rivals China and Russia, though it could also spark an arms race with such countries. Trump slams defence companies Trump’s announcement on boosting the US military budget comes after Nato allies committed last year to increase their defence spending to five per cent of GDP by 2035 in response to pressure from the US president. Even as he announced a budget goal that would be a major boon to defence contractors, Trump took aim at them in posts on Truth Social. Defence contractors are “issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks, at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment,” while pay packages for defence executives are “exorbitant and unjustifiable,” Trump said. The president said salaries should be capped at $5 million and that he would prohibit stock buybacks and dividends “until such time as these problems are rectified,” without specifying how he would do so. The announcement took the markets by surprise, sending US companies in the defence sector — such as Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics — more than four per cent lower. Northrop Grumman lost more than five per cent. Trump took aim at Raytheon specifically, saying the Defence Department told him the company was the “least responsive” to its needs and the “slowest in increasing their volume”. Raytheon must boost its investments in plants and equipment, Trump said, threatening it with a loss of US government business if it does not comply.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources said, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year. The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time of acute financial strain and as Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about US commitments in the Middle East. The mutual defence deal was signed following Israel’s strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region. One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion. The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion. The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the deal. Pakistan’s Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, including on “military cooperation between the two sides”, Saudi media outlet SaudiNews50 said on social media platform X on Monday. Tested in combat Amir Masood, a retired air marshal and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment, including JF-17s and electronic and weapons systems for the jets. He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations. The JF-17’s marketability has been increased because “it is tested and has been used in combat,” he told Reuters , adding that it’s also cost-effective. The aircraft was deployed during the conflict with India last May, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades. The military or finance and defence ministries did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s government media office also did not respond. The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership. Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress. In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6bn support package for Pakistan, including a $3bn deposit at the central bank and $3bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payment. Saudi Arabia has since rolled over deposits multiple times, including a $1.2bn deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures. Arms sales outreach Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry. Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4bn with Libya’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country’s largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft. Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East. On Tuesday, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook. “Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif told Geo News . Pakistan is currently under a $7bn IMF programme , its 24th, which followed a short-term $3bn deal that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Fund’s support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Wednesday jibed at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while recounting a meeting between the two, where the Indian PM had asked to meet the US president. While addressing the House GOP (Grand Old Party) Members’ Retreat, Trump recounted a meeting with Modi, stating that Modi had ordered 68 Apache attack helicopters from the US and had waited five years. “Prime Minister Modi came to see me. [He said] ‘Sir, may I see you, please?’ Yes,” Trump recalled. “I have a very good relationship with him. He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now, because they’re not doing the oil,” he added, referring to India halting imports of Russian oil. Trump also noted that the US is “getting rich because of tariffs”. Meanwhile, India’s opposition Congress party took to X and uploaded a caricature of the scene, showing a timid Modi. In a separate post in Hindi, Congress claimed that Modi went to the US uninvited to meet Trump after he took office last January, quoting the Indian PM’s request to meet him. “You must remember - among the world‘s leaders, Modi is the only one whom Trump did not come to receive at the gate,” the party wrote, attaching a video of Trump’s remarks. In response to the remarks, Indian lawmaker Priyanka Chaturvedi took to X and wrote, “His (Trump’s) condescending tone for India’s PM is demeaning. The GoI’s (Government of India) silence to all his insulting statements is bizarre because it reflects poorly on our nation.” Former Indian minister Subhramanian Swamy shared this post. The US is imposing 50 per cent tariffs on New Delhi over its purchase of Russian oil, causing tensions to rise between the world’s two largest democracies and strategic partners. A punitive 25pc tariff was imposed due to India’s purchases of Russian oil, adding to Trump’s prior 25pc tariff on many products from India. It took total duties as high as 50pc for goods such as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, sporting goods, furniture and chemicals — among the highest imposed by the US and on par with Brazil and China. However, Trump said during a press gaggle on Air Force One that he could raise the tariffs already in place. “Modi is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy,” Trump said on Sunday. “They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly,” Trump said in response to a question on India’s Russian oil purchases.",

      "title_orig": "AJK govt has implemented all points of JAAC agreement within its jurisdiction: info minister",
      "summary_orig": "The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government on Wednesday stated that it had accepted and implemented in letter and spirit almost all points of its agreement with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) that fell within its jurisdiction, adding that issues relating to the federal government could take some time. The federal government on October 4, 2025, signed an agreement with the JAAC to end the tense situation prevailing in the region since late September. The AJK government claimed it had resolved or was moving towards resolution of more than 90 per cent of the issues outlined by the JAAC. “We have implemented all matters that were within our domain. However, federally funded projects are approved through a defined process, and that naturally takes time,” Minister for Information and Religious Affairs Muhammad Rafique Nayyar said at a press conference. “Similarly, matters related to constitutional amendments also take time because they pass through different stages,” he added. Nayyar said the PPP-led government, under AJK Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, had worked day and night during its one-and-a-half months in power to resolve public issues. “The prime minister is young and energetic. He has removed the word ‘rest’ from his lexicon and has kept himself and his team constantly on their toes for public welfare,” he said. Nayyar added that the atmosphere of inertia in the prime minister’s office and the ministers’ block had come to an end and the government had held a record five cabinet meetings within 90 days, approving measures to resolve public matters on a fast-track basis. “The biggest challenge for the present government has been restoring public trust, a task in which, by the grace of Allah, it is succeeding.” Listing steps taken by the government in connection with the agreement, Nayyar said that since PM Rathore himself was among the signatories on behalf of the AJK government, it placed an even greater responsibility on the government to ensure its implementation. Regarding the reduction in the property transfer tax, he said the cabinet had already approved reducing the property transfer tax to 8.5pc, and a notification would be issued after the required legislation was enacted. As for health cards, Nayyar said the government was not facing any financial constraints and that negotiations with the relevant company were underway. The prime minister, he said, set a deadline of January 20 to resolve the issue. Responding to a question as to why the government was not holding talks with the JAAC, Nayyar said the government was always ready for negotiations and wanted to move forward by taking all stakeholders on board. “Our sincerity can also be gauged from the fact that the prime minister himself went to the house of a core member of the Action Committee. We are available 24 hours a day. If talks are to be held, just give us half an hour’s notice,” he said. Nayyar clarified that the AJK government was not functioning under the agreement with the JAAC but under the public mandate. However, he added, the government remained fully committed to implementing all commitments made in the public interest. The minister expressed regret that talks held in Islamabad on January 2 were attended by representatives of the federal and AJK governments, but members of the JAAC did not turn up. Describing AJK as a highly sensitive region, Nayyar said the ancestors of its people had made immense sacrifices for its freedom. “Our objective is to maintain an atmosphere of peace and order in the state and to resolve all legitimate public issues, and we will spare no effort to achieve this,” he added. In response to another question, Nayyar said the PPP would contest the next elections based on its performance and would once again seek the people’s trust. He said elections would be held on time, as there was no provision in the Constitution for their cancellation. The information minister said that when he had previously held the information portfolio two-and-a-half years ago, he had visited press clubs across AJK and made efforts to resolve their issues. “We will seek guidance from the media and will take every possible step to strengthen it,” he added. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down towards the end of September last year. Rival groups then staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. After two rounds of talks, an agreement between the JAAC, the AJK government and the federal government was reached. On December 29, the federal government notified a nine-member committee to deliberate on a contentious clause of the agreement, the abolition of elite privileges and 12 seats reserved for Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir. Under its terms of reference, the committee will deliberate on the issue of “members of the AJK Legislative Assembly other than the AJK constituencies (sic)” and has been auth­orised to meet as frequently as required and submit its recommendations to the Monitoring and Implementation (M&I) Commit­tee constituted under the Muzaf­farabad Agreement.",

      "summary_en": "The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government on Wednesday stated that it had accepted and implemented in letter and spirit almost all points of its agreement with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) that fell within its jurisdiction, adding that issues relating to the federal government could take some time. The federal government on October 4, 2025, signed an agreement with the JAAC to end the tense situation prevailing in the region since late September. The AJK government claimed it had resolved or was moving towards resolution of more than 90 per cent of the issues outlined by the JAAC. “We have implemented all matters that were within our domain. However, federally funded projects are approved through a defined process, and that naturally takes time,” Minister for Information and Religious Affairs Muhammad Rafique Nayyar said at a press conference. “Similarly, matters related to constitutional amendments also take time because they pass through different stages,” he added. Nayyar said the PPP-led government, under AJK Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, had worked day and night during its one-and-a-half months in power to resolve public issues. “The prime minister is young and energetic. He has removed the word ‘rest’ from his lexicon and has kept himself and his team constantly on their toes for public welfare,” he said. Nayyar added that the atmosphere of inertia in the prime minister’s office and the ministers’ block had come to an end and the government had held a record five cabinet meetings within 90 days, approving measures to resolve public matters on a fast-track basis. “The biggest challenge for the present government has been restoring public trust, a task in which, by the grace of Allah, it is succeeding.” Listing steps taken by the government in connection with the agreement, Nayyar said that since PM Rathore himself was among the signatories on behalf of the AJK government, it placed an even greater responsibility on the government to ensure its implementation. Regarding the reduction in the property transfer tax, he said the cabinet had already approved reducing the property transfer tax to 8.5pc, and a notification would be issued after the required legislation was enacted. As for health cards, Nayyar said the government was not facing any financial constraints and that negotiations with the relevant company were underway. The prime minister, he said, set a deadline of January 20 to resolve the issue. Responding to a question as to why the government was not holding talks with the JAAC, Nayyar said the government was always ready for negotiations and wanted to move forward by taking all stakeholders on board. “Our sincerity can also be gauged from the fact that the prime minister himself went to the house of a core member of the Action Committee. We are available 24 hours a day. If talks are to be held, just give us half an hour’s notice,” he said. Nayyar clarified that the AJK government was not functioning under the agreement with the JAAC but under the public mandate. However, he added, the government remained fully committed to implementing all commitments made in the public interest. The minister expressed regret that talks held in Islamabad on January 2 were attended by representatives of the federal and AJK governments, but members of the JAAC did not turn up. Describing AJK as a highly sensitive region, Nayyar said the ancestors of its people had made immense sacrifices for its freedom. “Our objective is to maintain an atmosphere of peace and order in the state and to resolve all legitimate public issues, and we will spare no effort to achieve this,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "Featuring for Pakistan for the first time since June last year, Shadab Khan impressed with the ball, teaming up with Abrar Ahmed as Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the opening fixture of the three-match Twenty20 International series at the Rangiri Dambulla Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. The all-rounder took two wickets, while Abrar hunted three victims to restrict Sri Lanka to a paltry 128-run total before Sahibzada Farhan’s half century helped Pakistan chase down the target with 20 balls to spare. Shadab gave away only 25 runs in his four overs, bagging both his wickets in his very first over and could have gone on to take a third had it not been for a dropped catch later on. Coming into bowl in the seventh over, after Mohammad Wasim and Salman Mirza’s pace — that accounted for a wicket for each — saw Sri Lanka post 35-2 in the powerplay, Shadab trapped a sweeping Kusal Mendis lbw and induced an inside edge off Dhananjaya de Silva’s bat for wicket-keeper Usman Khan to take a good catch. With Sri Lanka looking to break the stranglehold while at 59-4 by the halfway stage, it was an opportunity for Abrar to pounce on. The mystery spinner deceived Charith Asalanka into playing a googly across, only to be caught behind, leaving Sri Lanka reeling at 72-5 halfway through the 12th over. The incoming Wanindu Hasaranga initiated a counterattack of sorts lofting Abrar for a boundary in the 14th over.  Liyanage joined in a slap off Mohammad Nawaz through the covers before dispatching the left-arm spinner past long-on, bringing up the 100-run mark for Sri Lanka. Luck followed for Liyanage as an edge flew off his bat for another boundary as 16 runs came in the 15th over. Hasaranga targetted Abrar once again, clubbing him straight down the ground for another four, but holed the spinner to Fakhar Zaman at deep cover to depart for 18 off 12, ending the only partnership that looked to threaten Pakistan. Liyanage (40 off 31) followed suit in the 18th, finding Nawaz in the deep off Abrar (3-25) as he tried to clear the long-on fence. Salman Mirza (3-18) returned to dismiss Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka and the incoming Dushmantha Chameera before Wasim (2-7) wrapped up the first innings proceedings. Pakistan, in response, took off with a flurry of brilliant attacking shots by openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada lead the side to a 59-1 by the end of the powerplay, with Saim departing on the penultimate ball of the sixth over. The left-hander was castled by Theekshana but only after having hit three fours and a six — a lofted drive over cover — for his 18-ball 24. Sahibzada, on the other end, had used brute power to dispatch Chameera for sixes down the ground and over square-leg. Sahibzada continued the onslaught, welcoming Chameera back with a straight drive for four more before captain Salman Ali Agha, having just joined him, danced down the ground to play Hasaranga’s leg-spin over his head for another boundary. The skipper pushed Theekshana for his second boundary in the next over as Pakistan posted 92-1 by the halfway stage, but holed a juicy full toss by Hasranga to long-on to depart for 16 off 10. Sahibzada (51 off 36) brought up his third half century in five matches with a cut for three off Chameera in the 12th over, reaching the milestone in 35 balls. But the right-hander perished three balls later, finding Shanaka at mid-off off Chameera. Pakistan received yet another blow when Fakhar was stumped off Dhananjaya de Silva with 23 runs needed off 40 balls. The incoming Shadab (18 not out off 12), however, brought Pakistan within touching distance of a win with a square-drive and a pull for consecutive boundaries off Chameera in the 15th over before Pakistan crossed the finish line with 20 balls to spare.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Wednesday sought a “policy shift” and urged the inclusion of the provincial government in counter-terror policy-making. Federal authorities have criticised the PTI-led KP government for failing to ensure security in the province, with KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi saying that the party was in disarray and unable to achieve any of its policy goals. In a speech at Peshawar University’s convocation ceremony, the CM said that the people of KP had warned about the resurgence of terrorism in the province, but were brushed off as propaganda. “We would issue warnings that they (terrorists) were in the mountains and they were coming, that they had reached our markets and homes,” CM Afridi said. “We were told that we are spreading propaganda.” He highlighted that if there was going to be a military operation, then the people of KP needed to be taken into confidence and made part of the policy process. “There needs to be a policy shift, but not behind closed doors,” he explained. “It [policy] needs to be formed after consulting KP’s government, people and stakeholders.“ “A clear policy formed in this manner will play a role in lasting and enduring peace; a decision made behind closed doors will leave our people suffering, as they have for the past 17 years.” The CM noted that the KP government and the government had “different intentions”, adding, “If they wanted to eradicate terrorism, then they would have sat with us and formed a policy. “We came out of our homes, so they committed that they would give Rs400,000 to people whose homes have been lost to terrorism,” he said. “Imagine hearing that after sacrificing so much. They still have not received that money.” Highlighting the impact of military operations, CM Afridi noted that families would lose breadwinners in collateral damage or terrorist attacks, causing them to suffer economically. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveal a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism-linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2,555 in 2024 to 3,417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34 per cent year-on-year surge in violence. Per the report, “the most significant surge in violence was recorded in KP, where the fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.” Meanwhile, on January 2, KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said police thwarted hundreds of terrorism-related incidents, particularly in southern and merged tribal districts, while police personnel risked their lives but stood firm against the enemy. Last year, the police neutralised 459 terrorists in several engagements and arrested over 1,300 militants, including 29 with head money, in 3,277 intelligence-based operations across the province. The police said a large quantity of hand grenades, explosives, pistols, various weapons and ammunition was recovered.",
