      "title_orig": "KP govt does not support ‘operations’, Gandapur tells Centre at PTI rally in Peshawar",
      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who is a senior PTI leader, asserted on Saturday that his provincial government did not support any operation — a reference to military action in various parts of the province against militants. Addressing a PTI rally in Peshawar, he said, “We will not allow any operation and do not support it … Federal government, listen. The KP government does not support operation or displacement.” Gandapur called on the “federal institutions” to talk to Afghanistan and resolve the issue of terrorism in the country. “We don’t want war and we will raise our voice against it,” he added. Gandapur has been shifting positions on the matter. In July, he said in a heavily-edited video message that the armed for­ces were in the province at the request of the KP government and should be treated as “guests” and with respect. This came in complete contrast to another video statement issued by him following a PTI parliamentary meeting a day ago, in which he said that innocent civilians were martyred in a military offensive launched against militants in Bajaur district. He added that such operations had a negative impact and eroded trust between people and the forces. Meanwhile, the PTI remained opposed to military action. More recently on Tuesday, he said that mortar shelling, drone strikes and using fighter jets against terrorists was the constitutional right of the military and that the provincial government could not stop it. Gandapur calls for justice At the rally today, the KP CM also urged the judiciary to serve justice in line with the Constitution. “Deliver justice to Imran Khan, his wife and the people,” Gandapur said. The CM further stated that PTI’s struggle for ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi ’ would continue until it achieved success. Addressing army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, he said, “It is obligatory on you to play your role and sort out Imran’s issue” just as the PTI founder had played his role during the May conflict with India asked the people to stand with the armed forces. Earlier the rally, PTI leader Faisal Javed announced that “video messages” from Imran would be played at the rally. “In a while, Imran Khan will speak to you on this screen, Peshawar,” he said. Later, a video of an address by Imran was played, but it seemed to be from a previous public gathering. Party leader Azam Swati also addressed the gathering and vowed to stand tall and “continue to bear cruelty and barbarity” until Imran’s release from jail. He expressed the hope that Imran would soon come out of jail and lead the country towards development, prosperity and peace. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan lauded the party’s followers for standing together during the brief war with India in May. “This is the eighth rally since the elections and Pakistan has changed greatly since February 8,” he said. “In May, despite (Imran) Khan sahib being wrongfully imprisoned and not allowed to see his family, you stood with the rest of Pakistan and defeated our thuggish enemies.” Gohar added that the PTI lost its mandate in these elections, but said that Imran was confident the courts would restore it. However, he continued that “the 26th Constitutional Amendment killed that hope”. “Our rally is not a power show. The world is saying that 90 per cent of people are in favour of Khan sahib — 200 million people rise at his call,” the PTI chairman said. “They want to demand one thing: this rally is for us to raise our voices and show our concerns. Injustice in one place means injustice will be everywhere.” Quoting Imran, Gohar demanded free courts, a strong parliament and democracy.\n“It is your duty to hear our voice,” he emphasised, addressing the government. “Do not silence the voice of 90pc of our people; end injustice, end military operations; end these wrongful convictions. We want justice. We have approached the courts for it and will continue to fight for it.” He closed out his speech with a message from the PTI founder: “I will not compromise or make deals, I will not bend and I will remain in this country. But as long as I am here, I will stand up and live my life and will not let my country bend the knee.” PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram delivered a fiery speech branding the federal government “thieves and killers” and slamming the Punjab government’s flood relief efforts. “Today, [Imran] Khan has called you all here … it is his rally. This is a rally for a man who has been stripped of his rights and locked in prison for standing for the right thing and sacrificing for future generations,” Akram said, addressing the crowd. “He endures every problem, mistreatment and 22-hour isolation, but remains standing in the face of it all.” The party spokesperson said that if there were true freedom, PTI figures including Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Ahmed Bachar, Aliya Hamza, Ayesha Bhutta, Khadija Shah, Zartaj Gul, Dr Yasmin Rashid and Sanam Javed would not have been “jailed for 10 years”. “Why did this happen? Because there is no true freedom. This is a government of slaves, thieves and mandate stealers,” Akram declared. “If there were true freedom, what happened to the flood victims at the hands of this shameless government would not have happened. “Look at what the KP government — Imran Khan’s government — has done: we disbursed billions to flood victims and rehabilitation has started. In Punjab, [Punjab Chief Minister] Maryam Nawaz has not even completed the initial survey. She is a liar, chasing photo-ops.” Akram impressed on the crowd that “these people are not your leaders”. “They are thieves and killers; they murdered your vote. Will you endorse these murderers? Will you condemn them?” PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja took to the stage, emphasising that his party will not end its struggle until the “system of oppression” is brought down. “I was sitting with Imran Khan in Adiala Jail. I asked him what message he has for you all. He said: ‘Tell my nation that I will never bend before hardship. I am in jail because I value every drop of blood my nation sheds’,” Raja said. “Today, KP is drenched in blood: ours, the innocents and that of our martyrs. Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan are all drenched in blood. Oppression is everywhere.” Raja paid tribute to martyrs, stating that “their mothers’ tears are our tears”. “The martyrs of Tirah ask when this system of oppression will end,” he declared, referring to those affected by a recent airstrike in KP’s Tirah area. “I bring a message from Imran Khan: our struggle, our movement, will only end when the oppression does.” Raja then demanded the release of the PTI founder, as well as other party leaders and activists, who he said were “imprisoned without rights” and given “false punishments by military tribunals”. PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser said that the people of KP demand only one thing and that is peace. “We will not allow military operations in our province under any circumstances,” he emphasised. “We are tired of wars; we will not be a part of one.” Qaiser also demanded that the federal government settle matters with Afghanistan through diplomatic channels and jirgas. “We in KP and Afghanistan share deep relations, so we want trade and relations so that there is peace and jobs in our province,” he stated. “I am hopeful that Ali Amin Gandapur will convince this ‘Form 47’ federal government to do so.” The PTI leader and ex-national assembly speaker noted that there needs to be peace in this region. “We appreciate the Saudi pact, but if this country is going to progress, then it needs to establish trade relations with regional nations.” Rally arrangements According to information shared by the PTI on social media , party workers and supporters have reached Peshawar from across the country to participate in the rally. While television channels did not air it, the PTI employed social media to broadcast the event online. Earlier, a statement issued by the office Peshawar Chief Capital Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmed detailed the security and traffic plan ahead of the rally. The statement read that 1,451 police personnel would be deployed as part of security arrangements and sniper shooters would be stationed on the roofs of the buildings round the rally’s venue. Meanwhile, 508 traffic personnel would be deployed at different spots under the traffic plan, the statement said. Several PTI leaders visited the rally’s venue and examined arrangements before the event. They included Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan and PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar. Ahead of the gathering, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said on Friday that the party’s rally in Peshawar would raise a strong voice across the country against lawlessness, constitutional violations and restrictions on freedom of speech.

      "summary_en": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who is a senior PTI leader, asserted on Saturday that his provincial government did not support any operation — a reference to military action in various parts of the province against militants. Addressing a PTI rally in Peshawar, he said, “We will not allow any operation and do not support it … Federal government, listen. The KP government does not support operation or displacement.” Gandapur called on the “federal institutions” to talk to Afghanistan and resolve the issue of terrorism in the country. “We don’t want war and we will raise our voice against it,” he added. Gandapur has been shifting positions on the matter. In July, he said in a heavily-edited video message that the armed for­ces were in the province at the request of the KP government and should be treated as “guests” and with respect. This came in complete contrast to another video statement issued by him following a PTI parliamentary meeting a day ago, in which he said that innocent civilians were martyred in a military offensive launched against militants in Bajaur district. He added that such operations had a negative impact and eroded trust between people and the forces. Meanwhile, the PTI remained opposed to military action. More recently on Tuesday, he said that mortar shelling, drone strikes and using fighter jets against terrorists was the constitutional right of the military and that the provincial government could not stop it. Gandapur calls for justice At the rally today, the KP CM also urged the judiciary to serve justice in line with the Constitution. “Deliver justice to Imran Khan, his wife and the people,” Gandapur said. The CM further stated that PTI’s struggle for ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi ’ would continue until it achieved success. Addressing army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, he said, “It is obligatory on you to play your role and sort out Imran’s issue” just as the PTI founder had played his role during the May conflict with India asked the people to stand with the armed forces. Earlier the rally, PTI leader Faisal Javed announced that “video messages” from Imran would be played at the rally. “In a while, Imran Khan will speak to you on this screen, Peshawar,” he said. Later, a video of an address by Imran was played, but it seemed to be from a previous public gathering. Party leader Azam Swati also addressed the gathering and vowed to stand tall and “continue to bear cruelty and barbarity” until Imran’s release from jail. He expressed the hope that Imran would soon come out of jail and lead the country towards development, prosperity and peace. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan lauded the party’s followers for standing together during the brief war with India in May. “This is the eighth rally since the elections and Pakistan has changed greatly since February 8,” he said. “In May, despite (Imran) Khan sahib being wrongfully imprisoned and not allowed to see his family, you stood with the rest of Pakistan and defeated our thuggish enemies.” Gohar added that the PTI lost its mandate in these elections, but said that Imran was confident the courts would restore it. However, he continued that “the 26th Constitutional Amendment killed that hope”. “Our rally is not a power show. The world is saying that 90 per cent of people are in favour of Khan sahib — 200 million people rise at his call,” the PTI chairman said. “They want to demand one thing: this rally is for us to raise our voices and show our concerns. Injustice in one place means injustice will be everywhere.” Quoting Imran, Gohar demanded free courts, a strong parliament and democracy.\n“It is your duty to hear our voice,” he emphasised, addressing the government. “Do not silence the voice of 90pc of our people; end injustice, end military operations; end these wrongful convictions. We want justice. We have approached the courts for it and will continue to fight for it.” He closed out his speech with a message from the PTI founder: “I will not compromise or make deals, I will not bend and I will remain in this country. But as long as I am here, I will stand up and live my life and will not let my country bend the knee.” PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram delivered a fiery speech branding the federal government “thieves and killers” and slamming the Punjab government’s flood relief efforts. “Today, [Imran] Khan has called you all here … it is his rally.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan men’s captain Salman Ali Agha said on Saturday that he welcomed his players being aggressive on the field ahead of the first-ever final of an Asia Cup between Pakistan and India. Under fire after two comprehensive losses at the hands of India in the ongoing Asia Cup, the Green Shirts proved they were good enough to make it to the tournament’s final when they edged Bangladesh by 11 runs in their last Super Four outing on Thursday and all that matters now for the side are the title honours. Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Dubai, Salman said: “Every individual has their own way. If a player wants to be aggressive, then why not? If you take aggression away from a fast bowler, then there’s nothing left.” He was responding to an Indian journalist’s question about his responsibility as captain to keep his players’ actions in check. “Every player knows how to deal with their emotions. I give the players a free hand unless they are disrespecting someone or causing disrespect to our country,” the Pakistani skipper added. Speaking on the refusal of customary post-match handshakes by the Indian men’s team, Salman said: “I’ve been playing since 2007, I’ve never seen teams not shake hands … I don’t think there has been an instance of players not shaking hands.” He added that on previous occasions, even under worse circumstances between the two countries, handshakes still took place. The Pakistan captain added that he hoped that his team had “saved their best for the final”. Asked about media reports from across the border that the Indian captain had refused to attend the captains’ photoshoot ahead of the final, Salman said: “That’s their choice, we have our own protocols to follow. “If he (Yadav) wants to attend, he can attend — but if he doesn’t want to, then that’s up to him.” On Friday, India captain Suryakumar Yadav was found guilty by the ICC of breaching the code of conduct for his comments that alluded to the brief military conflict between India and Pakistan this year, after their group stage match in the Asia Cup on September 14, ESPNcricinfo reported . “It is understood Suryakumar’s not-guilty plea was rejected by ICC match referee Richie Richardson and that he was fined 30pc of his match fee. India have appealed against the verdict,” the publication reported. The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its September 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”. At least 24 people had been killed in the April attack, which led to a brief military escalation between India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence. “The PCB had demanded the ICC impose a Level 4 sanction — reserved for the most serious breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct — on Suryakumar. It cited past examples of players who were either prevented from what was deemed political messaging or fined for deploying it,” the ESPNcricinfo report added. Pakistan’s pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four stage match against India, ESPNCricinfo added. According to the publication, the pacer was fined 30 per cent of his match fee by match referee Richie Richardson. At the same time, “It is understood that Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan was not fined and let off with a warning by Richardson“. Pakistan won by 11 runs after stumbling to 135-8 in the virtual semi-final against Bangladesh in their men’s Asia Cup Super Four fixture at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday. With that win, the Green Shirts booked their final date with archrivals India for the first time in the 17th iteration of the Asia Cup on Sunday.",

      "title": "Pakistan skipper Salman calls for aggression ahead of clash with India in Asia Cup final",
      "summary": "Pakistan men’s captain Salman Ali Agha said on Saturday that he welcomed his players being aggressive on the field ahead of the first-ever final of an Asia Cup between Pakistan and India. Under fire after two comprehensive losses at the hands of India in the ongoing Asia Cup, the Green Shirts proved they were good enough to make it to the tournament’s final when they edged Bangladesh by 11 runs in their last Super Four outing on Thursday and all that matters now for the side are the title honours. Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Dubai, Salman said: “Every individual has their own way. If a player wants to be aggressive, then why not? If you take aggression away from a fast bowler, then there’s nothing left.” He was responding to an Indian journalist’s question about his responsibility as captain to keep his players’ actions in check. “Every player knows how to deal with their emotions. I give the players a free hand unless they are disrespecting someone or causing disrespect to our country,” the Pakistani skipper added. Speaking on the refusal of customary post-match handshakes by the Indian men’s team, Salman said: “I’ve been playing since 2007, I’ve never seen teams not shake hands … I don’t think there has been an instance of players not shaking hands.” He added that on previous occasions, even under worse circumstances between the two countries, handshakes still took place. The Pakistan captain added that he hoped that his team had “saved their best for the final”. Asked about media reports from across the border that the Indian captain had refused to attend the captains’ photoshoot ahead of the final, Salman said: “That’s their choice, we have our own protocols to follow. “If he (Yadav) wants to attend, he can attend — but if he doesn’t want to, then that’s up to him.” On Friday, India captain Suryakumar Yadav was found guilty by the ICC of breaching the code of conduct for his comments that alluded to the brief military conflict between India and Pakistan this year, after their group stage match in the Asia Cup on September 14, ESPNcricinfo reported . “It is understood Suryakumar’s not-guilty plea was rejected by ICC match referee Richie Richardson and that he was fined 30pc of his match fee. India have appealed against the verdict,” the publication reported. The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its September 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”. At least 24 people had been killed in the April attack, which led to a brief military escalation between India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence. “The PCB had demanded the ICC impose a Level 4 sanction — reserved for the most serious breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct — on Suryakumar. It cited past examples of players who were either prevented from what was deemed political messaging or fined for deploying it,” the ESPNcricinfo report added. Pakistan’s pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four stage match against India, ESPNCricinfo added. According to the publication, the pacer was fined 30 per cent of his match fee by match referee Richie Richardson. At the same time, “It is understood that Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan was not fined and let off with a warning by Richardson“. Pakistan won by 11 runs after stumbling to 135-8 in the virtual semi-final against Bangladesh in their men’s Asia Cup Super Four fixture at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday. With that win, the Green Shirts booked their final date with archrivals India for the first time in the 17th iteration of the Asia Cup on Sunday.",

      "summary_orig": "The Houthi rebels, who control swathes of Yemen, have used an array of sophisticated weapons — including ballistic missiles and “kamikaze” drones — in attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea in protest against Israel’s ongoing military onslaught in the Gaza Strip. Attacks on cargo ships and fuel tankers began in November 2023, when Houthi hijacked the Galaxy Leader cargo vessel as it was passing through the southern Red Sea. They redirected it toward Hodeidah port in Yemen and seized the crew. Since then, at least 43 more ships have been attacked in the area, with four seafarers killed and two vessels sunk. The Houthi attacks have disrupted international commerce, forcing international shipping to take the long route around South Africa to avoid being struck. Around 12 per cent of shipping passes through the Red Sea and the increase in delivery costs is stoking fears it could trigger a fresh bout of global inflation. Recent developments between Tel Aviv and Sanaa include the killing of the Houthi government’s prime minister and several other ministers in an Israeli strike on the Yemeni capital, while the Houthis have launched missiles and drones at Israel, targeting Tel Aviv and other cities like Eilat , where a Houthi drone wounded 22 people earlier this week. The Houthis have also hit American vessels during this almost two-year-long period, prompting the United States to launch a series of strikes, the most recent ones being in March. Who are the Houthis? In the late 1990s, the Houthi family in Yemen’s far north set up a religious revival movement for the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam, which had once ruled the country but whose northern heartland had become impoverished and marginalised. As friction with the government grew, they fought a series of guerrilla wars with the national army and a brief border conflict with Saudi Arabia. A civil war broke out in late 2014, when Sanaa was seized by the Houthis. Worried by the growing influence of Iran along its border, Saudi Arabia intervened at the head of a Western-backed coalition in March 2015 in support of the Saudi-backed government. The Houthis established control over much of the north and other big population centres, while the internationally recognised government based itself in Aden. Yemen enjoyed a period of relative calm amid a UN-led peace push , but the Houthi attacks on Israel have increased the risks of conflict in the country. Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping The Houthis say their attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea are a show of solidarity for the Palestinians and Hamas amid the latter’s fighting with Israel. Since November 2023, the Houthis have launched more than 100 attacks on ships off Yemen’s coast, causing traffic passing through the Suez Canal to fall by 75pc in 2024 and increasing transit times by an average of seven to 14 days, according to US-based supply chain management technology company project44. While the militia has said it attacked only vessels with links to Israel, the US and Britain, shipping industry sources have said all ships were at risk. A handout picture released by the Houthis’ ’media centre’ shows what they claim to be a missile, targeting a Liberia-flagged crude oil tanker in the Red Sea in July 2024. — AFP/File A period of relative calm started in January this year alongside the Gaza ceasefire , but the group then warned in March it would resume its naval strikes if Israel did not lift a blockage of aid into Gaza. They then announced a resumption of attacks with immediate effect on March 12. The Israeli response Since November 2023, Israel has intercepted multiple drones and missiles launched from Yemen and also struck Houthi facilities in response. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu detailed Tel Aviv’s military activity over the past year, stating, “We’ve hammered the Houthis. “So here’s where things stand today: half the Houthi leadership in Yemen [is] gone,“ he said. Over the past six months alone, Israel has launched devastating strikes on Yemen, targeting Sanaa , Houthi leadership, Houthi-controlled areas , ports and energy facilities . The port of Hodeida — a key entry point for Yemeni aid — has been struck several times over the past year, in April , May , June and July . Smoke billows after an Israeli air strike on Sanaa, Yemen on August 24. — AFP/File Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed earlier this month to inflict the biblical 10 plagues of Egypt on the Houthis after they stepped up missile attacks against Israel. The Houthis are firing missiles at Israel again. A plague of darkness, a plague of the firstborn — we will complete all 10 plagues,” Katz posted on X. He was referring to the 10 disasters that the Book of Exodus says were inflicted on Egypt by the Hebrew God to convince the pharaoh to free the enslaved Israelites. What happens now? Based on this pattern of tit-for-tat strikes, it is likely that these attacks and interceptions will continue until Israel ceases military operations in Gaza — that have only intensified. Today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that a liquefied petroleum gas tanker with 27 crew members, including 24 Pakistanis, was attacked by an Israeli drone while it was docked at a port in Yemen earlier this month. Naqvi added that an LPG tank had exploded following the attack, but the crew managed to extinguish the fire. “The vessel was subsequently stopped by Houthi boats and the crew were held hostage aboard the ship,” he said, adding that the tanker and its crew “have now been released by the Houthis and are out of Yemeni waters”.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces have killed 17 “India-sponsored” terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media affairs wing said on Saturday. According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted the IBO on the night between Friday and Saturday, on the “reported presence of khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij .” The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). During the operation, “own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and resultantly, seventeen Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the ISPR statement said. It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, “who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as [in the] killing of innocent civilians”. The statement said a sanitisation operation was being conducted to “eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khwarji found in the area”. The ISPR also reaffirmed the security forces’ determination to wipe out the menace of “Indian-sponsored terrorism” from the country. President Asif Ali Zardari has congratulated the security forces on their successful operation in Lakki Marwat, according to a statement issued by his secretariat. He paid tribute to the courage and sacrifices of the forces, saying “their efforts reflect the nation’s firm resolve to eradicate Indian proxy terrorism from Pakistan”. “The complete elimination of Fitna al Khwarij and its networks is vital for lasting peace and stability in the country,” he added President Zardari reaffirmed that the entire nation stands united with its valiant armed forces in the fight against terrorism. Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel. In August, terrorists in Lakki Marwat had carried out a series of militant attacks, killing three soldiers and a woman while injuring three others, including two soldiers.

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday that a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tanker with 27 crew members, including 24 Pakistanis, was attacked by an Israeli drone while it was docked at a port in Yemen earlier this month. After the Foreign Office (FO) said earlier today that Pakistanis aboard the LPG tanker were safe and sound and making their way out of Yemeni waters, Naqvi posted on X that the vessel was attacked on September 17 while it was docked at the Ras Issa port, which was under the control of Houthi rebels. Israel has launched repeated attacks on Houthi targets during the Gaza conflict, as the Iran-backed rebels fire missiles and drones at Israel and Red Sea shipping, claiming solidarity with the Palestinian cause. According to Naqvi, apart from Pakistanis, the LPG tanker’s crew included two Sri Lankans and a Nepali. He said the vessel’s captain was also a Pakistani. Naqvi added that an LPG tank had exploded following the attack, but the crew managed to extinguish the fire. “The vessel was subsequently stopped by Houthi boats and the crew were held hostage aboard the ship,” he said, adding that the tanker and its crew “have now been released by the Houthis and are out of Yemeni waters”. Naqvi said he was “profoundly grateful to Secretary Interior Khurram Agha and other MOI (Ministry of Interior) officers, Ambassador Naveed Bokhari and his team in Oman, our colleagues in Saudi Arabia, and especially the officials of our security agencies who worked day and night under extraordinary conditions to secure the safe release of our citizens when hope was fading”. Earlier, the FO said 24 Pakistani nationals aboard the vessel were safe and sound and making their way out of Yemeni waters. The FO also said that the tanker had caught fire off the coast of Yemen on September 17, adding that upon receiving the news about the incident, the relevant Pakistan embassies had established contacts with the authorities in Yemen to ensure the well-being of the crew. “Efforts were made to set the tanker underway again,” it added. The FO further stated that diplomatic missions also maintained contact with the family members of the Pakistani crew and kept them updated about the latest situation. “Today, the LPG tanker has departed [from the] port and is making [its] way out of Yemeni waters. The entire crew, including Pakistani nationals, on board is safe and sound,” it said.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has decided to shut down 16 Afghan refugee camps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Balochistan, and Punjab as the repatriation of refugees continues. The federal government last month informed the provinces that the formal repatriation and deportation of over 1.3 million Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards will begin on September 1. The decision followed the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that PoR cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30. According to notifications dated September 25, 2025 and issued by theMinistry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron) — copies of which are available with Dawn.com — denotified camps are located in Haripur, Chitral and Upper Dir in KP, Chaghai, Loralai, Killa Saifullah, Pishin and Quetta in Balochistan, and Mianwali in Punjab. When asked about the opinion on denotifying camps where thousands of refugees are staying, the Afghan Chief Commission did not respond to a request for comment. Haji Abdul Samad, who is representative of a main camp in Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told Dawn.com this week that local officials have told him to vacate the camp in accordance with the government’s policy. He, however, said there has been no raid, arrest or pressure on refugees to leave the Panian camp, which houses about 13,000 families and over 90,000 refugees, according to Abdul Samad. Chief Minister KP Ali Amin Khan Gandapur stated on a number of occasions that his government will not force refugees to return. The Safron ministry notifications say all lands within the denotified areas will be handed over to the provincial governments and deputy commissioners of the concerned districts. They also read that all non-movable assets within the notified area will also be handed over to the provinces and deputy commissioners. Most of the camps had been set up in early 1980s when refugees started coming to Pakistan after the invasion of the erstwhile Soviet Union. UNHCR concerned United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency, has shown concern at Pakistan’s decision to denotify some of the refugee villages. It reiterated that returns to Afghanistan should be voluntary, phased, safe and dignified. “Many of the people affected are Afghan refugees who have lived for years in these villages and have expressed great despair about how this development is going to impact on their lives,” spokesperson for UNHCR Pakistan, Qaiser Khan Afridi, told Dawn.com on Saturday. “In particular, UNHCR urges that people with international protection needs and those with humanitarian considerations face particular challenges and should be protected against (forced) returns,” Afridi said. Pakistan started repatriation of Afghan refugees in 2023 over security concerns and amid tension with the Taliban government . Pakistan also argues that war has ended in Afghanistan and refugees should go back. However, the refugees complain about the lack of transport. They say that they face problems finding trucks for shifting their household goods. Gada Ali Khan Zadran, a representative of the refugees at Mianwali camp, told Dawn.com that refugees are facing difficulties in finding transport to take household items to Afghanistan. Zadran also said that the fare of transport has also been increased from Rs300,000 to 600,000. According to UNHCR, there were over 1.3 million Afghans in Pakistan as of June 30, 2025. More than half of them (717,945) lived in KP, 326,584 in Balochistan, 195,188 in Punjab, 75,510 in Sindh and 43,154 in Islamabad.",

      "summary_en": "Pakistan has decided to shut down 16 Afghan refugee camps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Balochistan, and Punjab as the repatriation of refugees continues. The federal government last month informed the provinces that the formal repatriation and deportation of over 1.3 million Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards will begin on September 1.

      "summary_orig": "As some Western leaders recognise a Palestinian state, Israel seems to have entered panic mode. Tel Aviv has done again what it does best: attacking unarmed civilians. Late on Tuesday night, the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) — a collection of boats carrying humanitarian aid with rights activists, doctors, parliamentarians, journalists and others — was hit by Israeli drones as they entered the final stretch of their journey to Gaza. The aid boats are carrying delegations from over 40 countries, including Pakistan, which aim to distribute vital humanitarian aid such as baby formula, food, water and medicine to the malnourished, forcibly displaced and injured civilians suffering from almost two years of genocide , as classified by the United Nations. A group of ships from the Global Sumud Flotilla to Gaza are shown moored at the small island of Koufonisi, near the south of the island of Crete, Greece on September 26. — AFP According to a statement issued by the GSF, at least 14 boats were targeted with explosive and incendiary devices while in Greek waters. Emergency communication devices were also disabled and “calculated physical damage designed to render the ships unseaworthy”. Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the flotilla, told Dawn.com that his vessel was safe during the attacks. Recalling that night, he said that around 15 drones carried out 12 strikes. “They partially damaged around seven or eight of our boats,“ Khan said. “We were able to fix the damage and the boats are still seaworthy. “They jammed our communication systems, the systems we use to reach out to the international community for help were jammed,” he said. Khan stated that Israeli forces used sound bombs, flares and chemical agents to inflict “psychological warfare aimed at instilling fear in the participants”. The former senator said that the convoy has left Greek waters and is still en route to Gaza, expecting to enter international waters soon. He added that the next two to three days are crucial for the mission. “We have been travelling non-stop and will enter international waters soon. This stretch is extremely important because the moment we enter international waters, Gaza will be right in front of us.” Khan revealed that EU states warned of an impending escalation of attacks on the convoy as it neared Gaza. “An attack on this flotilla would be an act of terrorism,” he stressed. He reiterated that the flotilla’s mission is peaceful and its goal is to break the blockade and deliver life-saving humanitarian aid. Two days prior to the attack, the Israeli foreign ministry’s account on X posted a lengthy statement in which it slapped the ‘Hamas’ label on the flotilla convoy and asserted that it “will not allow the breach of a ‘lawful’ naval blockade”. Moreover, it suggested unloading the aid at Israel’s Ashkelon Marina port from where it would supposedly be delivered to the very enclave Israeli forces are starving and continuously bombing. When asked about the flotilla being labelled a part of Hamas by Tel Aviv, the former senator dismissed it as propaganda. “They have threatened us and attacked us, but people are now seeing Israel’s true face,” he replied. “Are these activists, actors and lawmakers terrorists?” Italy, which has stated its intention to recognise a Palestinian state — on the condition that all hostages are released and that Hamas is excluded, as outlined by its Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni — has not only condemned the attack but has dispatched two navy ships to assist the flotilla. Sailing boats, part of the Global Sumud Flotilla, sail off Crete island, Greece on September 25. — Reuters Italy’s Defence Minister Guido Crosetto stated last Thursday that the country had sent two of their naval vessels to assist the Italian participants on the GSF. “It is not an act of war, it is not a provocation: it is an act of humanity, which is a duty of a state towards its citizens,” he told the upper house of parliament. Following Italy’s lead, Spain announced that it has deployed a navy warship to help the aid convoy. However, Khan made it clear that these vessels are “not for action”, but rather for relief and rescue. According to the GSF, “hundreds of elected representatives from across the EU” have demanded the immediate protection of the Global Sumud Flotilla. The coalition also posted the penned appeal to EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on their Instagram platform. Using Italy and Spain as an example, Khan called on the Pakistani government to take action and aid the flotilla. “No official has reached out, nor have they raised this at international fora like the UN and the OIC,” he lamented. “The Pakistan government should state their support for the Global Sumud Flotilla and should condemn the attack. Like Italy and Spain who have sent their navy ships, Pakistan should dispatch a mission. If they cannot send navy ships then they should send a civilian humanitarian mission, something like Rescue 1122, so it can help in rescue efforts,” he stressed. During his conversation with Dawn.com , Khan noted that parliament also has a role to play in raising its voice against the attack. “Pakistan’s parliament and parliamentarians should also play their part.” On September 19, Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) issued a statement calling attention to the GSF and highlighting Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s concerns about its safety. The statement read that FM Dar, along with his counterparts from Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Ireland, Libya, Malaysia, the Maldives, Mexico, Oman, Qatar, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain and Turkiye, expressed concerns about the security of the flotilla. “We therefore call on everyone to refrain from any unlawful or violent act against the flotilla, to respect international law and international humanitarian law,” the FO said. Replying to a question about nations recognising a Palestinian state, the ex-senator expressed displeasure with the fact that European nations are recognising the state according to the 1967 borders and excluding Hamas from the governance process. “They are not recognising the state according to the 1948 borders, but those from 1967,” he explained. “In doing so, they are ignoring the government, currency and other aspects of the state from that time. “Hamas is a governing entity which won an election. I demand that Israel grant Palestinians political independence.” Meanwhile, the Israeli foreign ministry account on X posted another proposal, this time to unload the aid at any country outside Israel. “If this is not about provocation and serving Hamas, you are welcome to unload any aid you might have at any port in a nearby country outside Israel,” the post read. Resorting to threats is all Israel seems to know, as the post ends with the question of whether the GSF’s humanitarian mission is about “aid or provocation“. According to Reuters , Italy suggested that the GSF could leave the aid at Cyprus and that it would then be handed to the Catholic Church’s Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, who would then distribute it in Gaza. Reacting to their country’s recommendation, Italian volunteers on the GSF categorically rejected the notion of dropping aid in Cyprus. The Italian group, in a statement, said that their mission stays “true to its original goal of breaking [Israel’s] illegal siege and delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged population of Gaza.” Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar accused the participants of the GSF by stating that their rejection of Italy’s compromise was supposed proof that “their real purpose is provocation and serving Hamas“. Israel seems to think it owns the seas and can do what it likes without consequence, including attacking humanitarian vessels on international waters. In the backdrop of the 80th UNGA , the apartheid state continues to bomb Gaza and extend its aggression to those trying to address the plight of its civilian population. Greta Thunberg gestures next to a Palestinian flag on a ship, part of the Global Sumud Flotilla, off Crete island, Greece on September 25. — Reuters The latest attack on the flotilla is the third of its kind; however, this time, Israel has faced condemnation for the attack. The first two strikes, which took place on September 10 and 11 in Tunisian waters, targeted the ‘Family’ and ‘Alma’ boats. Footage of incendiary devices striking the boats was circulated on social media with calls for an investigation. Tunisian authorities, however, denied that any foreign device had intercepted their airspace. On Friday, Kieran Andrieu — one of the participants on the ‘Family’ boat — said in a video message that the vessel had been decommissioned due to engine failure and would not sail to Gaza. “The good news is that there are enough spaces on all of the other boats for people to be reallocated, so we are waiting to hear about reallocation and about who’s going where,” he said. Echoing the sentiments of all the participants on the flotilla, the former JI senator placed emphasis on the commitment to reach Gaza and distribute humanitarian aid. “We will not stop, we will reach Gaza under any circumstance. We will deliver humanitarian aid, we will break the siege and we will stand against genocide.

      "summary_en": "As some Western leaders recognise a Palestinian state, Israel seems to have entered panic mode. Tel Aviv has done again what it does best: attacking unarmed civilians. Late on Tuesday night, the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) — a collection of boats carrying humanitarian aid with rights activists, doctors, parliamentarians, journalists and others — was hit by Israeli drones as they entered the final stretch of their journey to Gaza. The aid boats are carrying delegations from over 40 countries, including Pakistan, which aim to distribute vital humanitarian aid such as baby formula, food, water and medicine to the malnourished, forcibly displaced and injured civilians suffering from almost two years of genocide , as classified by the United Nations. A group of ships from the Global Sumud Flotilla to Gaza are shown moored at the small island of Koufonisi, near the south of the island of Crete, Greece on September 26. — AFP According to a statement issued by the GSF, at least 14 boats were targeted with explosive and incendiary devices while in Greek waters. Emergency communication devices were also disabled and “calculated physical damage designed to render the ships unseaworthy”. Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the flotilla, told Dawn.com that his vessel was safe during the attacks. Recalling that night, he said that around 15 drones carried out 12 strikes. “They partially damaged around seven or eight of our boats,“ Khan said. “We were able to fix the damage and the boats are still seaworthy. “They jammed our communication systems, the systems we use to reach out to the international community for help were jammed,” he said. Khan stated that Israeli forces used sound bombs, flares and chemical agents to inflict “psychological warfare aimed at instilling fear in the participants”. The former senator said that the convoy has left Greek waters and is still en route to Gaza, expecting to enter international waters soon. He added that the next two to three days are crucial for the mission. “We have been travelling non-stop and will enter international waters soon. This stretch is extremely important because the moment we enter international waters, Gaza will be right in front of us.” Khan revealed that EU states warned of an impending escalation of attacks on the convoy as it neared Gaza. “An attack on this flotilla would be an act of terrorism,” he stressed. He reiterated that the flotilla’s mission is peaceful and its goal is to break the blockade and deliver life-saving humanitarian aid. Two days prior to the attack, the Israeli foreign ministry’s account on X posted a lengthy statement in which it slapped the ‘Hamas’ label on the flotilla convoy and asserted that it “will not allow the breach of a ‘lawful’ naval blockade”. Moreover, it suggested unloading the aid at Israel’s Ashkelon Marina port from where it would supposedly be delivered to the very enclave Israeli forces are starving and continuously bombing. When asked about the flotilla being labelled a part of Hamas by Tel Aviv, the former senator dismissed it as propaganda. “They have threatened us and attacked us, but people are now seeing Israel’s true face,” he replied. “Are these activists, actors and lawmakers terrorists?” Italy, which has stated its intention to recognise a Palestinian state — on the condition that all hostages are released and that Hamas is excluded, as outlined by its Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni — has not only condemned the attack but has dispatched two navy ships to assist the flotilla. Sailing boats, part of the Global Sumud Flotilla, sail off Crete island, Greece on September 25. — Reuters Italy’s Defence Minister Guido Crosetto stated last Thursday that the country had sent two of their naval vessels to assist the Italian participants on the GSF. “It is not an act of war, it is not a provocation: it is an act of humanity, which is a duty of a state towards its citizens,” he told the upper house of parliament. Following Italy’s lead, Spain announced that it has deployed a navy warship to help the aid convoy. However, Khan made it clear that these vessels are “not for action”, but rather for relief and rescue. According to the GSF, “hundreds of elected representatives from across the EU” have demanded the immediate protection of the Global Sumud Flotilla. The coalition also posted the penned appeal to EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on their Instagram platform. Using Italy and Spain as an example, Khan called on the Pakistani government to take action and aid the flotilla. “No official has reached out, nor have they raised this at international fora like the UN and the OIC,” he lamented. “The Pakistan government should state their support for the Global Sumud Flotilla and should condemn the attack. Like Italy and Spain who have sent their navy ships, Pakistan should dispatch a mission. If they cannot send navy ships then they should send a civilian humanitarian mission, something like Rescue 1122, so it can help in rescue efforts,” he stressed.

      "summary_orig": "NEW YORK: The foreign ministers of China, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, in a joint statement, have urged Afghan­istan to take “effective, concrete, and verifiable actions” to dismantle terrorist groups operating from its territory. The foreign ministers in a meeting on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session reaffirmed support for Afghanistan as an “independent, united, and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war, and narcotics”, but underlined the need to prevent terrorists from using Afghan soil. The four Asian states have been holding quadripartite consultations on Afghanistan since 2017, aimed at promoting reg­ional stability and coordinating efforts to counter terrorism, narcotics, and extremism emanating from Afghan territory. This informal grouping, which meets at ministerial and special representative levels, also seeks to facilitate political dialogue and regional economic integration in Afghanistan. They expressed deep concern over the presence of groups such as ISIL, Al-Qaida, Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan (TTP), the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Jaish ul-Adl, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the Majeed Brigade, and others, calling them a “serious threat to regional and global security.” The joint statement emphasised that strengthening peace and stability in Afghanistan and countering terrorism, radicalism, and narcotics are “common interests in the region”. The four sides also called for adjustments to the 1988 UN sanctions regime in line with ground realities, including travel exemptions for some Taliban officials; stressed the need for continued humanitarian assistance to Afghans, urging that aid be delinked from political considerations; supported regional economic initiatives to ease Afghan­is­tan’s dire situation and integrate it into regional trade and connectivity; and appealed to the international community to intensify emergency huma­nitarian aid while reaffirming their willingness to exp­and economic cooperation with Afghanistan. The ministers affirmed their support for diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a political settlement of the Afghan issue and backed the role of the international community, particularly the United Nat­ions. They noted the importance of regi­o­nal mechanisms such as the Moscow For­mat, the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting of Afghanistan’s Neighb­ouring Countries, and the Shanghai Co­operation Organisa­tion (SCO) in advancing a political solution. They welcomed the joint meeting of the Special Representatives of China, Iran, Pak­is­­tan, and Russia on Afghan­istan, held on Sept 12 in Dushanbe and encouraged the con­­tinuation of these quadrilateral consultations.

      "summary_orig": "• PM doubles compensation for families of victims to Rs2m • 161,000 houses, 395 health facilities damaged in Punjab, UNOCHA says • Senate panel told deluges left 1,000 dead, millions displaced ISLAMABAD: As millions of people have been affected and hundreds of casualties reported across the country during the recent floods and monsoon rains , the prime minister has raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives from Rs1 million to Rs2m. More than 4.2 million people in 18 districts of Punjab have been affected by the recent floods, with Muzaffargarh alone accounting for over a quarter of the total, according to a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) report released by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). Muzaffargarh, located on the bank of the Chenab River, is followed by Jhang with 646,000 affected people (15.3 per cent), Bahawalpur with 514,000 (12.2pc), Khanewal with 397,000 (9.4pc), and Multan with 347,000 (8.2pc). Other affected districts include Vehari, Bahawalnagar, Hafizabad, Okara, Chiniot, Gujrat, Rahim Yar Khan, Kasur, Sialkot, Mandi Bahauddin, Narowal, Dera Ghazi Khan and Gujranwala. The RNA, conducted from Sept 8 to 18 in collaboration with the government, covered 1,928 mouzas in these 18 flood-hit districts. Out of 161,000 houses assessed, about 115,700 were partially damaged and 46,000 fully or severely damaged, leaving thousands of families without adequate shelter. More than 93pc of the assessed locations reported some level of housing damage, with the highest numbers in Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, Khanewal and Jhang. Approximately 2.8m people have been displaced, many forced to leave flooded, damaged or destroyed homes. According to the report, the affected population faces urgent shelter and non-food item (NFI) needs, particularly tents, tarpaulins, GI sheets, plastic sheeting and winterisation kits, including blankets, bedding, mats, shawls, mosquito nets and warm clothes. Health facilities A total of 742 health facilities were assessed across the 18 districts; 395 were reported damaged — 315 partially and 80 fully or severely — posing a serious threat to the continuity of healthcare services. The highest proportions of damage were observed in Gujranwala, Bahawalnagar and Okara. In absolute terms, Bahawalnagar recorded the greatest impact with 64 facilities damaged, followed by Jhang (55) and Muzaffargarh (46). Other districts also reported significant damage, including Bahawalpur (35), Chiniot (39) and Khanewal (25), with several facilities fully destroyed. By contrast, Mandi Bahauddin (8pc), Vehari (17pc) and Dera Ghazi Khan (22pc) reported relatively limited impact. The scale of damage in the hardest-hit districts underscores the urgent need to restore and reinforce health infrastructure, as disruptions could reduce access to essential care, delay outbreak response and heighten community vulnerability. The RNA highlights a significant disease burden across 1,928 flood-affected villages. Malaria was the most reported health concern (64pc of assessed villages), followed by skin infections and diarrhoea, indicating deteriorating water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Dengue was also reported at considerable levels, adding to the challenge of vector-borne diseases. Educational institutions According to the School Education Department, floods damaged 667 schools across the 18 districts, of which 54pc were girls’ schools. Moreover, 217 schools were repurposed as evacuation centres, affecting 101,263 enrolled students. Most damage was recorded in Sialkot (210 schools), followed by Jhang (110), Gujrat (83), Muzaffargarh and Kot Addu (82 each), and Rahim Yar Khan (15). Nearly 97,000 water supply schemes were reported damaged. Over one-third of the assessed villages reported damage to these schemes. Of the 48,500 fully damaged schemes, 60pc were in Muzaffargarh, 12pc in Jhang, and 10pc in Bahawalpur. Before the floods, communities in most districts relied heavily on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods. Crop farming was the primary source of income for over 85pc of communities in Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Kasur, Khanewal, and Vehari, with similarly high levels in Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Chiniot, Multan, and Narowal. Livestock Livestock rearing engaged more than 70pc of communities in most areas, while daily wage labour was a key income source in Bahawalnagar, Gujranwala, and Khanewal.  Floods have devastated these livelihoods by damaging crops, killing livestock, and disrupting agricultural cycles, leaving many households without produce or animals to sell. As farming activities stall, wage opportunities linked to farm work and local markets are shrinking, pushing vulnerable communities deeper into income loss and food insecurity. Most communities reported having food stocks lasting only a week or less. Food insecurity is most critical in Multan, where 81.7pc of communities reported very limited stocks. Similarly, 76.2pc in Bahawalnagar, 74pc in Muzaffargarh, and 61.5pc in Bahawalpur said their food would run out within days. Ex-gratia assistance Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat was informed that the premier raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives during the floods from Rs1m to Rs2m. The revised compensation package will have a financial impact of about Rs2.033 billion. The committee’s meeting, chaired by Senator Rana Mehmoodul Hassan, was briefed on the overall flood situation by a member of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). He reported that around 1,000 people had died in the recent floods, while about 1,000 others had sustained various injuries. He added that the numbers were expected to rise once rescue, evacuation, and relief operations were completed and floodwaters receded. The NDMA said around three million people had been rescued or evacuated between June 26 and Sept 19. The committee was also told the floods damaged 12,559 houses and resulted in the loss of 6,509 livestock. The figures are expected to rise as assessments continued. The meeting was attended by senators Saadia Abbasi, Ataur Rehman, Aimal Wali Khan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir, Dr Afnanullah Khan, and Shahadat Awan, along with the secretary of the Establishment Division, special secretary of the Cabinet Division, chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and other senior officials.

He reported that around 1,000 people had died in the recent floods, while about 1,000 others had sustained various injuries. He added that the numbers were expected to rise once rescue, evacuation, and relief operations were completed and floodwaters receded. The NDMA said around three million people had been rescued or evacuated between June 26 and Sept 19. The committee was also told the floods damaged 12,559 houses and resulted in the loss of 6,509 livestock. The figures are expected to rise as assessments continued. The meeting was attended by senators Saadia Abbasi, Ataur Rehman, Aimal Wali Khan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir, Dr Afnanullah Khan, and Shahadat Awan, along with the secretary of the Establishment Division, special secretary of the Cabinet Division, chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and other senior officials.

      "summary_orig": "UNITED NATIONS: As President Donald Trump claimed being close to a deal to end the war in Gaza and bring prisoners home, an increasingly isolated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday tried to rebut what he called “the false charge of genocide”. He also denounced several Western countries for embracing Palestinian statehood, accusing them of pushing his country into “national suicide”. The Israeli leader, who has an International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes, addressed mostly empty chairs in the UN General Assembly , as scores of delegates — including the Pakistan contingent — walked out when he took the stage. At the same time, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters blocked traffic near Times Square in New York to protest the killing of more than 65,000 people in Gaza by Israeli strikes in less than two years. Israeli leader speaks to empty chairs as scores of delegates exit UNGA hall to boycott his address “War criminals don’t deserve any peace of mind. They don’t deserve any sleep,” said Andrea Mirez, a young woman who kept up an overnight noisy protest outside Netanyahu’s hotel. In his speech, days after France, Britain and other Western powers amid worldwide protests against the ongoing war on Gaza recognised the state of Palestine, he showed a map of the Middle East, taking out a pen to cross out adversaries Israel has killed. He also vowed to “finish the job” against Hamas, even as President Donald Trump said he thought he had sealed a deal on a ceasefire. A senior White House official told Reuters that Trump will meet Netanyahu on Monday in Washington with the aim of reaching a framework for a deal. In his speech, Netanyahu claimed that over time, many world leaders buckled. “They buckled under the pressure of a biased media, radical Islamist constituencies and antisemitic mobs… Behind closed doors, many of the leaders who publicly condemn us privately thank us. They tell me how much they value Israel’s superb intelligence services that have prevented, time and again, terrorist attacks in their capitals,” he claimed. However, he did not touch on the issue of annexing the occupied West Bank. Benjamin Netanyahu holds a map of the Middle East during his speech.—AFP Response to speech Gaza authorities described Netanyahu’s speech as one “filled with lies and blatant contradictions” and condemned it as a “desperate attempt to justify the war crimes and acts of genocide.” “Boycotting Netanyahu’s speech is one manifestation of Israel’s isolation and the consequences of the war of extermination,” Taher al-Nunu, the media adviser to the head of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement. Also, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, earlier speaking by video after the US denied him a visa, condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza as “a war of genocide”. He thanked the countries that recognised Palestinian statehood, pledged that Palestinian Authority would be ready to govern post-war Gaza. New coalition to back Palestine On the other hand, 12 countries — Britain, France, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia and Switzerland — announced a new coalition to financially support the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority as Israel withheld tax revenues of Palestinian Authority for past two years. The Emergency Coalition for the Financial Sustainability of the Palestinian Authority “was established in response to the urgent and unprecedented financial crisis” confronting the PA, the Spanish foreign ministry said. It aims to stabilise the Ramallah-based body’s finances, preserve its ability to govern, provide essential services and maintain security, “all of which are indispensable to regional stability and to preserving the two-state solution”, the statement added.
