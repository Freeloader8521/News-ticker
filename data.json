      "summary_orig": "Former Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha was formally appointed as South Korea's ambassador to the United States on Wednesday, according to Seoul's foreign ministry. Kang, who served as South Korea's top diplomat from 2017 to 2021 under former President Moon Jae-in, has become the Lee Jae Myung administration's first ambassador in Washington. Kang has extensive experience in working with the United Nations, especially in the field of human rights, including the U.N. deputy high commissioner for human rights in 2006. Experts said Kang is well fit for Seoul's top envoy in charge of seeking close policy coordination with the United States at a time when expectations are growing that North Korea and the U.S. may resume diplomacy. Kang is widely expected to first coordinate U.S. President Donald Trump's upcoming trip to South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and summit talks between Lee and Trump. As Seoul's top envoy, Kang also faces the daunting tasks of negotiating tariff talks with the U.S. and dealing with Washington's move to \"modernize\" the South Korea-U.S. al",

      "summary_orig": "The death toll from a 6.9-magnitude earthquake that hit the central Philippines has risen to 69, a disaster official said on Wednesday as the government mobilised agencies to search for survivors and restore power and water supplies. In Bogo city in the north of Cebu province, which was near the epicentre of the shallow quake that struck off the coast just before 10 p.m. on Tuesday, the hospital has been “overwhelmed,” Civil Defence official Raffy Alejandro told reporters. The death toll of 69 was based on data from the Cebu provincial disaster office and was subject to validation, said Jane Abapo, an information officer at the regional Civil Defence office. Another official said more than 150 people were injured. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr assured survivors of swift assistance, saying cabinet secretaries were on the ground directing relief operations, as he expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones. Cebu, one of the Philippines’ most popular tourist destinations, is home to 3.4 million people. Despite the damage, Mactan-Cebu International Airport, the country’s second busiest gateway, remained operational. Another hard-hit town, San Remigio was placed under a state of calamity to help the response and relief efforts. Vice Mayor Alfie Reynes appealed for food and water for evacuees, as well as heavy equipment to aid search and rescue workers. “It is raining heavily and there is no electricity, so we really need help, especially in the northern part because there’s a scarcity of water after supply lines were damaged by the earthquake,” Reynes told DZMM radio. In the nearby town of Pilar, resident Archel Coraza said most of his family were asleep when their house began to shake violently. “I woke them up and we all rushed outside into the street,” he told DZMM . Coraza, who lives close to the shoreline, said he saw seawater recede after the tremor. Local media posted videos of people rushing out of their homes as the ground shook and buildings collapsed, including a church that was more than 100 years old. Reynes said among the deceased were some people who had been playing basketball in a sports complex in San Remigio when it partially collapsed due to the quake. Earthquake monitoring agencies put the quake’s depth at around 10 km (6.2 miles) and recorded multiple aftershocks, the strongest having a magnitude of 6. There was no tsunami threat following the quake. The Philippines lies in the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where volcanic activity and earthquakes are common. The country had two major earthquakes in January, with no casualties reported. In 2023, a 6.7 magnitude offshore earthquake killed eight people.",

      "summary_orig": "WITH one in four Pakistanis suffering and over Rs250 billion lost annually, the refusal to fund mental health is philanthropy’s costliest neglect. Despite mental health disorders being among the leading causes of disability worldwide, philanthropy continues to look the other way. While billions are poured into visible projects, the silent epidemic of depression, anxiety and suicide remains neglected. This neglect is not only unjust; it is economically reckless. Less than one per cent of global charitable donations are directed towards mental health, even though the burden rivals — and often surpasses — that of heart disease, cancer, or diabetes. In Pakistan, where over 50 million people suffer from mental health conditions, this is not a marginal issue. With one in four Pakistanis affected, almost every household has someone struggling with mental health concerns. Yet it remains largely invisible in our daily discourse The lack of philanthropy in mental health is both myopic and shameful. The economic burden is staggering. The annual cost of mental illness in Pakistan in 2005-2006 was estimated at Rs250bn, mostly through lost productivity. It is estimated that by 2020, that figure had doubled to nearly Rs617bn. It has only grown since. Each student kept from realising his/her full potential, each employee unable to work effectively, each life lost to suicide is not just a personal tragedy — it is a direct hit to the economy. For a country already struggling with growth and employment, investment in mental health is not a soft choice but a smart one. It is also important, even urgent, to understand that untreated mental illness magnifies the burden of other diseases. Stress is a strong risk factor for heart disease; depression worsens outcomes in cancer and accelerates diabetes complications; anxiety exacerbates every acute and chronic illness. Families whose resources are already stretched by medical bills see their health costs multiply when mental illness is ignored. Communities lose their stability and societies lose their resilience. The crisis is also concentrated in the very group we most depend on: the young. With 64 per cent of the population under 30, Pakistan should be reaping the dividends of its youth bulge. Instead, many students and early-career professionals are confronting what has globally been described as a mental health time bomb. Depression, anxiety and substance abuse are disproportionately common among the young, fuelled by unemployment, inflation, climate change and political instability. Young employees are voicing these concerns. Across industries, Gen Z and millennials are consistently calling for employers to prioritise wellness. They want mental health literacy in workplaces, access to quality helplines, stress management programmes, and healthier environments. For multinationals and local organisations alike, ignoring these demands would be a mistake. Companies that fail to invest in mental health lose their best talent to those that do. Yet despite these costs, mental health remains at the margins of philanthropy. One of the main reasons remains stigma — many donors are hesitant to associate publicly with a cause still shrouded in discomfort and misunderstanding. In Pakistan, where large-scale giving is dominated by men, many philanthropists shy away from supporting mental health initiatives perhaps because they fear it undermines an image of strength. Donating to a school or a hospital wing reflects power and legacy; funding a mental health literacy programme or a suicide helpline may be viewed as undermining the donor’s image. Mental health philanthropy also lags behind because its needs are complex, its outcomes harder to measure and the issues themselves often invisible. Unlike a hospital wing or vaccination drive, mental healthcare rarely offers quick, tangible wins or legacy projects. Progress is incremental, long-term and difficult to quantify, making it less appealing to donors seeking visible impact. At the same time, other health and social causes benefit from clearer metrics, stronger advocacy and established global campaigns, while cultural attitudes still frame mental illness as a private or moral issue rather than a public health priority. The evidence for investment, however, could not be more robust: investing in mental health offers one of the highest returns in global health. The WHO and World Bank estimate that every dollar spent on mental health yields four dollars in improved health and productivity. Beyond this measurable return, the ripple effects are even greater: healthier workforces, better educational outcomes, reduced healthcare costs from untreated physical conditions and fewer burdens on social services and systems. Cru­cially, supporting mental health also has intergenerational benefits, improving child development and breaking cycles of disadvantage. If we are to disrupt this pattern, mental health giving must be reframed as compelling, urgent and aspirational. That means creating national visibility campaigns with powerful symbols, high-profile events and respected ambassadors so that giving towards mental health feels impactful and worthy. It also means channelling funds into evidence-based interventions — such as task-shifting programmes that enable front-line health workers to deliver basic care, mental health literacy initiatives that raise awareness and quality suicide helplines that provide immediate support. Businesses, too, must become partners in this effort by investing in wellness programmes not only as a matter of corporate responsibility but as a sound economic strategy that directly boosts productivity and talent retention. And finally, philanthropy must be made collective: pooled funds and endowments can offer visibility, scale and sustainability, reassuring donors that they are contributing to a larger national movement. Philanthropy has always had the power to change narratives. It did so for education, for healthcare, for poverty alleviation. It can do the same for mental health, but only if donors are willing to overcome stigma and embrace the truth, that investing in minds is urgent and imperative. Each individual who speaks up matters, and each rupee raised helps: it brings hope, momentum and courage to the space. With one in four Pakistanis suffering from a mental health disorder, this is not a hidden issue. It touches every family, every workplace and every community. Continuing to ignore is not only myopic. It is shameful. The writer is a consultant child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist and founder & CEO at Synapse Pakistan Neuroscience Institute.

      "summary_orig": "• Four security personnel among those martyred as explosive-laden van explodes at well-guarded entrance to Hali Road • Four terrorists ‘in FC uniforms’ gunned down while trying to breach security installation QUETTA: At least 10 people, including four security personnel, were martyred and over 30 others sustained injuries in a suicide car blast near the headquarters of the Frontier Corps, while five terrorists were killed while trying to breach the heavily guarded facility. Police officials said a suicide bomber driving an explosive-laden van  attempted to enter the well-guarded Hali Road from the Khojak Road area of Modal Town on Tuesday. At the entrance to Hali Road, the vehicle hit spikes and a barrier installed near the picket and exploded. The blast claimed the lives of six civilians, while four personnel were martyred, they added. Ten people lost their lives in the blast and 33 were injured, six of them seriously, Minister Health Bakht Muhammad Kakar told Dawn . There were at least two women among the seriously injured, he added. Shortly after the blast, four alleged terrorists in FC uniforms entered Hali Road attempted to breach the FC headquarters amid heavy firing. But security personnel foiled the atte­mpt. A gun battle with the terrorists ens­u­ed, who were armed with modern wea­pons and hand grenades, but they were gunned down by security personnel. “In all, five terrorists have been killed. One in an explosive-laden vehicle and four were eliminated by the FC personnel in the gun battle,” said a senior official of the home department while talking to Dawn. He disclosed that the attackers were wearing FC uniforms to dodge security. “No terrorist could reach up to the gates of the FC headquarters,” security officials said. They said that four AK-47 rifles, three grenade launchers, 15 grenades, hundreds of bullets and other items were recovered from the terrorists. An eyewitness said that all the attackers were very young. “The FC snipers sitting on a nearby building targeted the attacks from the roof,” he told Dawn , adding that the attackers also lobbed hand grenades at the security men. Security posts on both sides of Hali Road were destroyed in the huge explosion, and a large portion of a protective concrete wall was also damaged, while windowpanes and doors of nearby buildings, including the PTV Quetta Centre, MPAs’ hostel, bureau offices of private TV channels and newspapers were also shattered. The security guard of a TV channel also sustained injuries in the blast, witnesses said. They said the many of the victims were pedestrians and those travelling on the road at the time of the blast. Following the incident, police and rescue workers rushed to the site and shifted the injured and the bodies to civil hospital, where the health minister had declared a state of emergency. “Six seriously injured people were shifted to ICU,” hospital sources said, describing the condition of others “mostly stable”. No one has claimed responsibility of the suicide attack so far. But interestingly, the president and PM attributed differing identities to the terrorists who carried out the attack in Quetta. A  statement issued by the President’s Secretariat said President Asif Ali  Zardari “strongly condemned the suicide attack in Quetta carried out by the Fitna-al-Khawarij , the misguided extremists acting on  India’s agenda”. However, the federal government posted on X that Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif had commended the security forces for killing the “terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan ” who carried out the attack. Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned  Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Fitna al Hindustan refers to the  allegedly India-backed Baloch separatist groups. Balochistan Inspector General Mohammad Tahir visited the blast site along with senior police officers and was briefed on the initial evidence, the nature of the blast, the situation at the scene, and the progress of the investigation. Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the “terrorist attack”. A Balochistan government post on X, formerly Twitter, quoted him as saying that security forces gave a swift and effective response, eliminating four terrorists. “The terrorists cannot weaken the nation’s resolve through cowardly acts. The sacrifices of the people and security forces will not go in vain. We remain committed to making Balochistan peaceful and secure. I express solidarity with the families of the martyrs, pray for the elevation of their ranks, and for the speedy recovery of the injured,” the CM stated. Published in Dawn, October 1st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "PRESIDENT Donald Trump has finally unveiled his much-touted 20-point plan for a ceasefire in Gaza, which he describes as a landmark deal to end two years of a devastating war. But in reality, it’s a document of surrender for the Palestinian resistance against a brutal occupation. It has sanctified the genocide, carried out by the Zionist forces, which has killed tens of thousands of people, mostly women and children, and has uprooted the entire population of the occupied land. In fact, it’s a declaration of victory for a state accused of war crimes. Former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner have played a key role in preparing the so-called peace plan. Kushner was also the driving force behind the Abraham Accords during Trump’s first term as president. For his part, Blair, as prime minister, had actively supported the American-led invasion and occupation of Iraq based on false claims of the regime possessing weapons of mass destruction. Many in the Arab world and also in Britain regard him as a war criminal, too. Unsurprisingly, Israel immediately accepted the latest American plan. Standing, alongside Trump at a press conference, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been accused of committing crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court, had nothing but praise for the US leader who said, “Israel would have my full backing to finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas”. The plan has justifiably been termed as the ‘Trump-Netanyahu plan’ to ensure Israel’s military dominance in the region. The Gaza peace plan has further emboldened Israel. Hamas has been given a 72-hour ultimatum to accept the plan, which the group was never consulted on, and release the remaining hostages and return the bodies of the ones who died in its custody. Ironically, the Palestinians, who are the aggrieved party, were not consulted on the so-called peace plan, which is meant to decide their fate. The leaders of major Arab and Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, have already given their approval to the plan which, many analysts contend, would place Gaza under colonial rule. There is only a vague mention of the possibility of an independent Palestinian entity in the unforeseeable future. Israel has already rejected the idea of a separate Palestinian state. Though Israel has been stopped from annexing the West Bank, some hard-line Israeli ministers have threatened to do so. According to the Gaza plan, the war would immediately end after the exchange of prisoners. Israeli forces are only supposed to withdraw to the agreed-upon line to prepare for hostage release. During this time, “all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal”. Also, “Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries”. This is more or less a call for a complete surrender of the group, which heads the Pales­tinian resistance against the Zionist occupation. There would be no role for Hamas in the post-war administrative set-up in the occupied territory. Even the Palestinian Authority, which controls the occupied West Bank, has not been assigned any role in the post war set-up. That practically brings to an end the concept of a Palestinian state. Palestinian groups have been kept out of the post war set-up altogether. However, the complete implementation even of the “staged withdrawal” of the occupying forces remains uncertain given Israel’s bellicosity. In fact, the plan has further emboldened Israel, which is being ruled by extreme right groups that openly advocate for the establishment of a ‘Greater Israel’, with no place for a separate Palestinian state. According to the American plan, “Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Pale­stinian committee” under the supervision of a new international transitional body, the ‘Board of Peace’, to be headed by Trump and others including Blair. That would practically give America control of the occupied territory for an indefinite period. Some analysts believe the proposal is not very different from Trump’s suggestion in February to put Gaza under US control so that the enclave could be turned into a Riviera. Meanwhile, the Trump administration will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary ‘International Stabilisation Force’ to be deployed in Gaza. Besides, its main job of maintaining law and order, the ISF will also train and provide support to newly formed Palestinian police forces in Gaza. The ISF would comprise troops from various Muslim countries. According to some reports, the main bulk of the troops would come from Indonesia and Pakistan, the two largest Muslim-majority nations. It may be the reason for Trump’s adulation of Pakistan’s prime minister and army chief. It is evident that Pakistan was taken into confidence on the plan by Trump. The Israeli security forces will stay in the enclave till the ISF has taken control, but would still have “a security perimeter presence … until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”. Surely the ceasefire will end the relentless killing and destruction perpetrated by the Israeli forces and allow in much-needed humanitarian aid. But the main question is whether the American plan can establish long-term peace in the region without formally recognising the right of the Palestinian people to an independent state. Hamas might be disarmed but what about those in Gaza who lost family members to the genocide that has been raging for two years now? The anger of a whole generation of Palestinians, who have only seen death and hunger, will not be contained. The controversial plan will lead to greater discontent and uncertainty. Palestinians have rightly rejected the American plan as a farce. The writer is an author and journalist. zhussain100@yahoo.com X: @hidhussain Published in Dawn, October 1st, 2025",

In fact, it’s a declaration of victory for a state accused of war crimes. Former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner have played a key role in preparing the so-called peace plan. Kushner was also the driving force behind the Abraham Accords during Trump’s first term as president. For his part, Blair, as prime minister, had actively supported the American-led invasion and occupation of Iraq based on false claims of the regime possessing weapons of mass destruction. Many in the Arab world and also in Britain regard him as a war criminal, too. Unsurprisingly, Israel immediately accepted the latest American plan. Standing, alongside Trump at a press conference, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been accused of committing crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court, had nothing but praise for the US leader who said, “Israel would have my full backing to finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas”. The plan has justifiably been termed as the ‘Trump-Netanyahu plan’ to ensure Israel’s military dominance in the region. The Gaza peace plan has further emboldened Israel. Hamas has been given a 72-hour ultimatum to accept the plan, which the group was never consulted on, and release the remaining hostages and return the bodies of the ones who died in its custody. Ironically, the Palestinians, who are the aggrieved party, were not consulted on the so-called peace plan, which is meant to decide their fate. The leaders of major Arab and Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, have already given their approval to the plan which, many analysts contend, would place Gaza under colonial rule. There is only a vague mention of the possibility of an independent Palestinian entity in the unforeseeable future. Israel has already rejected the idea of a separate Palestinian state. Though Israel has been stopped from annexing the West Bank, some hard-line Israeli ministers have threatened to do so. According to the Gaza plan, the war would immediately end after the exchange of prisoners. Israeli forces are only supposed to withdraw to the agreed-upon line to prepare for hostage release. During this time, “all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal”. Also, “Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries”. This is more or less a call for a complete surrender of the group, which heads the Pales­tinian resistance against the Zionist occupation. There would be no role for Hamas in the post-war administrative set-up in the occupied territory. Even the Palestinian Authority, which controls the occupied West Bank, has not been assigned any role in the post war set-up. That practically brings to an end the concept of a Palestinian state. Palestinian groups have been kept out of the post war set-up altogether. However, the complete implementation even of the “staged withdrawal” of the occupying forces remains uncertain given Israel’s bellicosity. In fact, the plan has further emboldened Israel, which is being ruled by extreme right groups that openly advocate for the establishment of a ‘Greater Israel’, with no place for a separate Palestinian state. According to the American plan, “Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Pale­stinian committee” under the supervision of a new international transitional body, the ‘Board of Peace’, to be headed by Trump and others including Blair. That would practically give America control of the occupied territory for an indefinite period. Some analysts believe the proposal is not very different from Trump’s suggestion in February to put Gaza under US control so that the enclave could be turned into a Riviera. Meanwhile, the Trump administration will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary ‘International Stabilisation Force’ to be deployed in Gaza. Besides, its main job of maintaining law and order, the ISF will also train and provide support to newly formed Palestinian police forces in Gaza. The ISF would comprise troops from various Muslim countries. According to some reports, the main bulk of the troops would come from Indonesia and Pakistan, the two largest Muslim-majority nations. It may be the reason for Trump’s adulation of Pakistan’s prime minister and army chief. It is evident that Pakistan was taken into confidence on the plan by Trump. The Israeli security forces will stay in the enclave till the ISF has taken control, but would still have “a security perimeter presence … until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”. Surely the ceasefire will end the relentless killing and destruction perpetrated by the Israeli forces and allow in much-needed humanitarian aid. But the main question is whether the American plan can establish long-term peace in the region without formally recognising the right of the Palestinian people to an independent state. Hamas might be disarmed but what about those in Gaza who lost family members to the genocide that has been raging for two years now?

      "summary_orig": "RIEW: On a football field ringed by misty mountains, the air rang with fiery speeches as tribesmen protested a planned mega-dam, India’s latest move in its contest with China over Himalayan water. India says the proposed new structure could counteract rival China’s building of a likely record-breaking dam upstream in Tibet by stockpiling water and guarding against releases of weaponised torrents. But for those at one of the possible sites for what would be India’s largest dam, the project feels like a death sentence. “We will fight till the end of time,” said Tapir Jamoh, a resident of the thatch-hut village of Riew, raising a bow loaded with a poison-tipped arrow in a gesture of defiance against authorities. “We will not let a dam be built.” Jamoh’s homelands of the Adi people are in the far-flung northeastern corner of India, divided from Tibet and Myanmar by soaring snowy peaks. Beijing, which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, says its project will have no ‘negative impact’ downstream Proposed blueprints show India considering the site in Arunachal Pradesh for a massive storage reservoir, equal to four million Olympic-size swimming pools, behind a 280-metre (918-foot) high dam. The project comes as China presses ahead with the $167 billion Yaxia project upstream of Riew on the river known in India as the Siang, and in Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo. China’s plan includes five hydropower stations, that could produce three times more electricity than its vast Three Gorges dam — the world’s largest power station —though other details remain scant. Beijing — which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, rejected by India — says it will have no “negative impact” downstream. “China has never had, and will never have, any intention to use cross-border hydropower projects on rivers to harm the interests of downstream countries or coerce them,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said. Chinese reports hint at a tunnel-diversion project, while India eyes Riew for its mega-dam. Locals like 69-year-old Jamoh say damming the Siang would erase their culture and identity. Despite a thaw between New Delhi and Beijing, the two most populous nations have multiple areas of disputed border manned by tens of thousands of troops, and India has made no secret of its concerns. The river is a tributary of the mighty Brahmaputra, and Indian officials fear China could use its dam as a control tap — to create deadly droughts or release a “water bomb” downstream. China rejects that, saying that the “hype surrounding the Yaxia Hydropower Project as a ‘water bomb’ is groundless and malicious”. But Arunachal Pradesh state Chief Minister Pema Khandu said protective action against China’s dam is a “national security necessity”, and sees India’s dam as a safety valve to control the water. “China’s aggressive water resource development policy leaves little room for downstream riparian nations to ignore it,” said Maharaj K. Pandit, a Himalayan ecology specialist at the National University of Singapore. India’s dam could generate up to 11,600 MW, becoming its most powerful and cutting reliance on coal.

But for those at one of the possible sites for what would be India’s largest dam, the project feels like a death sentence. “We will fight till the end of time,” said Tapir Jamoh, a resident of the thatch-hut village of Riew, raising a bow loaded with a poison-tipped arrow in a gesture of defiance against authorities. “We will not let a dam be built.” Jamoh’s homelands of the Adi people are in the far-flung northeastern corner of India, divided from Tibet and Myanmar by soaring snowy peaks. Beijing, which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, says its project will have no ‘negative impact’ downstream Proposed blueprints show India considering the site in Arunachal Pradesh for a massive storage reservoir, equal to four million Olympic-size swimming pools, behind a 280-metre (918-foot) high dam. The project comes as China presses ahead with the $167 billion Yaxia project upstream of Riew on the river known in India as the Siang, and in Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo. China’s plan includes five hydropower stations, that could produce three times more electricity than its vast Three Gorges dam — the world’s largest power station —though other details remain scant. Beijing — which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, rejected by India — says it will have no “negative impact” downstream. “China has never had, and will never have, any intention to use cross-border hydropower projects on rivers to harm the interests of downstream countries or coerce them,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said. Chinese reports hint at a tunnel-diversion project, while India eyes Riew for its mega-dam. Locals like 69-year-old Jamoh say damming the Siang would erase their culture and identity. Despite a thaw between New Delhi and Beijing, the two most populous nations have multiple areas of disputed border manned by tens of thousands of troops, and India has made no secret of its concerns. The river is a tributary of the mighty Brahmaputra, and Indian officials fear China could use its dam as a control tap — to create deadly droughts or release a “water bomb” downstream. China rejects that, saying that the “hype surrounding the Yaxia Hydropower Project as a ‘water bomb’ is groundless and malicious”. But Arunachal Pradesh state Chief Minister Pema Khandu said protective action against China’s dam is a “national security necessity”, and sees India’s dam as a safety valve to control the water. “China’s aggressive water resource development policy leaves little room for downstream riparian nations to ignore it,” said Maharaj K. Pandit, a Himalayan ecology specialist at the National University of Singapore. India’s dam could generate up to 11,600 MW, becoming its most powerful and cutting reliance on coal.

      "summary_orig": "• ‘This is not our document’, says Dar about White House plan; sticks to joint statement from Muslim bloc • Reveals Indonesia has committed 20,000 troops; Islamabad expected to make a decision soon • Axios claims Netanyahu negotiated changes to draft agreed between Trump, Muslim leaders • US president gives Hamas ‘three to four days’ to agree to deal; insiders say group will ‘likely reject’ proposal ISLAMABAD / WASHI­N­GTON: A day after US President Donald Trump unveiled his ambitious plan to end the war in Ga­za, signs have began to emerge that not everyone is happy with the draft made public by White House. This was evident from Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s presser on Tuesday, where he made it clear in so many words that the US peace plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included. The “document has been issued by the US”, he said, seemingly distancing Pakistani decision-makers from the plan, even though Trump has previously claimed that both PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir are behind it ‘100pc’. “This is not our document, which we sent to them. There are some key areas that we want covered… If they are not covered, they will be covered,” he said. Consider Trump’s anno­u­ncement of the 20-point plan as “an announcement from their side”, he said. Mr Dar, who is also the deputy prime minister, added that Pakistan owned the joint statement given on behalf of eight Muslim countries. “If there is a difference, we will go by this,” he said. In response to a question, the foreign minister said the plan put forward by Trump envisions an independent technocrat government of Pales­tinians, to be overseen by an international body — mostly comprised of Palestinians. He was also guarded about the possibility of sending troops to become part of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF). “On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies… there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan’s leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said. Mr Dar maintained that this would be a special force for Gaza alone, and the arrangement for its deployment would be documented at the UN Security Council. Road to deal During the presser, Mr Dar expounded on the diplomatic process that led to the finalisation of the pea­ce plan, saying that one of the main purposes of attending the UN General Assembly was to work with some “like-minded countries” on trying to end the misery in Gaza as a “member of the Muslim ummah”. Eight countries, including Pakistan, agreed to take up this matter very proactively with President Trump during the US visit, he said. Dar said a preparatory meeting was held before the Muslim leaders’ huddle with Trump. The meeting with Trump was meant to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid to the strip without any hurdles, stop the forced displacement of Pales­tinians and make arrangements for the return of those displaced from the Gaza, plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and stop Israel’s attempts to annex the West Bank, he said. “These objectives were conveyed to him (Trump), and he was asked to work with us on achieving them,” Dar said, adding that the US president then proposed that his team would devise a “workable solution” with the foreign ministers of the eight Muslim countries that participated in the meeting. He said it was decided that the details of meetings held in this regard would be “secret” and “classified”. After sharing further details of how the proposal for ending the Isr­aeli onslaught in Gaza was finalised, Dar said he had received messages from the Saudi foreign minister. “He told me that five countries had reached a consensus on joint statem­ent [regarding the Gaza plan] and that our agreement was needed on this matter as well, and that they had also reached out to Indonesia and the UAE. “I then consulted the foreign secretary and proposed some changes. I spoke to the Saudi foreign minister again … as I had some objections … He then send me a revised version … and the joint statement was released.” When asked to assure that “you still believe in the two-state solution”, he said there was no change in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine. “And I rather would say the seven other countries are also with us on this.” The repeated reference to the Mus­lim bloc’s joint statement is being seen as a ‘mild protestation’ over cha­nges to the terms of the deal, which were ostensibly carried out at Israeli PM Benjamin Netan­yahu’s request. Changes to the draft According to US news outlet Axios , the deal now before Hamas is significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention. The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process. Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”. Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported. According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios. Quoting a senior Arab official involved in the negotiations, the Axios report said that while Netanyahu had managed to change the text, it still has a lot of very positive elements for the Palestinians. Deadline for Hamas After Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas on Monday, President Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal, or meet “a very sad end”. Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said Israeli and Arab leaders had already endorsed the plan and that “were just waiting for Hamas” to make its decision. “Hamas is either going to be doing it or not, and if it’s not, it’s going to be a very sad end,” Trump said as he left the White House. Asked whether there was scope for further talks on the proposal, he replied: “Not much.” A source close to Hamas told Reu­t­ers the plan was “completely biased to Israel” and imposed “impossible conditions” that aimed to eliminate the group. Qatar’s foreign ministry has said Hamas is studying the White House proposal “responsibly”. However, a senior Hamas figure told the BBC that the group is likely to reject Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, saying it “serves Israel’s interests” and “ignores those of the Palestinian people”. The source said the group is unlikely to agree to disarming and handing over their weapons. Published in Dawn, October 1st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Tuesday accused PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan of creating a divide within the party and alleged that she was being facilitated by the Military Intelligence (MI) and “establishment”. In a video statement, Gandapur said: “Imran Khan is my leader, I am loyal to him. It is my right to convey the truth to him … I made him aware of all that has been happening [during my meeting with him yesterday].” He said that initially he was not being given the permission to meet Imran in jail and his messages were conveyed to the public only through his sisters. “So there is a big divide in the party now,” he continued. Gandapur said his provincial government had presented KP’s budget as otherwise the PTI government would have been “disqualified”. And since there were no instructions from Imran to the effect of not presenting the budget, it was presented, he added. “But after that, campaigns that were launched declaring me and parliament traitors were highly inappropriate. And we repeatedly asked [Imran’s] sisters to bring some clarity on it but to no avail. So an impression was created that we were going against you (Imran). But it was not the case. “And when the time came to pass the budget, the situation was same. They were not allowing us to meet (Imran). Mirza Saif was eventually able to meet him after great difficulty in which Khan sahib was informed of the situation …  We eventually passed the budget after making it clear to Khan sahib that he could make any changes he wanted.” Gandapur also claimed that he had told Imran that he had the authority to stop them from passing the budget and they would comply. “But my MPAs and party members were accused that we committed treachery passing this budget … They are running these campaigns.” He said he had also been accused of applying the “minus Imran Khan” formula. “But I [told Imran] that nobody could think or have the courage to do so.” The KP CM added that he had conveyed to the party founder that “Aleema Khan had a big role in dividing the party. Because some party members are being discredited. And the party is losing hope. That steps were not being taken for your release. Instead there is groupism in party which some people are using to serve their own interests”. He further alleged that Aleema was in contact with “vloggers” working to create divide in the party. “And instead of stopping them … she is provoking them. And Hafeezullah Niazi sahib refers to Aleema Khan as the prime minister in his articles. He writes that she should become the party chairperson,” he alleged. He alleged that campaigns were being carried out to declare Aleema the chairperson of the party. Gandapur said he told Imran that the party was being harmed by these campaigns and agendas. “If you (Imran) want to elect a chairperson then go ahead … whoever you nominate will be acceptable but do it,” he said, referring to his conversation with Imran. Gandapur said that petty issues were being created within the party and no work was being done on getting Imran out of jail. He alleged that instead of standing united, “our trajectory is such that complies with the objectives of the institutions and establishment, and Aleema is playing a direct role in this”. “I clearly told him that institutions are working to weaken us … I told him that the MI was facilitating Aleema Khan in this process, according to my knowledge … It is supporting Aleema Khan in weakening us.” Gandapur’s statement came after Aleema spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, where Imran is incarcerated, earlier in the day. During the interaction , Aleema was asked about Gandapur’s meeting with Imran. To that, she said the KP CM had alleged during the meeting that she was working with the MI, was behind “all” the attacks directed towards Gandapur on social media and that she wanted to become the PTI chairperson. According to Aleema Imran shared with us. “He was laughing while telling us.” “Remember that Imran Khan is PTI’s chairman. Only he is the chairman and no one else,” she asserted. “We will do everything for Imran Khan, we will tolerate everything for him. But we will not leave him [alone] no matter what they do.” She maintained that Imran conveyed his messages to the outside world through his family only when a party member was not available. “He also specifies what has to be told publicly and what privately.”",

      "title_orig": "Pentagon chief slams ‘fat generals,’ says US officers should resign if they don’t support his agenda",
      "summary_orig": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth slammed “fat generals” and diversity initiatives that he said led to decades of decay in the military and told a rare gathering of commanders on Tuesday they should resign if they don’t support his agenda. “Foolish and reckless political leaders set the wrong compass heading and we lost our way. We became the ‘Woke Department,’” Hegseth said as he kicked off the event in Quantico, Virginia. “But not anymore,” he said. Addressing a room full of America’s top generals and admirals, summoned from around the world without explanation last week, Hegseth defended his firings of flag officers, which include the top US general, who is Black, and the Navy’s top admiral, who is a woman. He said the officers he relieved were part of a broken culture. He promised sweeping changes to how discrimination complaints are handled and how accusations of wrongdoing are investigated at the Pentagon, saying the current system has top brass walking on “egg shells.” “If the words I’m speaking today are making your hearts sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign,” Hegseth said. “I know the overwhelming majority of you feel the opposite. These words make your hearts full.” Hegseth criticised the look of overweight troops, saying: “It’s completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon.” He said all fitness tests would be set to male benchmarks only and emphasised the importance of grooming standards. “The era of unprofessional appearance is over. No more beardos,” Hegseth told the audience, which sat in silence. Trump tells commanders: I have your backs US President Donald Trump, as he departed for the event, told reporters on Tuesday that he would fire military leaders on the spot if he did not like them. Trump then opened with a joke as he took the stage for a speech that lasted more than an hour, saying: “If you don’t like what I’m saying, you can leave the room, of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future.” But he then spoke warmly of the military, in sometimes-wandering remarks that touched on issues like the prowess of US nuclear submarines but also included fierce criticism of the media, former President Joe Biden and Venezuela. He echoed Hegseth when he turned his attention to his opposition to diversity initiatives. “Merit. Everything’s based on merit. You’re all based on merit. We’re not going to have somebody taking your place for political reasons, because they are politically correct and you’re not,” Trump said. “I am with you. I support you, and as president, I have your backs 100 per cent,” Trump said. The auditorium was filled with senior uniformed officials, seated in front of a stage with a large American flag, a lectern and boards that read: “Strength. Service. America.” As Trump spoke, several officers sat looking expressionless, and the room was far quieter than the crowds at Trump’s usual gatherings. A naval officer took notes. The US military is meant to be apolitical, loyal to the US Constitution and independent of any party or political movement. That creates pressure on the commanders to avoid reacting to overtly political comments, by Trump or Hegseth. Revamp of Defence priorities The Pentagon has undergone eight months of blistering changes since Trump took office, including firings, banning books from academy libraries and ordering lethal strikes on suspected drug boats off Venezuela. “If you try to poison our people, we will blow you out of existence,” Trump told the audience. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defence the “Department of War,” reverting to a title it held until after World War Two when officials sought to emphasise the Pentagon’s role in preventing conflict. The name change will require congressional approval. The administration has announced a plan to send National Guard deployments to Chicago, the latest US city where Trump aims to deploy US troops despite objections from local authorities. Trump announced plans to send National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, over the weekend and sent Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles earlier this year, despite protests from local officials. He acknowledged discomfort among his opponents for deploying the military on US streets, but said America was in the grips of what he described as a war from within waged by illegal immigrants who his administration is seeking to deport. “America is under invasion from within. We’re under invasion from within, no different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways, because they don’t wear uniforms,” Trump said. Trump speaks about COAS Munir During his address, Trump also mentioned Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, saying he was in the US along with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “He is a very important guy in Pakistan … and I didn’t even realise it, as beautiful as he said it to a group of people who were with it … he said this man (Trump) saved millions of lives. “I was very honoured, I loved the way he said it” the US president said. He also maintained that Pakistan downed seven Indian jets during the May escalation between the two countries. Shakeups at Pentagon Amid speculation over reasons for gathering all the top brass in one place, Vice President JD Vance insisted it was “actually not unusual at all,” and told reporters “it’s odd that you guys have made it into such a big story”. The Pentagon only said last week that Hegseth “will be addressing his senior military leaders,” and the lack of clarity over what would occur fed speculation that a major announcement. In May, Hegseth ordered major cuts to the number of general and flag officers in the US military, including at least a 20 per cent reduction in the number of active-duty four-star generals and admirals. That came after the Pentagon announced in February that it aimed to reduce the number of its civilian employees by at least five per cent. Since beginning his second term in January, Trump has also purged top officers, including chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff general Charles “CQ” Brown, whom he fired without explanation in February. Other senior officers dismissed this year include the heads of the Navy and Coast Guard, the leaders of the National Security Agency and the Defence Intelligence Agency, the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, a Navy admiral assigned to Nato, and three top military lawyers. Hegseth defended the firings on Tuesday, saying: “it’s nearly impossible to change a culture with the same people who helped create — or even benefited from — that culture.” US forces carried out a nearly two month-long campaign of strikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels earlier this year and also hit three nuclear sites that were a key part of Tehran’s nuclear programme. And US troops have also been deployed in Los Angeles and Washington — allegedly to combat civil unrest and crime — while similar moves are planned for Portland, Memphis and potentially other cities.",

      "title_en": "Pentagon chief slams ‘fat generals,’ says US officers should resign if they don’t support his agenda",
      "summary_en": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth slammed “fat generals” and diversity initiatives that he said led to decades of decay in the military and told a rare gathering of commanders on Tuesday they should resign if they don’t support his agenda. “Foolish and reckless political leaders set the wrong compass heading and we lost our way. We became the ‘Woke Department,’” Hegseth said as he kicked off the event in Quantico, Virginia. “But not anymore,” he said. Addressing a room full of America’s top generals and admirals, summoned from around the world without explanation last week, Hegseth defended his firings of flag officers, which include the top US general, who is Black, and the Navy’s top admiral, who is a woman. He said the officers he relieved were part of a broken culture. He promised sweeping changes to how discrimination complaints are handled and how accusations of wrongdoing are investigated at the Pentagon, saying the current system has top brass walking on “egg shells.” “If the words I’m speaking today are making your hearts sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign,” Hegseth said. “I know the overwhelming majority of you feel the opposite. These words make your hearts full.” Hegseth criticised the look of overweight troops, saying: “It’s completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon.” He said all fitness tests would be set to male benchmarks only and emphasised the importance of grooming standards. “The era of unprofessional appearance is over. No more beardos,” Hegseth told the audience, which sat in silence. Trump tells commanders: I have your backs US President Donald Trump, as he departed for the event, told reporters on Tuesday that he would fire military leaders on the spot if he did not like them. Trump then opened with a joke as he took the stage for a speech that lasted more than an hour, saying: “If you don’t like what I’m saying, you can leave the room, of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future.” But he then spoke warmly of the military, in sometimes-wandering remarks that touched on issues like the prowess of US nuclear submarines but also included fierce criticism of the media, former President Joe Biden and Venezuela. He echoed Hegseth when he turned his attention to his opposition to diversity initiatives. “Merit. Everything’s based on merit. You’re all based on merit. We’re not going to have somebody taking your place for political reasons, because they are politically correct and you’re not,” Trump said. “I am with you. I support you, and as president, I have your backs 100 per cent,” Trump said. The auditorium was filled with senior uniformed officials, seated in front of a stage with a large American flag, a lectern and boards that read: “Strength. Service. America.” As Trump spoke, several officers sat looking expressionless, and the room was far quieter than the crowds at Trump’s usual gatherings. A naval officer took notes. The US military is meant to be apolitical, loyal to the US Constitution and independent of any party or political movement. That creates pressure on the commanders to avoid reacting to overtly political comments, by Trump or Hegseth. Revamp of Defence priorities The Pentagon has undergone eight months of blistering changes since Trump took office, including firings, banning books from academy libraries and ordering lethal strikes on suspected drug boats off Venezuela. “If you try to poison our people, we will blow you out of existence,” Trump told the audience. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defence the “Department of War,” reverting to a title it held until after World War Two when officials sought to emphasise the Pentagon’s role in preventing conflict. The name change will require congressional approval. The administration has announced a plan to send National Guard deployments to Chicago, the latest US city where Trump aims to deploy US troops despite objections from local authorities. Trump announced plans to send National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, over the weekend and sent Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles earlier this year, despite protests from local officials. He acknowledged discomfort among his opponents for deploying the military on US streets, but said America was in the grips of what he described as a war from within waged by illegal immigrants who his administration is seeking to deport. “America is under invasion from within. We’re under invasion from within, no different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways, because they don’t wear uniforms,” Trump said. Trump speaks about COAS Munir During his address, Trump also mentioned Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, saying he was in the US along with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “He is a very important guy in Pakistan … and I didn’t even realise it, as beautiful as he said it to a group of people who were with it … he said this man (Trump) saved millions of lives. “I was very honoured, I loved the way he said it” the US president said. He also maintained that Pakistan downed seven Indian jets during the May escalation between the two countries. Shakeups at Pentagon Amid speculation over reasons for gathering all the top brass in one place, Vice President JD Vance insisted it was “actually not unusual at all,” and told reporters “it’s odd that you guys have made it into such a big story”.

Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “The president said that the elements serving the interests of Fitna-al-Khawarij and India cannot undermine Pakistan’s peace and stability. He commended the security forces for their timely and effective response, which foiled the malicious designs of the terrorists.” According to the statement, the president “prayed for the swift recovery of the injured FC personnel and lauded the courage and resolve of the country’s security forces in defending the motherland”. Later, an X post by the Pakistan government said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had commended the security forces for killing the “terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan ” who carried out the attack. The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The government statement said the PM also prayed for the quick recovery of the injured citizens and security personnel. He expressed the resolve to defeat the nefarious designs of elements causing harm to citizens and their properties. “We will mete out exemplary punishment to elements trying to harm the security of the country,” the statement quoted him as saying. Six injured in critical condition, emergency declared in hospitals Following the explosion, the Balochistan Health Department imposed an emergency in hospitals across the capital, according to Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman. “An emergency has been declared at the Quetta Civil Hospital, Balochistan Medical College (BMC) Hospital Quetta, and the Trauma Centre,” a statement from Rehman said. “All consultants, doctors, pharmacists, staff nurses, and paramedical staff have been directed to remain present in the hospitals.” Speaking to the media later during a visit to the Civil Hospital, Health Minister Kakar said that the condition of six injured people was critical. “A major terrorist plot was planned. I strongly condemn the blast near FC headquarters,” he said, adding that most of the injured were civilians. The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency , have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) , in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.

      "title_orig": "‘Why make it Sindh vs Punjab?’: PPP takes exception to Maryam’s remarks, walks out of NA session",
      "summary_orig": "The rift between the PPP and PML-N escalated on Tuesday when PPP lawmakers walked out of the National Assembly in protest against remarks made a day earlier by Punjab Chief Minister and PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz. The war of words, which began over flood compensation through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), had expanded to water rights on the Indus River a day earlier as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. At a Faisalabad event on Monday, Maryam defended a controversial canal project on the Indus, rejecting Sindh’s objections and warning the PPP against criticising Punjab’s development — comments that triggered a PPP walkout from the National Assembly today. Taking the floor of the lower house of Parliament, PPP’s Naveed Qamar said: “Right now, our country is going through a severe flood situation. As we speak, there is a medium-level flood ongoing in my constituency. The onsluaght that came from Punjab has more or less subsided but many rural areas are still submerged. Standing crops were also submerged.” He added that people were looking toward the country’s leadership during this time, highlighting that a recent report released by the Food and Agric­u­lture Organisation (FAO) stated that the floods would also affect upcoming Rabi cultivation. “Unfortunately, people have not seen rescue efforts following the floods but have seen a lot of politics,” he lamented. “When it comes to it, we can also make fiery speeches. We can also make something an inter-provincial issue but we have mercy on the people of whose responsibility rests on ours shoulders. “We cannot absolve ourselves by saying ’it was because of nature’ and leave people to fend for themselves.” He continued: “In the past few days, there have been statements — and I accept some were from our side — but the escalation that followed and the level to which things went is in no way appropriate.” Qamar maintained that when PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari visited flood-hit areas, the first thing he did was to praise the Punjab government. “He said that in Punjab, the chief minister and the Punjab government did good work in dealing with the flood situation.” He added that some people from their camp did not like this but then the “escalation” went in another direction. “In Punjab, a flood of this size has occurred for the first time. But Sindh has suffered this repeatedly […]. We have gone through this experience, and we have learnt from our mistakes,” he said. “We learnt that instead of sending flour or sacks, give people cash directly so that they can rebuild their lives,” Qamar said. “We are your allies, we can give you suggestions. The government is yours, you have to make decisions […] but if we give you advice based on our experiences from the past then why do you turn it into criticism? Why make it a Sindh versus Punjab issue?” he asked. “‘Our water, our money, our will’ — what does that mean? What does that imply? This is our country and it belongs to all of us […]. Consider our suggestions; if you don’t like them, don’t accept them, but the response should not be what it has been,” he said, mentioning Maryam’s words. He said he was very “saddened” by the remarks made by her a day prior. “The Indus is the lifeline of Pakistan. If the Indus exists, Pakistan exists; if the Indus does not exist, Pakistan will not exist. It connects the whole country […] it is neither Sindh’s water nor Punjab’s nor any other province’s. It passes through all and benefits everyone,” he added. “In such a situation, it is becoming very difficult for us to sit on the treasury benches,” he said. “This is not a partnership. We are not getting a fee to sit with you. If you give us respect, we are with you in national interest. We don’t want ministries or anything else,” he said as other members of the House pounded on their desks. “Think of the people and look at how partnerships work. We cannot take part in House proceedings until things improve. We are walking out,” he said. Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said he was apologetic if the PPP was distressed over the comments made by Maryam and called for a dialogue between the two sides. The NA session was subsequently adjourned till 11am on Friday. ‘Better for provinces to share issues’ Meanwhile, PPP leader Sherry Rehman, in a video posted on the PPP’s X account, said that this matter should be taken up in both Houses of Parliament. “Whether it is the floods, the canals issue or regarding water reservoirs, we have never adopted an attitude towards Punjab where anyone could point fingers,” she said. “We have always spoken within the bounds of decency and acted with responsibility. So it is better that both the provinces share their issues with each other,” she said. She further said that the BISP was globally acknowledged and there was “no comparison”. “It has been recognised at an international level among social protection programmes,” she said, adding that if it was employed effectively then four million people would not currently be in distress. She questioned how the PPP could be part of such an alliance under the current circumstances and said that the war of words was not the way forward. “The people are watching all of us and they are looking toward us. Chairman Bilawal has also made it clear that the people should be given effective and complete relief. There is nothing here for anyone to be offended about,” she emphasised, adding that in such an environment it had become difficult to continue supporting the government with consistency.",

Standing crops were also submerged.” He added that people were looking toward the country’s leadership during this time, highlighting that a recent report released by the Food and Agric­u­lture Organisation (FAO) stated that the floods would also affect upcoming Rabi cultivation. “Unfortunately, people have not seen rescue efforts following the floods but have seen a lot of politics,” he lamented. “When it comes to it, we can also make fiery speeches. We can also make something an inter-provincial issue but we have mercy on the people of whose responsibility rests on ours shoulders. “We cannot absolve ourselves by saying ’it was because of nature’ and leave people to fend for themselves.” He continued: “In the past few days, there have been statements — and I accept some were from our side — but the escalation that followed and the level to which things went is in no way appropriate.” Qamar maintained that when PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari visited flood-hit areas, the first thing he did was to praise the Punjab government. “He said that in Punjab, the chief minister and the Punjab government did good work in dealing with the flood situation.” He added that some people from their camp did not like this but then the “escalation” went in another direction. “In Punjab, a flood of this size has occurred for the first time. But Sindh has suffered this repeatedly […]. We have gone through this experience, and we have learnt from our mistakes,” he said. “We learnt that instead of sending flour or sacks, give people cash directly so that they can rebuild their lives,” Qamar said. “We are your allies, we can give you suggestions. The government is yours, you have to make decisions […] but if we give you advice based on our experiences from the past then why do you turn it into criticism? Why make it a Sindh versus Punjab issue?” he asked. “‘Our water, our money, our will’ — what does that mean? What does that imply? This is our country and it belongs to all of us […]. Consider our suggestions; if you don’t like them, don’t accept them, but the response should not be what it has been,” he said, mentioning Maryam’s words. He said he was very “saddened” by the remarks made by her a day prior. “The Indus is the lifeline of Pakistan. If the Indus exists, Pakistan exists; if the Indus does not exist, Pakistan will not exist. It connects the whole country […] it is neither Sindh’s water nor Punjab’s nor any other province’s. It passes through all and benefits everyone,” he added. “In such a situation, it is becoming very difficult for us to sit on the treasury benches,” he said. “This is not a partnership. We are not getting a fee to sit with you. If you give us respect, we are with you in national interest. We don’t want ministries or anything else,” he said as other members of the House pounded on their desks. “Think of the people and look at how partnerships work. We cannot take part in House proceedings until things improve. We are walking out,” he said. Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said he was apologetic if the PPP was distressed over the comments made by Maryam and called for a dialogue between the two sides. The NA session was subsequently adjourned till 11am on Friday. ‘Better for provinces to share issues’ Meanwhile, PPP leader Sherry Rehman, in a video posted on the PPP’s X account, said that this matter should be taken up in both Houses of Parliament. “Whether it is the floods, the canals issue or regarding water reservoirs, we have never adopted an attitude towards Punjab where anyone could point fingers,” she said. “We have always spoken within the bounds of decency and acted with responsibility. So it is better that both the provinces share their issues with each other,” she said. She further said that the BISP was globally acknowledged and there was “no comparison”. “It has been recognised at an international level among social protection programmes,” she said, adding that if it was employed effectively then four million people would not currently be in distress. She questioned how the PPP could be part of such an alliance under the current circumstances and said that the war of words was not the way forward. “The people are watching all of us and they are looking toward us. Chairman Bilawal has also made it clear that the people should be given effective and complete relief. There is nothing here for anyone to be offended about,” she emphasised, adding that in such an environment it had become difficult to continue supporting the government with consistency.",
