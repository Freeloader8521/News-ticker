      "summary_orig": "I have my PPL with an instrument rating and I have around 150 hours. Recently just went on my night solo at a controlled tower airport, but prior to that I haven't solo'ed since I got my PPL back in November 2024. I'm working on commerical, and I can truthfully say, I had more anxiety than I expected to have for my night solo recently. I am usually fairly confident with my CFI in the seat with me, and during Private Pilot training if I was nervous for my solo's it usually went away after I got in the air but this time around, now that I'm doing a commerical solo it didn't. I feel like out of everything, the main source of my stress came from not being able to see the airport well at night while also talking to ATC. I was not able to see the airport when I was inbound for my landing, made the decision to let ATC know and asked for a heading to fly. I struggled with reading back taxi instructions, I tried my best and asked for clarification. I know I made safe decisions but I just hate the stress I had for most of the flight. I was just wondering, how long did it take you guys before you felt comfortable soloing and is it normal to be nervous and a little stressed during a solo? Does anyone have any advice? Any tips of how to possibly get rid of the stress that can come from Soloing? I never felt unsafe during this flight, but I think also being alone made me overthink about things going wrong as well submitted by /u/dontlikeyourtone [link] [comments]",

One second we're fat, dumb, and happy. The next second it snapping through 45 degrees right and 10 degrees nose down. We got it stopped around 70 degrees right while the plane is yelling BANK ANGLE. I have a crystal clear image burned into my mind of houses that looked way too close and a horizon that was not were it was supposed to be. We told approach and they seemed entirely uninterested. We told them we were going to slow and they didn't like that but after insisting and repeating what just happened we got a disgruntled \"okay\".

In the moment it felt very rote because I've recovered from those angles so many times in recurrent training but after the fact it was very sobering considering how it could have gone.

Changes to Rule 2: Rule 2 has been changed to include the use of AI. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of AI in writing comments and posts or generating images. This also includes presenting AI theories or arguments, even if you explicitly state they are generated by AI. AI-generated content regarding aviation is frequently wrong and is incredibly low effort. The use of AI may result in a ban. Introduction of Rule 10: Even though we have been restricting NSFW content and gore before this, we have added it as an official rule and will be strongly enforcing it from now on. Rule 10 bans any gore being posted to this subreddit , even if it is a link to an outside source. This includes as a post or a comment. Violations of this will result in a permanent ban from r/aviation . In addition to this, we are also limiting NSFW content that is not explicitly gore. This content will be decided on a case by case basis. Content involving incidents like the one that was seen at Milan Bergamo Airport will always be marked as NSFW, and we will provide details in pinned comments and the flair to elaborate on how NSFW the content is, so that everyone can make their own choice on what they want to see. Geopolitics: Please remember to keep discussion in this subreddit focused on aviation. While geopolitics will frequently be a part of discussion, please remain respectful and avoid getting in arguments about this. Do not bring geopolitics into posts where they don’t belong.

      "summary_orig": "Hello users of r/UkrainianConflict , For the past three years, Ukrainian cities have endured relentless attacks from Russian missiles and Iranian-made Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. In 2025 alone, over 12,000 of these drones have struck Ukraine — targeting not military infrastructure, but homes, hospitals, and schools. Thousands of civilians have been killed. Hundreds of them were children. A number of subreddits, including this one, believe this campaign of terror must end. We're proud to join the Sky Sentinel fundraiser in collaboration with United24, the official fundraising platform of Ukraine. The goal: help fund Sky Sentinel, an Al-powered, Ukrainian-made turret system designed to autonomously detect and shoot down these deadly drones. Each turret costs $150,000. United24 supporters have already raised over $1 million, and now we're coming together to raise enough for one more turret - entirely through Reddit. If we should not reach the goal, the donations will still be used for Sky Sentinel. If we don't reach the goal, the donations will still go to United24's general Sky Sentinel Program. If we succeed: • We'll save civilian lives. • A community vote will name the turret. • We'll receive a photo of the deployed turret, showing our contribution in action. Every donation helps, no matter the amount. Click the link below to donate and learn more about Sky Sentinel https://u24.gov.ua/sky-sentinel?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=fundraising&utm_campaign=sky-sentinel Thank you for your support and a shoutout to u/SurvivingSpartan and all the others who made this fundraiser possible! submitted by /u/humanlikecorvus [link] [comments]",
