      "summary_orig": "PROVINCIAL autonomy has always been an ultra-sensitive subject in Pakistan. The country was split in 1971 primarily because we failed to manage the just expectations of the erstwhile eastern province of Pakistan. We experimented with various constitutional formulas to satisfy the aspirations of our former eastern wing, but the half-hearted implementation of the agreed constitutional arrangement in 1956 led to a weakening of trust between the federation and its eastern wing. The military coup of 1958 and the subsequent 1962 constitution given by one person, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, and its unitary contours further disappointed East Pakistan. Therefore, there is a need to be extra-sensitive when it comes to provincial rights and autonomy, not only in letter but, more importantly, in spirit of the constitutional arrangement. Fortunately, the near-unanimous passage of the 1973 Constitution created a robust legal base for federalism in what remained of the country, consisting of the four provinces and the federally administered territories. The 18th Constitutional Amendment , passed with broad consensus 37 years later, further strengthened the federal constitutional framework. Over the subsequent 15 years, the provinces have emerged much stronger, more prosperous and even more assertive. Although we hear voices pleading for more autonomy or complaining about too much autonomy, the fact is that Pakistan has set a firm constitutional framework for federalism. While after a long and painful journey, we may have been successful in settling most of our legal issues regarding federalism, the political forces are apparently not conducting politics in the true spirit of the constitutional provisions regarding provincial autonomy. In general, political parties continue to be the proverbial lengthened shadows of their top leaders and there is hardly any ‘devolution’ of powers from the central figure to the provinces. The overall organisation of most of the parties is weak, but as one goes down the hierarchy from federal to local, there is a steep decline in the powers and autonomy of sub-national organisations. Most of the decisions are taken at the central level, which the provincial set-up is supposed to implement without question. Even if provincial parliamentary boards exist, final decisions about candidate selection for provincial assemblies are taken by the central parliamentary boards which, in many cases, authorise the top party leader to take the decision. According to the Constitution, the election of the chief minister is the prerogative of the members of the respective provincial assemblies. They do go through the motions of electing a leader of the House but the candidate of the majority party is almost invariably picked by the central party leader who in many cases, may not belong to the province. Since the Constitution binds assembly members to vote according to party direction or face ouster from the assembly, members have no choice but to go along with the choice of the party leader, even if they have strong reservations about the candidate. The top party leadership designs the system to keep CMs dependent on its directions. To understand the powerlessness of the MPAs, a case in point is the nomination of the little-known and least-qualified Usman Buzdar as a PTI candidate for the position of CM after the 2018 elections. The poor MPAs had absolutely no idea who they would be asked to vote for until party chairman Imran Khan dropped the bombshell just two days before the CM’s election. The members had no role whatsoever in picking the nominee and were generally shocked at the choice but went along with it and elected Mr Buzdar as CM. It is now an open secret that the logic behind selecting a weak CM was that there would be no resistance to running the province from the federal capital through the prime minister’s principal secretary. A similar scenario was seen in the case of KP after the 2024 election, when a rather weak and indecisive candidate for the CM’s position was nominated so that the province could be run by the PM’s secretariat. It would be unfair to single out the PTI in this context. PM Nawaz Sharif’s choice of Ghulam Haider Wyne as Punjab CM in 1990 followed the same pattern. Although Mr Wyne was a seasoned political worker, he was weak as a CM and followed the PM’s directions in running the province without asking any questions. The top party leadership designs the system to keep CMs dependent on its directions even in routine provincial matters. The former KP chief minister, Mr Ali Amin Gandapur, was asked by his party to seek the directions of the incarcerated party founder Mr Imran Khan before passing the province’s annual budget for 2025-26. He faced extreme criticism when he had to get the budget passed without his leader’s directions as the federal and Punjab governments denied him the opportunity to meet Mr Khan in prison. This must have been one of the reasons he was later removed from his position . The new CM delayed the formation of his provincial cabinet for 18 days and the provincial government remained nearly paralysed because he wanted to get Mr Khan’s approval by meeting him in jail. But the prison authorities again did not let him meet his leader. These are only a few instances; almost the entire political system, contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, is geared towards total obedience to the central party leadership in purely provincial matters, making a mockery of provincial autonomy. Framers of the Constitution have done their job to ensure provincial autonomy; it is now for the political parties and their leadership to devolve their powers to the provincial organisations of the party and the CM, if the party happens to be in power in a province. Centralisation of powers is not only against the spirit of the Constitution, it also stunts the growth of the party organisation and provincial leadership, weakening democracy in general.

      "summary_orig": "PRIME Minister Narendra Modi’s face was glowing as he approached the podium to address a charged crowd celebrating the BJP’s stunning election victory in the state of Bihar. After thanking the people of Bihar, Modi immediately rela­psed into the BJP’s familiar narrative. Criticising the Indian National Congress, Modi pejoratively referred to it as ‘Muslim League-Maoist Congress’ — in part an allusion to the Congress’s purported soft spot for Bihar’s Muslims who constitute 18 per cent of the state’s population. The BJP’s jubilation is not without cause. The party has emerged as the single largest party for the first time in Bihar by improving its tally to 89 seats compared to 74 in 2020. All in all, the Na­­ti­o­nal Democratic Alliance — the BJP and its allies — surged ahead with 202 seats in the 243-seat assembly. It is important to understand the drivers behind this remarkable electoral victory in Bihar as the same formula is likely to be repeated in upcoming state elections. Before Chief Minister Nitish Kum­ar, the BJP’s ally in the recent elections, took over two decades ago, Bihar, a state of some 135 million people, had rampant lawlessness or ‘Jungle Raj’. In the first decade, Kumar focused on providing public goods, mainly roads, bridges and access to electricity. But, failing to create jobs for India’s poorest state, Kumar soon ran out of steam. Instead of turning towards pro-market policies that would generate competition, economic growth and jobs, without increasing the state’s fiscal deficit, Kumar turned more statist in Bihar, where state spending was already at 34pc of GDP, double the national average. As in India, Pakistan’s political parties are aware of the transformative political power of cash transfers. Manipulation of macroeconomic policy tools to stimulate the economy and create employment ahead of elections to ensure re-election is known to economists. These tendencies were first captured by the ‘political business cycle’ literature that includes the Nobel laureate William Nordhaus amongst its pioneers. India’s rapid digitisation of government services, however, has exacerbated the phenomenon described by Nordhaus. In perhaps what can be described as digital political business cycles, some politicians can now use digital payment systems to engage in ‘virtual vote buying’ by directly reaching voters just before elections. In recent years, cash transfer schemes directed specifically at women are increasingly being used by all political parties to win elections in India. Despite waxing eloquent against the use of such tactics — ‘revdi culture’ — Modi’s party used women-oriented financial support schemes ahead of polls in Maharashtra last year. In the most recent elections, Kumar announced pre-election schemes amounting to 3pc of GDP despite Bihar’s fiscal deficit at 6pc of GDP. Before polls opened, Kumar started sending INR 10,000 to one woman from each family, claiming that this was ‘seed money’ for small businesses such as bea­uty parlours, dairy units, tailoring and retail kiosks. It goes without saying that with little oversight, and due to money’s fungibility, the amount was probably consumed immediately. Economists warn that such populist policies can create serious fiscal implications, with Bihar being forced to rely on additional debt financing to sustain such expenditures. According to Indian political analyst Neerja Chowdhury, these cash transfers underpinned the election results in Bihar. The 2025 Bihar election saw a record overall voter turnout of 66.91pc, the highest since 1951. This was driven by a landmark surge in female participation, where female turnout stood at 71.6pc — significantly outpacing male turnout (62.8pc) and marking a clear watershed from the 60.48pc and 59.69pc female turnouts of the previous two elections. In a sense, by directly doling out cash to voters, the BJP and its allies were able to encourage women to break from traditional loyalties of caste and identity. To be sure, the BJP’s rivals in Bihar had also promised goodies — one government job for every family — if they were voted into office. In this case, however, voters did not consider these to be credible commitments as government job promises appeared too good to be true. It appears that, as in India, Pakistan’s political parties are fully aware of the transformative political power of cash transfers. This is the reason why, despite being allies at the federal level, Pakistan’s two main political parties were recently at loggerheads . After the recent floods, the PPP had asked the PML-N’s government in Punjab to provide flood relief through the PPP’s signature Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP). Despite repeated requests, the PML-N resisted their federal ally’s demand with full force in the province, arguing that the amounts provided through the BISP were not enough to cover flood-related damage. Meanwhile, BISP allocations have been rising steadily over the years. This year, the BISP allocation was increased by 20pc to Rs716 billion. The ability of cash transfers to tip the electoral scales in India, and Pakistani politicos’ cognisance of this phenomenon, does not bode well for Pakistan’s future fiscal management. Where providing un­­conditional cash transfers to poor citizens is commendable, political competition may lead to exponential increases in BISP allocations in the future, especially as we get close to the next elections. Back in India, there were multiple fatalities in a bomb blast near the Red Fort in Delhi the night before the second round of elections in Bihar. Though it is too early to trace a connection, this tragic incident may have also impacted electoral outcomes, especially in the aftermath of the Pakistan-India conflict earlier this year. In a bid to highlight his strongman image, Modi repeatedly alluded to the Pakistan-India conflict on the campaign trail. Under fire from opposition leader Rahul Gandhi for “lacking courage”, the BJP even branded Gandhi the “ poster boy of Pak­is­­tan ”. Surprisingly, where the usually bellicose Indian media seems to have simmered down, Pak­istan keeps living rent-free in the BJP’s imagination. In all likelihood, Modi’s victory in Bihar and the BJP’s strong political momentum for the upcoming state elections are going to embolden foreign policy hawks in India. This is especially so since India was unable to achieve any of its military or political objectives in the recent conflict with Pakistan. The BJP’s surprising performance underscores its strategy for cementing power in different Indian states: direct cash transfers and a potent anti-Pakistan narrative. As the party seeks to maintain this momentum for upcoming state elections, Pakistani policymakers should be wary of runaway social spending, which could ultimately encroach on vital defence resources.

      "summary_en": "PRIME Minister Narendra Modi’s face was glowing as he approached the podium to address a charged crowd celebrating the BJP’s stunning election victory in the state of Bihar. After thanking the people of Bihar, Modi immediately rela­psed into the BJP’s familiar narrative. Criticising the Indian National Congress, Modi pejoratively referred to it as ‘Muslim League-Maoist Congress’ — in part an allusion to the Congress’s purported soft spot for Bihar’s Muslims who constitute 18 per cent of the state’s population. The BJP’s jubilation is not without cause. The party has emerged as the single largest party for the first time in Bihar by improving its tally to 89 seats compared to 74 in 2020. All in all, the Na­­ti­o­nal Democratic Alliance — the BJP and its allies — surged ahead with 202 seats in the 243-seat assembly. It is important to understand the drivers behind this remarkable electoral victory in Bihar as the same formula is likely to be repeated in upcoming state elections. Before Chief Minister Nitish Kum­ar, the BJP’s ally in the recent elections, took over two decades ago, Bihar, a state of some 135 million people, had rampant lawlessness or ‘Jungle Raj’. In the first decade, Kumar focused on providing public goods, mainly roads, bridges and access to electricity. But, failing to create jobs for India’s poorest state, Kumar soon ran out of steam. Instead of turning towards pro-market policies that would generate competition, economic growth and jobs, without increasing the state’s fiscal deficit, Kumar turned more statist in Bihar, where state spending was already at 34pc of GDP, double the national average. As in India, Pakistan’s political parties are aware of the transformative political power of cash transfers. Manipulation of macroeconomic policy tools to stimulate the economy and create employment ahead of elections to ensure re-election is known to economists. These tendencies were first captured by the ‘political business cycle’ literature that includes the Nobel laureate William Nordhaus amongst its pioneers. India’s rapid digitisation of government services, however, has exacerbated the phenomenon described by Nordhaus. In perhaps what can be described as digital political business cycles, some politicians can now use digital payment systems to engage in ‘virtual vote buying’ by directly reaching voters just before elections. In recent years, cash transfer schemes directed specifically at women are increasingly being used by all political parties to win elections in India. Despite waxing eloquent against the use of such tactics — ‘revdi culture’ — Modi’s party used women-oriented financial support schemes ahead of polls in Maharashtra last year. In the most recent elections, Kumar announced pre-election schemes amounting to 3pc of GDP despite Bihar’s fiscal deficit at 6pc of GDP. Before polls opened, Kumar started sending INR 10,000 to one woman from each family, claiming that this was ‘seed money’ for small businesses such as bea­uty parlours, dairy units, tailoring and retail kiosks. It goes without saying that with little oversight, and due to money’s fungibility, the amount was probably consumed immediately. Economists warn that such populist policies can create serious fiscal implications, with Bihar being forced to rely on additional debt financing to sustain such expenditures. According to Indian political analyst Neerja Chowdhury, these cash transfers underpinned the election results in Bihar. The 2025 Bihar election saw a record overall voter turnout of 66.91pc, the highest since 1951. This was driven by a landmark surge in female participation, where female turnout stood at 71.6pc — significantly outpacing male turnout (62.8pc) and marking a clear watershed from the 60.48pc and 59.69pc female turnouts of the previous two elections. In a sense, by directly doling out cash to voters, the BJP and its allies were able to encourage women to break from traditional loyalties of caste and identity. To be sure, the BJP’s rivals in Bihar had also promised goodies — one government job for every family — if they were voted into office. In this case, however, voters did not consider these to be credible commitments as government job promises appeared too good to be true. It appears that, as in India, Pakistan’s political parties are fully aware of the transformative political power of cash transfers. This is the reason why, despite being allies at the federal level, Pakistan’s two main political parties were recently at loggerheads . After the recent floods, the PPP had asked the PML-N’s government in Punjab to provide flood relief through the PPP’s signature Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP). Despite repeated requests, the PML-N resisted their federal ally’s demand with full force in the province, arguing that the amounts provided through the BISP were not enough to cover flood-related damage. Meanwhile, BISP allocations have been rising steadily over the years. This year, the BISP allocation was increased by 20pc to Rs716 billion. The ability of cash transfers to tip the electoral scales in India, and Pakistani politicos’ cognisance of this phenomenon, does not bode well for Pakistan’s future fiscal management. Where providing un­­conditional cash transfers to poor citizens is commendable, political competition may lead to exponential increases in BISP allocations in the future, especially as we get close to the next elections. Back in India, there were multiple fatalities in a bomb blast near the Red Fort in Delhi the night before the second round of elections in Bihar. Though it is too early to trace a connection, this tragic incident may have also impacted electoral outcomes, especially in the aftermath of the Pakistan-India conflict earlier this year. In a bid to highlight his strongman image, Modi repeatedly alluded to the Pakistan-India conflict on the campaign trail. Under fire from opposition leader Rahul Gandhi for “lacking courage”, the BJP even branded Gandhi the “ poster boy of Pak­is­­tan ”. Surprisingly, where the usually bellicose Indian media seems to have simmered down, Pak­istan keeps living rent-free in the BJP’s imagination. In all likelihood, Modi’s victory in Bihar and the BJP’s strong political momentum for the upcoming state elections are going to embolden foreign policy hawks in India. This is especially so since India was unable to achieve any of its military or political objectives in the recent conflict with Pakistan. The BJP’s surprising performance underscores its strategy for cementing power in different Indian states: direct cash transfers and a potent anti-Pakistan narrative. As the party seeks to maintain this momentum for upcoming state elections, Pakistani policymakers should be wary of runaway social spending, which could ultimately encroach on vital defence resources.

At a meeting of the ISIL and Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee held recently at the UN Security Council, Denmark, in its position as the current chair of the committee, said that the banned TTP posed a “serious threat” to Central and South Asia, while pointing out that the terrorist group received “logistical and substantial support” from the Afghan authorities, namely the Taliban. The Danish representative also mentioned the frequent cross-border attacks that TTP terrorists have conducted against Pakistan , while alerting the international community to the threat that IS-K — also based in Afghanistan but opposed to its rulers — posed to the region. The Pakistani representative used the forum to criticise both the Taliban and their newfound ally, India, when he observed that terrorist groups, including the TTP and BLA, were thriving “under the patronage of their hosts”, and were backed by “our principal adversary and net destabiliser in the region”. While the Taliban are often dismissive of Pakistan’s concerns in this regard, it will be hard for them to brush aside the issues raised by the UN body. The sanctions committee has reaffirmed what Pakistan has been saying for long: that the Taliban are supporting the TTP , and that terrorist groups in Afghanistan can destabilise the entire region. The Afghan Taliban’s responses to these grave concerns have been ambiguous, from stating that the TTP are Pakistan’s problem, to claiming they are hosting Pakistani ‘refugees’, to saying that no TTP terrorist is based on their territory. As is evident, the international community is not buying the Taliban’s explanations. Instead of displaying obduracy over the matter, the Kabul regime needs to work constructively with Pakistan to address the problem. The last round of peace talks held in Istanbul earlier this month ended inconclusively, though the ceasefire between both states has held. Though it would be overly idealistic to expect the Taliban to take strong action against the TTP — both groups are from the same ideological stock, and have fought together in Afghanistan — Pakistan’s demand that Kabul stop cross-border attacks is entirely doable. The alternative to the Taliban’s dithering and denialism would be more conflict, which is not in the interest of either country. The Pakistani state, therefore, while taking a firm stand against cross-border terrorism and internal security, must not let bilateral and people-to-people ties nosedive further. If ties with Kabul sour even more, inimical actors in the region will be ready to exploit these differences, which will only add to Pakistan’s security dilemmas.

The Palestinian health ministry said that two teenagers were martyred overnight in the town of Kufr Aqab. “The young man Amr Khaled Ahmed Al-Marbou, 18, and the boy Sami Ibrahim Sami Mashayekh, 16, were martyred by occupation forces’ gunfire in the town of Kufr Aqab near Ramallah,” the ministry announced in a statement. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that its medics transported two victims from Kufr Aqab during the night, describing one with a “very serious live bullet injury” and the second with a “live bullet injury to the chest.” Oday al-Shurfa, a friend who witnessed the killing of Marbou, told AFP that the pair were on the street when Israeli forces opened fire during a raid. He said Israeli soldiers shot them without provocation. Shurfa stated that Marbou was hit “in the chest, in the heart. He collapsed and was martyred on the spot,” insisting his friend was not participating in any clashes or throwing stones. The town of Kufr Aqab, though technically part of illegally annexed east Jerusalem, is cut off by Israel’s separation wall, depriving its residents of basic municipal services from either Jerusalem or the Palestinian Authority. In the besieged southern Gaza Strip, the Israeli army said its forces killed five Palestinians on Friday. The killings took place in an area of southern Gaza under Israeli military control, east of the so-called Yellow Line. Israeli military used “immediate threat” to justify the killings. The same pretext has been repeatedly used by the Israeli military to legitimise its brutality, even as Palestinian resistance groups have affirmed a halt to their activities in Gaza since a ceasefire was announced. Separately, a Gaza hospital official told AFP that another Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire near Khan Yunis. Meanwhile, the Israeli military confirmed on Friday that its strike on the Ain al-Helweh refugee camp in southern Lebanon earlier in the week killed 13 Palestinians, whom it claimed were “Hamas terrorists.” Published in Dawn, November 22nd, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• FO says Islamabad understands ‘economic pain’ caused by closures but security threat ‘existential’ • Can’t let ‘our people be killed indiscriminately’ • Scheduling of planned Turkish delegation’s visit in connection with Pak-Afghan conflict still awaited ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups. “The onus of delay in the reopening of the border crossings rests with the Afghan Taliban regime,” Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said at a weekly media briefing. Pakistan and Afghanistan’s bilateral trade, estimated at $1.6 billion to $1.8bn in 2023-24, with key border gateways like Torkham and Chaman handling most of the traffic, has been suspended since mid-October, following deadly clashes between Pakistani forces and Taliban fighters. This suspension is estimated to be costing Afghan traders an estimated $2.5 million a day. The impasse has pushed Kabul to increasingly rely on Iranian routes, including Chabahar, while risking the erosion of Pakistan’s roughly $1bn in annual transit fees in addition to its own trade losses. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had closed border crossings and suspended all trade because of “the support being extended to Fitna-al-Khawarij [FAK] and Fitna-al-Hindustan [FAH] terrorist elements by the Afghan Taliban regime”. FAK is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­i­stan, while the Balochistan Liberation Army and other militant groups based in the province have been designated FAH to highlight India’s alle­ged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. ‘Economic pain’ The FO spokesperson said Islamabad understood the economic pain caused by the closures but described the security threat as “existential”. “If you recall, on November 10 and 15, the trade posts were actually attacked from Afghanistan. So, either we get ourselves killed, or we undertake a very risky trade. What is the choice?” he added. “Carrying out trade has become risky. So, with respect to trade, the position remains the same as I outlined last week.” Mr Andrabi said Islamabad had for years attempted to insulate trade from security tensions but that patience had run out. “From 2022, 23, 24 and the mid of 25, we segregated trade and security. But then there is a threshold of patience. I think that threshold of patience has been crossed,” he continued. The FO spokesperson noted that Islamabad could not allow trade to continue as if it were a “licence to kill Pakistanis from Afghan soil”. He rejected suggestions that trade losses should override security concerns. “Can you put a price tag on a human life, a Pakistani life?” he said. “Consider the people whose father, children, mother have been killed in these terrorist attacks. Can we convince them that look, let these killings continue because we are having an X amount of dollars of trade with Afghanistan?” Regional projects He also warned that major regional infrastructure projects including the Turkmen­istan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline and the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000) depended on a shift in the Taliban’s conduct. “The success of all these projects also depends on the Taliban regime halting its support and abetment of terrorist outfits operating from Afghan soil,” he said. Calling this a central “denominator” of ties, Mr Andrabi said the Afghan Taliban must stop backing groups such as FAK, FAH and their affiliates, and prevent Afghan nationals from carrying out attacks inside Pakistan. “We are cognisant of the losses to Pakistani traders, who are suffering,” he said. “But now we cannot let our people be killed indiscriminately.” Turkish delegation The spokesperson said the scheduling of a planned Turkish delegation’s visit in connection with the Pakistan-Afgha­nistan conflict was still awaited, despite Ankara’s announcement earlier this month that senior officials would travel to Islamabad for renewed mediation efforts. The third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, held under the Turkish-Qatari initiative, ended without an agreement on Nov 7 in Istanbul, leaving the ceasefire fragile amid continued TTP attacks. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later announced on Nov 9 that a high-level delegation, including Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin would visit Islamabad the following week to help secure a lasting ceasefire and work towards reopening trade routes. Pakistan welcomed Ankara and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process. “This visit has not taken place. It is being scheduled. The travel schedules of ministers take time to firm up,” Mr Andrabi said. He rejected suggestions that Islam­abad’s lack of cooperation was causing delays.“The delay should not be attributed to any non-cooperation from Pakistan,” he said.“Whether there is any non-cooperation from the Afghan Tali­ban regime, I am not aware of it.” The FO spokesperson said it was premature to comment on other mediation proposals, including those from Russia and Iran. “Many states have offered mediation, and we appreciate the support of our friendly and brotherly countries,” he said. “It is too early to comment on any specifics or other mediation offers. We will respond once we receive them.” Published in Dawn, November 22nd, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "An Indian fighter aircraft, the indigenously developed Tejas, crashed during a demonstration flight at the Dubai Air Show on Friday, a witness and officials told AFP . The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited-built Tejas jet crashed at about 2:10pm local time. View this post on Instagram Videos circulating on social media showed the aircraft failing to recover from an aerial maneuver and bursting into a ball of flames after impacting the ground as onlookers watched in shock. A plume of smoke billowed from the crash site as emergency vehicles sped towards it. The incident happened on the last day of the Middle East’s biggest airshow, which features a flying display each afternoon. Hundreds of people were watching from a grandstand, while the apron was packed with planes, helicopters and other hardware on static display. In September, India signed a $7 billion order for 97 upgraded Tejas Mk1A fighter jets to replace its Russian MiG-21 fleet after decades of use. In a post on X, the Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the death of the pilot in the incident. “An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at Dubai Air Show, today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident,” said the post. “IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief. A court of inquiry is being constituted to ascertain the cause of the accident,” it added. Footage of the crash showed the fighter executing a low roll before crashing in flames about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from the show site. The UAE aviation authority was not immediately available to comment on whether it would lead a local investigation. The Indian embassy said it was in touch with UAE authorities. Experts stressed it was too early to say what caused the crash. GE, the engine manufacturer, said in a statement that it was ready to support the investigation. ‘Oil leak’ controversy Earlier this week, social media was abuzz with posts claiming that the Indian fighter jet was ‘leaking oil’ while parked on the tarmac. Pictures showed shopping bags placed beneath the Tejas to collect the leaking liquid. Some posts claimed the leak continued on the second day of the international air show. However, there was no official comment on the topic by the Indian government or the armed forces. The Press Information Bureau (PIB) of India, in a post, claimed that it was a “routine draining process, not a technical malfunction”. The bureau added that it was part of the “standard pre-flight procedure to remove condensation, which naturally forms as part of the aircraft’s cooling system”. The Tejas, meaning “brilliance” in Hindi, is a domestically designed and built fighter jet that was commissioned into the Indian Air Force in 2016. The aircraft has been beset by design and other challenges and was once rejected by the Indian Navy as too heavy. The biennial airshow is being held at Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport from November 17-21. The show, according to its website , brought together over 1,500 exhibitors, 200 aircraft across flying and static displays, 12 conference tracks, and 450 global visionaries. India had been gauging interest from potential foreign buyers at the week-long airshow, a major arena for global arms and airliner markets and well-known for bold displays making use of wide vistas of airspace. Friday’s accident was the first on record for the world’s third-largest airshow, after Paris and Britain’s Farnborough. Airshow accidents were common in the 1970s, but have become rare at the top aerospace events as safety restrictions were tightened in recent decades. This is the second known crash of the fighter jet, which is powered by General Electric (GE) engines. The first crash was during an exercise in India in 2024. The Tejas Mk-1A fighters are crucial for India’s efforts to bolster its air force’s depleting fighter squadrons and replace ageing jets in the face of China’s growing military strength and support for arch-rival Pakistan. The IAF expects to operate a fleet of almost 220 Tejas fighters and its advanced Mk-1A variants over the next decade after HAL completes the pending orders. The rollout of the fighter has been delayed due to slow deliveries from GE of 99 engines ordered in 2021, of which only four have arrived so far. GE has blamed supply chain issues following Covid-19.",

In Washington, a defining moment in President Trump’s second term saw a MAGA rebellion force through the release of all government and FBI files on the Epstein investigation, prompting a visibly irritable President to sign it into law while insisting it marked a victory for transparency.

      "summary_orig": "The PTI and the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday staged demonstrations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab in protest of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the mistreatment of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. Concurrently, the PTI and TTAP staged a protest in Karachi, where police detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the demonstration’s scheduled venue. In KP, the demonstrations were staged on the directives of the PTI’s KP President Junaid Akbar, after the TTAP made the decision to march. They were held at the district level, where charged PTI workers chanted slogans against institutions while holding portraits of the party founder. In Peshawar, dozens of PTI workers held a protest outside the Peshawar Press Club, which was addressed by Provincial Minister for Local Government Meena Khan Afridi, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Sher Ali Arbab and the PTI’s Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem. In his speech, Afridi said that Imran has presented two options to the leadership of TTAP. “The first option is to hold negotiations with the powers that be to sort out all outstanding issues,” he said, adding that if the negotiations failed, the second option would be peaceful protest across the country. He assailed the powers of immunity granted through the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which defines that the president and military leadership cannot be prosecuted. “Immunity is un-Islamic, unethical and in violation of traditions,” he said. “The 1973 Constitution was a social contract between the masses, the state, government and institutions, which ended with the 27th Constitutional Amendment.” He urged the Insaf Lawyers Forum to challenge the 27th Amendment and stage a protest against it with the support of the public. Saleem added that the party’s struggle for the supremacy of the constitution, the rule of law and human rights would not stop till achieving their goals. He slammed security agencies for allegedly detaining Pashtoon Tahafuz Movement (PTM) workers following the conclusion of the grand jirga at the KP Assembly on November 12. “Only the elected people have the right to rule Pakistan, while those imposed on the nation have no rights and are ruling the country illegally.” Demonstrations in KP’s districts In Swabi, PTI workers claimed that the incumbent federal government has been working for the establishment since coming to power through a fraudulent election. The party staged a protest on Swabi-Jahangira road in Tordhir against the 27th Constitutional Amendment, claiming that it was passed to strengthen “powerful personalities” instead of common people. Speaking on the occasion, MNA Shahram Khan Tarakai said that terrorists have never been tried in the courts of Islamabad, but PTI leaders have been tried there to stop them from serving the people. Meanwhile, in Mohmand’s Mian Mandi Bazar, PTI workers staged a large protest against the recently-passed Amendment, calling it a “direct assault on Pakistan’s constitution, judicial subjugation and extension scheme”. Party workers, led by district leaders including MNA Sajid Khan and MPA Muhammad Israr, waved black flags and chanted “Withdraw the 27th Amendment” and “Long Live the Constitution”. “The 27th Amendment is a dangerous conspiracy against the nation’s constitution. It was passed to block the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf from the elections,” claimed MNA Khan. MPA Israr said in his address, “The mistreatment of Imran Khan’s sisters the day before yesterday is beyond tolerance. The establishment wants to completely dismantle the PTI. “ He added that through Form 47, the rulers are stripping away judicial independence and hollowing out national institutions. In Battagram, the PTI, led by Battagram chapter president Niaz Muhammad Khan Trand, staged a protest on the Karakoram Highway. The demonstration featured party workers holding placards with slogans against the federal government. Trand stated that Pakistan was founded in the name of Islam, emphasising accountability for all actions. He criticised the PML-N government for “placing itself above the law through the 27th Amendment”, which he deemed unacceptable. He further claimed the amendment aimed “to conceal the government’s mismanagement, corruption and administrative failures”. Niaz accused the PML-N government of attempting to sideline PTI, its leadership, and workers, asserting that PTI remains the most popular and acceptable party in Pakistan. Meanwhile, in Bajaur, scores of PTI workers and supporters attended the demonstration in the Sewai area of War Mamund tehsil, where they chanted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government and its allies while waving party flags. The protesters said that the 27th Amendment was nothing but an attempt to further destroy the judiciary system in the country. Protests staged across Punjab In response to the protest call by the PTI and the TTAP, the PTI’s Chief Organiser in Punjab, Aliya Hamza, also instructed her party’s ticket holders to join the movement. All party ticket holders, even at the union council level, were instructed to wear black bands, hold pro-democracy and judiciary placards and take out rallies in their areas, she said in a message posted on X. By evening, aside from small protests, no big gatherings were reported. Hamza posted on X that the protests had been peaceful, with ticket holders, lawyers and the party’s Punjab chapter protesting outside their tehsil courts against the 27th Amendment and the unethical treatment of Imran’s sisters. “Participants held protest placards and staged a peaceful demonstration,” she wrote.",

In Battagram, the PTI, led by Battagram chapter president Niaz Muhammad Khan Trand, staged a protest on the Karakoram Highway. The demonstration featured party workers holding placards with slogans against the federal government. Trand stated that Pakistan was founded in the name of Islam, emphasising accountability for all actions. He criticised the PML-N government for “placing itself above the law through the 27th Amendment”, which he deemed unacceptable. He further claimed the amendment aimed “to conceal the government’s mismanagement, corruption and administrative failures”. Niaz accused the PML-N government of attempting to sideline PTI, its leadership, and workers, asserting that PTI remains the most popular and acceptable party in Pakistan. Meanwhile, in Bajaur, scores of PTI workers and supporters attended the demonstration in the Sewai area of War Mamund tehsil, where they chanted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government and its allies while waving party flags. The protesters said that the 27th Amendment was nothing but an attempt to further destroy the judiciary system in the country. Protests staged across Punjab In response to the protest call by the PTI and the TTAP, the PTI’s Chief Organiser in Punjab, Aliya Hamza, also instructed her party’s ticket holders to join the movement. All party ticket holders, even at the union council level, were instructed to wear black bands, hold pro-democracy and judiciary placards and take out rallies in their areas, she said in a message posted on X. By evening, aside from small protests, no big gatherings were reported. Hamza posted on X that the protests had been peaceful, with ticket holders, lawyers and the party’s Punjab chapter protesting outside their tehsil courts against the 27th Amendment and the unethical treatment of Imran’s sisters. “Participants held protest placards and staged a peaceful demonstration,” she wrote.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Friday said that the recent death sentence for former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina was an “internal matter” for the country and that its people were fully capable of solving their own issues. A Bangladesh court had sentenced Hasina to death on Monday, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year. The ruling came months ahead of parliamentary elections expected to be held in early February. Addressing his weekly press briefing today, Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said several queries were received regarding the development, on which he said: “This is an internal matter of Bangladesh. The people of Bangladesh are fully capable of addressing their issues in accordance with their own democratic and constitutional processes.” Hasina was found guilty of ordering lethal force by a tribunal in the capital Dhaka, 15 months after resigning and fleeing to India in the face of a student-led uprising that killed hundreds or more. The verdict by the International Crimes Tribunal — a court that Hasina set up to try war crimes from Bangladesh’s 1971 war for independence from Pakistan — marked a dramatic turn for a political career that began when she avoided death during the 1975 coup because she happened to be in Europe. After the sentence was handed down, the Bangladesh government had told India that failure to return her would be a highly unfriendly gesture and an affront to justice. “Under the existing extradition treaty between the two nations, this is a binding obligation for India,” Bangladesh’s foreign ministry had said in a statement. But all previous efforts so far to persuade New Delhi to send her back have faltered. New Delhi said it was committed to “the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country. We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end”. The development also came amid a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement. FO condemns targeting of Kashmiris in wake of Delhi blast Andrabi issued a statement condemning the recent wave of arbitrary arrests and detention of people in India-occupied Kashmir after a bomb blast in New Delhi. “Pakistan remains gravely concerned about the persistent and serious human rights situation in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir,” he said. “The prevailing policies, marked by widespread detentions, arbitrary arrests, and extensive restrictions on fundamental freedoms, continue to amount to collective punishment of the occupied Kashmiri population.” Andrabi added that reports of Kashmiri youth being profiled based on their identity and faith “further heighten these concerns”. “India continues its efforts to alter the demographic character of the occupied territory and to erode the religious, cultural, and social heritage of the Kashmiri people,” the statement added. “These measures appear to form part of a deliberate strategy to suppress the legitimate aspirations of the Kashmiri population.” Andrabi added that thousands of Kashmiri youths remain missing, while political representatives remain in custody. He said that these actions cannot undermine the Kashmiri people’s “enduring commitment to realising their internationally recognised right to self-determination”. “Pakistan calls upon the international community, including the United Nations, the Human Rights Council and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, to take full cognisance of the grave human rights situation in IIOJK,” the statement read. The FO requested that international bodies urge India to take immediate remedial measures, ensure accountability for documented violations and allow international human rights organisations to conduct independent and impartial assessments. “A just, peaceful, and lasting resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, remains essential for durable peace and stability in South Asia,” the statement concluded.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed 13 terrorists during two separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Friday. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in the statement that a joint intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in the Pahar Khel area of Lakki Marwat district, conducted by security forces and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD). “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, ten khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement read. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) The CTD said in their statement earlier today that two key commanders were among the terrorists killed in the IBO, which was launched at 7:30am. “During the operation, 10 terrorists were killed, including two key commanders of the Teepo Gul group: Commander Niaz Ali, known as Akasha and Commander Abdullah, known as Shipunkoi,” the CTD said, adding that five terrorists were wounded, and one facilitator was arrested in the IBO. In a separate IBO conducted in Dera Ismail Khan district, three terrorists were killed by security forces, according to ISPR. “Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from [the] killed Indian sponsored khawarij , who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians,” the military’s media wing said. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as [the] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.” Earlier this week, the ISPR said that 38 terrorists were killed in four separate IBOs conducted over a period of three days in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in terror incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.",

      "summary_orig": "The Karachi police on Friday detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the venue of a scheduled protest by the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), held as part of countrywide demonstrations against the recently passed 27th Constitutional Amendment. All roads leading to the Karachi Press Club (KPC) were closed by the police after buses and other heavy vehicles were parked to block access. Contingents of female police personnel were also deployed. Some protesters were detained as they attempted to reach KPC. PTI Sindh spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar told Dawn that “more than two dozen protesters” were detained near the KPC. Also detained was civil society activist Alifya Sohail, not part of the TTAP protest, who was initially taken to the Artillery Maidan Police Station, where her phone was taken from her and she was not permitted to contact anyone. She was subsequently moved to the Women Police Station situated on Sharae Faisal. No case was registered against her, nor was there any written complaint against her. Sohail has been consistently covering civil society protests, enforced disappearances and activities of rights group Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) in Karachi for several years. Journalists and human rights activists called her arrest a serious attack on press freedom and demanded her immediate release. The police claimed later in the day that all detainees were released. Tehrik-i-Numandagi Awam protest The protest organised by the Tehrik-i-Numandagi Awam brought together civil society members, grassroots activists, and lawyers who collectively condemned and rejected the 27th Constitutional Amendment. It marked the launch of the platform, which is “a national movement formed to restore the Constitution, defend fundamental rights and re-establish the people’s mandate,” as per a press release issued by the group. It was held amid heavy police deployment outside the KPC, where contingents of police could be seen carrying batons. Lahore-based academic Dr Ammar Ali Jan, speaking to Dawn , assailed the 27th Amendment, calling it an “affront” to democracy. Jan stressed that the “Constitution is a contract between the people and the state,” noting that with the passing of the 27th Amendment, the state was blocking all avenues of “resistance to the system”. “Where would a common person go to get justice when you block all legal paths?” he questioned. Decrying the amendment, one of the participants, Samrina Hashmi, expressed her frustration over the current state of affairs while speaking to Dawn . “I am 65 years old. I am so frustrated. When will I see my country flourish? We have been fighting all our lives against martial law, dictatorship. It seems we are going back to 1958,” she remarked, in an apparent reference to the military coup staged by General Ayub Khan in 1958. Organiser Riaz Ahmed told Dawn that the amendment was a “question mark on the state of our judiciary”. He called for the annulment of the 26th and the 27th amendments. On the matter of resistance against the amendment, Ahmed told Dawn that “there was solid momentum” building against it.",

      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday reiterated that the “illegal and unilateral” step to hold the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) in abeyance is a “real threat” to regional stability while addressing the Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum Roundtable in Brussels. India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Speaking at the EU forum in Belgium’s capital today, Dar emphasised that water must be a source of cooperation “and not weaponised for politics”. “We believe that durable peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without a peaceful resolution of decades-old Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and aspirations of Kashmiri people,” Dar said. On the subject of Afghanistan, the foreign minister said the country “remains a consequential relationship for Pakistan and the regional stability”. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have also come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. “We desire a peaceful, stable, friendly, connected, and prosperous Afghanistan. We urge the Afghan Taliban regime to act responsibly, honour their commitments, and work towards rooting out terrorism from its soil,” Dar restated. With reference to Israel and Gaza , DPM said the situation in the Middle East “impacts us all directly”. “Pakistan commends efforts of President Trump, along with eight Arab Islamic countries, including Pakistan, leading to the signing of the peace agreement in Sharm el-Sheikh, heralding a ceasefire,” he said. “The ongoing atrocities in Gaza and violations of the peace agreement must end, as well as the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands,” he added. “Our foreign policy is grounded in the criticality of a credible, time-bound political process consistent with relevant [UNSC] resolutions, leading to the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital,” Dar stressed. The foreign minister also spoke on the conflict in Ukraine , which he pointed out has disrupted energy and food markets, “with real consequences for people around the globe”. He said that Islamabad’s position on the conflict is anchored in the UN Charter. “We hope for a peaceful resolution of this conflict at the earliest. The model of cooperation adopted by the [EU] offers many lessons for the international community, proving that inclusivity and interdependence are the surest foundations of peace and prosperity.”",

We urge the Afghan Taliban regime to act responsibly, honour their commitments, and work towards rooting out terrorism from its soil,” Dar restated. With reference to Israel and Gaza , DPM said the situation in the Middle East “impacts us all directly”. “Pakistan commends efforts of President Trump, along with eight Arab Islamic countries, including Pakistan, leading to the signing of the peace agreement in Sharm el-Sheikh, heralding a ceasefire,” he said. “The ongoing atrocities in Gaza and violations of the peace agreement must end, as well as the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands,” he added. “Our foreign policy is grounded in the criticality of a credible, time-bound political process consistent with relevant [UNSC] resolutions, leading to the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital,” Dar stressed. The foreign minister also spoke on the conflict in Ukraine , which he pointed out has disrupted energy and food markets, “with real consequences for people around the globe”. He said that Islamabad’s position on the conflict is anchored in the UN Charter. “We hope for a peaceful resolution of this conflict at the earliest. The model of cooperation adopted by the [EU] offers many lessons for the international community, proving that inclusivity and interdependence are the surest foundations of peace and prosperity.”",
      "title": "Abeyance of Indus Waters Treaty presents ‘real threat’ to regional stability, Dar tells EU",
      "summary": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday reiterated that the “illegal and unilateral” step to hold the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) in abeyance is a “real threat” to regional stability while addressing the Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum Roundtable in Brussels. India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Speaking at the EU forum in Belgium’s capital today, Dar emphasised that water must be a source of cooperation “and not weaponised for politics”. “We believe that durable peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without a peaceful resolution of decades-old Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and aspirations of Kashmiri people,” Dar said. On the subject of Afghanistan, the foreign minister said the country “remains a consequential relationship for Pakistan and the regional stability”. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have also come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. “We desire a peaceful, stable, friendly, connected, and prosperous Afghanistan.

      "title_orig": "South Africa accepts huge rate of violence against women is national disaster",
      "summary_orig": "South Africa said on Friday the rate of violence against women in the country was a national disaster, as thousands protested to highlight the problem ahead of this weekend’s G20 summit of world leaders. The country has one of the world’s highest rates of gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF), leading to deaths five times higher than the global average, according to the United Nations’s gender equality organisation UN Women. In one of dozens of “lie-in” protests countrywide, thousands of people dressed in black lay on the ground for 15 minutes at an event in Johannesburg’s city centre, just a few kilometres (miles) from the venue where G20 leaders will meet on Saturday and Sunday. Organisers said the action was to honour the 15 women murdered every day in South Africa. A 2022 government survey found that one in three South African women had experienced physical violence, and almost 10 per cent had faced sexual violence. More than 10,700 cases of rape were reported to police in the first three months of 2025, but the real numbers are expected to be much higher. “I’m here standing for not only myself but my younger sisters, my siblings and every woman in South Africa,” said one of the protesters, 23-year-old Lefika Jonathan. The government’s disaster management said that after evaluating the “persistent and immediate life-safety risks posed by ongoing acts of violence”, it had concluded that GBVF met the “threshold of a potential disaster”. This made the issue a priority for the executive branch of government and “all organs of state”, it said. “All we want is justice,” said another protester, 19-year-old student Nomhle Porogo. She hoped the timing of the protest meant “those in higher positions can hear our cries”. But she was unimpressed by the decision to wait until South Africa was in the international spotlight to classify the problem a disaster – a longstanding demand from women’s rights groups. “For them to declare it a national disaster when it suits them and in front of our visitors because they want to make our house look clean for visitors…is an injustice,” she told AFP.",

      "summary_orig": "Seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, police said on Friday. Police officials told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Talib’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives. In their complaint to the police, the victims’ family has maintained that the attack was a result of a family feud. However, police say the family has taken the stance to avoid another potential attack carried out in retaliation. The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Havaid police station under Sections 302 (punishment for intentional murder), 324 (attempt of intentional murder), 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common objective) and 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) of the Pakistan Penal Code. The FIR said that the suspects barged into the victims’ baithak (guesthouse), opened fire on them and fled. Three suspects were nominated in the FIR, which said they were accompanied by other armed men and led by a terrorist commander. According to the complainant, named Abdullah, there was enmity between his family and the suspects over the matter of a murder. Peace committees, or village defence committees, were formed to assist law enforcement agencies in defending KP areas against terror attacks. These also include former militants, often referred to as ‘good Taliban’. Peace committee officials in KP have been targeted by terrorists in the past as well. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “strongly condemned” today’s attack, state-run APP reported. The prime minister expressed “deep grief and sorrow” over the loss of precious lives in the attack, which he said was carried out by “ Fitna-al-Khawarij ”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term designated by the state for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP). APP , citing an official statement, reported that PM Shehbaz prayed for the “elevation of ranks of the departed souls in jannah (paradise) and for patience for their families”. He directed relevant authorities to identify those responsible and ensure they received due punishment, the report said. “Such cowardly acts, aimed at sabotaging peace efforts, expose the evil intentions of the Fitna-al-Khawarij to create unrest in Pakistan. These cowardly actions cannot, at any cost, weaken the resolve of the people. “The entire nation stands united to defeat anti-state elements,” the statement quoted him as saying. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack “carried out by *Fitna-al-Khawarij”,* a statement issued by his office said. “He expressed deep sorrow over the loss of life in the attack,” the statement said, adding that he also extended condolences to the bereaved families. The statement quoted him as saying: “This cowardly attack of terrorism is a nefarious attempt to undermine peace and stability. Such cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken the high morale of the people. The state and the nation are standing united against enemies of peace.”",
