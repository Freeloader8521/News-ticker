      "summary_orig": "The United Nations’ top legal body, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), on Wednesday said Israel has an obligation to ensure the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met. The panel of 11 judges added that Israel is forced to support the relief efforts provided by the United Nations in the Gaza strip and its entities, including the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Israel has not substantiated its claims that a significant number of UNRWA’s employees are members of Hamas, the judges said. The ICJ said that Israel was obliged to ease the passage of aid into Gaza, stressing it had to provide Palestinians with “basic needs” essential to survival. The wide-ranging ICJ ruling came as aid groups are scrambling to scale up much-needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza, seizing upon a fragile ceasefire agreed earlier this month. The ICJ’s “Advisory Opinion” is not legally binding but the court believes it carries “great legal weight and moral authority”. Israel did not take part in the proceedings but an official told journalists before the hearing that it was “an abuse of international law”. The official added that Israel “cooperates with international organisations, with other UN agencies regarding Gaza. But Israel will not cooperate with UNRWA”. ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa said the ICJ “rejects the argument that the request abuses and weaponises the international judicial process”. On the eve of the ICJ ruling, Abeer Etefa, Middle East spokeswoman for the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), said 530 of the organisation’s trucks had crossed into Gaza since the ceasefire. Those trucks had delivered more than 6,700 tonnes of food, which she said was “enough for close to half a million people for two weeks”. Etefa said around 750 tonnes a day were now coming through, which, although more than before the ceasefire, remains well below WFP’s target of around 2,000 tonnes daily. The ICJ said that Israel, as an occupying power, was under an obligation “to ensure the basic needs of the local population, including the supplies essential for their survival”. At the same time, Israel was “also under a negative obligation not to impede the provision of these supplies”, the court said. The court also recalled the obligation under international law not to use starvation as a method of warfare. ‘Serious concerns’ The UN had asked the ICJ to clarify Israel’s obligations, as an occupying power, towards UN and other bodies “including to ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of urgently needed supplies essential to the survival” of Palestinians. ICJ judges heard a week of evidence in April from dozens of nations and organisations, much of which revolved around the status of UNRWA. At the ICJ hearings, a US official raised “serious concerns” about UNRWA’s impartiality, and alleged that Hamas used the agency’s facilities. The US official, Josh Simmons, said Israel had “no obligation to permit UNRWA specifically to provide humanitarian assistance”. Simmons added that UNRWA was not the only option for delivering aid into Gaza. However, the ICJ noted that UNRWA “cannot be replaced on short notice without a proper transition plan”. Palestinian official Ammar Hijazi told the ICJ judges during the April hearings that Israel was blocking aid as a “weapon of war”, sparking starvation in Gaza. Wednesday’s case was separate from the others Israel faces under international law over its campaign in Gaza. In July 2024, the ICJ issued another advisory opinion stating that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories was “unlawful” and must end as soon as possible. ICJ judges are also weighing accusations , brought by South Africa, that Israel has broken the 1948 UN Genocide Convention with its actions in Gaza. Another court in The Hague, the International Criminal Court, has issued arrest warrants for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. It also issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif, who Israel says was killed in an airstrike.",

      "summary_orig": "A new United Nations secretary-general will be elected next year for a five-year term starting on January 1, 2027. Here are the potential candidates so far and how the successor to current UN chief Antonio Guterres will be chosen: When does the process start? The race will formally start when the 15-member Security Council and the president of the 193-member General Assembly send a joint letter soliciting nominations. That letter is due to be sent by the end of the year. A candidate has to be nominated by a UN member state. The job traditionally rotates among regions, but when Guterres — who is from Portugal — was elected in 2016, it was supposed to be Eastern Europe’s turn. Next on the list is Latin America; however, some diplomats expect candidates from other regions. Who wants to be the next secretary-general? While the race doesn’t formally begin until the letter is sent by the presidents of the Security Council and the General Assembly, there are already several publicly declared candidates: Michelle Bachelet — Chile : Chile will nominate the country’s former president, Michelle Bachelet, President Gabriel Boric said on September 23, 2025. Bachelet was Chile’s first female head of state and served as president of the South American nation twice. Bachelet was UN High Commissioner for Human Rights between 2018-2022 and executive director of UN Women between 2010-2013. Rebeca Grynspan — Costa Rica : Costa Rica will nominate former Vice President Rebeca Grynspan, President Rodrigo Chaves said on October 8, 2025. Grynspan, a 69-year-old politician and economist, currently serves as Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Rafael Grossi — Argentina : Grossi has long said he was considering campaigning to be secretary-general. When asked by Reuters on September 3, 2025 if he was definitely going to run, he said: “Yes, I am going to do that, yes.” A veteran Argentinian diplomat, Grossi is director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a role he has held since 2019. What is the process? The 15-member Security Council will formally recommend a candidate to the 193-member General Assembly for election as the 10th UN secretary-general later next year. The Security Council will hold secret ballots — referred to as a straw poll — until a consensus is reached on a candidate. The choices council members are given for each candidate in the straw poll are: encourage, discourage or no opinion. Ultimately, the five permanent veto-wielding council members — the United States, Russia, Britain, China and France — must agree on a candidate. The ballots for the veto powers in the straw poll are traditionally a different colour from those of the 10 elected members. When Guterres was chosen in 2016 to be recommended to the General Assembly, it took six straw polls for the Security Council to reach agreement. The Security Council then adopts a resolution, traditionally behind closed doors, recommending an appointment to the General Assembly. The resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes to pass. The General Assembly’s approval of the appointment of a secretary-general has long been seen as a rubber stamp. How transparent is the process? The United Nations has been working to improve the transparency of the historically opaque selection process. The General Assembly, in a resolution adopted in September 2025, said each candidate should provide a vision statement when they are formally nominated and be given the opportunity to present it. It said the vision statement should also be publicised on a dedicated United Nations web page. The Assembly said each candidate should disclose their sources of funding and that any candidates who already hold a UN position “should consider suspending their work in the United Nations system during the campaign, with a view to avoiding any conflict of interest that may arise from their functions and adjacent advantages.” What does the secretary-general do? The UN Charter calls the secretary-general the “chief administrative officer” of the world body. The UN website describes the role as “equal parts diplomat and advocate, civil servant and chief executive officer.” Guterres currently oversees more than 30,000 civilian staff and 11 peacekeeping operations with around 60,000 troops and police. The core annual United Nations budget is $3.7 billion, while the peacekeeping budget is $5.6bn. Since the power to authorise military force or sanctions rests with the Security Council, the UN chief has little more than a bully pulpit. Many diplomats say the five council veto powers prefer a “secretary” rather than a “general.” Has a woman ever been secretary-general? No. There is a growing push for the United Nations to choose the first female secretary-general in its 80-year history. In the resolution adopted in September, the General Assembly noted “with regret that no woman has ever held the position of Secretary-General” and encouraged countries to “strongly consider nominating women as candidates.” Header image: The General Assembly Hall is seen at the United Nations headquarters in New York City September 18, 2015. — Reuters",

The UN website describes the role as “equal parts diplomat and advocate, civil servant and chief executive officer.” Guterres currently oversees more than 30,000 civilian staff and 11 peacekeeping operations with around 60,000 troops and police. The core annual United Nations budget is $3.7 billion, while the peacekeeping budget is $5.6bn. Since the power to authorise military force or sanctions rests with the Security Council, the UN chief has little more than a bully pulpit. Many diplomats say the five council veto powers prefer a “secretary” rather than a “general.” Has a woman ever been secretary-general? No. There is a growing push for the United Nations to choose the first female secretary-general in its 80-year history. In the resolution adopted in September, the General Assembly noted “with regret that no woman has ever held the position of Secretary-General” and encouraged countries to “strongly consider nominating women as candidates.” Header image: The General Assembly Hall is seen at the United Nations headquarters in New York City September 18, 2015. — Reuters",

      "summary_orig": "The PTI announced on Wednesday that a “massive public rally” would be held in Karachi during the month of November to kick off a nationwide public engagement campaign. A press release issued today said the decision was taken during PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja’s visit to Karachi. During his visit, he met party leaders, including PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, PTI Parliamentary Leader Shabbir Qureshi and Jamal Siddiqui. Raja held detailed discussions on the prevailing political situation, strategy for party founder Imran Khan’s release and organisational matters. Addressing the media after the meetings, Raja announced that a “massive public rally will be held in Karachi” in November, followed by similar gatherings in Hyderabad and other major cities as part of a nationwide public engagement campaign. The senior PTI leader added that the party was united and mobilised for Imran’s release. He informed those present that Mahmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated as opposition leader in the National Assembly and Raja Nasir Abbas in the Senate, while Sohail Afridi had been appointed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, terming the recent moves as symbolising “a wave of political renewal within PTI”. “We stand firm for the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law,” Barrister Raja said. “Truth and justice will prevail. All cases fabricated against Imran Khan are proving false in the courts. However, delaying tactics are being used to hinder justice, but these baseless cases will soon be over.” Reiterating Imran’s message to the nation, Raja said: “Patron in Chief Imran Khan has urged the people to keep faith in Allah Almighty; victory always belongs to truth. He has directed the party to reach out to the public through rallies across the country to raise awareness against oppression and injustice.” Expressing grave concern over the situation in Sindh, Raja said that the PPP had “in the last 17 years … turned Sindh into ruins”. He noted that from Karachi to the interior of the province, cities were in a state of decay, adding that lawlessness and insecurity had made life miserable for citizens. Raja said he had personally visited several cities of Sindh and found a “scene of desolation and hopelessness everywhere“. “Rampant corruption by the PPP has plundered Sindh’s public resources,” he asserted. “But the people of Sindh are now awake. Wherever we went, we witnessed overwhelming support for Imran Khan. The people of Sindh want change; they want a leader like Imran Khan: honest, brave, and dedicated to the nation.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about the lack of access to the party founder and how family, friends and party leaders are hindered from meeting him. The party said last week that Imran has offered to resolve the recent hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan and other issues if he is released on parole. The party had also aired concerns earlier this month about Imran being transferred from Adiala Jail to some unknown location to prevent his access to his family and legal team.",

      "summary_orig": "Anxious to bolster its air power, Turkiye has proposed to European partners and the US ways it could swiftly obtain advanced fighter jets as it seeks to make up ground on regional rivals such as Israel, sources familiar with the talks say. NATO-member Turkiye, which has the alliance’s second-largest military, aims to leverage its best relations with the West in years to add to its ageing fleet 40 Eurofighter Typhoons, for which it inked a preliminary agreement in July, and later also US-made F-35 jets, despite Washington sanctions that currently block any deal. Strikes by Israel — the Middle East’s most advanced military with hundreds of US-supplied F-15, F-16 and F-35 fighters — on Turkiye’s neighbours Iran and Syria , as well as on Lebanon and Qatar , unnerved Ankara in the last year. They laid bare key vulnerabilities, prompting its push for rapid air power reinforcement to counter any potential threats and not be left exposed, officials say. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has sharply criticised Israel’s attacks on Gaza and elsewhere in the Middle East, and once warm relations between the two countries have sunk to new lows. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Turkiye’s bases, rebel allies and support for the army in Syria posed a threat to Israel. Greece, a largely symbolic but sensitive threat to Turkiye, is expected to receive a batch of advanced F-35s in the next three years. In years past, jets from the two NATO states engaged in scattered dogfights over the Aegean, and Greece has previously expressed concerns about Turkish military build-up. Turkiye would buy second-hand planes to get them fast For the Typhoons, Turkiye is nearing a deal with Britain and other European countries in which it would promptly receive 12 of them, albeit used, from previous buyers Qatar and Oman to meet its immediate needs, according to a person familiar with the matter. Eurofighter consortium members Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain would approve the second-hand sale proposal, in which they would provide Turkiye with 28 new jets in the coming years pending a final purchase agreement, the person said. Erdogan is expected to discuss the proposal on visits to Qatar and Oman on Wednesday and Thursday, with jet numbers, pricing, and timelines the main issues. Erdogan is then expected to host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz later this month, when agreements could be sealed, sources say. A UK government spokesperson told Reuters that a memorandum of understanding that Britain and Turkiye signed in July paves the way “for a multibillion-pound order of up to 40 aircraft,” adding: “We look forward to agreeing the final contracting details soon.” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, who was in Ankara last week, said Berlin supported the jets purchase and later told broadcaster NTV that a deal could follow within the year. Turkiye’s defence ministry said no final agreement had been reached and that talks with Britain were moving in a positive direction, adding that other consortium members backed the procurement. Qatar and Oman did not immediately comment. Turkiye, US have political will to resolve issues Acquiring the advanced F-35s has proven trickier for Ankara, which has been barred from buying them since 2020 when Washington slapped it with CAATSA sanctions over its purchase of Russian S-400 air defences. Erdogan failed to make headway on the issue at a White House meeting with President Donald Trump last month. But Turkiye still aims to capitalise on the two leaders’ good personal ties, and Erdogan’s help in convincing Palestinian group Hamas to sign Trump’s Gaza ceasefire agreement , to eventually reach a deal. Separate sources have said that Ankara considered proposing a plan that could have included a US presidential “waiver” to overcome the CAATSA sanctions and pave the way for an eventual resolution of the S-400 issue and F-35 purchase. Turkiye’s possession of the S-400s remains the main obstacle to purchasing F-35s, but Ankara and Washington have publicly stated a desire to overcome this, saying the allies have the political will to do so. The potential temporary waiver, if given, could help Ankara increase defence cooperation with Washington and possibly build sympathy in a US Congress that has been sceptical of Turkiye in the past, the sources said. “Both sides know that resolving CAATSA needs to be done. Whether it is a presidential waiver or a congressional decision, that is up to the United States,” Harun Armagan, vice chair of foreign affairs for Erdogan’s ruling AK Party, told Reuters. “It looks awkward with all of the other diplomacy and cooperation happening at the same time.” Turkiye’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about floating a waiver to US counterparts or discussions on resolving the S-400 issue. The White House did not immediately comment on whether Ankara raised a waiver option. A State Department spokesperson said Trump recognises Turkiye’s strategic importance and that “his administration is seeking creative solutions to all of these pending issues,” but did not elaborate further. Asked about Turkiye’s separate agreement to buy 40 F-16s, an earlier generation fighter jet, a US source said that talks have been dogged by Turkish concerns about the price and desire to buy the more advanced F-35s instead. Turkiye has developed its own stealth fighter Frustrated by past hot-cold ties with the West and some arms embargoes, Turkiye has developed its own KAAN stealth fighter. Yet officials acknowledge it will take years before it replaces the F-16s that form the backbone of its air force. Jet upgrades are part of a broader effort to strengthen layered air defences that also includes Turkiye’s domestic “Steel Dome” project and an expansion of long-range missile coverage. Yanki Bagcioglu, an opposition CHP lawmaker and former Turkish Air Force brigadier general, said Turkiye must accelerate plans for KAAN, Eurofighter and F-16 jets. “At present, our air-defence system is not at the desired level,” he said, blaming “project-management failures.”",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Wednesday condemned Israel’s renewed hostilities in Gaza, following a US-backed ceasefire agreement, calling on the international community to take “urgent and effective” measures against the violation. Israeli forces have killed at least 87 Palestinians, among them civilians, since the ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and two Israeli soldiers were killed by Palestinian freedom fighters in southern Gaza over the weekend, Reuters reported. On Sunday, more than 100 air strikes were reported in Rafah and Khan Younis in the south, Jabalia in the north, and other parts of central Gaza. While Israel accuses Hamas of initiating the hostilities with an attack on its forces in Rafah, the group has denied any knowledge or connection to the incident. “Pakistan strongly condemns the renewed attacks by the Israeli occupying forces in Gaza, resulting in the loss of numerous civilian lives,” said a statement released by the Foreign Office (FO) today. It noted that Israeli actions “run contrary to the spirit of the peace agreement signed in Sharm El-Sheikh in the presence of leadership from the Muslim and Arab world, [the] US, Europe, and the UN.” The FO, in its statement, urged the international community to “take urgent and effective measures to end these violations and to ensure full implementation of the ceasefire and protection of Palestinian civilians. “Reaffirming its unwavering support for the Palestinian people, Pakistan calls for an immediate end to Israeli hostilities and reiterates its principled position for the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.” Pakistan was among the eight countries that worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Most Americans support US recognition of Palestinian state, poll shows Most Americans — including 80 per cent of Democrats and 41pc of Republicans — think the US should recognise Palestinian statehood, a sign that Trump’s opposition to doing so is out of step with public opinion, a Reuters /Ipsos poll found. The six-day poll, which closed on Monday, found 59pc of respondents backed US recognition of a Palestinian state, while 33pc were opposed and the rest were unsure or did not answer the question. About half of Trump’s Republicans — 53pc — opposed doing so, while 41pc of Republicans said they would support the US recognising a Palestinian state. A growing number of countries — including US allies Britain, Canada, France and Australia — have formally recognised Palestinian statehood in recent weeks, drawing condemnation from Israel, whose founding in 1948 led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and decades of conflict. Israeli bombardments have leveled vast swaths of Palestinian neighbourhoods in Gaza following an October 2023 surprise attack by Hamas on Israel. Some 60pc of poll respondents said Israel’s response in Gaza was excessive, compared to 32pc who disagreed. Trump, who returned to the White House in January, has largely backed Israel in its offensive and this month brokered a ceasefire , raising hopes that a lasting peace could be in reach. The Reuters /Ipsos poll gave signs that the US public was ready to give Trump credit should his plan work. Some 51pc of poll respondents agreed with a statement that Trump “deserves significant credit” if peace efforts are successful, compared with 42pc who disagreed. While only one in 20 Democrats approve of Trump’s overall performance as president, one in four said he should get significant credit if the peace holds. The Reuters /Ipsos poll was conducted online and gathered responses from 4,385 people nationwide. It had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.",

      "summary_orig": "Roman philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero believed that laws were silent amidst the clash of arms. However, the notion that rules were necessary even in times of armed conflict have ancient roots. From the ancient Vedic traditions, Sun Tzu’s ‘The Art of War’, Roman law, the Bible, and the Qur’an, all of these texts include stipulations of what is or is not allowed in war. These norms have evolved into the contemporary law of armed conflict, which aims to spare those not directly involved in hostilities and limit the effects of violence to the amount necessary for the purpose of war. They aim to balance the need to uphold humanitarian rules even in times of armed conflict and that of military necessity, which would allow for a party to the conflict to engage in lawful conduct in order for it to win the war. Ultimately, they seek to inject some element of humanity into the awful business that is warfare. Cardinal Principles Distinction The laws of armed conflict are applied when there is a “resort to armed force between States or protracted violence between governmental authorities and organised armed groups or between such groups within a State.“ Therefore they apply to inter-state as well as civil wars. One of the cardinal principles of the laws of war is that of distinction . This rule states that parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives. Only combatants and military objectives are to be targeted. However, there are certain caveats to the simple statement of this rule. Civilians can be targeted if they directly participate in hostilities for so long as they do so. Moreover, combatants who are injured, surrender, or become prisoners of war cannot be targeted. The definition of military objective has been subject to debate. The law defines military objectives as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”. This generally includes armaments factories, missile depots and command centres, however, it can also include bridges if they are used to supply troops to the front line and hills if they offer a vantage point of high ground. Even hospitals can become a legitimate target if they are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy, though the opposing party must give a warning before attacking a hospital. The US’ position has been that military objectives include ‘war sustaining’ objectives as the military advantage comes from the revenues which allow them to support their military operations. This renders the US’ targeting of oil tankers and cash stockpiles in its war against Isis lawful. This interpretation has been contended and criticised. Legal scholar Marty Lederman, for instance, asks whether this approach would allow a state at war with the US to “target Apple headquarters, or various other tax-generating operations in Silicon Valley.” Similarly, in its most recent operation in the Gaza Strip, Israel “adopts a highly unusual view” that entire apartment buildings inside which an enemy military facility is found constitute a single military objective that may be targeted. Most other militaries adopt the view that the unit itself is a military objective but the entire building is not. Therefore, there are a number of approaches that states adopt regarding the definition of military objectives which allow for a broader view of what may or may not be targeted during times of armed conflict. Proportionality The principle of proportionality provides that the amount of ‘collateral damage’ must be weighed against the military advantage anticipated from an attack. The law itself defines an indiscriminate attack as an “attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”. A key issue with this principle is the inherent difficulty of weighing civilian life in exchange for military advantage and whether they can in fact be balanced at all. While many human rights reports in particular simply determine an attack to be disproportionate due to the civilian lives lost, that is not an adequate way to gauge the legality or otherwise of an attack. As military lawyers have stated , “I have approved targets that could have caused 3,000 civilian casualties and I’ve raised questions about targets predicted to risk fewer than 200 civilian lives. The issue is about the importance of the target.” However, the importance of the target itself may be subjectively determined with the importance of the military advantage to be gained being overblown, thereby undermining the calculation made. In analysing Israel’s attack on the Jabalia refugee camp on October 31, 2023, in which 126 civilians died in the targeting of a Hamas commander, operatives and the tunnel network underneath the camp, Mark Lattimer notes that “the IDF appears to have accepted a level of expected civilian casualties that was not just larger but several times larger than that used by the U.S. and the U.K. in any of the operations during the war against ISIS and other counterterrorism campaigns”. He further questions Israel’s commitment to civilian protection which the principle of proportionality aims to guarantee. Precaution The principle of precaution requires that feasible measures be taken to ensure that civilians or civilian objects are not being attacked. If a range of options are available, for instance, in destroying a railway line, it would be preferable to destroy the line in the countryside as opposed to in the city, if this is feasible. Additionally, the attacking state must take precautions in choosing weapons and tactics to minimise incidental injury and collateral damage and the selecting of military objectives among those giving similar military advantage expected to cause least danger to civilian lives or objects. This principle also obliges parties to endeavour to give warning if feasible to civilians who may be affected by an attack. However, compliance with the principle of precaution does not mean that any of the other obligations (of distinction and proportionality) are lessened in any way. Israel has in the past issued warnings before air strikes through phone calls, text messages or ‘knocks on the roof. In doing so, Israel argues that it is abiding by international law. It is contended , however, that giving warnings to civilians who in practice have no means to leave may not in fact comply with this cardinal principle. Conclusion After the devastation wrought by recent conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan, where the laws of war have been violated and war crimes have been committed, it is a worthwhile endeavour to return to the laws themselves and ask whether they are in fact fit for purpose. While the norms underlying these rules have ancient roots, it may be that the current indeterminacy with which they are drafted, and the varying approaches to their implementation, undermine the fundamental principles they seek to protect. In order to reduce human suffering amid the clash of arms, it may be that more precise and objective rules are required.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan Navy ship Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea, according to a statement issued on Wednesday from the naval network overseeing the operation. The Combined Maritime Force (CMF), a naval partnership that includes the United States, said the Pakistani naval vessel intercepted two different dhow sailing boats within 48 hours last week. It was working in “direct support of Saudi-led Combined Task Force (CTF) 150” of the CMF during focused operation Al Masmak, which began on October 16. “The crew boarded the first dhow and seized over two tons of crystal methamphetamine with an estimated street value of $822,400,000 [on] October 18. Less than 48 hours later, the crew boarded a second dhow and seized 350 kilogrammes of [crystal meth] worth $140,000,000 and 50kg of cocaine worth $10,000,000,” the CMF statement said. The narcotics were transported back to the ship for testing to confirm the contents and subsequently disposed of, the statement added. The intercepted vessels were “identified as having no nationality”, it said without indicating where they had originated. It was “one of the most successful narcotics seizures for CMF,” Royal Saudi Naval Forces Commodore Fahad Aljoiad, commander of the CMF taskforce carrying out the operation, was quoted as saying. “The success of this focused operation highlights the importance of the multi-national collaboration,” he further stated. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Navy said in a statement that the achievement highlighted its “unwavering commitment to regional maritime security, global peace, and the collective fight against illicit trafficking at sea”. It further said that the successful operation reaffirmed Pakistan’s “active role as a responsible maritime partner contributing to peace and security in the wider Indian Ocean region”. The statement further said that Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf commended the crew for their professionalism and dedication. “He emphasised that Pakistan Navy remains steadfast in its mission to safeguard national maritime interests while contributing to the global commons through cooperation and coordinated maritime security efforts,” it quoted him as syaing. “The naval chief underscored that PNS Yarmook’s operation under Saudi-led task force will further enhance the interoperability between the two navies and strengthen defence collaboration between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it added. President Asif Ali Zardari said that the achievement reflected “national pride, professional excellence, and Pakistan Navy’s unwavering commitment to regional peace and maritime security”. The US Central Command in a post on X congratulated the CMF, which includes 47 countries’ navies and patrols more than three million square miles of sea, including some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, to disrupt the smuggling of drugs and weapons. The commissioning ceremony for Pakistan Navy Ship (PNS) Yarmook was held in Romania in February 2020 and it was inducted into the Pakistan Navy fleet in December 2020. PNS Yarmook is an electronic warfare, anti-ship and anti-air platform with cutting edge self-protection and terminal defence systems. The ship is capable of performing a variety of maritime operations and unmanned aerial vehicle operations simultaneously. In March last year, the vessel was employed in a rescue operation after a distress call from a boat, carrying eight Iranian fishermen, that had caught fire. In July 2024, it was also deployed in the Indian Ocean with an embarked helicopter for the safety and security of merchant ships bound to and coming from the country’s ports.",

      "summary_orig": "A Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC) again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, on Wednesday in a case pertaining to protests staged by the PTI in November last year over her absence from the hearing. This is the fourth time that the court has issued an arrest warrant for Aleema in the case. November 26 protests , as they famously came to be known as, saw more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone had ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”. Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations. Proceedings for the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station were held at the ATC in Rawalpindi today, where 10 of the 11 suspects appeared before the court. Subsequently, the ATC again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over her failure to appear before the court. The court also issued a show-cause notice to Superintendent of Police (Rawal Division) Saad Arshad and Deputy Superintendent of Police Naeem for filing a “bogus report”. Moreover, the court summoned them in their personal capacities over “contempt of court”. The court remarked that the officials had said in the report that Aleema had gone into hiding. But, she was seen at the Adiala jail and also on social media channels, the court observed. During the last hearing, the court had directed SP Saad to arrest and produce Aleema before the court on Oct 22 (today). It had also ordered the confiscation of her surety bond and the verification of property documents submitted by her guarantor. At today’s hearing, her guarantor’s surety bonds were confiscated and Aleema was directed to submit new surety bonds worth Rs1 million. Moreover, the surety bonds of the guarantors of four vehicles linked to the case, which had been acquired from the ATC, were also confiscated. The case has been adjourned till November 24. Previous proceedings Today was not the first time when the court issued arrest warrants for Aleema in the case over her non-appearance. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her over her continued absence from the proceedings during the last hearing on Oct 20 as well. Prior to that, the court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her during the hearing on Oct 14, noting that she had failed to appear twice before the court. It had also directed Sadiqabad police to arrest and produce her before the court by Oct 15. The court had also rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that she was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the Nov 26 protest. The ATC had also issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleem on Oct 8. Aleema was to be indicted during that hearing but didn’t appear before the court.",

Prior to that, the court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her during the hearing on Oct 14, noting that she had failed to appear twice before the court. It had also directed Sadiqabad police to arrest and produce her before the court by Oct 15. The court had also rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that she was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the Nov 26 protest. The ATC had also issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleem on Oct 8. Aleema was to be indicted during that hearing but didn’t appear before the court.",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump has stated that he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a phone call where they talked about having “no wars with Pakistan”. The US president has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. India has denied the claim that the US president was responsible for brokering the ceasefire via trade threats. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has praised Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping the two neighbours achieve peace in the region. Participating in a Diwali celebration at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he had a “great conversation” with Indian PM Modi over the phone. “We talked about trade — we talked about a lot of things, but mostly the world of trade, he’s very interested in that. Although we did talk a little while ago about let’s have no wars with Pakistan,” he said. “I think the fact that trade was involved, I was able to talk about that — and we have no war with Pakistan and India and that was a very, very good thing,” he said. Trump also called Modi a “great person”, saying that he had become a great friend of his over the years. The US president also stated that Modi was keen to see the end of the Russia-Ukraine war. “We just have a very good relationship,” he said while talking about Modi. “And he’s not gonna buy much oil from Russia; he wants to see that war end as much as I do — he wants to see the war end between Russia and Ukraine … so they’ve cut it way back and they’re continuing to cut it way back.” Trump also lauded the US’ success in “forging peace all over the world”. “We’re putting America first; we’re getting everybody to sort of get along,” he said, highlighting the US role in securing “total peace ” in the Middle East. “Nobody thought we’d ever see that happening,” he said. “We have levels of friendship with everybody … countries that hated each other now love each other,” he said. Meanwhile, Modi thanked the US president for his phone call and Diwali greetings. “On this festival of lights, may our two great democracies continue to illuminate the world with hope and stand united against terrorism in all its forms,” he said on social media platform X. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” which targeted sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory operation called “Bunyanum Marsoos” , leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Month later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.",

      "summary_orig": "North Korea fired what appeared to be multiple short-range ballistic missiles on Wednesday, South Korea’s military said, a week before a key Asia-Pacific leaders’ meeting in South Korea. It was the first launch of ballistic missiles since May by Pyongyang, which has defied a United Nations Security Council ban on the weapons. It was also the first such launch since Lee Jae Myung was elected president in South Korea, with a platform of engagement with North Korea. Lee and United States President Donald Trump are expected to meet in South Korea next week at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Trump is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. South Korea detected several projectiles believed to be short-range ballistic missiles fired from an area near North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, in a northeasterly direction early on Wednesday, its Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. Trump to visit South Korea Lee and Trump have discussed the idea of trying to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when the American president visits the South, but Pyongyang has not publicly responded to the idea. US officials considered, but never confirmed, a trip to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, according to a person familiar with the discussions. South Korea has suspended tours of the Joint Security Area (JSA) at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom until early November, but has not confirmed any plans for a meeting with Kim. Trump and Kim held three summits during Trump’s 2017 to 2021 first term and exchanged a number of letters that Trump called “beautiful“, before the unprecedented diplomatic effort broke down over US demands that Kim give up his nuclear weapons. In September, Kim expressed “fond memories” of Trump saying there was no reason to avoid talks with the US if Washington stopped insisting his country give up nuclear weapons, but he would never abandon the nuclear arsenal to end sanctions. “It is not at all inconceivable that Donald Trump could here in Washington, DC, say ‘Denuclearisation, that’s our goal, that’s our policy’ and then go up to Panmunjom and say, ‘Oh, you know, Kim Jong Un is a nuclear power’,” said Victor Cha, with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “Even if it’s a short meeting, in the broader scheme of things, with all that the United States has to deal with these days, it wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing.” Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said while a Trump-Kim meeting was not impossible, the US president’s known schedule and timing might make it unlikely. “Trump’s only there for one night, two days, and because of the Xi-Trump meeting, that’s probably taking up all the bandwidth or resources of the US government,” he said. Multiple missiles launched Nuclear-armed North Korea has steadily upgraded its missile capabilities over the past decade, defying multiple United Nations sanctions , having test-launched long-range ballistic missiles with potential ranges to strike the US mainland if fired at a trajectory calibrated for that purpose. South Korea’s military said it had detected movements ahead of the launch, then tracked the projectiles after they were fired and flew about 350 km (217 miles), the military said. The missiles appeared to have fallen inland, a military official separately said. Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said there was no impact on Japan’s security from the North Korean missile launch and Tokyo was sharing real-time information with the US. North Korea last launched ballistic missiles on May 8 when it fired multiple short-range missiles from its east coast. North Korea showcased its latest intercontinental ballistic missile this month at a parade attended by the Chinese premier.",
