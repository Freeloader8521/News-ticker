Follow today’s news live Anthony Albanese says former opposition leader, Sussan Ley was “undermined” by conservative colleagues, Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie , during her 276-day tenure in the seat. Speaking to Hit 104.9, which covers Ley’s southern NSW electorate of Farrer, the prime minister criticised the Coalition’s recent internal turmoil while praising his own side of politics. Albanese said: From day one, she was undermined by Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie and a range of them who weren’t really working to try to get her success in the party. … It’s, I think, unfortunate that politics can be a pretty rough game, and that [Ley] was elected by the Liberal party caucus, fair and square, she was the leader, but never even got to give a budget reply. I don’t know if that’s happened before. I’m not sure, but certainly she didn’t even get one year in the office, which is pretty rough. We want to ensure that people who leave our country and go to terrorist hotspots, people who go there to support terrorist organisations or to support Islamic State or organisations or other terror listed organisations, and then who actually commit crimes over there … they can’t come back to Australia. I’ve got a newsflash for the government. They are the government. They can change the law. If the law is not strong enough to keep Australians safe and to keep people out who actually hate Australian values and hate the Australian way of life, and who have left our country to fight for an alternate way of life, then we should change those laws.

      "summary_orig": "South Africa ended India’s 12-match winning streak at the T20 World Cup with a crushing 76-run win in Ahmedabad on Sunday in the opening Group 1 Super Eights match. After a counter-attacking 63 by David Miller and some late hitting from Tristan Stubbs took South Africa to 187-7, the defending champions were all out for 111 in 18.5 overs, failing badly in their first chase of the tournament. Left-arm quick Marco Jansen finished with 4-22, while left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 as the South African bowlers exposed India’s fragile batting line-up. “Great performance. Very different type of wicket to what we’ve had here, so great to see the boys assess that pretty early and adapt their skills to execute their plans,” said South Africa captain Aiden Markram. “We’re really pumped for the bowling group. They’ve been working hard, started the comp a bit tough, but the way they rocked up tonight was a great effort.” Hot favourites to defend their crown on home soil, India will need to win their two remaining Super Eight games against Zimbabwe and the West Indies to have a chance of qualifying. But the magnitude of the defeat means they will take a poor net run rate forward and that could prove pivotal if their Super Eights group is tight. “We bowled really well, but we could have batted a little better,” said India captain Suryakumar Yadav. Fans silenced “Sometimes you’ve got to think, if you’re chasing 180-185, you can’t win the game in the power play, but you might lose it. “We lost too many wickets in the power play.” Both teams were unbeaten in group phase and the game was a rematch of the 2024 T20 World Cup final in Barbados, which India won. India’s unbeaten run in the tournament had stretched back to their defeat in the semi-final against eventual winners England in 2022. South Africa struck immediately in India’s chase when Markram opened the bowling and dismissed Ishan Kishan with his off-spin. Abhishek Sharma got his first runs of the tournament, after three ducks, with a four off Markram to get the 82,000 crowd on their feet in the cavernous stadium, which has a reported capacity of 130,000. The joy of Indian fans was short-lived, and they were silenced as left-arm quick Marco Jansen had Tilak Varma caught behind for one in the next over and removed the left-handed Abhishek for 15. India needed a partnership, but Corbin Bosch dismissed Washington Sundar and Suryakumar, who toe-ended to midwicket, as the hosts slumped to 51-5. Left-arm spinner Maharaj took three wickets in one over to dismiss Hardik Pandya (18), Rinku Singh (0) and Arshdeep Singh (one) to shut the door on India. Shivam Dube made 42 at the end, but it was too little too late, and when he fell off Jansen, last man Jasprit Bumrah followed the next ball. Batting first after winning the toss, South Africa slipped to 20-3 before Miller and Dewald Brevis, who hit 45, put on 97, to guide South Africa to 187-7. Tristan Stubbs had a late cameo that saw him crash an unbeaten 44 off 24 balls and launch the final two balls of the innings both for six off Pandya. India’s Jasprit Bumrah took 3-15.",

      "summary_orig": "A senior Hamas official told AFP on Sunday that the group was in the final phase of selecting a new leader, with two prominent figures competing for the position. Hamas recently completed the formation of a new Shura Council of more than 80 members, a consultative body largely composed of religious scholars, as well as a new 18-member political bureau, the official said. Since Tel Aviv’s war on Gaza began on October 7, 2023, in response to Hamas’ attack on Israel, Israeli forces have killed several Hamas leaders, including two former chiefs. The country has also killed more than 70,000 Palestinians. “The movement has completed its internal elections in the three regions and has reached the final stage of selecting the head of the political bureau,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly. He said the race for the group’s leadership was now between Khaled Meshaal and Khalil al-Hayya. A second Hamas source confirmed the development, while a third source said the new leader would lead the movement only “for one year”. Despite a US-brokered ceasefire that entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in Gaza, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement. Members of the council are elected every four years by representatives from Hamas’s three branches: the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and the movement’s external leadership. Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails are also eligible to vote. The council subsequently elects the political bureau, which in turn selects the head of the movement. Experienced leaders Both Meshaal and Hayya have years of experience within the movement. Hayya, 65, a Gaza native and Hamas’s chief negotiator in ceasefire talks, has held senior roles since at least 2006, according to the US-based NGO the Counter Extremism Project (CEP). Meshaal, who led the political bureau from 2004 to 2017, has never lived in Gaza. He was born in the West Bank in 1956. He joined Hamas in Kuwait and later lived in Jordan, Syria and Qatar. The CEP says he oversaw Hamas’s evolution into a political-military hybrid. He currently heads the movement’s diaspora office. Last month, a Hamas source told AFP that Hayya enjoyed backing from the group’s armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades. After Israel killed former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July 2024, the group chose its then-Gaza chief, Yahya Sinwar, as his successor. Israel accused Sinwar of masterminding the October 7 attack. He, too, was killed by Israeli forces in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Hamas then opted for a five-member leadership committee based in Qatar, postponing the appointment of a single leader until elections, given the risk of the new chief being targeted by Israel.",

      "title_orig": "Over 80 terrorists killed as armed forces strike 7 camps along Pakistan-Afghanistan border",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistani airstrikes on Afghanistan killed “more than 80 terrorists,” security sources said on Sunday, in a retaliatory operation against groups responsible for recent suicide bombings in Pakistan. Pakistan struck seven “terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban of [ Fitna al Khwarij ] and its affiliates and [the Islamic State-Khorasan Province] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting announced in a post early Sunday on the social media platform X. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Security sources said late Sunday evening that, “Last night, Pakistan’s intelligence-based airstrikes destroyed seven centres of Fitna al-Khawarij TTP in three provinces of Nangarhar, Paktika and Khost, in which more than eighty Khawarij have been confirmed killed, while more are expected.” They added that the centres targeted included “New Centre No. 1 and New Centre No. 2 in Nangarhar, Khwariji Maulvi Abbas Centre in Khost, Khwariji Islam Centre, Khwariji Ibrahim Centre in Nangarhar, and Khwariji Mullah Rahbar and Khwariji Mukhlis Yar in Paktika.” Per the information ministry, the action was taken, “in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, including Imam Bargah at Islamabad , one each in Bajaur and Bannu, followed by another incident today in Bannu during the holy month of Ramazan.” “Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij on the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers. Responsibilities for these attacks were also claimed by Afghanistan-based Pakistani Taliban belonging to Fitna al Khwarij (FAK) and their affiliates, and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP),” the ministry said. It asserted that “Pakistan has always strived for maintaining peace and stability in the region, but at the same time, the safety and security of our citizens remains our top priority”, adding that the action against the seven camps and hideouts was “a retributive response”, carried out based on “intelligence-based selective targeting”. “Despite repeated efforts by Pakistan to urge the Afghan Taliban Regime to take verifiable measures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the ministry noted. “Pakistan expects and reiterates [that the] Interim Afghan Government […] fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan, as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost. Pakistan also expects the international community to play a positive and constructive role by urging the Taliban regime to stand by its commitments as part of [the] Doha Agreement to deny use of its soil against other countries; an act vital for regional and global peace and security.” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, in a post on X, stated that the strikes by the “Pakistan Air Force were retribution for the innocent lives lost to terrorism”. He maintained that the strikes were an “answer to the tears of every mother who has sacrificed her son for the homeland”. Chaudhry issued a stern warning, stating that while “Pakistan desired peace, it would not make compromises on its safety, land, and people”. “Whoever looks at us with evil intent, we will destroy them, and no one will be spared,” the minister said. Kabul protests Meanwhile, the Taliban regime in Kabul called the strikes a violation of its sovereignty, saying “an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time”, Reuters reported. The news agency quoted the Afghan foreign ministry as saying that it had summoned Pakistan’s ambassador over what it described as violations of Afghan airspace and the bombing of civilians, calling the strikes “a provocative act”. A Taliban spokesperson also claimed the attacks had killed and injured dozens of people, but Pakistani authorities termed such claims a “false and malicious narrative designed to create cover for terrorist sanctuaries”. They maintained that TTP terrorists routinely blended into civilian areas and used non-combatants as human shields, adding that Pakistan’s operational planning accounted for this, and forces took measures to reduce or eliminate any collateral damage. They described the actions as a “limited, proportionate response to an ongoing terror wave”, which saw mass casualty attacks inflicted on Pakistani civilians and security forces. Photos from Nangarhar’s Bihsud district – one of the locations Afghan authorities claim were targeted by Pakistan – showed people using a bulldozer to search to clear the rubble of a destroyed building, which was being guarded by Taliban fighters. Souring relations There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire. Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast. Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault. Then, on Saturday, Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district. In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”. “Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij , irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted. On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable. Not the first time In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR. The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.",

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Under the deal, the deliveries are scheduled in three tranches, running from 2027 through 2029, the FT said.

In June last year, US forces struck Iran’s three main nuclear sites as the country joined Israel’s military campaign against Iran. President Donald Trump said Iran’s key nuclear facilities were destroyed in the attack. However, according to a preliminary US intelligence assessment at the time, the US airstrikes did not destroy Iran’s nuclear capability and only set it back by a few months.

      "title_orig": "Israel disqualifies its own bobsleigh team over false statements to officials: report",
      "summary_orig": "Israeli Olympic officials have disqualified Israel’s four-man bobsleigh team from finishing their event today, Times of Israel reported on Sunday. The Olympic Committee of Israel told the publication that it has prevented the country’s four-man bobsleigh team from taking part in today’s competition after one athlete provided false information to officials to let teammate Ward Fawarseh compete in his place. Per the report, Israel had raced on Saturday with Adam Edelman, Menachem Chen, Uri Zisman, and Omer Katz. Although the team was originally scheduled to compete this morning with Edelman, Chen, Fawarseh, and Katz, the disqualification has halted their participation. Fawarseh would have become Israel’s first Druze Olympian had he competed, but he arrived at the Games as an alternate and was only permitted to race if another team member was unwell. “The bobsleigh team asked to include Ward, the substitute, in the competition. According to the rules, this is only permitted if one of the athletes is injured or ill,” the Olympic Committee of Israel said, according to Times of Israel. “In order to make this possible, one of the team members — encouraged by his teammates — declared that he was unwell. He even went for a medical examination and signed an affidavit so that the Olympic Committee could request approval for a substitution.” After admitting that he had lied, the athlete told the head of the delegation that he “had acted improperly,” forcing the Olympic Committee to withdraw the request and disqualify the move, the OCI said. The committee called the team’s actions “improper” and said they “go against fair and sportsmanlike conduct.” After the first two runs on Saturday, Israel’s team was in 24th place out of 27, following crashes by three sleds during the second run. Previous controversy The team had made headlines earlier this week as well when a commentator on Swiss channel RTS said Adam Edelman’s supportive comments of Israel’s more-than-two-year bombardment of Gaza, which has resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 people and the destruction of most of the territory’s infrastructure, should have resulted in him being barred from the Olympics. “Edelman, first appearance at an Olympic Games, who defines himself and I quote ‘as a Zionist to the core’,” remarked the commentator, Stefan Renna, as Edelman and teammate Chen began their two-man bobsleigh run on Monday. The commentator went on to tell viewers that Edelman had posted on social media “in favour of the genocide in Gaza.

Renna also commented that Edelman had “said the Israeli military intervention was, I quote, the most morally justified war in history”. He suggested Edelman should have been barred from the Milan-Cortina Games on the same basis that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to allow Russian athletes to appear if they had made pro-war remarks regarding their country’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Edelman was furious and hit back on his Instagram account. “I am aware of the diatribe the commentator directed towards the Israeli bobsled team on the Swiss Olympic broadcast today,” he wrote. “I can’t help but notice the contrast: Shul Runnings is a team of 6 proud Israelis who’ve made it to the Olympic stage,” he said in a reference to the Israeli team’s nickname, a play on the film “Cool Runnings” about the debut of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics. “No coach with us. No big program. Just a dream, grit and unyielding pride in who we represent. Working together towards such an incredible goal and crushing it. Because that’s what Israelis do. I don’t think it’s possible to witness that and give credence to this commentary.” The Israeli embassy in Switzerland reacted robustly to the commentary. “We are deeply appalled by the blatant abuse of a live Olympic broadcast by a Swiss RTS journalist,” the embassy posted on their X. They demanded that action be taken against the journalist. “ @RadioTeleSuisse must publicly address this misconduct, issue a clear apology, and take decisive action against the journalist responsible.” IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said it was not for them to comment. “In terms of specific comments by a commentator, that is a matter you have to refer to the broadcaster,” he said at the IOC daily briefing at the Winter Olympics.",

      "summary_en": "Israeli Olympic officials have disqualified Israel’s four-man bobsleigh team from finishing their event today, Times of Israel reported on Sunday. The Olympic Committee of Israel told the publication that it has prevented the country’s four-man bobsleigh team from taking part in today’s competition after one athlete provided false information to officials to let teammate Ward Fawarseh compete in his place. Per the report, Israel had raced on Saturday with Adam Edelman, Menachem Chen, Uri Zisman, and Omer Katz. Although the team was originally scheduled to compete this morning with Edelman, Chen, Fawarseh, and Katz, the disqualification has halted their participation. Fawarseh would have become Israel’s first Druze Olympian had he competed, but he arrived at the Games as an alternate and was only permitted to race if another team member was unwell. “The bobsleigh team asked to include Ward, the substitute, in the competition. According to the rules, this is only permitted if one of the athletes is injured or ill,” the Olympic Committee of Israel said, according to Times of Israel. “In order to make this possible, one of the team members — encouraged by his teammates — declared that he was unwell. He even went for a medical examination and signed an affidavit so that the Olympic Committee could request approval for a substitution.” After admitting that he had lied, the athlete told the head of the delegation that he “had acted improperly,” forcing the Olympic Committee to withdraw the request and disqualify the move, the OCI said. The committee called the team’s actions “improper” and said they “go against fair and sportsmanlike conduct.” After the first two runs on Saturday, Israel’s team was in 24th place out of 27, following crashes by three sleds during the second run. Previous controversy The team had made headlines earlier this week as well when a commentator on Swiss channel RTS said Adam Edelman’s supportive comments of Israel’s more-than-two-year bombardment of Gaza, which has resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 people and the destruction of most of the territory’s infrastructure, should have resulted in him being barred from the Olympics. “Edelman, first appearance at an Olympic Games, who defines himself and I quote ‘as a Zionist to the core’,” remarked the commentator, Stefan Renna, as Edelman and teammate Chen began their two-man bobsleigh run on Monday. The commentator went on to tell viewers that Edelman had posted on social media “in favour of the genocide in Gaza. I remind you that genocide is the term used by the United Nations commission of inquiry”. Renna also commented that Edelman had “said the Israeli military intervention was, I quote, the most morally justified war in history”. He suggested Edelman should have been barred from the Milan-Cortina Games on the same basis that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to allow Russian athletes to appear if they had made pro-war remarks regarding their country’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

      "summary_orig": "The US Secret Service said on Sunday that its agents had shot and killed an armed man who breached the security perimeter of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump was in Washington at the time of the incident, which officials said happened around 1:30 am (11:30am PKT). Secret Service agents fired at a man after they saw him “unlawfully entering the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago early this morning,” agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a post on X. The suspect, a man in his early 20s, “was observed by the north gate of the Mar-a-Lago property carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can,” the agency said in a statement. Agents confronted the man and fired shots. No US officers were injured, the agency said that no “Secret Service protectees” were present in Mar-a-Lago at the time. The individual was pronounced deceased. “The only words that we said to him were drop the items, which means the gas can and the shotgun,” Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters. “At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” Bradshaw said. A deputy and two Secret Service agents then shot him. Trump, who often spends his weekends in Mar-a-Lago, has been the target of several assassination plots or attempts. Earlier this month, Ryan Routh, 59, who plotted to assassinate the president at a Florida golf course in September 2024, two months before the US election, was sentenced to life in prison. Routh’s planned attack on Trump came two months after an assassination attempt on the Republican leader in Pennsylvania, where 20-year-old Matthew Crooks fired several shots during a rally , one of them grazing Trump’s right ear. That attack, in which a rallygoer was killed, proved to be a turning point in Trump’s return to power. Crooks was immediately shot and killed by security forces, and his motive remains unknown. The incident was the latest in a series of episodes of political violence in a highly polarised country. The name of the suspect in the Sunday incident has not been released while officials attempt to contact his relatives.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Leaders of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Sunday launched a broadside against the government, terming its national and foreign policies “flawed”, criticising its economic performance and governance decisions, and warning that the country was facing irreversible damage. The leaders, including Taimur Khan Jhagra, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai and others, were speaking at a press conference in Islamabad. Jhagra alleged that the government’s claims of economic recovery were incorrect and claimed that the government “lacked a plan to improve the country’s economic situation.” Referring to recently released national poverty statistics, he said that in 2018, as much as 22 per cent of the population was living below the poverty line, but that figure had now risen to 29pc. “Over the past 11 years, not only has poverty increased, but the gap between the rich and the poor has further widened, reaching a poverty level of 32.7pc,” he said. Jhagra alleged that Punjab and Sindh were having the highest increases in poverty, with poverty rising by 41pc in Punjab and 33pc in Sindh. He also claimed that the government’s latest unemployment report reflected the highest jobless rate in 21 years. He also alleged that special privileges were granted to Punjab’s inspector general and chief secretary, including the provision of 4500cc vehicles, and claimed that government officials in Punjab were provided with vehicles worth Rs 110 million. Speaking at the presser, Khokhar expressed concern over rising regional tensions, stating that “clouds of war were looming over a neighbouring country.” He claimed that the United States had deployed naval fleets against Iran. “The heavy deployment is equal to the one deployed in 2003 before the attack on Iraq”, he added. He also criticised Pakistan’s participation in US President Donald Trump’s “ Board of Peace ,” referring to a report by The Guardian , which claimed the event was attended by representatives of dictators and monarchies. He questioned Pakistan’s participation, stating that China stayed away. He further alleged that just after participation in the meeting, news emerged that a deal regarding the Roosevelt Hotel had been done. He demanded that the government share the terms and conditions of the agreement. Regarding the rise in terrorist incidents in the country, Khokhar stated that the government should strictly deal with the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other terrorist organisations. TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Yousafzai showed concerns about the health of PTI founder Imran Khan, saying that the second injection will be administered to the incarcerated leader on Feb 24 or 25. “The PTI founder must be taken to the Shifa International Hospital for medical treatment in the presence of his family and Dr Asim,” Yousafzai  demanded. He also condemned recent tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan and suggested that the disputes with neighbouring countries should be resolved through dialogue.",

      "summary_orig": "The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu said on Sunday it had thwarted a militant attack, adding that a detained commander of a banned outfit was killed in an exchange of fire, according to a press release. The investigation team was transporting a “recently arrested, highly wanted terrorist commander, Osama alias Baghi”, to identify the site of the attack on Assistant Commissioner Miranshah Shah Wali Khan , when his accomplices opened indiscriminate fire on the convoy, attempting to release him, the release said. “A fierce exchange of fire followed, during which Osama was killed by gunfire from his own associates,” it added. The CTD team’s armoured personnel carrier (APC) was also hit, but no personnel were injured. The gun battle reportedly lasted around 40 minutes, it added. It stated that the assault was aimed at freeing the detained commander during a crime-scene visit. “In the retaliatory action by CTD’s Special Weapons and Tactical (SWAT) team, another terrorist was also killed. He was identified as Kamyab Khan alias Ikhlas Yar, a resident of North Waziristan.” It added that the killed terrorist was wanted in multiple cases involving attacks on police and security forces. “Weapons and explosives, including a Kalashnikov rifle with two magazines, two hand grenades, a card of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a CNIC and a mobile phone, were recovered from the slain militant.” The release continued: “Bloodstains were found at several locations, indicating that the fleeing terrorists took their injured accomplices with them. Search and strike operations are underway to arrest the remaining suspects.” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Zulfiqar Hamid and the additional IGP CTD praised the professionalism of the officers involved and reiterated that indiscriminate action against terrorist elements would continue, particularly in the southern districts, to ensure lasting peace and order in the province, the release said. On February 12, CTD announced the arrest of Osama alias Baghi from Bannu’s Pipal Bazaar area. It said that he was an active commander of the newly formed organisation Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), established through a collaboration between the banned TTP and Gul Bahadur group. During the interrogation, he confessed to his involvement in nine major terrorist activities, including the killing of AC Miranshah Shah Wali Khan and three others.",

      "summary_orig": "King Charles III has been left wrestling with a new test after the arrest of his brother Andrew, the latest in a series of painful personal shocks to mar his reign. “Charles has, since coming to the throne in September 2022, been battered by a succession of difficulties and crises, whether it’s in relation to his second son, Harry … his health, the health of Catherine, or the very disruptive figure of Andrew,” royal commentator Ed Owens told AFP . After decades waiting in the wings, Charles became king in September 2022 on the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who had reigned for 70 years and commanded deep public affection and respect. His coronation on May 6, 2023 was rich in pageantry, projecting continuity and tradition. Yet trouble stirred even before the crown was placed on his head. In January 2023, his youngest son Harry released his explosive memoir Spare , launching repeated attacks on the royal family and airing private disputes lapped up by a global audience. Living in California with his wife Meghan since 2020 and estranged from his family, Harry has been accused by critics of damaging, for personal and commercial gain, an institution long seen as unshakeable. Though Harry has since sought reconciliation, the rift remains. Then, in February 2024, Charles, now 77, revealed he was undergoing treatment for cancer, without disclosing the type, forcing him to scale back public duties . Weeks later came another blow: Catherine, Princess of Wales and wife of heir apparent William, announced she too was being treated for cancer. While Catherine has since said she is in remission and Charles indicated in December that his treatment was being eased, illness has cast a long shadow over the royal household. The king has won admiration for his dignified, touching fight against cancer, talking about his shock at learning his diagnosis, and making a point of publicly visiting patients, urging prevention and early detection. But arguably the gravest threat to his reign has come from his younger brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, who remains eighth in line to the throne. Royal historian Andrew Lownie told AFP that it was “a crunch point” for the monarchy. If it is found that “they have been abetting him, enabling him, protecting him, then I think Charles will have to stand aside”, he said. The long-standing ties between the deeply unpopular Mountbatten-Windor to late convicted American sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have caused years of embarrassment. A photograph published in 2011 showing the former prince with his arm around the waist of Virginia Giuffre, Epstein’s main accuser, proved especially damaging. ‘Monarchy unstable’ Scrutiny has intensified in recent months. In October, Charles sought to draw a line under the affair by stripping his brother of all his titles. But new documents released by the US Department of Justice last month reignited public outrage. On Thursday, Andrew was arrested and held for hours in police custody, suspected of having passed confidential information to Epstein during his 2001-2011 role as a UK trade envoy. It was the first time a senior British royal has been arrested in modern history. In a rare personally signed statement, Charles vowed on Thursday the “law must take its course” and expressed his “deepest concern”. Some commentators have likened the moment to other crises that have shaken the monarchy, such as the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII and the 1997 death of Princess Diana, Charles’s ex-wife. In both cases, it took more than a decade to restore stability and public confidence, Owens said. For Pauline Maclaran, an academic and royal family expert, Charles is in part a victim of timing. “The monarchy seems quite unstable now and that was always going to happen after the queen passed away because she had been there for so long and had given this great sense of continuity,” she said. The late queen “certainly protected Andrew”, Maclaran added. Owens was more direct. “Andrew was an unexploded bomb that the queen passed on to Charles,” he said. “This episode, I think, could potentially be hugely damaging to the institution,” he added. “Already, I think its moral authority has suffered. That includes the moral authority of the king.” Restoring that authority will require visible change, Maclaran argued. “William has indicated that he will change things, but they’ve got to really emphasise that more now,” she said.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Central Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dr Imran Khan on Sunday ordered the suspension of five cops for their alleged involvement in the custodial torture of a man at the city’s Sharifabad police station. According to a statement issued by the Sindh Police’s Central District branch, SSP Imran took serious notice of the alleged incident and issued directives for the five cops to be suspended. The statement noted that an initial inquiry was conducted by the Liaquatabad sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) on the orders of the Central SSP. According to the probe, four personnel of Sindh Police’s Shaheen Force and a sentry of the Sharifabad police station were found to be involved in the torture. “All five personnel were immediately suspended and the [case] was closed, while further departmental inquiry is under way,” the Central District police statement read. “Further departmental action will be taken after the inquiry has been completed,” it added. SSP Imran warned, “Unlawful and unethical behaviour towards citizens would not be tolerated, and indiscriminate action will be taken against police officers and personnel violating the law.” On Wednesday, a large number of people gathered outside the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday to protest the killing of a man during an alleged encounter by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD). The protest and a petition before the Sindh High Court (SHC) came after the CTD said its officials had conducted a raid on a house in Shah Latif Town on a terrorist hideout. However, the man’s family said the deceased was a student who was earlier arrested by law enforcers and termed it a “fake encounter”. Earlier this month, PTI leaders presented journalists with what they described as “evidence” of torture allegedly inflicted on them during their detention under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance. In October 2025, seven policemen were suspended after a “teenage boy” died under controversial circumstances in the custody of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of Sindh Police.",

      "summary_orig": "US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal. The United States and Iran this week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at averting the possibility of military action, after Washington dispatched two aircraft carriers, jets and weaponry to the region to back its warnings. In a Fox News interview with Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Iran’s position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal. “I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated’, because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t… I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated’, but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said. “Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.” The US envoy also confirmed in the interview that he had met with Reza Pahlavi , the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a critic of the current authorities, who has not returned to the country since before the 1979 Revolution that ousted the monarchy. “I met him at the direction of the president,” Witkoff said, without providing further details. “I think he’s strong for his country, cares about his country. But this is going to be about President Trump’s policies.” US-based Pahlavi last week told a crowd in Munich that he was ready to lead the country to a “secular democratic future” after Trump said regime change would be best for the country. Witkoff’s comments come after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days. Trump said on Thursday that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme. As talks between the two nations continued in Geneva, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday said that Trump would not succeed in destroying the Islamic republic. Western countries accuse Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes. Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy, which played a role in sparking anti-government protests in December.",

      "summary_orig": "PPP leader Sharjeel Inam Memon on Sunday said that PTI founder Imran Khan’s release was “in his own hands” as it depended on his party’s “attitude”. The Sindh senior minister made the remarks while speaking to reporters during a visit to a site of ongoing development work in Karachi. In response to a question regarding Imran’s release, the minister maintained that the incarcerated former premier’s release “was in his own hands and the attitude” of PTI. “I do not have any knowledge of his release; however, it is the blessed month of Ramazan, and I pray for his health, particularly his eye issue”, Memon said. Imran’s health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January. Memon assailed the party for “not focusing on the release of their leadership” and instead “creating fuss and staging protests outside of Adiala”. “It is better if they focus on seeking Imran’s release,” he added. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was convicted months ago in another case regarding state gifts. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023 . Speaking to the media, Memon further said the PTI’s social media teams “target leaders and national institutions on social media and through their teams abroad”. The PPP leader advised the party to “improve their language and choice of words”, stressing that while one can hold disagreements, it was not appropriate to “verbally abuse people’s families and use below the belt language”. “Improve your mindset. It will help you a lot,” he added. Earlier this week, PPP Central Punjab General Secretary Syed Hassan Murtaza warned the PTI that any character assassination would be met with a forceful response, as he accused the PTI of unleashing a wave of online abuse against his party’s leadership. Last week, in a series of public addresses during his visit to South Punjab, President Asif Ali Zardari also criticised Imran amid concerns about his health, saying the jailed PTI leader should face imprisonment “like a man” and should not order his party leaders and workers to block roads. “He has served less than two years of imprisonment and is exhausted. In fact, [one realises what jail] actually is after two years of imprisonment,” he said.",

Speaking to the media, Memon further said the PTI’s social media teams “target leaders and national institutions on social media and through their teams abroad”. The PPP leader advised the party to “improve their language and choice of words”, stressing that while one can hold disagreements, it was not appropriate to “verbally abuse people’s families and use below the belt language”. “Improve your mindset. It will help you a lot,” he added. Earlier this week, PPP Central Punjab General Secretary Syed Hassan Murtaza warned the PTI that any character assassination would be met with a forceful response, as he accused the PTI of unleashing a wave of online abuse against his party’s leadership. Last week, in a series of public addresses during his visit to South Punjab, President Asif Ali Zardari also criticised Imran amid concerns about his health, saying the jailed PTI leader should face imprisonment “like a man” and should not order his party leaders and workers to block roads. “He has served less than two years of imprisonment and is exhausted. In fact, [one realises what jail] actually is after two years of imprisonment,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "RAWALPINDI: As many as 469 trees and 715 shrubs have been relocated from Peshawar Road to other areas as work on three underpasses worth Rs8 billion commenced on the main artery of the cantonment area. The federal and Punjab governments had earlier issued directives not to cut any trees at the development sites following criticism over tree felling in Islamabad’s Shakarparian . After initial work began on Race Course Park, Army Graveyard and the Chairing Cross underpasses, the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) was tasked with relocating trees in the middle of the road and along Peshawar Road from Qasim Market to Chairing Cross. Cantonment Executive Officer Amir Rasheed told Dawn that the RCB decided to relocate the trees to protect them in nearby areas. 715 shrubs and 74 dead trees also removed; RCB pledges to plant 10 trees for each dead one He stated that 469 trees had been moved from Qasim Market to Chairing Cross and planted elsewhere around the area. “A total of 469 trees and 715 shrubs were affected in the development work and we have planted them in and around Peshawar Road,” he said. He added that as part of the replacement plan, RCB intends to plant more than 400 full-grown, healthy local tree and shrub varieties on the site after underpass construction, for a safer and healthier environment. There were 22 large trees, including 11 pilkan, two sheesham, six alstonia and one each of peepal, dhariak, and shireen. There were also 90 terminalia trees, one conocorpus, three eucalyptus, one more sheesham, 21 pine trees, and 33 ashoke. Additionally, 74 dead trees were removed from the site, and on the recommendation of the Environment Protection Agency Punjab, the RCB will plant ten new trees for each dead one. He mentioned that clear instructions had been given to the RCB Garden Branch to cultivate more plants in the nursery to be used for replanting once the underpass construction concludes in late May. Existing trees have been replanted in green belts from Lane 5 to Motorway Chowk, where space is available. The green belts are also being extended from Motorway Chowk to Chur Chowk, giving the area a greener appearance. Meanwhile, Iesco has completed its work on relocating electricity pylons from Chairing Cross to Radio Pakistan. The work, which started from Qasim Market to Radio Pakistan, is expected to be finished by the end of February. The Punjab Department of Communication and Works has already announced plans to commence work on the underpasses following Eidul Fitr. Punjab Highway Department Executive Engineer Qamar Ali Saqib told Dawn that initial work on the underpasses had already begun. After utility services, trees and electricity pylons are shifted, formal construction will commence. He explained that the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) has started constructing a dedicated utility service corridor in front of Race Course Park. Utility providers such as Iesco, SNGPL, RCB, and PTCL will lay their lines before work begins. He added that once the underpass work begins, it is expected to be completed within 70 days.

He mentioned that clear instructions had been given to the RCB Garden Branch to cultivate more plants in the nursery to be used for replanting once the underpass construction concludes in late May. Existing trees have been replanted in green belts from Lane 5 to Motorway Chowk, where space is available. The green belts are also being extended from Motorway Chowk to Chur Chowk, giving the area a greener appearance. Meanwhile, Iesco has completed its work on relocating electricity pylons from Chairing Cross to Radio Pakistan. The work, which started from Qasim Market to Radio Pakistan, is expected to be finished by the end of February. The Punjab Department of Communication and Works has already announced plans to commence work on the underpasses following Eidul Fitr. Punjab Highway Department Executive Engineer Qamar Ali Saqib told Dawn that initial work on the underpasses had already begun. After utility services, trees and electricity pylons are shifted, formal construction will commence. He explained that the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) has started constructing a dedicated utility service corridor in front of Race Course Park. Utility providers such as Iesco, SNGPL, RCB, and PTCL will lay their lines before work begins. He added that once the underpass work begins, it is expected to be completed within 70 days.

      "summary": "RAWALPINDI: As many as 469 trees and 715 shrubs have been relocated from Peshawar Road to other areas as work on three underpasses worth Rs8 billion commenced on the main artery of the cantonment area. The federal and Punjab governments had earlier issued directives not to cut any trees at the development sites following criticism over tree felling in Islamabad’s Shakarparian . After initial work began on Race Course Park, Army Graveyard and the Chairing Cross underpasses, the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) was tasked with relocating trees in the middle of the road and along Peshawar Road from Qasim Market to Chairing Cross. Cantonment Executive Officer Amir Rasheed told Dawn that the RCB decided to relocate the trees to protect them in nearby areas. 715 shrubs and 74 dead trees also removed; RCB pledges to plant 10 trees for each dead one He stated that 469 trees had been moved from Qasim Market to Chairing Cross and planted elsewhere around the area. “A total of 469 trees and 715 shrubs were affected in the development work and we have planted them in and around Peshawar Road,” he said. He added that as part of the replacement plan, RCB intends to plant more than 400 full-grown, healthy local tree and shrub varieties on the site after underpass construction, for a safer and healthier environment. There were 22 large trees, including 11 pilkan, two sheesham, six alstonia and one each of peepal, dhariak, and shireen. There were also 90 terminalia trees, one conocorpus, three eucalyptus, one more sheesham, 21 pine trees, and 33 ashoke.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The government borrowed almost five times more from banks in the first seven months of FY26 than in the same period last year, reflecting growing spending despite higher revenue collections. The government’s appetite for more bank money has shot up, leaving little room for the private sector to borrow. The private sector is not performing well enough to spur economic growth, given persistent tight monetary policy despite low inflation. The data issued by the State Bank showed that the government borrowed Rs1,912 billion in 7MFY26 from the commercial banks compared to Rs408bn a year ago. However, the government ended FY25 with total borrowing of Rs5.4 trillion, indicating most of the borrowing was carried out in the second half of that fiscal year. Raises Rs1.9tr from banks in 7MFY26, leaves little room for private sector The situation is even worse this year, as the government has already borrowed about Rs2tr, and if the pace continues, the total would surely exceed the Rs5.4tr borrowed in FY25. It must be alarming, since the government had borrowed Rs8.5tr in FY24 to meet rising current expenditure. Interest payments accounted for the largest share of spending, at around Rs8tr in FY25. Financial sectors have been warning that increased borrowing will lead to higher debt servicing costs. The government has no option but to borrow and cut development spending, as noted over the last three years. Last month, the State Bank reduced the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) for banks to 5pc from 6pc enabling banks to have higher liquidity. This additional liquidity has been created to feed the private sector. However, financial sector experts believe the additional liquidity could boost investment in government papers, as the private sector is least interested in launching new projects or expanding production. Businessmen and industrialists were borrowing for working capital, not for new ventures. Experts offer several reasons for the private sector’s reluctance to borrow for long-term investments. First, the interest rate is still double the prevailing inflation and the highest among regional countries. Secondly, the banks prefer risk-free easy profit from government securities and discourage long-term lending to businesses amid high default fears. Third, the unprecedented cost of inputs, especially energy, and high taxes, combined with rampant corruption in the Federal Board of Revenue, discourage new investment. It is believed in the financial sector that the time is not suitable for any new long-term investment due to the uncertain political situation in the country, while an alarming high alert in the region regarding the increasing possibility of attacks on Iran by Israel and US forces.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: As a guilty plea in New York confirms India’s involvement in an assassination attempt on US soil, Pakistan has highlighted Indian-sponsorship of extraterritorial terrorism and threats against dissidents abroad, warning that the Modi government, in the garb of extremist Hindutva ideology has become the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Islamabad has shared “irrefutable and concrete evidence of Indian sponsorship of terrorism and terrorist groups operating in Pakistan from across our borders,” said Tahir Abdrabi, spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a recent press briefing. The warning comes as Nikhil Gupta , an American citizen, formally stands convicted in a US federal court after a Manhattan judge accepted his guilty plea in a murder-for-hire conspiracy targeting Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh activist living in New York. The case carries a maximum prison exposure of 40 years. Observers say conviction confirms Indian plot to kill Sikh activist, but it does not resolve broader diplomatic questions of ‘state responsibility’ Under US law, a conviction occurs once a judge accepts a guilty plea after determining it was made knowingly, voluntarily, and with a factual basis. In Gupta’s case, the finding of guilt is final; only sentencing remains. His hearing is scheduled for May 29, with prosecutors calculating an advisory sentencing range of 235 to 293 months (roughly 19 to 24 years). Gupta admitted to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. US officials have emphasised the broader implications. A US Department of Justice state­­ment said the assassination plot was initiated by an Indian government employee, identified in reports as former Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) officer Vikash Yadav. FBI Assistant Director James C. Barnacle, Jr., added that Gupta acted at the “direction and coordination of an Indian government employee,” facilitating a “foreign adversary’s unlawful effort to silence a vocal critic of the Indian government.” When the case first appeared in the media in November 2023, then-Senator and Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin described it as “a foiled assassination plot against a US citizen involving Indian government officials,” highlighting the need to examine how governments attempt to silence dissidents abroad. While US lawmakers have not publicly commented on Gupta’s conviction, reports indicate interest in assessing whether the plot reflects a systemic pattern or a limited operation. Intelligence cooperation between Washington and New Delhi could see subtle recalibrations in sensitive channels, while the Trump administration is expected to use the case as a warning against extraterritorial targeting on American soil. Diplomatic observers in Washington note that the case will likely influence “intelligence sharing, law-enforcement coordination, and visa or security vetting in sensitive areas,” rather than immediately prompting public sanctions or a breakdown in relations. The case also remains linked to the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada, an episode that strained Ottawa-New Delhi relations and drew attention from the United States and other Five Eyes partners. Together, the two incidents have positioned India in Western security discourse as a country accused of targeting dissidents abroad. While Gupta’s conviction confirms the plot, it does not resolve broader diplomatic questions of state responsibility, the observers noted. Those issues are expected to be addressed through intelligence channels, congressional oversight, and private diplomatic engagement — the quiet processes through which Washington balances law enforcement red lines with strategic partnerships central to its Asia policy. In that sense, the case is no longer just about the criminal act itself, but about how the United States chooses to translate a conviction into long-term norms governing the conduct of both allies and adversaries.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the government released a list of 3,117 people, including about 200 security personnel, whom he described as “victims of recent terrorist operation”. “If anyone disputes accuracy of our data, please share any evidence,” the diplomat, who has previously stated that 690 people on the list were “terrorists” armed and funded by the US and Israel, wrote on X. His comments came as the threat of war looms increasingly large over the country and potentially the region, with Serbia on Saturday becoming the latest country to call on all its citizens to immediately leave Iran. ‘20,000 civilians’ Mai Sato, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, has said more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed, but information remains limited amid heavy internet filtering by the state, six weeks after a nationwide communications blackout was imposed. The US-based HRANA says it has documented more than 7,000 people killed during the nationwide protests, and is investigating nearly 12,000 more cases. Sato was among 30 special rapporteurs and international human rights experts who signed a joint statement on Friday calling on Iranian authorities to fully disclose the fate and whereabouts of tens of thousands arrested, forcibly disappeared or missing in the aftermath of the nationwide protests, and to halt all related death sentences and executions. ‘Iran will not bow to pressure’ Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that his country would not bow its head to pressure from world powers amid nuclear talks with the United States, Reuters reported. “World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads … but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us,” Pezeshkian said in a speech carried live by state TV. On the other hand, the Iranian foreign minister has also been speaking with multiple US media outlets to advocate for a “fair” agreement with Washington over Iran’s nuclear programme. The comments come after President Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran after ordering a major naval build-up in the Middle East aimed at pressuring Tehran to reach a deal to curb its nuclear programme. The latest warning came after Iran’s foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready within days, following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week. Trump had suggested on Thursday that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, a deadline he later extended to 15 days. Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump replied: “The most I can say — I am considering it.” As part of the military build-up, the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford was seen entering the Mediterranean Sea on Friday, transiting the Strait of Gibraltar, after being ordered to the region by Trump. Washington had already deployed t he USS Abraham Lincoln and escort warships to the Gulf in January. Published in Dawn, February 22nd, 2026",

Sources said he would remain in London for two days before leaving for Pakistan on Monday.

The premier had travelled to the United States at President Trump’s invitation to participate in the high-level gathering foc­u­sed on Gaza and broader peace efforts. Addressing the gathering in Washington, PM Shehbaz stressed the need to end ceasefire violations in Gaza, calling it “very important” for achieving long lasting peace in the war-torn territory. “The people of Palestine have long endured illegal occupation and immense suffering,” he said, adding that protecting lives and advancing reconstruction required strict adherence to the ceasefire. He emphasised that Palestinians must exercise full control over their land and future in line with UN Security Council resolutions, and called for a credible pathway to self-determination through the establishment of an independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine.
