      "summary_orig": "Gunmen killed three people and abducted a Catholic priest and several others during an early morning attack on the clergyman’s residence in northern Nigeria’s Kaduna state, church and police sources said on Sunday. Saturday’s assault in Kauru district highlights persistent insecurity in the region, and came days after security services rescued all 166 worshippers abducted in attacks by gunmen on two churches elsewhere in Kaduna. Such attacks have drawn the attention of US President Donald Trump, who has accused Nigeria’s government of failing to protect Christians, a charge Abuja denies. US forces struck what they described as terrorist targets in northwestern Nigeria on December 25. The Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan named the kidnapped clergyman as Nathaniel Asuwaye, parish priest of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Karku, and said 10 other people were abducted. Three residents were killed during the attack, which began at about 3:20am (7:20 PKT, the diocese said in a statement. A Kaduna police spokesperson confirmed the incident, but said five people had been abducted in total and that the three people killed were members of the security forces. “Security agents exchanged gunfire with the bandits, killed some of them, and unfortunately, two soldiers and a police officer lost their lives,” he said. Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement on Sunday that Nigeria’s security crisis was “increasingly getting out of hand”. It accused the government of “gross incompetence” and failure to protect civilians as gunmen kill, abduct and terrorise rural communities across several northern states. A presidency spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment. Pope Leo, during his weekly address to the faithful in St. Peter’s Square, expressed solidarity with the victims of recent attacks in Nigeria. “I hope that the competent authorities will continue to act with determination to ensure the security and protection of every citizen’s life,” Leo said.",

      "summary_orig": "Recognition of Iran’s right to enrich uranium is key for nuclear talks with the United States to succeed, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Sunday. American and Iranian diplomats held indirect talks in Oman on Friday, aimed at reviving diplomacy amid a US naval buildup near Iran and Tehran’s vows of a harsh response if attacked. “Zero enrichment can never be accepted by us. Hence, we need to focus on discussions that accept enrichment inside Iran while building trust that enrichment is and will stay for peaceful purposes,” Araqchi said. Iran and the US held five rounds of nuclear talks last year, which stalled mainly due to disagreements over uranium enrichment inside Iran. In June, the US attacked Iranian nuclear facilities at the end of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said it has halted enrichment activity, which the US views as a possible pathway to nuclear bombs. Iran says its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes. A diplomat in the region briefed by Iran told Reuters on Friday that Tehran was open to discussing the “level and purity” of enrichment as well as other arrangements, as long as it was allowed to enrich uranium on its soil and would be granted sanctions relief in addition to military de-escalation. “Iran’s insistence on enrichment is not merely technical or economic (…) it is rooted in a desire for independence and dignity,” Araqchi said. “No one has the right to tell the Iranian nation what it should or should not have.” The minister also said that Iran’s missile programme, which the US would like to include in negotiations, had never been part of the agenda. President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on Sunday that talks with the US were a “step forward” and that Tehran wanted its rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be respected. The date and venue of the next round of talks will be determined in consultation with Oman and might not be Muscat, Araqchi said.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE/ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR/QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lahore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections. A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported in Quetta.  In Lahore, all major markets remained closed, primarily due to Sunday and Basant day. The strike ended in Peshawar after 5pm. The PTI — a part of the TTAP — earlier also announced its plan to stage nationwide protests today to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024, general elections , which it alleges were marred by rigging . The party has also announced it will observe a mourning day following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives . In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. “It is a day of mourning over the stolen vote and terrorism in Balochistan and Islamabad,” he added. Recalling the Feb 8, 2024 elections, Raja termed it a “historic moment of the Pakistani nation’s democratic expression”. He highlighted that the people voted for PTI in support of its founder, Imran Khan despite “months-long oppression and snatching the electoral symbol”. He further said, “On that dark evening, the wolves who looted the votes of those young people and of the entire nation across the country, they negated the very existence of millions of human beings.” The TTAP and PTI shared purported visuals of shops shut in various cities, including KP’s Peshawar , Abbottabad , Balakot , Haripur , Bajaur , Upper Chitral and Lakki Marwat ; Sindh’s Hyderabad , Mirpurkhas , Umerkot , Badin and Nawabshah ; Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin , Mianwali , Muzaffargarh ; and Balochistan’s Quetta , Chaman , Zhob , and Kuchlak . It also posted videos showing PTI workers and supporters gathered in KP’s Kohat , as well as Balochistan’s Nasirabad , Qila Saifullah , Chaman and Pishin . On Saturday, PTI leader Asad Qaiser had told Dawn the party had neither postponed nor cancelled its protest programme. “The day will be observed as a National Day of Mourning and, at the same time, protests will be held across the country against rigging in the general election,” he said. Qaiser said the party would hold protests and a shutter-down strike “with the masses” against the alleged electoral manipulation. KP In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A Dawn correspondent reported a partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. The strike ended across Peshawar shortly after 5pm. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. He expressed his gratitude to “all traders associations and transport associations of Haripur for their cooperation in showing solidarity” with TTAP’s call. PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders. PTI KP Deputy Information Secretary Ikram Khatana said that the party’s Peshawar chapter would arrange a demonstration at Chowk Yadgar in the afternoon. Seating arrangement and panaflex boards could be seen at the venue, with PTI banners hanging in front of closed shops. He said that party workers would gather at Hashtnagri Chowk around 12pm and later march through Rampura Bazaar to reach Chowk Yadgar. Besides, he said that all the district chapters across the province would arrange events. In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests. PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under the MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found. Sindh All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. The PTI’s Karachi chapter also claimed that markets in Safoora Town , North Nazimabad , Landhi , Shah Faisal Colony , Model Town and Malir were shut by traders to record their protest silently. In another post, Sheikh contended, “This strike is not just a strike, it’s a referendum! Today’s nationwide strike has set a new precedent. “Historically, strikes in this province were enforced with sticks, threats, roadblocks, burning tyres, even bullets and arson.” He claimed, “This may be the first strike in Pakistan’s history where workers were not on the streets — yet the public itself shut everything down. That is not a strike; that is a referendum.” Punjab In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”. However, a Dawn correspondent in Lahore reported that markets exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with routine traffic movement observed. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival , which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level. Party leaders in the province also criticised police raids and arrests of workers on Saturday, alleging harassment of families during search operations. Islamabad, Rawalpindi Meanwhile, most of the markets in the federal capital remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Fawad Khan, a PTI supporter who was selling garments, said that he and other traders cannot afford to close their shops. “We are already hand-to-mouth, and I cannot starve my family. I am a follower of Imran Khan and even voted for his candidate, but I cannot afford to close the stall,” he said. People shop at the H-9 Sunday bazaar in Islamabad on Feb 8, 2026. — Ikram Junaidi Muhammad Faiq, a resident who had come for shopping, said that although they have sympathy for PTI, it was not possible for him to remain limited to his house on a Sunday. “I get only one day in a week to purchase grocery and I must do it,” he said. However, resident Muhammad Danish said that all the political parties were the same and they never cared about the masses. “When PTI was in power, they did not care about the masses and Imran Khan has been facing charges that he sold the [state] gifts. He used to give examples of different premiers that they come to office on bicycles but he himself travelled on a helicopter to go to office,” he said. “No one, including the establishment, cares about Pakistan; otherwise, we would not be suffering and facing such a situation,” he lamented. PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal had said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities. A local district administration official confirmed that the metro bus service that runs between the twin cities was suspended. The electric bus service operated by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was also suspended. However, traffic on the capital’s roads was reported to be the same as usual. Balochistan A complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in the provincial capital Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin in Quetta, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic. Mobile internet services have been suspended again , a Dawn correspondent reported. Workers of the PTI and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — which is headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — staged demonstrations in some areas of the city. Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. Police were reported to have used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and removed the barricades and the burning tyres to open the road for traffic. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. A small demonstration also took place near Airport Road, but police dispersed the participants and cleared the route for traffic. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. Protesters attempted to block inter-provincial roads, but police dispersed them, reportedly resorting to baton charges in Qila Saifullah. In Chaman, political workers pelted stones at the police, injuring one constable who was taken to a hospital. In an exchange on X, Balochistan government official Shahid Rind said in a reply to Achakzai that the Quetta Airport road usually displayed similar scenes as today on “a Sunday in winters”. In his post, Achakzai had shared a picture showing a deserted road. In a post, the TTAP said its workers had “blocked all roads” in Balochistan’s Loralai and Harnai . Tyres were also burned to block the road near Duki’s Eidgah Chowk, it said . Additional input from Irfan Raza, Imtiaz Ali More to follow",

The PTI — a part of the TTAP — earlier also announced its plan to stage nationwide protests today to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024, general elections , which it alleges were marred by rigging . The party has also announced it will observe a mourning day following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives . In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. “It is a day of mourning over the stolen vote and terrorism in Balochistan and Islamabad,” he added. Recalling the Feb 8, 2024 elections, Raja termed it a “historic moment of the Pakistani nation’s democratic expression”. He highlighted that the people voted for PTI in support of its founder, Imran Khan despite “months-long oppression and snatching the electoral symbol”. He further said, “On that dark evening, the wolves who looted the votes of those young people and of the entire nation across the country, they negated the very existence of millions of human beings.” The TTAP and PTI shared purported visuals of shops shut in various cities, including KP’s Peshawar , Abbottabad , Balakot , Haripur , Bajaur , Upper Chitral and Lakki Marwat ; Sindh’s Hyderabad , Mirpurkhas , Umerkot , Badin and Nawabshah ; Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin , Mianwali , Muzaffargarh ; and Balochistan’s Quetta , Chaman , Zhob , and Kuchlak . It also posted videos showing PTI workers and supporters gathered in KP’s Kohat , as well as Balochistan’s Nasirabad , Qila Saifullah , Chaman and Pishin . On Saturday, PTI leader Asad Qaiser had told Dawn the party had neither postponed nor cancelled its protest programme. “The day will be observed as a National Day of Mourning and, at the same time, protests will be held across the country against rigging in the general election,” he said. Qaiser said the party would hold protests and a shutter-down strike “with the masses” against the alleged electoral manipulation. KP In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A Dawn correspondent reported a partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. The strike ended across Peshawar shortly after 5pm. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. He expressed his gratitude to “all traders associations and transport associations of Haripur for their cooperation in showing solidarity” with TTAP’s call. PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders. PTI KP Deputy Information Secretary Ikram Khatana said that the party’s Peshawar chapter would arrange a demonstration at Chowk Yadgar in the afternoon. Seating arrangement and panaflex boards could be seen at the venue, with PTI banners hanging in front of closed shops. He said that party workers would gather at Hashtnagri Chowk around 12pm and later march through Rampura Bazaar to reach Chowk Yadgar. Besides, he said that all the district chapters across the province would arrange events. In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests. PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under the MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found. Sindh All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. The PTI’s Karachi chapter also claimed that markets in Safoora Town , North Nazimabad , Landhi , Shah Faisal Colony , Model Town and Malir were shut by traders to record their protest silently. In another post, Sheikh contended, “This strike is not just a strike, it’s a referendum! Today’s nationwide strike has set a new precedent. “Historically, strikes in this province were enforced with sticks, threats, roadblocks, burning tyres, even bullets and arson.” He claimed, “This may be the first strike in Pakistan’s history where workers were not on the streets — yet the public itself shut everything down. That is not a strike; that is a referendum.” Punjab In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”. However, a Dawn correspondent in Lahore reported that markets exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with routine traffic movement observed. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival , which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level. Party leaders in the province also criticised police raids and arrests of workers on Saturday, alleging harassment of families during search operations. Islamabad, Rawalpindi Meanwhile, most of the markets in the federal capital remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Fawad Khan, a PTI supporter who was selling garments, said that he and other traders cannot afford to close their shops. “We are already hand-to-mouth, and I cannot starve my family. I am a follower of Imran Khan and even voted for his candidate, but I cannot afford to close the stall,” he said. People shop at the H-9 Sunday bazaar in Islamabad on Feb 8, 2026. — Ikram Junaidi Muhammad Faiq, a resident who had come for shopping, said that although they have sympathy for PTI, it was not possible for him to remain limited to his house on a Sunday. “I get only one day in a week to purchase grocery and I must do it,” he said. However, resident Muhammad Danish said that all the political parties were the same and they never cared about the masses. “When PTI was in power, they did not care about the masses and Imran Khan has been facing charges that he sold the [state] gifts. He used to give examples of different premiers that they come to office on bicycles but he himself travelled on a helicopter to go to office,” he said. “No one, including the establishment, cares about Pakistan; otherwise, we would not be suffering and facing such a situation,” he lamented. PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal had said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities. A local district administration official confirmed that the metro bus service that runs between the twin cities was suspended. The electric bus service operated by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was also suspended. However, traffic on the capital’s roads was reported to be the same as usual. Balochistan A complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in the provincial capital Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin in Quetta, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic. Mobile internet services have been suspended again , a Dawn correspondent reported. Workers of the PTI and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — which is headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — staged demonstrations in some areas of the city. Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. Police were reported to have used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and removed the barricades and the burning tyres to open the road for traffic. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. A small demonstration also took place near Airport Road, but police dispersed the participants and cleared the route for traffic. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. Protesters attempted to block inter-provincial roads, but police dispersed them, reportedly resorting to baton charges in Qila Saifullah. In Chaman, political workers pelted stones at the police, injuring one constable who was taken to a hospital. In an exchange on X, Balochistan government official Shahid Rind said in a reply to Achakzai that the Quetta Airport road usually displayed similar scenes as today on “a Sunday in winters”. In his post, Achakzai had shared a picture showing a deserted road. In a post, the TTAP said its workers had “blocked all roads” in Balochistan’s Loralai and Harnai . Tyres were also burned to block the road near Duki’s Eidgah Chowk, it said . Additional input from Irfan Raza, Imtiaz Ali More to follow",

      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday issued renewed warnings about the threats to global peace due to “terrorist organisations operating in Afghanistan”, and criticised the Taliban regime’s policies, which he said created conditions “similar to or worse than pre-9/11”. He made the remarks in a statement thanking world leaders for showing solidarity with Pakistan over the recent attack on an imambargah in Islamabad , which killed 36 people and injured more than 160. The militant group Islamic State (IS) had claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat, Zardari reiterated the Pakistani nation’s resolve to combat terrorism and violent ideology. “Pakistan has long maintained that terrorism cannot be confronted by a single country in isolation,” he was quoted as saying. Citing Pakistan’s experience, he said in the statement that whenever “terrorist groups are allowed space, facilitation or impunity beyond national borders, the consequences are borne by innocent civilians all over the world.” Under such a context, he continued, certain neighbouring countries had become partners in crime by allowing terrorist elements to operate against Pakistan from their soil, while some not only finance them directly but also provide them with technical and military means. “This is a reality that has shaped the regional developments in recent years. Pakistan takes strong exception to the situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime has created conditions similar to or worse than pre-9/11, when terror organisations posed threats to global peace, ending in the 9/11 tragedy,” the statement quoted him as saying. The Sept 11, 2001 , attacks, also known as 9/11, refer to a series of coordinated plane hijackings by the armed Al Qaeda group, which claimed almost 3,000 lives. Zardari also accused India of “assisting the Taliban regime and threatening not only Pakistan but also the regional and global peace.” Following Friday’s mosque attack in Islamabad, government officials, including the Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, had also blamed “Indian-backed proxies” for carrying out the attack. President Zardari appreciated the international community for expressing solidarity with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism. “Pakistan is humbled by the strong and sincere outpouring of support and solidarity from world leaders, governments and international organisations,” he said in the statement. “The messages of sympathy and solidarity had brought comfort to the people of Pakistan and strength to the families who mourned.” Islamabad has reiterated that Afghanistan’s soil has been continuously used by terrorists against Pakistan and urged the Taliban regime to rein in the terror groups’ operations in its land to target civilians and military personnel in Pakistan.",

      "summary_orig": "International Cricket Council (ICC) Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam separately landed in Lahore on Sunday. Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said the guest will hold a meeting with PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as the interior minister. The ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport. According to an earlier PCB press release, the BCB president will also meet with Naqvi. Islam was welcomed at the airport by Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — and other officials. The high-level visits come a day after the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup commenced. The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland. Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka. After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo. In response to the development even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC in a statement said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”. It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of. “The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated. A government source told Dawn at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh. “The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added. Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue. It was reported earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses. Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown . Pakistan, who edged out the Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate. Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.",

      "summary_orig": "Opener Tim Seifert struck a blistering 65 off 42 balls to lead New Zealand’s highest-ever run in a T20 World Cup as they beat Afghanistan by five wickets on Sunday. After Afghanistan made 182-6, New Zealand were driven by Seifert’s 42-ball knock and 42 by Glenn Phillips to achieve their target with 13 balls to spare in Chennai. New Zealand’s previous best chase in the T20 World Cup was their 167 against England in the 2021 semi-final. Afghanistan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman had New Zealand in early trouble when he struck on successive balls in the second over of the chase to dismiss Finn Allen, for one, and Rachin Ravindra, for a duck. The hat-trick was avoided by Phillips, who then got going with wicketkeeper Seifert in a partnership of 74 for the third wicket to thwart Afghanistan’s spin-heavy attack. Captain Rashid Khan let out a roar as he broke through to dismiss Phillips, who inside-edged onto his stumps. Leg-spinner Rashid dropped Seifert on 48 off his own bowling, and the batsman reached his fifty with a six off veteran spinner Mohammad Nabi. Seifert hit Nabi for another six and a four on successive balls before the bowler had his revenge on the next when he top-edged to be caught in the deep. Mark Chapman fell after a 17-ball 28, but Daryl Mitchell, on 25, and skipper Mitchell Santner, on 17, saw New Zealand to 183-5 and a comfortable victory. Afghanistan won the toss and chose to bat, and Gulbadin Naib, coming in at number three, struck 63 off 35 balls after they had slipped to 44-2. Matt Henry nearly had Rahmanullah Gurbaz caught after he skied a top edge behind the stumps, but keeper Seifert and Allen collided as they both ran back, and the chance went begging. Pace bowler Lockie Ferguson struck twice in his opening over to send back Ibrahim Zadran, for 10, and then Gurbaz, bowled for 27 off an inside edge. Naib and left-hander Sediqullah Atal, who made 29, got together to rebuild the innings with a 79-run stand for the third wicket. Naib reached his fourth T20 fifty off 29 balls before he departed attempting a slog off left-arm spinner Rachin Ravindra.",

      "summary_orig": "China condemned on Sunday the deadly suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad earlier this week, asserting that it “firmly supports” the Pakistani government in safeguarding national security and stability. “China is deeply shocked by the deadly explosion in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad and the heavy casualties it has inflicted. China mourns for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones. “China strongly condemns the attack, opposes any form of terrorism and firmly supports the Pakistani government in safeguarding national security and stability and protecting the safety of the people,” a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry said. Turkiye FM offers condolences over loss of life Separately, in a phone call with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan conveyed “heartfelt condolences on behalf of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, himself, and the brotherly people of Turkiye” over the loss of life in the attack, the Foreign Office (FO) said. FM Dar “thanked the Turkish leadership for their solidarity and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unshaken resolve to combat terrorism and protect its civilians,” according to the statement. “Both leaders also exchanged views on bilateral relations, matters of mutual interest, and key regional and international developments,” the FO added. The attack The attack took place inside the mosque at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra, located in the Tarlai area of what is considered ‘rural Islamabad’, off Lehtrar Road on Friday. It left over 30 people dead and more 100 injured. Police officials said the blast occurred after Friday prayers, adding that the attacker was stopped at the gate of the mosque, where he detonated his explosive payload. Footage and photos from the blast site showed several bodies lying near the mosque’s front gate, with people and debris also strewn across the red-carpeted prayer hall. Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the mosque as people called for help. The brazen attack elicited an outpouring of grief from across the country, and prompted condemnations from most world capitals, as well as local political and religious groups. Authorities have pointed fingers at Afghanistan and India as the investigation into the incident continues. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said yesterday that four facilitators behind the suicide bombing, including the mastermind, had been arrested, saying the suspects were detained in overnight raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said multiple agencies launched an investigation immediately after the blast and carried out operations overnight. “I want to praise our agencies and the Counter-Terrorism Department in KP that all the people who were linked to the blast, including the masterminds, were arrested before 3am,” he added. After the blast, raids were conducted in Peshawar and Nowshera and the facilitators and the mastermind were arrested. Naqvi claimed that the mastermind was an Afghan national, affiliated with the militant Islamic State (IS) group. “The terrorist involved in the incident got training in Afghanistan. How he was trained, his travel history tells everything,” Naqvi said. A KP police assistant sub-inspector was martyred during the overnight raids, while several personnel were injured, the minister added. He stressed that the network had been dismantled. “The entire ISIS network has been busted,” he said. Naqvi claimed there were at least “21 terrorist organisations” operating from Afghanistan. He alleged that the mercenaries shifted allegiance “to whoever paid them more”. “Someone is giving them funds, and they are getting dollars from somewhere,” he said, alleging India was providing funding and targets. “Those who were giving $500 are now giving $1,500… India has increased the funding three times after May,” he said.",

Bilateral interaction is close to zero, while Pakistan has strong reasons to believe that its eastern neighbour is playing a key role in fomenting terrorism within its borders. This is unsustainable in the long run, as the threat of conflict is never far away when such a massive gulf of mistrust exists. And while India keeps harping on about the main obstacle to better ties being ‘terrorism’, which it alleges emanates from Pakistan, it is India which is bringing terrorism to this country. Meanwhile, the main flashpoint in South Asia remains the unresolved question of Kashmir. Though New Delhi would like to believe its own fiction that the Kashmir dispute has been ‘resolved’ by the scrapping of the occupied territory’s limited autonomy in 2019, the fact remains that internationally, Kashmir remains a disputed region. The lack of resolution of the Kashmir question results in a state of permanent insecurity in the subcontinent. We must not forget that both states fought a limited war after the Pahalgam episode last year. The threat of fresh conflict is ever-present as long as the dispute is not judiciously settled. Moreover, Indian repression in occupied Kashmir continues unabated. And when events such as Pahalgam occur, the plight of Kashmiris in the held region, as well as in India, becomes even more acute. They are punished doubly; because of their Kashmiri origin, as well as their Muslim faith. Human Rights Watch has documented Hindu mob attacks in India after the Pahalgam assault in which Kashmiri students and workers were targeted in various Indian states. UN human rights experts have reached similar conclusions. Furthermore, the UN experts have condemned “arbitrary arrests and detentions, suspicious deaths in custody, torture … lynchings” of Muslims including Kashmiris. These grim facts reveal the true face of the ‘world’s largest democracy’. Pakistan has consistently sought to bring India to the table in order to resolve the Kashmir question. Yet India, particularly under Narendra Modi, has arrogantly rejected the invitation. While New Delhi abhors the thought of third-party meditation in Kashmir, it is time international actors paid more attention to the issue. US President Donald Trump has on several occasions said he is willing to step in and help resolve the dispute. Last year, he claimed to have “stopped the war” between Pakistan and India, while adding that “I can solve anything”. He is welcome to try, perhaps using his Board of Peace as a platform to address the Kashmir issue. While the Indians talk tough, they will have a hard time resisting US pressure, as their recent ‘commitment’ to stop buying Russian oil shows. Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Bangladesh has expressed keen interest in procuring freight wagons and passenger coaches after Pakistan offered the rolling stock at prices cheaper than those in other countries. A two-member delegation, headed by a senior Bangladeshi official, has also visited the Pakistan Railways (PR) carriage factory in Islamabad and the Mughalpura Workshop in Lahore to receive a briefing from the railway authorities and to witness the rolling stock manufacturing process, Dawn has learnt. According to the Lahore-based PR authorities, Mr Farhad Islam, Bangladesh’s Secretary for International Organisations and Consular Affairs and Designate D-8 Commissioner and Mohammad Iqbal Hussain Khan, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan, visited the Mughalpura workshop on Friday. Muhammad Nasir Khalili, Chief Mechanical Engineer (Carriage and Wagons), briefed the delegation on the overall functioning, technical capabilities, and ongoing projects of the PR’s workshops. A short documentary highlighting the workshops’ operational and working strengths was also shown to the guests. Pakistan Railways offers attractive prices to seal export deal Mr Khalili stated that Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries sharing a common history, culture, and heritage, and that there exists immense potential for cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the railway sector. The delegation was subsequently given a detailed tour of the Mughalpura Locomotive Workshop, where they were briefed on the various stages of locomotive maintenance, rehabilitation, and manufacturing. The diplomats termed their visit informative, productive, and encouraging, and appreciated the technical expertise and professional competence of Pakistan Railways. “Our visit stands as a clear testament to the strengthening bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” said Mr Islam. On the other hand, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has expressed his resolve to advance railway-to-railway cooperation between the two countries, emphasising that such collaboration can yield substantial benefits. PR is currently supplying coaches and wagons to four countries with broad-gauge rail networks — Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chile and Argentina. ““It reflects that we have achieved modern, indigenous manufacturing capability for coaches and wagons,” the minister said in a statement. In the next phase, according to Mr Khalili, the railway experts from Bangladesh will also visit Pakistan for a detailed technical evaluation. In the 1980s, Pakistan Railways exported rolling stock to Bangladesh while it provided freight wagons to Sri Lanka in 1999 and 2000 and 2009. In the current regional context, Pakistan is emerging as a suitable and cost-effective alternative to other international suppliers for Bangladesh. Bangladesh was dealing with India regarding the provision of wagons and coaches. But now Dhaka has shown its interest in us for this purpose,” Mr Khalili told Dawn when contacted. He said the delegation also visited the Islamabad carriage factory a few days ago. Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026",

Pakistan Railways offers attractive prices to seal export deal Mr Khalili stated that Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries sharing a common history, culture, and heritage, and that there exists immense potential for cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the railway sector. The delegation was subsequently given a detailed tour of the Mughalpura Locomotive Workshop, where they were briefed on the various stages of locomotive maintenance, rehabilitation, and manufacturing. The diplomats termed their visit informative, productive, and encouraging, and appreciated the technical expertise and professional competence of Pakistan Railways. “Our visit stands as a clear testament to the strengthening bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” said Mr Islam. On the other hand, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has expressed his resolve to advance railway-to-railway cooperation between the two countries, emphasising that such collaboration can yield substantial benefits. PR is currently supplying coaches and wagons to four countries with broad-gauge rail networks — Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chile and Argentina. ““It reflects that we have achieved modern, indigenous manufacturing capability for coaches and wagons,” the minister said in a statement. In the next phase, according to Mr Khalili, the railway experts from Bangladesh will also visit Pakistan for a detailed technical evaluation. In the 1980s, Pakistan Railways exported rolling stock to Bangladesh while it provided freight wagons to Sri Lanka in 1999 and 2000 and 2009. In the current regional context, Pakistan is emerging as a suitable and cost-effective alternative to other international suppliers for Bangladesh. Bangladesh was dealing with India regarding the provision of wagons and coaches. But now Dhaka has shown its interest in us for this purpose,” Mr Khalili told Dawn when contacted. He said the delegation also visited the Islamabad carriage factory a few days ago. Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The public health crisis triggered by unchecked increase in stray dog population once again came into the spotlight when two female polio workers and a policeman escorting the field staff were injured in separate incidents of animal attacks on Saturday. Sources said one female worker carrying out door-to-door vaccination campaign was attacked by a street dog in Zaman town, Korangi, while the other in the area of Malir Cantonment. The third incident, the sources said, was reported in the Quaidabad area where a policeman escorting the polio team was bitten by a stray dog. He was later treated at the Indus Hospital. Speaking to Dawn , a spokesperson for the Sindh Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) only confirmed the cases involving two female workers. EOC confirms two incidents involving as many female polio workers; cop bitten by stray dog receives treatment at Indus Hospital “Two incidents involving street dogs affecting polio workers were officially reported today in Korangi and Malir. The safety of our frontline workers is our highest priority, and we stand fully with our teams,” said EOC-Sindh spokesperson Minahil Mustafa. According to her, the cases were immediately managed as per the health and safety protocols, with full support from relevant departments. She explained that teams established for the polio vaccination drive at union council level included representatives from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, town municipal corporations and the local government and “such issues are promptly raised and addressed through these coordination mechanisms”. The government encouraged the media and community members to share any relevant information so targeted support and solutions could be provided in affected areas, she added. Rabies Prevention and Training Centre Manager Aftab Gohar of the Indus Hospital confirmed that a policeman engaged in polio-related duties reported at the hospital with dog-bite injuries on Saturday. “A 21-year-old policeman, escorting the polio workers, reported at our facility today with dog-bite injuries. His leg injury was classified as a Category II exposure,” he said, adding that he was provided treatment and asked to report back for follow-up doses scheduled on Day 3 and Day 7. This year, he pointed out, at least two to three polio workers with dog-bite injuries had received treatment at the hospital. One of the victims was a woman in her late 30s. “On a daily basis, however, 150 to 200 dog-bite [old and new] cases are reported at our facility,” he said. The official emphasised the need for controlling dog population, training healthcare providers in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and creating public awareness. It might be recalled that this week a rabies case was reported in Karachi, raising the total number of reported cases of the deadly infectious disease to three in the province. Last year, at least 22 people lost their lives to rabies. Over 41,000 dog-bite cases were reported at three tertiary care hospitals — over 16,000 at the Indus Hospital, over 12,000 at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and over 13,000 at Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.

      "summary_orig": "RAWALPINDI: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Rawalpindi on Saturday dismissed an application filed by PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan, seeking permission for a medical check-up by his personal doctors at Adiala jail. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court declined to grant access to Mr Khan’s private physicians inside the jail. Appearing for the PTI founder, counsel Faisal Malik argued that as a former prime minister, his client deserved the same medical facilities previously extended to other ex-premiers, citing Nawaz Sharif as precedent. He contended that Mr Khan was an undertrial prisoner and had the legal right to be examined by doctors of his choice. The lawyer also claimed that Adiala jail lacked adequate facilities for specialised eye treatment. Referring to Pakistan Prison Rules, Mr Malik said Rule 795 required that a prisoner’s family be informed before any medical treatment. He questioned why Mr Khan had been taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) late at night, stating that he had not been taken out of jail for three years. Denial of access to personal doctors, he argued, amounted to discriminatory treatment. Special Prosecutor Zaheer Shah opposed the plea, arguing that Mr Khan was on bail in the GHQ attack case related to the May 9 events and convicted in other cases, and therefore could not be treated as an undertrial prisoner whose custody could be regulated by a criminal court. He further maintained that the ATC lacked jurisdiction to issue directions regarding jail administration or medical arrangements. Under prison rules, he said, medical care was the responsibility of government-appointed doctors, with no provision for private physicians. After hearing both sides, the court dismissed the application. Separately, Mr Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum alleged on X that medical reports promised by the Supreme Court had not been provided to the family, urging the chief justice to take contempt action. Meanwhile, a Pims medical report confirmed that Mr Khan was diagnosed with right central retinal vein occlusion and received hospital-based treatment, which was completed smoothly. Jail authorities informed the court that Mr Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were receiving medical care strictly under jail rules. Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026",

The enemies of the country want to see us divided,” Hafiz Ashrafi said, adding that the ule­ma wanted to convey a single mes­­sage that this was neither a sectarian conflict nor a religious issue. “These are attempts to spread fear and panic among Pakistanis, but the entire nation responded with unity, and citizens came forward to help one another.” Clerics call for unity The committee members stres­sed the importance of national harmony and urged all segments of society to work together to promote peace and stability, and not to fall into the trap of those seeking to create divisions along ethnic or religious lines. Allama Hadiul Hussaini, who belongs to Gilgit-Baltistan, said it was the first time such a collective effort had been made, with clerics from all four mainstream sects showing unity by visiting terrorism victims together.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan serves as a pre-eminent case study of a state creating a ‘Frankenstein’s monster’ by funding and facilitating proxies to destabilise a neighbour. Throughout the 1980s, acting at the behest of the United States and Saudi Arabia, the Pakistani state recruited, trained and armed various Islamist Afghan groups to combat Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan. Once the Soviet forces withdrew in 1989, the victorious proxies failed to reach an amicable power-sharing agreement and began fighting amongst themselves. Desperate to maintain a stake in the region, Pakistan helped mould an even more extreme force, the Taliban, who won decisive battles against rival factions to install a stringent Islamist regime by 1996 in Afghanistan. While the Pakistani state believed it had successfully installed a government beneficial to its strategic geopolitical interests, the internal fallout of this involvement had already commenced. A decade of establishing recruitment centres where young men were indoctrinated and trained in guerrilla warfare eventually backfired. These proxy militants turned their guns against the Pakistani state, forming groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to demand the enforcement of Sharia law and the creation of a ‘Greater Afghanistan’ that included Pakistan’s own Pakhtun-majority areas. From Afghan militancy in the 1980s and 1990s to the Middle East’s sectarian militias and from Africa to Balochistan, modern history is filled with states that created violent proxies, only for them to become existential threats to themselves For the next two decades, anti-state groups comprising former proxies and their Pakistani allies unleashed waves of brutal attacks across the country. By the time the state fully grasped the devastating consequences of the strategy it had initiated in the 1980s, over 80,000 Pakistani soldiers, police personnel, politicians and civilians had been killed. This ongoing conflict underscores a devastating strategic reversal, where proxies, once cultivated as a shield for regional interests, became an existential threat, sustained by the very forces Pakistan helped bring to power. This is but just one example of how proxies often become a problem for their own creators, a phenomenon frequently described as ‘blowback’. History is littered with instances where short-term tactical gains through third party actors led to long-term domestic catastrophes. In 2009, the American journalist Andrew Higgins wrote that Israel’s early, indirect encouragement of Islamist elements in the Palestinian territories as a counterweight to Yasser Arafat’s secular Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), contributed to the rise of Hamas, which later became Israel’s most formidable local adversary. These cases demonstrate a recurring geopolitical truth, that when a state breathes life into a proxy, it loses the ability to control the monster’s appetite once the original mission is over. This loss of control often transforms a strategic asset into a primary security threat, as Iraq experienced following the 2003 US invasion. The initial support provided by regional powers such as Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran to sectarian militias in Iraq eventually resulted in the birth of the Islamic State (ISIS). In his book ISIS: A History, Lebanese-American academic Fawaz Gerges writes that many of the fighters who formed the backbone of ISIS were seasoned by years of proxy warfare, eventually turning their sights not just on Western targets, but on the regional states that had once turned a blind eye to their radicalisation. According to British academic Dr Alex Vines, Apartheid-era South Africa funded and trained rebels in Mozambique to destabilise that country. While the rebels successfully crippled Mozambique’s infrastructure, the resulting chaos created a massive refugee crisis and a thriving black market in small arms that flooded back across South African borders, fuelling a rise in violent crime and instability that persisted long after the official conflict ended. In his book Proxy Warfare, the British political scientist Andrew Mumford writes that the danger of creating proxies lies in the inherent paradox of attempting to outsource national security to autonomous actors, whose interests only temporarily align with those of the sponsor. According to the American political scientist Tyrone Groh, while states often view these groups as cost-effective tools for projectable power and plausible deniability, they frequently ignore the reality that a proxy is not a precision-guided weapon but a sentient political entity with its own evolving ambitions. As a conflict progresses, the proxy inevitably seeks to shed its dependence on its creator, often utilising the training, funding and ideological fervour it was gifted by its facilitator to pursue an independent and frequently contradictory agenda. This transforms a strategic asset into a domestic liability, a phenomenon that forces the original sponsor to expend even greater resources to contain the radicalism or violence it once actively cultivated. Despite the overwhelming historical evidence that proxies eventually turn on their creators, the allure of low-cost, deniable warfare remains irresistible to modern states. According to Mumford, this persistence suggests that, for many governments, the immediate tactical advantages — such as bleeding a rival — outweighs the potential for long-term domestic catastrophe. Contemporary geopolitics has seen the rise of new sponsors who have adopted these risky strategies with varying degrees of success and instability. India has frequently been accused of utilising proxy groups to maintain leverage in its complex regional environment. More recently, scholarship has examined the manner in which India is leveraging Baloch separatist groups in Pakistan to destabilise its western frontier. The Baloch separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), as well as the Islamist TTP, have increasingly been identified by Pakistani authorities and some regional analysts as instruments of Indian strategic interest. The discourse surrounding their Indian-proxy status has intensified following significant escalations in 2025 and 2026. Perhaps more surprisingly, the UAE has emerged as a significant sponsor of third party actors to project power far beyond its small geographic footprint. According to the conflict analyst Emadeddin Badi, during the Libyan civil war, the UAE provided extensive military support, drone strikes, and funding to Gen Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA). According to the researcher Peter Salisbury, in Yemen, the UAE trained and equipped the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist militia that eventually staged military takeovers of key governorates, often clashing with the interests of the UAE’s own coalition partner, Saudi Arabia. UAE has also faced international scrutiny for its alleged role in fuelling the civil war in Sudan by supplying the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) with weapons and logistics, a strategy that has contributed to a massive humanitarian crisis and a surge in regional instability. According to Groh, the continued reliance on this strategy by states confirms a grim geopolitical truth: the “Frankenstein” lesson is often ignored in favour of immediate strategic depth. Even as nations witness blowback around the world, the temptation to use proxies as a ‘surgical’ tool for regional dominance remains a primary feature of modern statecraft, despite the near-certainty of future complications.

The Baloch separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), as well as the Islamist TTP, have increasingly been identified by Pakistani authorities and some regional analysts as instruments of Indian strategic interest. The discourse surrounding their Indian-proxy status has intensified following significant escalations in 2025 and 2026. Perhaps more surprisingly, the UAE has emerged as a significant sponsor of third party actors to project power far beyond its small geographic footprint. According to the conflict analyst Emadeddin Badi, during the Libyan civil war, the UAE provided extensive military support, drone strikes, and funding to Gen Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA). According to the researcher Peter Salisbury, in Yemen, the UAE trained and equipped the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist militia that eventually staged military takeovers of key governorates, often clashing with the interests of the UAE’s own coalition partner, Saudi Arabia. UAE has also faced international scrutiny for its alleged role in fuelling the civil war in Sudan by supplying the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) with weapons and logistics, a strategy that has contributed to a massive humanitarian crisis and a surge in regional instability. According to Groh, the continued reliance on this strategy by states confirms a grim geopolitical truth: the “Frankenstein” lesson is often ignored in favour of immediate strategic depth. Even as nations witness blowback around the world, the temptation to use proxies as a ‘surgical’ tool for regional dominance remains a primary feature of modern statecraft, despite the near-certainty of future complications.

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday denied approaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) in connection with the team’s boycott of the match against India on February 15. In a post on the social media platform X, the PCB issued a statement attributed to its spokesperson, Amir Mir. “I categorically reject the claim by Indian sports journalist Vikrant Gupta that the PCB approached the ICC,” Mir was quoted as saying. Gupta, earlier in the day, had posted on X that the PCB had “reached out to the ICC for dialogue”. He had alleged that after the ICC wrote back to the PCB regarding the legal ramifications it could face, the board approached the cricket world body for talks to resolve the issue. “As usual, sections of the Indian media are busy circulating fiction. A little patience and time will clearly show who actually went knocking and who didn’t,” PCB spokesperson Mir said. It is worth mentioning that earlier on Saturday, AFP had reported a source close to the developments as saying that the PCB had reached out to the ICC after a formal communication from the cricket world body. The ICC was seeking a resolution through dialogue and not confrontation, the source added, according to AFP . The government gave the cricket team the nod to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo. Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue. The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland. As a protest, Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture. Pakistan, who edged out Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate. India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said this week that his team would travel to Colombo for the clash. Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments. Earlier this week, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown . Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would consult the government.",

      "title_orig": "Mastermind of attack on Islamabad imambargah among 4 arrested in KP raids, says Mohsin Naqvi",
      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday that four facilitators of the suicide attack on an imambargah in Islamabad , including the “main mastermind”, had been arrested during raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He made the remarks while speaking to the media in Islamabad. In his media talk, the interior minister said that operations were underway throughout last night to trace those behind the attack. Making special mention of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the KP police for their joint efforts, he said, “All those people linked to this, and the mastermind, at around 3am, all of them were apprehended.” He lauded all “agencies”, saying that this incident was a “test case”. “After the blast, raids were carried out in Nowshera and Peshawar, in which four facilitators were caught. And their mastermind, who is an Afghan, was also caught,” he said. He said that an assistant sub-inspector of KP police was martyred during the raids, while others were injured. “But the main mastermind is linked to Daesh and is in our custody,” he said, referring to the banned so-called Islamic State. The minister further said that the planning and training for the attack was done by “Daesh Afghanistan” and carried out in the neighbouring country. “We have people who are telling us details about how he (the attacker) went there and how he was trained,” he said. He again lauded law enforcement agencies on the achievement. “We have been saying for a while that whether it be Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Afghan Taliban, Daesh or other kharji terrorist organisations — they are all working together. At this time, 21 terrorist bodies’ setups … name any terrorist body, it is operating from Afghanistan,” he said. The minister further said that he had two requests for the public. “We are in a state of war; be it in Balochistan, KP or elsewhere. The intelligence [from] the community matters the most. When people get to know about an unknown person living in their community, report it to the police — when this system is activated, [terror incidents] will decrease,” he said. “Secondly, I received a message last night from someone asking where the security agencies were and why this incident happened. I can tell you that if one blast happens, 99 others are being foiled,” he said. “I spoke with the agencies and told them that we should share this with the media. It may spread panic but I said that we should share with the media which incidents were foiled,” he said. The interior minister further said that the names of Daesh and Taliban were coming up but “someone was funding them” and giving them targets. “They would get $500 but now they’re getting $1,500. Someone’s increasing their budget,” he said. “I say again with clarity that all of their funding comes from India. India is giving them all the targets; they are planning each and every thing behind the scenes. These organisations are at the front, while India is at the back,” he said. He said that while the world may stay silent for now, it would agree with Pakistan’s stance in the future. Naqvi noted that “nothing happens for free” and that the attack cost money to orchestrate, adding that since May, terrorists’ budgets had increased by three times. “We know about this and it is our duty to take this case to all international platforms,” the interior minister said. He added that he would brief the deputy prime minister on this in the coming days, so that foreign missions could update other countries about India’s involvement. “They (India) are now doing it so openly because they know that they cannot beat us in a war,” Naqvi added. “If they have adopted this tactic, then let them. But we will stop this; even if they increase their budget tenfold, it will have no impact,” he asserted. Naqvi further stated that the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) — which was behind a spate of attacks in Balochistan last weekend — created “high-production value” content that was carried by Indian media. “The world has declared BLA a terrorist organisation, but nobody will go there (India) and ask why they are showing the BLA’s content,” Naqvi said. “They create content, carry out incidents and run it on their media. It is a complete system they’ve created,” he said. He added that Indian media was trying to portray the BLA as having captured swathes of land in Pakistan but stated that “not one inch [of land] is under their control”. Talking about the attacks in Balochistan, Naqvi said that no attacker was spared. “They (India) are upset about that. But going forward, we will have a briefing on Balochistan and you will get the details,” he said. “We will continue fighting this war, but the world needs to realise that this is becoming a regional threat,” he warned. “We are doing what we can for our country, but these terrorist bodies are collaborating and jointly operating,” Naqvi added. “The world needs to observe the damage and if this violence goes elsewhere in the world, then it is on other countries to decide on what to do,” he said. Responding to questions from reporters, Naqvi noted that Pakistan had given a befitting response to Indian aggression in May last year, saying, “I think we are responding to them well. They will get a diplomatic answer.” He stated that the attacker came from Afghanistan, with the operation taking place “after an important member of Daesh came here”. Asked about the rank of the Daesh operative, Naqvi said further information would be provided in due course. “We have caught multiple accounts on Twitter being used by terrorists and they are not being shut down,” Naqvi said in response to another question about the use of social media by terrorists. “The government has written to them … but they are not blocked here, so we have taken this up very seriously,” he said. He added, “If they do not do it, we may have to adopt another strategy.” Questioned about security arrangements in Islamabad, Naqvi said that he had a detailed meeting with the Islamabad police today. “We discussed entry points in detail; we have 93 entry points,” the minister replied. “The red zone has separate entry points, and then we discussed the M-tag. Within the coming days, the chief commissioner or Islamabad inspector general will brief you.” Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior also said on the social media platform X and said, “ Based on technical and human intelligence, coordinated raids were conducted in Peshawar and Nowshera districts of KP province, leading to the arrest of four facilitators, including the Afghan ISIS mastermind behind the attack.” “Evidence confirms that planning, training, and indoctrination were carried out in Afghanistan by ISIS. The nexus of terrorism under Afghan Taliban patronage remains a serious threat to regional peace,” it said. “During the conduct of these operations, an official of Law Enforcement Agencies embraced martyrdom and four sustained injuries. Our forces remain resolute; further intelligence-based operations are underway,” it said. Raids in KP Earlier in the day, security sources had also stated the same regarding the arrests of those involved. According to sources, a police officer was martyred, and three other security personnel were injured during the raids. Among those arrested is the alleged Afghan mastermind, affiliated with the banned Islamic State. The raids, based on technical and human intelligence, were conducted in connection with the ongoing investigation to arrest those involved in the Islamabad imambargah suicide bombing, according to the police sources. The raid in Nowshera was conducted in the Hakeemabad area of the district, according to police officials. An official of the Nowshera police said that during a late-night operation, following leads on possible facilitators of the Islamabad suicide bombing, an exchange of fire took place between law enforcement agencies and the suspected militants. “Yes, a raid was conducted in the district, and an exchange of fire took place. An assistant sub-inspector was martyred and a constable sustained injuries in the crossfire,” the police official confirmed. The official, who requested anonymity, added that the raid was conducted as part of an ongoing probe against those involved in the Islamabad suicide bombing and that “it was not Nowshera police alone that took part in the operation”. He, however, refused to share further details. Friday’s attack came less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast. Yesterday’s attack was the deadliest in the capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel.

He added that he would brief the deputy prime minister on this in the coming days, so that foreign missions could update other countries about India’s involvement. “They (India) are now doing it so openly because they know that they cannot beat us in a war,” Naqvi added. “If they have adopted this tactic, then let them. But we will stop this; even if they increase their budget tenfold, it will have no impact,” he asserted. Naqvi further stated that the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) — which was behind a spate of attacks in Balochistan last weekend — created “high-production value” content that was carried by Indian media. “The world has declared BLA a terrorist organisation, but nobody will go there (India) and ask why they are showing the BLA’s content,” Naqvi said. “They create content, carry out incidents and run it on their media. It is a complete system they’ve created,” he said. He added that Indian media was trying to portray the BLA as having captured swathes of land in Pakistan but stated that “not one inch [of land] is under their control”. Talking about the attacks in Balochistan, Naqvi said that no attacker was spared. “They (India) are upset about that. But going forward, we will have a briefing on Balochistan and you will get the details,” he said. “We will continue fighting this war, but the world needs to realise that this is becoming a regional threat,” he warned. “We are doing what we can for our country, but these terrorist bodies are collaborating and jointly operating,” Naqvi added. “The world needs to observe the damage and if this violence goes elsewhere in the world, then it is on other countries to decide on what to do,” he said. Responding to questions from reporters, Naqvi noted that Pakistan had given a befitting response to Indian aggression in May last year, saying, “I think we are responding to them well. They will get a diplomatic answer.” He stated that the attacker came from Afghanistan, with the operation taking place “after an important member of Daesh came here”. Asked about the rank of the Daesh operative, Naqvi said further information would be provided in due course. “We have caught multiple accounts on Twitter being used by terrorists and they are not being shut down,” Naqvi said in response to another question about the use of social media by terrorists. “The government has written to them … but they are not blocked here, so we have taken this up very seriously,” he said. He added, “If they do not do it, we may have to adopt another strategy.” Questioned about security arrangements in Islamabad, Naqvi said that he had a detailed meeting with the Islamabad police today. “We discussed entry points in detail; we have 93 entry points,” the minister replied. “The red zone has separate entry points, and then we discussed the M-tag. Within the coming days, the chief commissioner or Islamabad inspector general will brief you.” Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior also said on the social media platform X and said, “ Based on technical and human intelligence, coordinated raids were conducted in Peshawar and Nowshera districts of KP province, leading to the arrest of four facilitators, including the Afghan ISIS mastermind behind the attack.” “Evidence confirms that planning, training, and indoctrination were carried out in Afghanistan by ISIS. The nexus of terrorism under Afghan Taliban patronage remains a serious threat to regional peace,” it said. “During the conduct of these operations, an official of Law Enforcement Agencies embraced martyrdom and four sustained injuries. Our forces remain resolute; further intelligence-based operations are underway,” it said. Raids in KP Earlier in the day, security sources had also stated the same regarding the arrests of those involved. According to sources, a police officer was martyred, and three other security personnel were injured during the raids. Among those arrested is the alleged Afghan mastermind, affiliated with the banned Islamic State. The raids, based on technical and human intelligence, were conducted in connection with the ongoing investigation to arrest those involved in the Islamabad imambargah suicide bombing, according to the police sources. The raid in Nowshera was conducted in the Hakeemabad area of the district, according to police officials. An official of the Nowshera police said that during a late-night operation, following leads on possible facilitators of the Islamabad suicide bombing, an exchange of fire took place between law enforcement agencies and the suspected militants. “Yes, a raid was conducted in the district, and an exchange of fire took place. An assistant sub-inspector was martyred and a constable sustained injuries in the crossfire,” the police official confirmed. The official, who requested anonymity, added that the raid was conducted as part of an ongoing probe against those involved in the Islamabad suicide bombing and that “it was not Nowshera police alone that took part in the operation”. He, however, refused to share further details. Friday’s attack came less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast. Yesterday’s attack was the deadliest in the capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel.

      "title": "Mastermind of attack on Islamabad imambargah among 4 arrested in KP raids, says Mohsin Naqvi",
      "summary": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday that four facilitators of the suicide attack on an imambargah in Islamabad , including the “main mastermind”, had been arrested during raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He made the remarks while speaking to the media in Islamabad. In his media talk, the interior minister said that operations were underway throughout last night to trace those behind the attack. Making special mention of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the KP police for their joint efforts, he said, “All those people linked to this, and the mastermind, at around 3am, all of them were apprehended.” He lauded all “agencies”, saying that this incident was a “test case”. “After the blast, raids were carried out in Nowshera and Peshawar, in which four facilitators were caught. And their mastermind, who is an Afghan, was also caught,” he said. He said that an assistant sub-inspector of KP police was martyred during the raids, while others were injured. “But the main mastermind is linked to Daesh and is in our custody,” he said, referring to the banned so-called Islamic State. The minister further said that the planning and training for the attack was done by “Daesh Afghanistan” and carried out in the neighbouring country. “We have people who are telling us details about how he (the attacker) went there and how he was trained,” he said. He again lauded law enforcement agencies on the achievement. “We have been saying for a while that whether it be Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Afghan Taliban, Daesh or other kharji terrorist organisations — they are all working together. At this time, 21 terrorist bodies’ setups … name any terrorist body, it is operating from Afghanistan,” he said. The minister further said that he had two requests for the public. “We are in a state of war; be it in Balochistan, KP or elsewhere. The intelligence [from] the community matters the most. When people get to know about an unknown person living in their community, report it to the police — when this system is activated, [terror incidents] will decrease,” he said. “Secondly, I received a message last night from someone asking where the security agencies were and why this incident happened. I can tell you that if one blast happens, 99 others are being foiled,” he said. “I spoke with the agencies and told them that we should share this with the media. It may spread panic but I said that we should share with the media which incidents were foiled,” he said. The interior minister further said that the names of Daesh and Taliban were coming up but “someone was funding them” and giving them targets. “They would get $500 but now they’re getting $1,500. Someone’s increasing their budget,” he said. “I say again with clarity that all of their funding comes from India. India is giving them all the targets; they are planning each and every thing behind the scenes. These organisations are at the front, while India is at the back,” he said. He said that while the world may stay silent for now, it would agree with Pakistan’s stance in the future. Naqvi noted that “nothing happens for free” and that the attack cost money to orchestrate, adding that since May, terrorists’ budgets had increased by three times. “We know about this and it is our duty to take this case to all international platforms,” the interior minister said.
