      "summary_orig": "THE 19th century witnessed a major refinement of policing philosophy. Sir Robert Peel, widely regarded as the father of modern policing, articulated principles that continue to guide democratic police forces. His assertion that “the police are the public, and the public are the police” underlined the idea that police legitimacy flows from public consent rather than coercion. Accountability, restraint, proportionality, and strict adherence to the rule of law were the essential safeguards against the misuse of police power. The evolution of policing thus mirrored the development of the state itself, from coercive authority to regulated power, from force to legitimacy, and from unquestioned command to accountability. While this modern policing model was taking shape in England, the British introduced policing institutions in their newly conquered Indian colony, beginning with Calcutta and Bombay. The uprising of 1857, however, fundamentally altered British priorities. A centralised, Irish-style constabulary was established with the primary objective of control and maintaining order, largely indifferent to public rights. Despite this, the organisational structure itself was built on principles of command and control. Independent Pakistan inherited the colonial police architecture, an efficient law-enforcement machinery designed to control the population rather than to serve it. Tragically, successive political and later military rulers largely assumed the role of colonial masters and failed to undertake meaningful police reform. Despite repeated proclamations of intent, numerous committees and commissions, numbering nearly 30, produced reports that were ultimately unceremoniously consigned to archives. It was only in 2002 that a military ruler, during an initial phase of reformist enthusiasm, enacted a law intended to transform the police from an instrument of enforcement into a service-oriented institution. During the drafting of this law, it was recognised that police strength had expanded in an ad hoc manner to cope with rapid population growth and unplanned urbanisation. The result was an unwieldy colonial police force with vast powers that was becoming increasingly difficult to manage and hold accountable. Multiple police forces need to be established within each province under the existing legal framework. The framers of the law correctly recognised the need for creating additional police forces to ensure effective law enforcement. Political considerations, however, prevented this structural reform. Instead, the proposed law attempted to compensate by introducing concepts of enhanced operational autonomy to the regional commanders and heads of police in the provincial capital cities and large urban police forces. Regrettably, under sustained pressure from political elites, the same military ruler was compelled to dilute this progressive legislation. Core principles of depoliticisation, accountability, and civilian oversight were systematically weakened, restoring, and in some cases deepening, political interference in policing. To address the growing demands of policing an expanding population and chaotic urbanisation, governments resorted to expedient but flawed solutions. Numerous so-called ‘specialised’ units were created outside the formal police structure, complete with standalone police stations and ambiguous lines of accountability. These units were showcased as panaceas for law-and-order problems, but in reality, they generated overlapping mandates. The result was the weakening of a disciplined, uniformed force trained to operate within defined jurisdictions and legal limits, thereby undermining the entire criminal justice system. Specialised units should remain the exception rather than the norm. Their creation must be based strictly on professional needs assessments, embedded within the existing command and control structure. Such units must operate under rigorous oversight and explicit safeguards for fundamental rights. Experience shows that ‘specialised units,’ when allowed to function outside established frameworks, often pursue narrowly defined objectives at the expense of the rule of law. Their prolonged existence fosters impunity, encourages lawlessness and violence, and risks dehumanising their members and turning them into ‘rogue cops.’ For meaningful, sustainable structural police reform, there is a compelling case for smaller and more manageable police jurisdictions. Today, Punjab has a police force of approximately 224,000 personnel, Sindh 160,000, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 125,000, and Balochistan 48,000. It is against all principles of efficient management for armed police forces of this size to be placed under single provincial commanders. Attempts within the existing hierarchy to create empowered urban and regional commands failed because the Police Order 2002 was never implemented in its true spirit and was subsequently rendered ineffective through amendments negating accountability, oversight, autonomy and service. In these circumstances, there is no viable alternative but to establish multiple police forces within each province under the existing legal framework, with no single force exceeding 50,000 personnel. The Central Police Office should be reconstituted as a Provincial Police Directorate, headed by a director general drawn from the senior police leadership. The directorate would be responsible for province-wide coordination, training, standardisation of equipment and transport, and the formulation of uniform operational procedures, supported by a robust system of monitoring and evaluation. Commanders of the newly constituted police forces must be granted guaranteed tenures, enabling them to exercise lawful authority, resist illegal external interference, and provide professional, field-oriented leadership. This framework would enhance efficiency, transparency, and operational effectiveness, while progressively reducing reliance on paramilitary forces for routine policing and emergency response. At the same time, these police forces would remain subject to strong civilian oversight and continuous professional supervision through the Provincial Police Directorate. This reorganisation is achievable within the existing provincial governance framework, without engaging in the politically sensitive issue of creating new provinces. It must, however, be acknowledged as an interim arrangement. Durable and optimal governance can ultimately be achieved only through smaller, empowered, and autonomous provinces. The sooner this reality is confronted, the better for democratic governance and effective policing. The writer is a former IGP Sindh. Published in Dawn, December 27th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Archaeologists carry out excavation at Bhir Mound remains on Friday.—Dawn • Evidence pushes civilisation timeline beyond 6th century BC • Uncovered ruins reveal advanced streets and drainage systems • Pottery, seals, other items indicate thriving commerce before arrival of Greeks TAXILA: An excavation team working at the ancient remains of Bhir Mound, recognised as the first city of the Taxila Civilisation, has made a major archaeological breakthrough, uncovering compelling evidence of a well-organised urban settlement that predates the sixth century BC. This significant discovery holds the potential to rewrite the early history of civilisation in the region, suggesting that Taxila was a thriving city centuries earlier than scholars previously belie­ved, existing even before the emergence of Achaemenid or Greek influence. Mr Dogar described the current discovery as one of the most important in recent decades. He said the evidence confirms Taxila’s role was not merely that of a centre of learning or military activity, but as a fully developed urban civilisation that flourished in the region’s earliest historical phases. Officials from the Punjab Department of Archaeology, who are currently conducting the extensive excavation at the ancient site, told Dawn on Friday that the newly unearthed remains point definitively to continuous human habitation. The findings reveal a sophisticated civic structure, placing Taxila among the earliest known urban centres of South Asia. Archaeologists at the site have uncovered specific remnants such as stone and mud-brick walls, carefully planned stre­­et and an advanced drainage system. These structural findings clearly indicates an organised and forward-looking society. Aasim Dogar, the deputy director of the Punjab Department of Archaeology, said that the current evidence points towards a much older timeline than traditional historical accounts suggest. “Evidence of second century, fourth century and sixth century culture de­­p­o­sits are found, and the further deep tre­n­­ch may lead to discovery beyond the sixth century,” Mr Dogar said. He explained that pushing deeper into the stratigraphy may rewrite the history of the first city of Taxila beyond the sixth century BC, creating a historical profile “resembling it to Harappa and Gandhara grave culture”. Beyond the structural discoveries, a significant number of physical artifacts have been recovered from the site. Mr Dogar revealed that the team has found finely crafted pottery bearing int­ricate designs, ancient coins, and seals dating back to the second century B.C. These items reflect established trade networks and include stone and metal tools used in construction and daily life. These findings collectively demonstrate that the settlement supported a complex social and economic system long before the period traditionally associated with Taxila’s rise. Mr Dogar noted that the site flourished during the periods of Achae­m­e­nid, Greek, and Mauryan influence and was occupied at the time of Alexander the Great’s arrival in 326 BC. The deputy director provided a detai­led history of the exploration at Bhir Mou­­nd to contextualise the current success. He noted that the first extensive archaeological investigations were conducted by Sir John Marshall between 1918 and 1934, work that formed the basis for the original chronological and cultural interpretation of the site. A later excavation was led by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1944-1945. According to Mr Dogar, Wheeler focused on stratigraphic clarification and introduced modern excavation techniques to the region. These methods heavily influenced subsequent archaeological work in Pakistan. After a hiatus of nearly two decades, renewed archaeological work is now being carried out by the Punjab Department of Archaeology.. Mr Dogar believes the breakthrough will draw international scholarly attention and significantly enhance Taxila’s standing on the global archaeological map. Mr Dogar said that for the first time in excavations in Taxila, the latest Japanese and Chinese software and hardware technology are being utilised. This includes advanced GPS technology and scanners, alongside the geo-mapping of the city through the use of drone technology. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Mr Dogar said. “There are likely many more layers of history buried beneath Bhir Mound waiting to be uncovered.” Published in Dawn, December 27th, 2025",

JERUSALEM: An Israeli reservist soldier rammed his vehicle into a Palestinian man as he prayed on a roadside in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, after earlier firing shots in the area, the Israeli military said. “Footage was received of an armed individual running over a Palestinian individual,” it said in a statement, adding the individual was a reservist and his military service had been terminated. The reservist acted “in severe violation of his authority” and his weapon had been confiscated, the military said. Israeli media reported that he was being held under house arrest. The Israeli police did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Palestinian man went to hospital for checks after the attack, but was unhurt and is now at home. Video which aired on Palestinian TV and was verified by Reuters shows a man in civilian clothing with a gun slung over his shoulder driving an off-road vehicle into a man praying on the side of the road. This year was one of the most violent on record for Israeli civilian attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to United Nations data that shows more than 750 injuries. More than a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 7, 2023 and October 17, 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, according to the UN In the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks. On Friday, a Palestinian assailant killed two people in northern Israel, police said. Published in Dawn, December 27th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Despite PM’s renewed offer of dialogue, no formal contact has been made with the PTI • Politicos view latest offer as ‘earnest’; say it cannot have come without Pindi’s consent DESPITE Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s renewed offer of national dialogue , apparently directed at the main opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), no concrete steps have so far been taken by the government to initiate a formal talks process. On the other hand, PTI leaders say they are waiting for the government to make the first move and establish contact to begin negotiations. Meanwhile, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — a coalition of opposition parties of which PTI is an essential component — has welcomed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent invitation for talks. Against this backdrop, PTI’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan appears to lack visible international support, either for his release or for opening a channel of dialogue with the rulers. When contacted, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed that no serious effort had been made. “Not yet. Haven’t witnessed any progress,” he said, responding to a question about efforts to initiate talks. Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah stressed that PM Shehbaz would decide on talks with PTI once the opposition party clarifies its stance on negotiations. “Maybe once they clarify their position, they can respond to the PM’s invite,” Mr Sanaullah said while speaking to Geo News on Friday. “The offer was directly initiated by the PM. Their (the PTI’s) response, which the media finds complicated, has been received. Once we get clarification from them, the PM will make a decision, either forming a committee or meeting with them directly,” he said. There is a perception in political circles that the government’s dialogue offer was made in earnest and “is desired by the establishment”. A senior PPP leader, who did not want to be named, said the prime minister would not have extended an offer of talks without the consent of “Rawalpindi”. He suggested that recent international developments, which he said led to praise for Pakistan’s civil-military leadership, indicated that Western powers might be seeking Islamabad’s support for “something big”. He added that these powers might believe that political stability in Pakistan was imperative for achieving such objectives. On the question of foreign support for Imran Khan, he said the PTI founder did have some backing abroad. Responding to the observation that the government had not yet reached out to PTI, the PPP leader said that in such situations, parties rarely move directly to the negotiating table. “Otherwise, it weakens each other’s stance,” he said, adding that back-channel contacts were often employed in such circumstances and could already be in play. Imran vs Zulfikar vs Nawaz Political analysts say Imran Khan’s situation was quite different from that faced by former prime ministers Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif during their respective periods of imprisonment. They recalled that when Gen Ziaul Haq overthrew Mr Bhutto and the latter faced execution in 1979, several international leaders — including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, King Khalid of Saudi Arabia and Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi — appealed for clemency, but Gen Zia turned down all those requests. Similarly, Nawaz Sharif began a period of exile in Saudi Arabia in 2000 after being released from prison by the military regime of Gen Pervez Musharraf. His life sentence was commuted following an agreement brokered with the Saudi royal family, which acted as guarantor that Mr Sharif would stay in Saudi Arabia for 10 years and not return to Pakistan during that period. Analysts argue that no such international effort has emerged in Imran Khan’s case, mainly because he allegedly failed to maintain cordial relations, even with states traditionally seen as friends of Pakistan. ‘Support is coming’ Speaking to Dawn, PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Amir Dogar, said the government had so far made no contact with the opposition for negotiations. He said the government’s attitude towards PTI did not coincide with the prime minister’s public statements on dialogue. “If they are serious, they must allow relatives and friends of Imran Khan to meet him in jail and release elderly PTI leaders who were sent behind bars three years ago,” he said. Asked whether Imran Khan had received support from abroad, Mr Dogar declined to provide details but said, “Support is coming.” He added that Mr Khan was not ready to go into exile and was determined to face his cases. “He was offered to go abroad, not for 10 years but for five. But he refused.” Mr Dogar claimed. Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), said TTAP had responded positively to the prime minister’s offer, but described Imran Khan’s apparent stance as indecisive. “We have seen in the past that Imran Khan allowed his party leaders to hold talks with the government but later refused to accept what his team had agreed,” he said, referring to previous negotiation attempts. Mr Mehboob also noted that while opposition parties welcomed the dialogue offer, Imran Khan had simultaneously called for countrywide protests on Feb 8. He stressed the need for both sides to open back-door channels to create space for formal talks. Published in Dawn, December 27th, 2025",

The remarks by Haqqani are significant in that the TTP owes its allegiance to him and has been operating from areas in Afghanistan that have been under his control since long.

      "title_orig": "Pakistan summons UK high commissioner after ‘provocative’ Bradford demonstration",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday summoned the United Kingdom’s acting high commissioner in connection with a protest outside the Pakistani consulate in Bradford, where “provocative” statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership. FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the acting UK high commissioner was summoned and issued a démarche. “The demarche was issued after provocative statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership from British soil,” the FO spokesperson said. The FO urged the UK to “hold responsible elements accountable in accordance with the law”. Earlier, two ministers of state from the PML-N said that the Pakistan government had written a letter to the UK authorities, seeking action over “inciteful” statements, particularly in reference to a video that was circulating on social media. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani confirmed that development to Geo News , with the latter particularly mentioning that “the head of armed forces was threatened” in the video. Kayani also mentioned the opposition PTI’s involvement in the matter, naming the party, which Chaudhry didn’t. In the video, a woman appears to be wishing ill on a person without taking any name, saying that they should be “blown up in a car”. The woman can be seen surrounded by people holding PTI flags. When asked about the video, Chaudhry said, “Pakistan has formally written to the UK, expecting them to act according to their laws and justice system.“ He maintained that Pakistan had the right to take legal action against those “targeting its institutions”. Chaudhry recalled that there had been complaints before as well regarding the “use of social media platforms to incite hatred against state institutions and political figures”. “The footage of the incident is available,” he added, referring to the video being discussed. He added, “This is not a political matter, nor one pertaining to the freedom of speech.” It was a clear violation of international law and the UK law, he said, particularly mentioning the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006. “Every state is responsible for ensuring its citizens, or those who have taken asylum, or those residing there, don’t act to incite rebellion or violence against other sovereign states,” he stressed. Chaudhry further noted: “What’s concerning is the specific mention of a car bomb blast, making it a targeted issue; it is not something generalised, it seems to be carefully planned.“ “Pakistan has raised these concerns,” he said. “It appears as if there is a larger plan involved, and Pakistan has raised these concerns,” Chaudhry said. He maintained that “inciting terrorism or provoking people was not akin to freedom of expression”. “You can not have people in one state promoting terrorism against another sovereign state,” he reiterated. He hoped that the British government would take action, adding that in case of non-compliance, “Pakistan has other options as well“. Minister of State for Finance Kayani termed the incident shown in the video “unacceptable” and “unfortunate”. “We have repeatedly said that PTI spreads violence and threats under the guise of politics, justifies threats, and misuses freedom of speech,” Kayani said. He added that the party had “crossed a limit” by “threatening the armed forces’ chief with murder under the guise of political protest”. “That’s not politics[..] it’s unacceptable,” he said. He termed PTI a “national security threat”, alleging that it had always used politics to cover for “violence”. “Whether on May 9, using KP police to attack soldiers, and threatening the army chief […] if that’s not a national security threat, what is?” he said. In response to a question on whether the Pakistani government would take action in the matter, he said, “First, we will urge the UK government to take immediate legal action and investigate the matter”. However, he added that the government was open to “exploring other legal options”. Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had said that the government would repatriate from the UK those (YouTubers) involved in targeting the state institutions. When asked about criticism directed towards the army chief, Naqvi had said: “The state is clear. We will not spare them.“ On Dec 4, the interior minister, in a meeting with the UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott, submitted extradition papers for former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja, who Naqvi said were involved in spreading “anti-Pakistan propaganda” online.",

      "summary_en": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday summoned the United Kingdom’s acting high commissioner in connection with a protest outside the Pakistani consulate in Bradford, where “provocative” statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership. FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the acting UK high commissioner was summoned and issued a démarche. “The demarche was issued after provocative statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership from British soil,” the FO spokesperson said. The FO urged the UK to “hold responsible elements accountable in accordance with the law”. Earlier, two ministers of state from the PML-N said that the Pakistan government had written a letter to the UK authorities, seeking action over “inciteful” statements, particularly in reference to a video that was circulating on social media. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani confirmed that development to Geo News , with the latter particularly mentioning that “the head of armed forces was threatened” in the video. Kayani also mentioned the opposition PTI’s involvement in the matter, naming the party, which Chaudhry didn’t. In the video, a woman appears to be wishing ill on a person without taking any name, saying that they should be “blown up in a car”. The woman can be seen surrounded by people holding PTI flags. When asked about the video, Chaudhry said, “Pakistan has formally written to the UK, expecting them to act according to their laws and justice system.“ He maintained that Pakistan had the right to take legal action against those “targeting its institutions”. Chaudhry recalled that there had been complaints before as well regarding the “use of social media platforms to incite hatred against state institutions and political figures”. “The footage of the incident is available,” he added, referring to the video being discussed. He added, “This is not a political matter, nor one pertaining to the freedom of speech.” It was a clear violation of international law and the UK law, he said, particularly mentioning the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006. “Every state is responsible for ensuring its citizens, or those who have taken asylum, or those residing there, don’t act to incite rebellion or violence against other sovereign states,” he stressed. Chaudhry further noted: “What’s concerning is the specific mention of a car bomb blast, making it a targeted issue; it is not something generalised, it seems to be carefully planned.“ “Pakistan has raised these concerns,” he said. “It appears as if there is a larger plan involved, and Pakistan has raised these concerns,” Chaudhry said. He maintained that “inciting terrorism or provoking people was not akin to freedom of expression”. “You can not have people in one state promoting terrorism against another sovereign state,” he reiterated. He hoped that the British government would take action, adding that in case of non-compliance, “Pakistan has other options as well“. Minister of State for Finance Kayani termed the incident shown in the video “unacceptable” and “unfortunate”. “We have repeatedly said that PTI spreads violence and threats under the guise of politics, justifies threats, and misuses freedom of speech,” Kayani said.

      "title_orig": "Nigeria signals more strikes likely in ‘joint’ US operations",
      "summary_orig": "Nigeria on Friday signaled that more strikes against terrorist groups were expected after a Christmas Day bombardment by US forces against militants in the north of the country, which it said was a joint operation with its military. The west African country faces multiple interlinked security crises, with terrorists waging an insurgency in the northeast since 2009 and armed “bandit” gangs raiding villages and staging kidnappings in the northwest. The strikes came after Abuja and Washington were locked in a diplomatic dispute over what US President Donald Trump has characterised as the mass killing of Christians amid Nigeria’s myriad armed conflicts. A Pentagon official told AFP that “the Department of War worked with the government of Nigeria to carry out these strikes” and that they “were approved by the government of Nigeria”, without saying whether Nigeria’s military had been involved. US defence officials later posted a video of what appeared to be a nighttime missile launch from the deck of a battleship flying the US flag. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s military said in a statement that its forces, “in conjunction with the United States”, had conducted “precision strike operations”. Both countries said the strikes targeted militants linked to the Islamic State group, without providing details. Washington’s framing of the violence in Nigeria as amounting to Christian “persecution” is rejected by the Nigerian government and independent analysts, but has nonetheless resulted in increased security coordination. “It’s Nigeria that provided the intelligence,” the country’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, told broadcaster Channels TV, saying he was on the phone with US State Secretary Marco Rubio ahead of the bombardment. Asked if there would be more strikes, Tuggar said: “It is an ongoing thing, and we are working with the US. We are working with other countries as well.” Targets unclear The Department of War’s US Africa Command said “multiple ISIS terrorists” were killed in an attack in the northwestern state of Sokoto. Residents in the far-flung villages of that state told AFP they were shocked by the blasts. The strikes hit multiple locations, including a town that residents said was not a militant stronghold. Which of Nigeria’s myriad, and well-documented, armed groups were targeted remains unclear. Nigeria’s terrorist groups are mostly concentrated in the northeast, but have made inroads into the northwest. Researchers have recently linked some members of an armed group known as Lakurawa — the main terrorist group located in Sokoto State — to Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP), which is mostly active in neighbouring Niger and Mali. Other analysts have disputed those links, and research on Lakurawa is complicated as the term has been used to describe various armed fighters in the northwest. “We initially thought it was (an) attack by Lakurawa,” said Haruna Kallah, a resident of Jabo town. That the explosions were in fact the result of a US strike “surprised us because this area has never been a Lakurawa enclave, and we have never had any attacks in the last two years.” Tukur Shehu, a resident of Tangaza, a neighbouring district, said two strikes targeted Warriya and Alkassim villages — known to house Lakurawa camps, from where they launch attacks and keep hostages. Public opinion divided Public opinion on the surprise strikes was split. “America has made its way by force in our country, to kill our people,” said Sulaiman Ibrahim, an imam in Lagos. Emmanuel Udoh, a member of the clergy at Living Faith Church, told AFP : “We are grateful with what the US has done. We are grateful with what the Nigerian government is trying to do.” While the Nigerian government has welcomed the strikes, “I think Trump would not have accepted a ‘No,’” said Malik Samuel, an Abuja-based researcher for Good Governance Africa, an NGO. Security analyst Brant Philip called the timing, on Christmas Day, “a symbolic start to official US operations in Nigeria”, adding: “The operational results of the strikes are not significant, but much is expected soon.” Tuggar said that Nigerian President Bola Tinubu “gave the go-ahead” for the strikes. The foreign minister added: “It must be made clear that it is a joint operation, and it is not targeting any religion nor simply in the name of one religion or the other.“",

Heba Muraisi, 31, who is at HMP New Hall, joined the pair on 3 November. The group also includes Teuta Hoxha, 29, Kamran Ahmed, 28, and Lewie Chiaramello, 22, who is refusing food every other day because he has diabetes. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "An explosion killed at least eight worshippers at a mosque in a predominantly Alawite area of Syria’s Homs on Friday, state media said. The attack during Friday prayers is the latest on the Alawite community, and the second blast in a place of worship since extremist authorities took power a year ago, after a suicide bombing in a Damascus church killed 25 people in June. In a statement on Telegram, terrorist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunna said its fighters “detonated a number of explosive devices” in the Imam Ali Bin Abi Talib Mosque in the central Syrian city. The group formed after the ouster last year of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, himself a member of the Alawite community, and had claimed responsibility for the June church bombing, though authorities blamed the militant Islamic State group. State news agency SANA reported an explosion in the mosque in Homs’s Wadi al-Dahab neighbourhood and gave a preliminary toll of at least eight dead and 18 wounded, citing a health ministry official. An AFP photographer saw security forces cordoning off the area around the mosque while inside, personnel stood guard as red tape encircled the blackened, debris-strewn corner where the blast went off. Usama Ibrahim, 47, who was being treated in hospital for shrapnel wounds to his head and back, said he was at Friday prayers when he heard a loud explosion. “The world turned red… and I fell to the ground. Then I saw blood flowing from my head,” he told AFP . ‘Shrapnel all around’ Syria’s interior ministry said in a statement that “a terrorist explosion” targeted the mosque and that authorities had “begun investigating and collecting evidence to pursue the perpetrators of this criminal act”. SANA quoted a security source as saying that initial investigations indicated that “explosive devices planted inside the mosque” caused the blast. As victims’ families gathered at the hospital, wounded bookseller Ghadi Maarouf, 38, told AFP that the explosion occurred “just before the imam was to ascend the minbar to deliver the sermon”, referring to the imam’s raised platform. “It was a huge explosion, and I saw shrapnel flying all around me,” said Maarouf, whose leg was wounded in the blast. Syria’s foreign ministry condemned a “cowardly criminal act”, saying it came “in the context of repeated desperate attempts to undermine security and stability and spread chaos among the Syrian people”. The ministry statement reiterated its “firm stance in combating terrorism in all its forms”, vowing to hold the attackers accountable. Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan condemned the attack. Since Assad’s fall, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor and Homs province residents have reported kidnappings and killings targeting members of the minority community, while the country has seen several bloody sectarian episodes. Detainees released Syria’s coastal areas saw the massacre of Alawite civilians in March, with authorities accusing armed Assad supporters of sparking the violence by attacking security forces. A national commission of inquiry said at least 1,426 members of the minority were killed, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor put the toll at more than 1,700. Late last month, thousands of people demonstrated on the coast in protest at fresh attacks targeting Alawites in Homs and other regions. Before and after the March bloodshed, authorities carried out a massive arrest campaign in predominantly Alawite areas, which are also former Assad strongholds. On Friday, Syrian state television reported the release of 70 detainees in the coastal city of Latakia “after it was proven that they were not involved in war crimes”, saying more releases would follow. Despite assurances from Damascus that all Syria’s communities will be protected, the country’s minorities remain largely wary of their future under the new authorities. In July, sectarian clashes in southern Syria’s Druze-majority Sweida province saw more than 2,000 people killed , including hundreds of Druze civilians who the Observatory said were “summarily executed by defence and interior ministry personnel”. In a speech this month marking a year since the fall of Assad, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa emphasised the importance of all Syrians unifying efforts to “to build a strong Syria”. Despite major achievements in relaunching Syria’s foreign standing, Sharaa faces the major domestic challenge of maintaining security and unity nationwide.",

      "summary": "An explosion killed at least eight worshippers at a mosque in a predominantly Alawite area of Syria’s Homs on Friday, state media said. The attack during Friday prayers is the latest on the Alawite community, and the second blast in a place of worship since extremist authorities took power a year ago, after a suicide bombing in a Damascus church killed 25 people in June. In a statement on Telegram, terrorist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunna said its fighters “detonated a number of explosive devices” in the Imam Ali Bin Abi Talib Mosque in the central Syrian city. The group formed after the ouster last year of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, himself a member of the Alawite community, and had claimed responsibility for the June church bombing, though authorities blamed the militant Islamic State group. State news agency SANA reported an explosion in the mosque in Homs’s Wadi al-Dahab neighbourhood and gave a preliminary toll of at least eight dead and 18 wounded, citing a health ministry official. An AFP photographer saw security forces cordoning off the area around the mosque while inside, personnel stood guard as red tape encircled the blackened, debris-strewn corner where the blast went off. Usama Ibrahim, 47, who was being treated in hospital for shrapnel wounds to his head and back, said he was at Friday prayers when he heard a loud explosion. “The world turned red… and I fell to the ground. Then I saw blood flowing from my head,” he told AFP . ‘Shrapnel all around’ Syria’s interior ministry said in a statement that “a terrorist explosion” targeted the mosque and that authorities had “begun investigating and collecting evidence to pursue the perpetrators of this criminal act”. SANA quoted a security source as saying that initial investigations indicated that “explosive devices planted inside the mosque” caused the blast. As victims’ families gathered at the hospital, wounded bookseller Ghadi Maarouf, 38, told AFP that the explosion occurred “just before the imam was to ascend the minbar to deliver the sermon”, referring to the imam’s raised platform. “It was a huge explosion, and I saw shrapnel flying all around me,” said Maarouf, whose leg was wounded in the blast. Syria’s foreign ministry condemned a “cowardly criminal act”, saying it came “in the context of repeated desperate attempts to undermine security and stability and spread chaos among the Syrian people”. The ministry statement reiterated its “firm stance in combating terrorism in all its forms”, vowing to hold the attackers accountable. Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan condemned the attack. Since Assad’s fall, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor and Homs province residents have reported kidnappings and killings targeting members of the minority community, while the country has seen several bloody sectarian episodes. Detainees released Syria’s coastal areas saw the massacre of Alawite civilians in March, with authorities accusing armed Assad supporters of sparking the violence by attacking security forces. A national commission of inquiry said at least 1,426 members of the minority were killed, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor put the toll at more than 1,700. Late last month, thousands of people demonstrated on the coast in protest at fresh attacks targeting Alawites in Homs and other regions. Before and after the March bloodshed, authorities carried out a massive arrest campaign in predominantly Alawite areas, which are also former Assad strongholds. On Friday, Syrian state television reported the release of 70 detainees in the coastal city of Latakia “after it was proven that they were not involved in war crimes”, saying more releases would follow. Despite assurances from Damascus that all Syria’s communities will be protected, the country’s minorities remain largely wary of their future under the new authorities. In July, sectarian clashes in southern Syria’s Druze-majority Sweida province saw more than 2,000 people killed , including hundreds of Druze civilians who the Observatory said were “summarily executed by defence and interior ministry personnel”. In a speech this month marking a year since the fall of Assad, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa emphasised the importance of all Syrians unifying efforts to “to build a strong Syria”. Despite major achievements in relaunching Syria’s foreign standing, Sharaa faces the major domestic challenge of maintaining security and unity nationwide.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: At least six terrorists were killed and several others injured on Friday in a clash between police forces, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) commandos and armed locals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat. “The terrorists armed with sniper rifles and quadcopters attacked the police in the rural area bordering Bannu district and located within the limits of Shaheed Asmatullah Khan Khattak police station of Serai Naurang town,“ said a police statement. “The attack triggered a fierce gun battle as the law enforcers returned the fire effectively,” it said. As per the release, the terrorists also targeted the “houses of villagers with quadcopter strikes”, resulting in “civilian casualties”. Although the official press release did not provide any details about police casualties, it stated that “during the armed clash, the law enforcers eliminated six terrorists and several of their accomplices were injured”. “The casualties occurred as a result of explosive payload released by the quadcopters.” Meanwhile, Additional Deputy Commissioner Habibullah Wazir, who visited the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Serai Naurang town, told media persons that ten injured had been brought to the hospital so far. “Some injured have been referred to a hospital in Bannu while others were in stable condition,” he said. “The district administration has declared an emergency at the THQ Hospital as all doctors and paramedics have been called to duty,“ he maintained, adding that doctors, along with a sufficient quantity of medicines, are available and standard treatment facilities are being provided to the injured people. The hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr Ishaq, also confirmed that they had received “ten injured so far and three of them had been referred to a hospital in Bannu owing to their critical condition”. The situation was tense, and security had been tightened in the remote rural area on the special instructions of Regional Police Officer (RPO) Bannu Sajjad Khan. “The RPO and Lakki Marwat DPO Nazir Khan are supervising the operation against Fitna al Khawarij terrorists as a large police contingent backed by the CTD personnel and volunteers of peace committees are present in the area,” added the release. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. It continued that the law enforcers had surrounded the entire area and a search and clearance operation was underway, while additional forces had also been put on “high alert” to counter any untoward eventuality. “Police will continue operations against the terrorists and anti-peace elements to establish lasting peace in the region and protect people’s lives and properties,” the RPO affirmed. Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Zulfiqar Hameed also praised the Bannu police and CTD for the successful operation against the terrorists. “Such successful actions against terrorists would be further accelerated for the protection of public life and regional peace,” he stated. A terrorist commander was also killed in an exchange of fire with police and a CTD team in the Wanda Amir area of Lakki Marwat on Thursday. On the same day, two wanted suspects, one of them wanted by the Punjab police, were arrested during a targeted operation in the district. Earlier, the security forces and police had destroyed several hideouts of terrorists during an operation in the Bettani subdivision of Lakki Marwat district on Tuesday. Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022.",

      "summary_orig": "Fresh from a widely-celebrated U-19 Asia Cup triumph, skipper of the Pakistan youth team Farhan Yousaf wants his side to show humility as they take on Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in the tri-series that starts in Harare on Saturday. The series will act as a warm-up for the teams ahead of the U-19 World Cup, which is set to be held from January 15 in Zimbabwe and Namibia. Pakistan won the U-19 Asia Cup title after beating an unbeaten India side by 191 runs in the final last week — the achievement sparking raucous celebrations back home with the national youth squad welcomed by a huge crowd at the Islamabad International Airport. The decider saw Pakistan opener Sameer Minhas smash a scintillating 172 and pacer Ali Raza routing the Indian batting line-up with a four-wicket show under the mentorship of former national skipper Sarfraz Ahmed. The achievement added star value to the Pakistan U-19 team, raising expectations ahead of the tri-series and the World Cup, but for Farhan, it is about focusing on what he believes are brand new assignments. “The past is in the past, this is a new journey and a new chapter and we are preparing for it accordingly,” he said in a statement issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday. “The Asia Cup was a good win for us and the players showed great morale and intensity. “The players are confident and excited as we head into the tri-series.” Pakistan will take on Afghanistan in the tri-series opener at the Harare Sports Club before playing hosts Zimbabwe at the Prince Edward School in the capital on Dec 29. The national side will clash against Afghanistan in the reverse fixture at the Sunrise Sports Club in Harare on Jan 2 and their last round-robin match, against Zimbabwe will be played on Jan 4. The tri-series final is set to be hosted by the Harare Sports Club on Jan 6. “Both teams in the tournament are strong and competitive and we respect every opposition as we look forward to a competitive event,” said Farhan. The tri-series provides a valuable opportunity for all three sides to prepare for the U-19 World Cup, set to run until Feb 6. Pakistan are placed in Group ‘C’ and will play their group-stage matches in Harare from Jan 16-22. The Super Six stage will take place from Jan 25 to Feb 1, followed by the semi-finals on Feb 3 and 4. The final of the 16-team tournament will be played at the Harare Sports Club on Feb 6. Pakistan held their first training session on Friday ahead of their first tri-series match. “The tri-series is very important for the players and will help us find the right combinations ahead of the U-19 World Cup,” Farhan noted. “The conditions here are similar and will be beneficial for our World Cup preparations.” Pakistan U-19 squad: Farhan Yousaf (captain), Usman Khan (vice-captain), Abdul Subhan, Ahmed Hussain, Ali Hasan Baloch, Ali Raza, Daniyal Ali Khan, Hamza Zahoor (wicket-keeper), Huzaifa Ahsan, Momin Qamar, Mohammad Sayyam, Mohammad Shayan (wicket-keeper), Niqab Shafiq, Sameer Minhas, Umar Zaib",

The achievement added star value to the Pakistan U-19 team, raising expectations ahead of the tri-series and the World Cup, but for Farhan, it is about focusing on what he believes are brand new assignments. “The past is in the past, this is a new journey and a new chapter and we are preparing for it accordingly,” he said in a statement issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday. “The Asia Cup was a good win for us and the players showed great morale and intensity. “The players are confident and excited as we head into the tri-series.” Pakistan will take on Afghanistan in the tri-series opener at the Harare Sports Club before playing hosts Zimbabwe at the Prince Edward School in the capital on Dec 29. The national side will clash against Afghanistan in the reverse fixture at the Sunrise Sports Club in Harare on Jan 2 and their last round-robin match, against Zimbabwe will be played on Jan 4. The tri-series final is set to be hosted by the Harare Sports Club on Jan 6. “Both teams in the tournament are strong and competitive and we respect every opposition as we look forward to a competitive event,” said Farhan. The tri-series provides a valuable opportunity for all three sides to prepare for the U-19 World Cup, set to run until Feb 6. Pakistan are placed in Group ‘C’ and will play their group-stage matches in Harare from Jan 16-22. The Super Six stage will take place from Jan 25 to Feb 1, followed by the semi-finals on Feb 3 and 4. The final of the 16-team tournament will be played at the Harare Sports Club on Feb 6. Pakistan held their first training session on Friday ahead of their first tri-series match. “The tri-series is very important for the players and will help us find the right combinations ahead of the U-19 World Cup,” Farhan noted. “The conditions here are similar and will be beneficial for our World Cup preparations.” Pakistan U-19 squad: Farhan Yousaf (captain), Usman Khan (vice-captain), Abdul Subhan, Ahmed Hussain, Ali Hasan Baloch, Ali Raza, Daniyal Ali Khan, Hamza Zahoor (wicket-keeper), Huzaifa Ahsan, Momin Qamar, Mohammad Sayyam, Mohammad Shayan (wicket-keeper), Niqab Shafiq, Sameer Minhas, Umar Zaib",

      "summary": "Fresh from a widely-celebrated U-19 Asia Cup triumph, skipper of the Pakistan youth team Farhan Yousaf wants his side to show humility as they take on Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in the tri-series that starts in Harare on Saturday.

      "summary_orig": "President Donald Trump said US forces conducted “powerful and deadly” strikes on Thursday against Islamic State (IS) militants in northwestern Nigeria, weeks after he warned against any systemic assault on Christians in the country. The Nigerian foreign ministry early on Friday confirmed the air strikes, describing them as “precision hits on terrorist targets” in the country. The Department of Defence’s US Africa Command said “multiple ISIS terrorists” were killed in an attack in Sokoto state conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities, but few details were provided and it was not clear how many people died. The strikes hit IS targets on Christmas Day, according to Trump. View this post on Instagram “I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “May God Bless our Military,” he said, adding provocatively, “MERRY CHRISTMAS to all, including the dead Terrorists, of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues.” The attacks mark the first by US forces in Nigeria under Trump, and come after the Republican leader unexpectedly berated the west African nation in October and November, saying Christians there faced an “existential threat” that amounted to “genocide” amid Nigeria’s myriad armed conflicts. That diplomatic offensive was welcomed by some but interpreted by others as inflaming religious tensions in Africa’s most populous country, which has seen bouts of sectarian violence in the past. Nigeria’s government and independent analysts reject framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution — a narrative long used by the Christian right in the United States and Europe. But Trump, spotlighting what his administration says is global persecution of Christians, stressed last month that Washington was ready to take military action in Nigeria — with “guns-a-blazing” — to counter such killings. ‘Grateful’ for cooperation The Nigerian foreign ministry said the country was engaged with international partners against terrorism. “Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorism and violent extremism,” the ministry said in a statement on Friday. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth took to X to say he was “grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation.” The United States this year placed Nigeria back on the list of countries of “particular concern” regarding religious freedom, and has restricted the issuance of visas to Nigerians. Trump last month also threatened to stop all aid to Abuja if it “continues to allow the killing of Christians“. Nigeria is almost evenly divided between a Muslim-majority north and largely Christian south. Its northeast has been in the grip of violence for more than 15 years by the Boko Haram group, which has claimed more than 40,000 lives and displaced two million people. At the same time, large parts of the country’s northwest, north and centre have been hit by criminal gangs known as “bandits” who attack villages, killing and kidnapping residents. On Wednesday, an explosion ripped through a mosque in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, killing at least seven worshippers. No armed groups immediately claimed responsibility.",

      "summary_orig": "Fourteen people were injured in a stabbing attack in a factory in central Japan during which an unspecified liquid was also sprayed, an emergency services official said on Friday. “Fourteen people are subject to transportation by emergency services,” Tomoharu Sugiyama, a firefighting department official in the city of Mishima in the Shizuoka region, told AFP . He said a call was received at about 4.30pm (12:30pm PKT) from a nearby rubber factory saying “five or six people were stabbed by someone” and that a “spray-like liquid” had also been used. Japanese media, including public broadcaster NHK , reported that police had arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder. The seriousness of the injuries was unknown, although NHK said all victims remained conscious. Sugiyama said at least six of the 14 victims had been sent to a hospital in a fleet of ambulances. The exact nature of the injuries was also unclear. The factory in Mishima is run by Yokohama Rubber Co., whose business includes manufacturing tyres for trucks and buses, according to its corporate website. Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan, which has a low murder rate and some of the world’s toughest gun laws. However, there are occasional stabbing attacks and even shootings, including the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022. A Japanese man was sentenced to death in October for a shooting and stabbing rampage that killed four people, including two police officers, in 2023. A 43-year-old man was also charged with attempted murder in May over a knife attack at Tokyo’s Toda-mae metro station.",

      "summary_orig": "Five people were killed in an armed clash on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Tajik state media said on Thursday. Citing a statement by the Border Troops of the Tajik State Committee for National Security, state news agency Khovar reported that three people crossed into the country late on Tuesday in the Shamsiddin Shohin district of the country’s southwestern Khatlon region, and were later located on Wednesday. “The terrorists refused to obey orders from Tajik border guards to surrender and offered armed resistance. They intended to carry out an armed attack on one of the border posts of the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan,” the statement said. “As a result of the combat operation, all three terrorists were neutralised,” the statement said, adding that two Tajik border officers were killed during the clashes. According to the statement, this was the third “armed attack, terrorist act, and border crossing” from Afghanistan in the past month. It also accused the Afghan government of “demonstrating serious and repeated irresponsibility and non-commitment in fulfilling its international obligations and consistent promises to ensure security and stability” on the Tajik-Afghan border. The Tajik statement additionally expressed hope that the Afghan administration will “apologise to the people of Tajikistan and take additional effective measures to ensure security on the border with Tajikistan”. Afghanistan did not immediately comment on the development. Earlier this month, Tajikistan said five people were killed and five others injured in two previous cross-border attacks from Afghanistan. On Wednesday, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon commissioned four new border outposts, as well as a training range for tanks at the Harb-Maidon training ground near the Tajik-Afghan border, as part of efforts to bolster border security amid growing concerns over cross-border attacks.",
