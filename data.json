      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A special court on Saturday sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case. The case pertains to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated. Imran was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison; he was awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 (common intention) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Pakistan Penal Code, and seven years under Section 5(2) (criminal misconduct by public servants) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was also sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment under the same provisions. Both of them were also fined Rs16.4 million. As per the law, a failure to pay the fines will result in additional jail time. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Imran’s jail term in the case would begin after his sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said, “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment.” It added that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was “hereby given to the convicts”. Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year in October, the two had denied all allegations in case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case. PTI slams verdict The PTI, in a post on X, said that Imran’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo court announced the verdict of the Toshakhana 2 case”. “A closed-door jail trial is neither free nor fair; it is in fact a military trial,” the party said. It also shared a video of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan inside a car asking why she was not being allowed to proceed further. “They can’t stop us. The jail trial is today,” she said in the video, adding that it was “illegal” that the family was being stopped. Later, Aleema, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against Imran were being delivered under a pre-written script. “Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. Aleema claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to ten years or fourteen years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said. “Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned. According to Aleema, Imran’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in what she described as illegal solitary confinement. Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja stated that the case was being conducted on the basis of promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said. He described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was put on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case. PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgment. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former prime minister and his wife were those of a “Kangaroo court”. “There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Ayub added. A detailed statement released by the PTI’s Central Media Department rejected the sentence against the former prime minister and his wife, terming it “unconstitutional, illegal, ill-intended” and the “worst form of political revenge”. The party alleged that Imran and Bushra Bibi’s lawyers were not present at the time of the verdict was announced. “Neither were their families allowed to come to court, nor were basic judicial requirements fulfilled,” PTI said. “This is open contempt of court, contempt of law and contempt of justice,” the party said. The party further stated that the sentence was the “second for the same charge, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy”. The party alleged that the courts had become an “instrument of political engineering, rather than being an independent forum”. It said that the “sole” purpose of this court was to “prolong the illegal imprisonment of Imran and provide temporary support to the rulers who are afraid of the mandate of the people”. Minister says sentence to run consecutively Separately, Information Minister Tarar said that the punishment awarded on Saturday was a “consecutive sentence”, adding that it would begin after the sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. Speaking to Geo News , the minister welcomed the judgment, asserting that the former prime minister and his wife had “committed fraud” by getting the gifts undervalued and retaining them for personal use. He said that PTI founder and his wife’s actions were a “breach of public trust”. “During the trial, when these gifts were properly assessed, it emerged that[..] the actual price was quite high,“ he said. He further stated that the two had “committed fraud” by undervaluing the gifts and retaining them for personal use. “They had no right to harm the exchequer and retain gifts,” he stressed. He said the judgment was “completely fair and grounded in the principles of justice”. “The misuse of office, dishonesty with the government’s property, and criminal breach of trust, all of it has been proven,” he said. Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, while speaking with Geo News, remarked that the judgment was “in line with the Constitution and the law”. He stressed that “there was no political side to this, if you violate the law, it is clear that a punishment is expected”. “The trial that went on for 15-16 months, it was proven that PTI founder and his wife caused the national exchequer significant harm as the set’s valuation was under-reported,” Malik said. “The gift was not even submitted,” he added. Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the judgment came after lengthy legal proceedings. Speaking to Geo News, he noted that the case followed a similar pattern to that of the Toshakhana-I reference. “The state was given a gift that was not deposited, which they were legally bound to do according to the procedure for acceptance and gifts in Toshakhana,“ he said. “Unfortunately, Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan attempted to buy the set at throwaway rates,“ he said. He asserted that all the facts had “now been established in light of today’s judgement”.",

Later, Aleema, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against Imran were being delivered under a pre-written script. “Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. Aleema claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to ten years or fourteen years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said. “Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned. According to Aleema, Imran’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in what she described as illegal solitary confinement. Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja stated that the case was being conducted on the basis of promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said. He described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was put on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case. PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgment. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former prime minister and his wife were those of a “Kangaroo court”. “There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Ayub added. A detailed statement released by the PTI’s Central Media Department rejected the sentence against the former prime minister and his wife, terming it “unconstitutional, illegal, ill-intended” and the “worst form of political revenge”. The party alleged that Imran and Bushra Bibi’s lawyers were not present at the time of the verdict was announced. “Neither were their families allowed to come to court, nor were basic judicial requirements fulfilled,” PTI said. “This is open contempt of court, contempt of law and contempt of justice,” the party said. The party further stated that the sentence was the “second for the same charge, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy”. The party alleged that the courts had become an “instrument of political engineering, rather than being an independent forum”. It said that the “sole” purpose of this court was to “prolong the illegal imprisonment of Imran and provide temporary support to the rulers who are afraid of the mandate of the people”. Minister says sentence to run consecutively Separately, Information Minister Tarar said that the punishment awarded on Saturday was a “consecutive sentence”, adding that it would begin after the sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. Speaking to Geo News , the minister welcomed the judgment, asserting that the former prime minister and his wife had “committed fraud” by getting the gifts undervalued and retaining them for personal use. He said that PTI founder and his wife’s actions were a “breach of public trust”. “During the trial, when these gifts were properly assessed, it emerged that[..] the actual price was quite high,“ he said. He further stated that the two had “committed fraud” by undervaluing the gifts and retaining them for personal use. “They had no right to harm the exchequer and retain gifts,” he stressed. He said the judgment was “completely fair and grounded in the principles of justice”. “The misuse of office, dishonesty with the government’s property, and criminal breach of trust, all of it has been proven,” he said. Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, while speaking with Geo News, remarked that the judgment was “in line with the Constitution and the law”. He stressed that “there was no political side to this, if you violate the law, it is clear that a punishment is expected”. “The trial that went on for 15-16 months, it was proven that PTI founder and his wife caused the national exchequer significant harm as the set’s valuation was under-reported,” Malik said. “The gift was not even submitted,” he added. Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the judgment came after lengthy legal proceedings. Speaking to Geo News, he noted that the case followed a similar pattern to that of the Toshakhana-I reference. “The state was given a gift that was not deposited, which they were legally bound to do according to the procedure for acceptance and gifts in Toshakhana,“ he said. “Unfortunately, Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan attempted to buy the set at throwaway rates,“ he said. He asserted that all the facts had “now been established in light of today’s judgement”.",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: A special court on Saturday sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case. The case pertains to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated. Imran was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison; he was awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 (common intention) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Pakistan Penal Code, and seven years under Section 5(2) (criminal misconduct by public servants) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was also sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment under the same provisions. Both of them were also fined Rs16.4 million. As per the law, a failure to pay the fines will result in additional jail time. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Imran’s jail term in the case would begin after his sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said, “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment.” It added that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was “hereby given to the convicts”. Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year in October, the two had denied all allegations in case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case. PTI slams verdict The PTI, in a post on X, said that Imran’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo court announced the verdict of the Toshakhana 2 case”. “A closed-door jail trial is neither free nor fair; it is in fact a military trial,” the party said. It also shared a video of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan inside a car asking why she was not being allowed to proceed further. “They can’t stop us. The jail trial is today,” she said in the video, adding that it was “illegal” that the family was being stopped.

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh tightened security on Saturday, deploying police and paramilitary forces in the capital Dhaka ahead of funeral prayers for a slain youth leader and election candidate whose death has sparked a surge of violence. The unrest in the South Asian nation after the shooting death of Sharif Osman Hadi has included coordinated mob attacks on major newspapers and cultural institutions. Hadi, 32, a key figure in the student-led uprising last year that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last week while launching his campaign. He died on Thursday night in Singapore after six days on life support. Bangladesh is to elect a new parliament on February 12 — a transition many hope will help the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million people recover from nearly two years of instability and reclaim its position as a regional success story. Rights groups condemn killing, attacks on media But frequent bouts of violent protests and political wrangling among disparate groups have punctured the national sense of euphoria that arose after Hasina was ousted in August 2024. It has also exposed the limitations of the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, analysts say, raising questions over his grip on governance in the world’s largest apparel producer after China. Yunus’ government, which declared Saturday a day of state mourning for Hadi, urged citizens to resist “mob violence by fringe elements”, warning that turmoil threatens Bangladesh’s fragile democratic transition. Human Rights Watch called Hadi’s killing a “terrible act” and urged the government to act urgently to halt the violence that has gripped the country since Hasina’s ouster. The group also condemned the attacks on media as an assault on free expression. Bangladesh ranks 149th of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index. Rights groups warn that continued attacks on journalists and activists could further shrink civic space ahead of the election. Amnesty International urged prompt, independent investigations into Hadi’s killing and the subsequent violence, including the burning of newspaper offices and harassment of journalists. Demonstrations continued on Friday in the Shahbagh area of the capital, where crowds demanded justice for Hadi and accountability for the attacks. A mob stormed the Dhaka office of Udichi Shilpigosthi, Bangladesh’s premier progressive cultural organisation. The violence has spread beyond the capital. In Chittagong, protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission, reflecting growing anti-India sentiment since Hasina fled to New Delhi after her ouster. Her party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could derail the vote.",

Hadi, 32, a key figure in the student-led uprising last year that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last week while launching his campaign. He died on Thursday night in Singapore after six days on life support. Bangladesh is to elect a new parliament on February 12 — a transition many hope will help the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million people recover from nearly two years of instability and reclaim its position as a regional success story. Rights groups condemn killing, attacks on media But frequent bouts of violent protests and political wrangling among disparate groups have punctured the national sense of euphoria that arose after Hasina was ousted in August 2024. It has also exposed the limitations of the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, analysts say, raising questions over his grip on governance in the world’s largest apparel producer after China. Yunus’ government, which declared Saturday a day of state mourning for Hadi, urged citizens to resist “mob violence by fringe elements”, warning that turmoil threatens Bangladesh’s fragile democratic transition. Human Rights Watch called Hadi’s killing a “terrible act” and urged the government to act urgently to halt the violence that has gripped the country since Hasina’s ouster. The group also condemned the attacks on media as an assault on free expression. Bangladesh ranks 149th of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index. Rights groups warn that continued attacks on journalists and activists could further shrink civic space ahead of the election. Amnesty International urged prompt, independent investigations into Hadi’s killing and the subsequent violence, including the burning of newspaper offices and harassment of journalists. Demonstrations continued on Friday in the Shahbagh area of the capital, where crowds demanded justice for Hadi and accountability for the attacks. A mob stormed the Dhaka office of Udichi Shilpigosthi, Bangladesh’s premier progressive cultural organisation. The violence has spread beyond the capital. In Chittagong, protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission, reflecting growing anti-India sentiment since Hasina fled to New Delhi after her ouster. Her party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could derail the vote.",

Chasing a world record 435 runs to win, England were reduced to 207 for six at stumps, still 228 runs short of victory and having played no small part in their predicament through batting misadventure. Jamie Smith, on two, and Will Jacks, on 11, were left to try to salvage something from the wreckage of another demolition day for the tourists. With holders Australia 2-0 up in the five-test series after eight-wicket wins in Perth and Brisbane, they need only draw the match to retain the urn.

Uphill battle from here,” England opener Zak Crawley told reporters. “We came here to win the Ashes and we’re staring down the barrel now …. It’s been tough, they’re a very, very good side…. Obviously we’ve been slightly short of our best but credit to them.” Questions have been asked of England’s preparations, selections and batting approach, and there were plenty more teachable moments from Saturday’s play at Adelaide Oval. Their batters seemed determined to squander the rare periods when they could reasonably be judged to be on top of the Australian attack. They needed at least one, and preferably two, to stand up like Travis Head who put on 170, nearly half Australia’s second-innings total of 349, to effectively bat England out of the game. Instead, they were prey for Australia skipper Cummins, who took three top-order wickets andextracted gold from a still-firm pitch that proved unyielding, initially, for others. In his first test since July, coming off a back injury, Cummins became the second test captain to take 150 wickets, joining Pakistan’s Imran Khan (187). Keeping the champagne on ice England’s Ben Duckett was first to go, taking a half-hearted push at a nagging ball and sending an edge flying chest-high to Marnus Labuschagne in the slips. The shot was neither Bazball aggression nor stout defence, something meekly in between. Number three Ollie Pope fell for 17 in a similar vein, nicking off to the slips with a more hard-handed prod and watching in disbelief as Labuschagne dived forward to take a one-hander just above the grass. Labuschagne raced around the wicket in open-mouthed celebration, and England were 31 for two. Another collapse beckoned but Crawley (85) and Joe Root (39) dug in until just after tea. Root was lucky not to be dismissed lbw when he failed to play a shot at the part-time spin of Head, only to be caught-behind off Cummins moments later, playing at a ball he should have left. It was Cummins’ 13th dismissal of England’s master batter, the most by any bowler. Root slapped his bat in frustration but his was a misdemeanour compared to the batting crime committed by Harry Brook, who was bowled for 30 by Nathan Lyon with a botched reverse sweep. Lyon followed up by bowling captain Ben Stokes for five with a ball that pitched, straightened and crashed into middle and off-stump. The collapse gathered pace as Crawley lumbered forward at Lyon, misjudged the flight and was gleefully stumped by the clinical Alex Carey. He had batted well for his 85 to that point but his wicket came as the pressure rose, leaving England needing a miracle from Jacks and Smith. Each has struggled for runs when their team has been crying out for them. Australia will keep the champagne on ice until victory is complete. “We want to keep working hard and probably not look too far ahead,” said Carey, who singled out Lyon for praise. “I just thought Nathan was bowling really well and kept putting lots of energy on the ball. He toiled away all day and finally got some reward.”",

      "summary_orig": "Alphabet’s Google has advised some employees on US visas to avoid international travel due to delays at embassies, Business Insider reported on Friday, citing an internal email. The email, sent by the company’s outside counsel BAL Immigration Law on Thursday, warned staff who need a visa stamp to re-enter the United States not to leave the country because visa processing times have lengthened, the report said. Google did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Some US embassies and consulates face visa appointment delays of up to 12 months, the memo said, warning that international travel will “risk an extended stay outside the US”, according to the report. The administration of US President Donald Trump this month announced increased vetting of applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, including screening social media accounts. The H-1B visa programme, widely used by the US technology sector to hire skilled workers from India and China, has been under the spotlight after the Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee for new applications this year. In September, Google’s parent company Alphabet had strongly advised its employees to avoid international travel and urged H-1B visa holders to remain in the US, according to an email seen by Reuters.",

      "summary_orig": "The US military launched large-scale strikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria on Friday in retaliation for an attack on American personnel, US officials said. A US-led coalition had already been carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in Syria targeting Islamic State suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces. US President Donald Trump had vowed to retaliate after a suspected ISIS attack killed US personnel last weekend in Syria. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes targeted “ISIS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites” and said the operation was “OPERATION HAWKEYE STRIKE”. “This is not the beginning of a war it is a declaration of vengeance,” Hegseth said. “Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,” he added. Trump said on social media that the Syrian government fully supported the strikes and that the US was inflicting “very serious retaliation”. At a speech in North Carolina on Friday night, Trump called it a “massive” blow against the ISIS members that the US blames for the Dec 13 attack on coalition forces. “We hit the ISIS thugs in Syria. It was very successful,” Trump said at a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. US Central Command said the strikes hit more than 70 targets across central Syria, adding that Jordanian fighter jets supported the operation. One US official said the strikes were carried out by US F-15 and A-10 jets, along with Apache helicopters and HIMARS rocket systems. Syria reiterated its steadfast commitment to fighting Islamic State and ensuring that it has “no safe havens on Syrian territory,” according to a statement by the foreign ministry. Two US Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed on Saturday in the central Syrian town of Palmyra by an attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces before being shot dead, according to the US military. Three other US soldiers were also wounded in the attack. About 1,000 US troops remain in Syria. The Syrian Interior Ministry has described the attacker as a member of the Syrian security forces suspected of sympathising with Islamic State. Syria’s government is now led by former rebels who toppled leader Bashar al-Assad last year after a 13-year civil war, and includes members of Syria’s former Al Qaeda branch who broke with the group and clashed with Islamic State. Syria has been cooperating with a US-led coalition against Islamic State, reaching an agreement last month when President Ahmed al-Sharaa visited the White House.",

      "summary_orig": "PPP leader Sherry Rehman has said that Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan must apologise following his heated exchange with Senator Palwasha Khan during a Senate panel meeting on Friday. Pal­washa, who is also a PPP leader, and the federal minister had traded sharp remarks on Friday over the construction of a road allegedly benefiting a private housing society during a meeting of the Senate Stan­ding Committee on Com­mu­ni­cations. View this post on Instagram In a post on the social media platform X late on Friday night, Rehman said, “What happened today in a Senate standing committee can neither become normalised nor considered acceptable. No federal minister should speak the way Aleem Khan did with Senator Palwasha in a communications committee meeting.” Rehman further said that it was Senator Palwasha’s “absolute responsibility and right to ask questions” and to hold the government accountable. “He must apologise. I am not even going to say that it is necessary because she is a woman. She is due that basic right of respect as an honourable member of Parliament from a federal minister,” she said. The confrontation between the minister and Senator Palwasha had begun when the latter questioned whether public funds had been used to build a road primarily serving a private housing scheme in Lahore. Responding angrily, the minister warned that personal attacks would be met in kind. “If you make personal attacks, you will face the same behaviour,” he said, adding that while the government was willing to clarify its position, it would not lower itself to the level he felt the senator had adopted. However, she maintained it was her right as a parliamentarian to question the use of taxpayers’ money and reiterated that she had merely sought clarification on whether the road had been constructed to benefit a private housing society. The exchange escalated further when the minister accused committee members of being “blackmailers and dishonest”, prom­pting strong objections. Senator Pal­wa­sha said she had been humiliated by the minister’s remarks and announced she would raise the matter with her party’s top leadership. Following the intervention of the committee chairman, Senator Pervaiz Rashid, the minister tendered an apology. But Senator Palwasha declined to accept it. Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House following the argument, she said that if “a road funded by the public is being built, then why can we not question whether someone is trying to seek benefits for his private business?” Expressing disappointment at the minister‘s behaviour, she said it was the “collective demeanour of Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet”.",

The Foreign Office has said that Pakistan has not been asked to send personnel, nor has the country taken a decision yet . The issue resurfaced after reports began circulating that Field Marshal Asim Munir was due to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington in the near future, with Gaza deployment to feature in the talks. The FO contradicted these reports, while a White House official also said no such meeting was on the cards. Earlier, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said that Pakistan could not take a decision until the ISF’s terms of reference were clear, adding that disarming Hamas was “not our job”. Perhaps it is time that the state took a decision about the ISF deployment. Like most grand schemes of the Trump administration, the Gaza plan is high on hyperbole, and low on substance. Critically, the US State Department’s reported vision for foreign troops in Gaza to dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and decommission weapons “used by terrorists” — euphemisms for disarming Hamas — is incredibly problematic, especially for Arab and Muslim states. Mr Trump’s scheme seeks to put Muslim states on a collision course with Hamas and other resistance groups, and attempts to do what Israel failed. It is our view that no Muslim state should be fighting Palestinian groups, essentially doing Israel’s dirty work. It is perhaps because of this unsavoury aspect of the Gaza plan that so many states have refused to commit troops. As per reports, Azerbaijan, Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states have all said that in the current conditions, they will be unable to send troops to the occupied Palestinian territory. Pakistan must not break with this consensus, and its own stated principles, by sending troops to confront Palestinian resistance groups. The state has taken difficult decisions such as this in the past. For example, despite significant Saudi pressure, through the collective wisdom of parliament the state preferred neutrality and refused to commit forces to the war on Yemen’s Houthis. In hindsight, this was the correct decision. Israel cannot be trusted, and has already indicated that it intends to remain in significant parts of occupied Gaza. Muslim and Arab states, thus, should not become accessories in the US-Israeli plan to perpetuate the occupation. Hamas is willing to lay down arms, but only if there is a visible pathway for a Palestinian state. Tel Aviv abhors the idea of a viable Palestinian state, and the implementation of the ceasefire’s second phase looks doubtful. Pakistan should, therefore, stay away from any half-baked plans to commit troops to an occupied war zone. Published in Dawn, December 20th, 2025",

According to officials, unknown armed men planted an explosive device on the main rail track between Sibi and Mushkaf area of Bolan Pass and detonated it. Another incident of blasting a railway track took place in the Dasht area of Mastung district. “The targets were the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express and the Karachi-bound Bolan Mail,” police officials said, adding that railway operations were disrupted due to the blasts at two locations. After receiving information about the explosions, the two trains, which had already departed for their destinations, were stopped at different stations as a precautionary measure. Railway officials said the tracks were damaged in the explosions, adding that after security clearance, engineers and other concerned staff repaired both damaged sections. “Both passenger trains were allowed to proceed to their destinations after the repair work,” the officials said, adding that the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail would leave for Peshawar and Karachi, respectively, on Saturday. Militants have made several attempts to blow up the Jaffar Express over the past two months and have succeeded twice, targeting the train in the Dasht area of Mastung district and in the Shikarpur area of Sindh.

Another incident of blasting a railway track took place in the Dasht area of Mastung district. “The targets were the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express and the Karachi-bound Bolan Mail,” police officials said, adding that railway operations were disrupted due to the blasts at two locations. After receiving information about the explosions, the two trains, which had already departed for their destinations, were stopped at different stations as a precautionary measure. Railway officials said the tracks were damaged in the explosions, adding that after security clearance, engineers and other concerned staff repaired both damaged sections. “Both passenger trains were allowed to proceed to their destinations after the repair work,” the officials said, adding that the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail would leave for Peshawar and Karachi, respectively, on Saturday. Militants have made several attempts to blow up the Jaffar Express over the past two months and have succeeded twice, targeting the train in the Dasht area of Mastung district and in the Shikarpur area of Sindh.

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the verdict inside Kot Lakhpat Jail after concluding the trial of the accused in FIR No 852/2023, which relates to an attack on the entrance gate of the GOR-I Club Chowk. The case had been registered by the Race Course police, who later submitted a challan against 25 accused persons, including PTI leaders and party workers. In the same case, the court also handed down 10-year imprisonment sentences to PTI workers Qasim Elahi, Muhammad Shehbaz, Mushtaq and Abdullah. However, the judge acquitted 12 other accused due to a lack of sufficient evidence against them. This marks the fifth case in Lahore in which Mr Qureshi has been acquitted, while Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mehmoodur Rashid have been convicted. The majority of those convicted were charged with participating in the attack while armed with clubs, pelting stones and chanting slogans. Previously, verdicts have alre­ady been announced in several other cases arising from the May 9 unrest, including trials related to the attack on Shadman police station, violence at Sherpao Bridge, the burning of police vehicles near Rahat Bakery, and the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squ­ad vehicle near Jinnah House. Barrister Taimur Malik, counsel for Shah Mahmood Qureshi, stated that despite the acquittal, the PTI vice chairman would not be released from Kot Lakhpat Jail as his bail pleas in three other cases are still pending. He expressed hope that bail in those cases would be granted sooner rather than later, instead of Mr Qureshi having to wait for the completion of the trials. “We have now obtained his bail or acquittals in around 50 cases across Punjab and Islamabad over the last three years,” the counsel added. The May 9 riots erupted following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan by the National Accountability Bureau from the premises of the Islamabad High Court. Subsequently, PTI leaders and workers launched protests across the country, during which military installations and public property were attacked. Joint letter Separately, five senior PTI leaders currently incarcerated at Kot Lakhpat jail issued a joint letter through their lawyer, stating that dialogue is the only viable path to steer the country out of its ongoing crises. The letter, signed by Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed, stated that the party’s central leadership firmly believes that dialogue at all levels is the sole workable solution to the prevailing situation. The incarcerated leaders said that Pakistan has been grappling with severe political, economic and social crises for the past three years and eight months, and that it is the responsibility of every patriot to think in the national interest and pursue objectives through peaceful and constitutional means. According to the PTI leaders, negotiations alone can help pull the country out of the current turmoil. The letter further stated that the PTI founder has asked the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan to engage in consultations with national political parties in order to chart a way forward. It added that broad-based consultation opens the door to meaningful dialogue. The imprisoned leaders also expressed hope that Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas would provide guidance to the nation during this critical period.

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday issued a demarche to the Afghan Taliban over its failure to rein in terrorist organisations operating from its soil after a deadly attack on a military camp in North Waziristan earlier today. Four security forces personnel were martyred when an attempt by terrorists to attack a security forces camp was foiled in the area of Boya in North Waziristan district. In a statement, the FO said that Pakistan condemned the attack in the strongest possible terms and identified the attackers as members of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, a group under the TTP umbrella. “To convey our strong demarche, the Afghan deputy head of mission was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” the statement read. “The ministry conveyed Pakistan’s grave concern over the continued support and facilitation provided by the Afghan Taliban regime to the FAK/TTP, enabling them to carry out terrorist attacks against [the] Pakistan Military and the civilian population along the Pak-Afghan border and in adjoining areas,” it added. The FO emphasised that the permissive environment enjoyed by the Fitna-al-Khawarij in Afghanistan contradicts Kabul’s commitments to Pakistan and the international community. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “Pakistan has demanded a full investigation and decisive action against the perpetrators and facilitators of the terrorist attacks launched against Pakistan from Afghan soil,” the statement said. Islamabad also asked Kabul to take “immediate, concrete and verifiable measures against all terror groups operating from its territory, including their leadership and deny the continued use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan”. The FO warned the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan “reserves the right to defend its sovereignty and protect its citizens, and will take all necessary measures to respond to terrorism originating from Afghan soil”. Pak-Afghan relations Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the TTP remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes. Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process. The Foreign Office also said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups. On December 1, Saudi Arabia quietly facilitated a round of direct talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan aimed at easing tensions over cross-border terrorism, but the discussions wrapped up without any breakthrough. A recent United Nations Security Council report rejected the Taliban’s claim that terrorist groups are not using Afghan territory for cross-border violence, calling the assertion “not credible” and warning that neighbouring states increasingly view Afghanistan as a source of regional insecurity. The assessment, contained in the sixteenth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, was submitted to the UN Security Council, as international concern grows over Afghanistan’s security landscape more than four years after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. “The de facto authorities continue to deny that any terrorist groups have a footprint in or operate from its territory. That claim is not credible,” the report said.",

      "title_orig": "Partial strike as lawyers divided over IHC judge’s removal",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A visible split among lawyers in the federal capital on Friday resulted in only a partial strike, as a small group of lawyers observed the call issued by the Islamabad District Bar Association (DBA) to protest the removal of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri , while the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) played down the verdict that led to his ouster. Justice Jahangiri was removed from office thro­ugh a short order passed by an Islamabad High Court (IHC) division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan. The bench ruled that his elevation to the high court was “without lawful authority” and that he had “ceased to hold” the office with immediate effect. The short order was announced at around 3:30pm. However, sources said Justice Jahangiri had left his chamber for his residence approximately half an hour earlier, adding that he may have been informed of the decision before its formal announ­cement. An official of his court told Dawn that the judge personally met and embraced each staff member before leaving, telling them: “We will meet again if God so wills.” Following the verdict, DBA President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar announced a strike to protest the decision. The IHCBA, however, chose not to issue any such call. IHCBA Secretary Chaudhry Manzoor Jajja told Dawn that the verdict was “like one of the many decisions the IHC passes every day” and said there was no justification for a strike. He added that IHC judges — including Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Jahangiri himself — had previously opposed strikes over what he described as peripheral issues. As a result of this division within the legal fraternity, the strike had only a limited impact. While routine attendance was reported at the Supreme Court, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and the Islamabad High Court, only a small number of lawyers boycotted proceedings at the sessions courts. A senior sessions court official estimated that fewer than 10 per cent of lawyers abstained from hearings in solidarity with the ousted judge. Meanwhile, the IHC administration issued a duty roster for the coming week that did not include Justice Jahangiri’s name. Hearings in cases fixed before his bench were cancelled, and the administration is expected to redistribute his caseload among other available judges. Even before the formal de-notification, Justice Jahangiri’s name was removed from the IHC website. Late on Thursday night, the Presidency confirmed that President Asif Ali Zardari had approved the de-notification of Justice Jahangiri on the advice of the prime minister, in compliance with the IHC order. The move followed a direction in the short written order instructing the law ministry to de-notify him. The ministry forwarded a summary through the Prime Minister’s Office, which was subsequently approved by the president. The controversy originated from a letter that surfaced on social media last year, purportedly issued by the University of Karachi (KU). During the proceedings, KU Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui submitted records stating that the university syndicate had cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, alleging that it had been obtained through “unfair means”. He claimed the judge had been found cheating and creating a disturbance in an examination hall in 1988 and was debarred until 1992, but had allegedly appeared in an examination in 1989 under a changed name. Justice Jahangiri’s counsel, Advocate Muhammad Akram Sheikh, argued that a sitting judge could only be removed through the procedure prescribed under Article 209 of the Constitution, which requires proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). However, amicus curiae Barrister Zafarullah Khan contended that where a judge’s eligibility or qualification was in question, the SJC process was not applicable, citing past judicial precedents. The bench observed that the qualification to hold the office of a high court judge was personal to the individual and independent of judicial performance. It noted that sufficient opportunity had been provided to Justice Jahangiri to submit his reply and credentials, but he failed to do so. Published in Dawn, December 20th, 2025",

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: A visible split among lawyers in the federal capital on Friday resulted in only a partial strike, as a small group of lawyers observed the call issued by the Islamabad District Bar Association (DBA) to protest the removal of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri , while the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) played down the verdict that led to his ouster. Justice Jahangiri was removed from office thro­ugh a short order passed by an Islamabad High Court (IHC) division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan. The bench ruled that his elevation to the high court was “without lawful authority” and that he had “ceased to hold” the office with immediate effect. The short order was announced at around 3:30pm. However, sources said Justice Jahangiri had left his chamber for his residence approximately half an hour earlier, adding that he may have been informed of the decision before its formal announ­cement. An official of his court told Dawn that the judge personally met and embraced each staff member before leaving, telling them: “We will meet again if God so wills.” Following the verdict, DBA President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar announced a strike to protest the decision. The IHCBA, however, chose not to issue any such call. IHCBA Secretary Chaudhry Manzoor Jajja told Dawn that the verdict was “like one of the many decisions the IHC passes every day” and said there was no justification for a strike. He added that IHC judges — including Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Jahangiri himself — had previously opposed strikes over what he described as peripheral issues. As a result of this division within the legal fraternity, the strike had only a limited impact. While routine attendance was reported at the Supreme Court, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and the Islamabad High Court, only a small number of lawyers boycotted proceedings at the sessions courts. A senior sessions court official estimated that fewer than 10 per cent of lawyers abstained from hearings in solidarity with the ousted judge. Meanwhile, the IHC administration issued a duty roster for the coming week that did not include Justice Jahangiri’s name. Hearings in cases fixed before his bench were cancelled, and the administration is expected to redistribute his caseload among other available judges. Even before the formal de-notification, Justice Jahangiri’s name was removed from the IHC website. Late on Thursday night, the Presidency confirmed that President Asif Ali Zardari had approved the de-notification of Justice Jahangiri on the advice of the prime minister, in compliance with the IHC order. The move followed a direction in the short written order instructing the law ministry to de-notify him. The ministry forwarded a summary through the Prime Minister’s Office, which was subsequently approved by the president. The controversy originated from a letter that surfaced on social media last year, purportedly issued by the University of Karachi (KU). During the proceedings, KU Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui submitted records stating that the university syndicate had cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, alleging that it had been obtained through “unfair means”. He claimed the judge had been found cheating and creating a disturbance in an examination hall in 1988 and was debarred until 1992, but had allegedly appeared in an examination in 1989 under a changed name.

      "summary_orig": "Four security forces personnel were martyred when an attempt by terrorists to attack a security forces camp was foiled in the area of Boya in North Waziristan district, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Friday. “On 19 December 2025, in a heinous and cowardly terrorist act, Khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij attacked security forces camp, in general area Boya, North Waziristan District.” Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The military’s media wing added that the terrorists “attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response by own troops”. The terrorists then rammed an explosives-laden vehicle “on [the] outer perimeter wall, resulting in its collapse and considerable damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, including a mosque”. The ISPR stated that the car bomb attack inflicted damage to nearby homes and other structures and inflicted “severe injuries to fifteen local civilians, including innocent children and women”. Weapons and explosives seized from the terrorists after the attack on the security forces camp in Boya, North Waziristan. —ISPR In an earlier report, police and hospital sources reported that 11 civilians were injured as a result of the blast, and they were rushed to the district headquarters hospital in Miranshah for treatment. “However, during the intense fire exchanges, four brave sons of soil Havildar Muhammad Waqas (age: 42 years, resident of District Kotli), Naik Khanwaiz (age: 38 years, resident of District Mansehra), Sepoy Sufyan Haider (age: 25 years, resident of District Vehari) and Sepoy Riffat (age: 32 years, resident of District Leyyah) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced Shahadat,” stated ISPR, giving details of the martyred personnel. The military further said that the “hideous” act of terrorism was planned and orchestrated by Afghanistan-based khwarij and “is in contrast to assertions made by Afghan Taliban Regime, claiming non presence of these terrorist groups operating from their soil”. “Pakistan expects from Afghan Taliban Regime to fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij against Pakistan as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost.” The military warned that Pakistan reserves the right to hunt down and eliminate the terrorists and their facilitators to ensure the safety of the Pakistani people. The incident comes two months after four terrorists were killed after security forces foiled a suicide attack on a military camp in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali. State media reported at the time that one terrorist rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the wall of the security forces’ camp after which three more tried to enter it. Friday’s incident comes as a spate of terrorist attacks continues in Pakistan. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year.",

      "summary_orig": "The body of a popular student leader who was assassinated returned home to Bangladesh on Friday, as the country’s interim government urged people to resist violence as protests erupted across Dhaka and other cities. In a post on X, the interim administration wrote that a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight carrying Sharif Osman Hadi’s remains landed at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka at 5:48pm local time (4:48pm PKT) after departing from Singapore, where he was undergoing medical treatment. Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, the youth leader who died, was a spokesperson for the Inquilab Mancha (Platform for Revolution) and participated in the protests that overthrew Hasina. He was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last Friday while launching his election campaign. Hadi, an outspoken critic of India, was initially treated at a local hospital before being flown to Singapore for advanced medical care, where he died after spending six days on life support. Meanwhile, the United States Embassy in Dhaka stated in a post on X that Hadi’s funeral prayers will be held after afternoon prayers around 2pm in front of the National Parliament building on Manik Mia Avenue. “Extremely heavy traffic is expected in the area and throughout Dhaka. US citizens should practice vigilance and remember that gatherings intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence,” the post warned. “ You should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings. ” Chief adviser of the interim administration Muhammad Yunus also confirmed in a post on X that the funeral would be held at 2pm at the southern plaza of the Bangladeshi parliament building. Although calm had returned to much of the country on Friday morning, protesters carrying national flags and placards continued demonstrating at Shahbagh in central Dhaka, chanting slogans and vowing not to return until justice was served. Residents in the Muslim-majority South Asian nation of 173 million said they were worried there could be fresh violence later on Friday. The National Citizen Party, formed by students who led protests that forced then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina to flee the country last year, also warned of possible violence later in the day. Nearly 1,500 people gathered peacefully at the national mosque in Dhaka after Friday prayers for a rally called by Khelafat Majlis, a religiopolitical party. View this post on Instagram According to Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star , around 100 protesters gathered in Chowhatta and demanded that those responsible for Hadi‘s killing be brought to justice and also called for the resignation of Dhaka’s home affairs adviser if their demands were not met. “Addressing the gathering, protesters alleged that the killing had been carried out ‘at the behest of India’ and blamed the Awami League and its affiliated bodies, particularly the banned Chhatra League,” the newspaper reported. View this post on Instagram In Dhaka, videos circulating on social media showed mobs vandalising the offices of the country’s largest daily newspaper, Prothom Alo , as well as The Daily Star , on Thursday night. The fire service said the blaze at The Daily Star was under control. Troops were deployed to the scene, and firefighters rescued journalists trapped inside the building. The demonstrations were marked by emotionally charged slogans invoking Hadi’s name, with protesters vowing to continue their movement and demanding swift justice. Several areas remained tense, with additional police and paramilitary forces deployed to prevent further violence. Chief adviser of the interim government, Muhammad Yunus, issued a statement from his office condemning the arson and urging citizens to resist mob violence. “This is a critical moment in our nation’s history when we are making a historic democratic transition,” he was quoted as saying. “We cannot and must not allow it to be derailed by those few who thrive on chaos and reject peace.” Yunus added that the upcoming elections were “inseparable” from Hadi’s dreams and that honouring his sacrifice would require restraint, responsibility and a commitment against hatred. “To the journalists of The Daily Star , Prothom Alo and New Age : we stand with you. We are deeply sorry for the terror and violence you have endured,” the statement read. “The nation has witnessed your courage and tolerance in the face of terror. Attacks on journalists are attacks on truth itself. We promise you full justice.” The statement also condemned the lynching of a Hindu man in Mymensingh, vowing that there would be “no space for such violence in new Bangladesh”. UN rights chief urges probe into killing The United Nations human rights chief voiced alarm at Hadi’s killing and called for a swift and impartial investigation. “I urge the authorities to conduct a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation into the attack that led to Hadi’s death, and to ensure due process and accountability for those responsible,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. He urged calm as protesters rallied across Bangladesh. “Retaliation and revenge will only deepen divisions and undermine the rights of all,” he warned. With parliamentary elections scheduled for February, Turk stressed that it was vital to ensure an environment where all individuals could participate safely and peacefully in public life and freely express different views. “I urge the authorities to uphold the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and security of journalists at this critical time, and prevent further escalation of unrest,” the rights chief added. Government blames ‘fringe elements’ Bangladesh has been governed by the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Yunus since August 2024, after Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising. The government has been grappling with fresh protests over delayed reforms, and warnings of unrest by Hasina’s party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the vote. The elections are scheduled for February 12. It urged the people of Bangladesh to resist all forms of mob violence, which it said were committed by a “few fringe elements”. Earlier, in a televised address to the nation, Yunus declared Saturday a day of state mourning in honour of Hadi. Violence was also reported in a number of cities across Bangladesh, including the port city of Chittagong, where protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission. The unrest follows fresh anti-India protests this week, with ties between the neighbours deteriorating since Hasina fled to Delhi. On Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators marched toward the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, chanting anti-India slogans, while also demanding Hasina’s return.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A heated exchange was witnessed between Minister for Communications Aleem Khan and Senator Palwasha Khan on Friday during a meeting of the Senate Committee on Communications over a question related to the construction of a road project. The confrontation began when the PPP senator raised a question about a road she alleged was benefiting a private housing society in Lahore. Pulwasha maintained that it was her right to “seek clarification on a project funded with public money and question whether the road had been built to benefit a specific private entity”. A bitter exchange then took place between the minister and the senator. “I cannot stand the allegations set against me; I consider this offensive,” the minister said. Senator Palwasha responded that the minister became furious over being “just questioned.” View this post on Instagram “I just asked a question whether you sought any benefit from it or not; it was not an allegation,” the senator clarified. Aleem then reportedly said he would respond in kind if such “personal attacks” were made, adding that he did not wish to descend to what he described as a “lower level of discourse”. Senator Palwasha, noting that the minister reacted angrily to legitimate parliamentary scrutiny, claimed he became “enraged” when asked to respond. “You are angry at being questioned because you are guilty,” the senator stated. “We will treat you the way we are treated,” Aleem responded. “If you speak about our person, we will also speak about yours,” he added. As tempers flared, the committee chairman repeatedly attempted to defuse the situation and restore order. “Mr chairman, is this any way to behave?” Palwasha questioned. The senator then formally demanded a ruling on the minister’s conduct from the chairman of the committee, reiterating that her question was limited to transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. “Give a ruling on the conduct of the federal minister,” she demanded. The senator also urged the committee chairman to intervene and issue a ruling on what she termed the minister’s inappropriate behaviour. “A ruling should be given on this behaviour,” Palwasha reiterated. Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House following the argument, she said that if “a road funded by the public is being built, then why can we not question whether someone is trying to seek benefits for his private business?” Expressing disappointment at the minister‘s behaviour, she said it was the “collective demeanour of Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet” She also maintained that she will bring this matter to her party’s senior leadership. Senator Bilal Ahmed Khan Mandokhail, a committee member, said that while ministers are routinely questioned in committees, the exchange was “inappropriate”. He added that after the chairman’s intervention, the minister offered an apology, which Senator Palwasha declined to accept.",

Senator Palwasha responded that the minister became furious over being “just questioned.” View this post on Instagram “I just asked a question whether you sought any benefit from it or not; it was not an allegation,” the senator clarified. Aleem then reportedly said he would respond in kind if such “personal attacks” were made, adding that he did not wish to descend to what he described as a “lower level of discourse”. Senator Palwasha, noting that the minister reacted angrily to legitimate parliamentary scrutiny, claimed he became “enraged” when asked to respond. “You are angry at being questioned because you are guilty,” the senator stated. “We will treat you the way we are treated,” Aleem responded. “If you speak about our person, we will also speak about yours,” he added. As tempers flared, the committee chairman repeatedly attempted to defuse the situation and restore order. “Mr chairman, is this any way to behave?” Palwasha questioned. The senator then formally demanded a ruling on the minister’s conduct from the chairman of the committee, reiterating that her question was limited to transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. “Give a ruling on the conduct of the federal minister,” she demanded. The senator also urged the committee chairman to intervene and issue a ruling on what she termed the minister’s inappropriate behaviour. “A ruling should be given on this behaviour,” Palwasha reiterated. Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House following the argument, she said that if “a road funded by the public is being built, then why can we not question whether someone is trying to seek benefits for his private business?” Expressing disappointment at the minister‘s behaviour, she said it was the “collective demeanour of Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet” She also maintained that she will bring this matter to her party’s senior leadership. Senator Bilal Ahmed Khan Mandokhail, a committee member, said that while ministers are routinely questioned in committees, the exchange was “inappropriate”. He added that after the chairman’s intervention, the minister offered an apology, which Senator Palwasha declined to accept.",
