The intracity bus union said the decision to strike was reached at a meeting of chapter representatives in the morning. The management has offered to increase hourly wages by 10 percent. But the union has rejected the proposal, saying it effectively amounts to a wage cut in consideration of recent rulings by the Supreme Court and a court of appeals that regular bonuses should be added to an employee's base pay to calculate their ordinary wages. Generally, increases in ordinary wages translate into higher amounts of various allowances for employees. The union has argued that the wage increases should be 12.85 percent, including unpaid allowances calculated based on the new ordinary wage standards. The union has also filed a criminal complaint against the management over the unpaid allowances. The Seoul city government said its annual expenses will be increased by 150 billion won ($103 million) a year if t",

      "summary_orig": "For Kim Hyo-sun, life beside Cheong Wa Dae, the longtime presidential office, had been shaped by the quiet rules of a high-security zone. Since her high school years in Seoul’s Hyoja-dong, the 38-year-old’s routines were influenced by the blue-tiled compound that served as the nation’s seat of power for more than 70 years. That proximity carried trade-offs. The neighborhood’s rare calm, set apart from Seoul’s bustle, came with constraints that defined daily life in Hyoja-dong. “There were frequent protests nearby, often causing traffic restrictions and inconvenience,” Kim told The Korea Times. “But the neighborhood felt very safe, with police stationed at every corner around the clock.” The balance shifted in 2022, after then-President Yoon Suk Yeol moved the presidential office from Cheong Wa Dae to central Seoul’s Yongsan District, describing the compound as authoritarian and insular. But now, President Lee Jae Myung is returning to Cheong Wa Dae, with the gradual move beginning earlier this week. The return of the presidential office will cost 56 billion won ($38.3",

The committee made the decision in a unanimous vote in a meeting Monday, also attended by Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back.

      "summary_orig": "BANNU: Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan said on Wednesday that 27 cops were martyred in 134 terrorist attacks targeting personnel in the district in 2025. He made the remarks while addressing a press briefing at his office, where he gave a detailed breakdown of the overall law and order situation in the district and operations carried out against terrorist elements. According to the DIG, Bannu police conducted comprehensive, well-organised and result-oriented operations against militants. He said the data showed that during 2025, a total of 134 terrorist attacks targeted police stations, police posts, checkpoints, police mobiles and police parties. In these attacks, 27 police personnel were martyred, while 79 sustained injuries. In retaliatory action by police, 53 terrorists were killed and 163 were injured, he said. The DIG said that Bannu police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations across the district, resulting in the arrest of 105 terrorists and the elimination of 65 terrorists. Overall, successful action was taken against 170 terrorists, he said. He further stated that police and security forces jointly conducted successful operations in the areas of Miryan, Haved, Daud Shah, Mamand Khel and Domel. During these joint operations, one police constable was martyred while 11 police personnel and five civilians were injured, he said. As a result of these operations, 22 terrorists were killed and four were arrested, and several terrorist hideouts and houses were also demolished. He also said that terrorists had carried out 20 drone attacks targeting police installations and civilian populations, in which 19 police personnel were injured. Further, nine civilians were martyred and 33 were injured, he said. However, following the installation of an anti-drone system on July 18, a significant improvement was observed, with over 300 drone attacks thwarted and four drones neutralised. DIG Khan said that despite limited resources, various security measures were implemented to protect police installations, including the installation of barriers, bunkers, double boundary walls, bullet-proof gates and CCTV cameras. He said that work had also begun on the Safe City Project to further enhance the safety of both police personnel and the general public. He added that for coordinated action against terrorists, jirgas were held with local elders in different areas, yielding positive results, and peace committees were formed. With public cooperation, militant attacks on several police stations and checkposts were successfully thwarted, while effective operations were carried out in Kakki, Bharath, Khojri, Bargantu, Sheikh Landak, and other areas, he said. According to the DIG, in order to align Bannu police with modern requirements, the force had been equipped with drones, anti-drone guns, sniper rifles, armoured personnel carriers (APCs), thermal imaging systems, tactical helmets and bullet-proof vehicles. He reaffirmed his commitment that Bannu police would continue its struggle to maintain law and order in the district, efforts to eliminate terrorism, and ensure the protection of the lives and property of the public.",

      "title_orig": "Asif says govt satisfied with PIA sale, sees it having great ‘symbolic value’",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday said that the government was satisfied with the sale of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), adding that it had great “symbolic value”. He expressed these views on Geo News programme ‘Geo Pakistan’ when asked whether the government was satisfied with the process. “Yes, the government is satisfied. This is the first biggest transaction of our privatisation process. This transaction has a great symbolic value,“ he said, recalling that previously First Women Bank had also been privatised but that transaction was not as big. A consortium led by the Arif Habib group won the auction for a controlling stake in Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) on Tuesday with a bid of Rs135 billion after a competitive, televised process, marking the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades. The sale is a central plank of the government’s plan to offload loss-making state-owned enterprises and a key condition under Pakistan’s $7bn International Monetary Fund bailout programme. Speaking about the matter on ‘Geo Pakistan’ , Asif said the PIA sale had “symbolic value because of the history of this transaction“. Four years ago, he said, the country’s entire aviation sector had suffered following a statement by a then-minister from the PTI. He was apparently referring to former aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement in June 2020 during a parliamentary session. Khan had said investigations revealed that more than 262 of the country’s 860 active pilots either held fake licences or had cheated in their exams. Following the then-minister’s statement, European and UK authorities had ban­ned PIA from their territories, which were the airline’s most profitable routes. A number of foreign airlines had also grounded Pak­istani-origin pilots over concerns about their licences. The developments followed the crash of a PIA flight from Lahore near Karachi’s Jinnah Inter­national Airport in 2020, killing around 100 people. Asif said these events had led to PIA going “almost bankrupt”, adding that the government then restructured the company. “The government itself owned a big portion of its liability and only nominal liability remained,“ he said. “Against this backdrop, yesterday’s transaction is a very successful one.” He also credited the civil aviation department for its considerable contribution in the matter and seeing the transaction through. “We went through a painstaking process,” he said, adding that PIA was now operating flights to Manchester . The minister further stated that the airline now also had permission to operate flights to Birmingham and London, but it did not have aircraft for those flights. Similarly, he continued, PIA now also had permission to operate flights to New York and around 14-15 destinations in Europe. The defence minister also appeared to be defending the arrangement under which the government is to receive just 7.5 per cent — around Rs10bn — of the amount from the PIA sale, saying that investing a “bigger portion” back into the airline increased its value. He said the government still held 25pc of PIA’s shares and 92.5 of the amount from the sale being invested back into the airline was actually an investment into a national asset. “We did not give a handout to anyone,” he asserted, adding that the country had borne losses for 50-55 years following nationalisation of businesses. He also blamed the bureaucracy for state-owned enterprises’ losses, adding that politicians likely shared some responsibility for these losses as well. “We have to construct such transactions [as that of PIA‘s sale] to rid [the national exchequer] of these losses. We don’t have a choice. We are beggars, not the choosers,” Asif said, adding that several other transactions were to be carried out in the future. In this connection, he also mentioned that two power distribution companies in Sindh and one each in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan were facing severe losses. When the anchorperson pointed out that Asif had held Khan responsible for losses in the aviation sector in recent years and asked whether action would be taken over such matters, Asif said action would be taken. “There is no other option. These people should be held answerable,” he said. He said often retired bureaucrats would become part of boards of state-owned enterprises and earn in millions. “This is an orgy of loot and plunder of the public sector that has been going on in our country for the past 55 years,” he commented. “The existence of a sick public sector is actually supported or pushed by the bureaucracy […] The government is largely responsible for it, and they [bureaucrats] are the major beneficiaries of this loot and plunder.” Asked about over-staffing in PIA, he said even if a little more had to be paid to the employees than the actual payable amount to “get rid of them”, then it should be paid. “Because the purpose should be to stop the continuous bleeding.” Asked about the possibility of talks between the government and opposition, he said issues on which dialogue was to be held should be decided first.",

      "summary_en": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday said that the government was satisfied with the sale of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), adding that it had great “symbolic value”. He expressed these views on Geo News programme ‘Geo Pakistan’ when asked whether the government was satisfied with the process. “Yes, the government is satisfied. This is the first biggest transaction of our privatisation process. This transaction has a great symbolic value,“ he said, recalling that previously First Women Bank had also been privatised but that transaction was not as big. A consortium led by the Arif Habib group won the auction for a controlling stake in Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) on Tuesday with a bid of Rs135 billion after a competitive, televised process, marking the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades. The sale is a central plank of the government’s plan to offload loss-making state-owned enterprises and a key condition under Pakistan’s $7bn International Monetary Fund bailout programme. Speaking about the matter on ‘Geo Pakistan’ , Asif said the PIA sale had “symbolic value because of the history of this transaction“. Four years ago, he said, the country’s entire aviation sector had suffered following a statement by a then-minister from the PTI. He was apparently referring to former aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement in June 2020 during a parliamentary session. Khan had said investigations revealed that more than 262 of the country’s 860 active pilots either held fake licences or had cheated in their exams. Following the then-minister’s statement, European and UK authorities had ban­ned PIA from their territories, which were the airline’s most profitable routes. A number of foreign airlines had also grounded Pak­istani-origin pilots over concerns about their licences. The developments followed the crash of a PIA flight from Lahore near Karachi’s Jinnah Inter­national Airport in 2020, killing around 100 people. Asif said these events had led to PIA going “almost bankrupt”, adding that the government then restructured the company. “The government itself owned a big portion of its liability and only nominal liability remained,“ he said. “Against this backdrop, yesterday’s transaction is a very successful one.” He also credited the civil aviation department for its considerable contribution in the matter and seeing the transaction through. “We went through a painstaking process,” he said, adding that PIA was now operating flights to Manchester . The minister further stated that the airline now also had permission to operate flights to Birmingham and London, but it did not have aircraft for those flights. Similarly, he continued, PIA now also had permission to operate flights to New York and around 14-15 destinations in Europe. The defence minister also appeared to be defending the arrangement under which the government is to receive just 7.5 per cent — around Rs10bn — of the amount from the PIA sale, saying that investing a “bigger portion” back into the airline increased its value. He said the government still held 25pc of PIA’s shares and 92.5 of the amount from the sale being invested back into the airline was actually an investment into a national asset. “We did not give a handout to anyone,” he asserted, adding that the country had borne losses for 50-55 years following nationalisation of businesses. He also blamed the bureaucracy for state-owned enterprises’ losses, adding that politicians likely shared some responsibility for these losses as well. “We have to construct such transactions [as that of PIA‘s sale] to rid [the national exchequer] of these losses. We don’t have a choice. We are beggars, not the choosers,” Asif said, adding that several other transactions were to be carried out in the future.

      "summary_orig": "The Libyan army’s chief of staff, Mohammed Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, died in a plane crash on Tuesday after leaving Turkiye’s capital Ankara as well as four others that were on the jet as well. “This followed a tragic and painful incident while they were returning from an official trip from the Turkish city of Ankara. This grave loss is a great loss for the nation, for the military institution, and for all the people,” Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah said in a statement. According to the Washington DC-based Stimson Centre , Libya has effectively split into two virtual quasi-states since 2014. The west is ruled by the Government of National Unity (GNU), of which Dbeibah is the prime minister, while the east is run by Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar’s Libyan Armed Forces. Dbeibah said the commander of Libya’s ground forces, the director of its military manufacturing authority, an adviser to the chief of staff, and a photographer from the chief of staff’s office were also on the aircraft. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X that the plane had taken off from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport at 1710 GMT en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost at 1752 GMT. He said authorities found the plane’s wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara’s Haymana district. He added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana, but that no contact was established. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said an investigation into the crash was under way. The Tripoli-based GNU said in a statement that the prime minister directed the defence minister to send an official delegation to Ankara to follow up on proceedings. Walid Ellafi, state minister of political affairs and communication for the GNU, told broadcaster Libya Alahrar that it was not clear when a crash report would be ready, but that the jet was a leased Maltese aircraft. He added that officials did not have “sufficient information regarding its ownership or technical history,” but said this would be investigated. Turkiye’s defence ministry had announced Haddad’s visit earlier, saying he had met with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and Turkish counterpart Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, along with other Turkish military commanders.",

      "summary_en": "The Libyan army’s chief of staff, Mohammed Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, died in a plane crash on Tuesday after leaving Turkiye’s capital Ankara as well as four others that were on the jet as well. “This followed a tragic and painful incident while they were returning from an official trip from the Turkish city of Ankara. This grave loss is a great loss for the nation, for the military institution, and for all the people,” Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah said in a statement. According to the Washington DC-based Stimson Centre , Libya has effectively split into two virtual quasi-states since 2014. The west is ruled by the Government of National Unity (GNU), of which Dbeibah is the prime minister, while the east is run by Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar’s Libyan Armed Forces. Dbeibah said the commander of Libya’s ground forces, the director of its military manufacturing authority, an adviser to the chief of staff, and a photographer from the chief of staff’s office were also on the aircraft. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X that the plane had taken off from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport at 1710 GMT en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost at 1752 GMT. He said authorities found the plane’s wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara’s Haymana district. He added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana, but that no contact was established. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said an investigation into the crash was under way. The Tripoli-based GNU said in a statement that the prime minister directed the defence minister to send an official delegation to Ankara to follow up on proceedings. Walid Ellafi, state minister of political affairs and communication for the GNU, told broadcaster Libya Alahrar that it was not clear when a crash report would be ready, but that the jet was a leased Maltese aircraft. He added that officials did not have “sufficient information regarding its ownership or technical history,” but said this would be investigated. Turkiye’s defence ministry had announced Haddad’s visit earlier, saying he had met with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and Turkish counterpart Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, along with other Turkish military commanders.",

      "summary_orig": "DEAR MURAD JAMALI: A bomb planted on a railway track near Dera Murad Jamali exploded on Tuesday, damaging a section of the track, while another explosive device was defused by police. Police said unknown miscreants had planted an improvised explosive device (IED) on the main railway track near the Notal area of Nasirabad district. The device detonated before the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express, coming from Peshawar, reached the site. The explosion damaged a portion of the track, forcing the suspension of train services. “About four feet of the railway track was blown up in the powerful blast,” a senior police officer told Dawn , adding that another IED, weighing around 10 kilogrammes, was found planted at a similar distance from the first blast and was defused by the concerned authorities. Railway officials stopped the Jaffar Express at Dera Murad Jamali and suspended train services between Quetta and other provinces until repairs to the track are completed. Jaffar Express narrowly escapes another attack Following the blast, a heavy contingent of police, the bomb disposal squad, and security forces rushed to the site, cordoned off the area, and launched a search operation to arrest those involved. Police said that over the past two months, around a dozen attempts had been made by miscreants to target the Jaffar Express. In a separate incident, a landmine blast in Dera Bugti district killed three goats and injured five others. Police said the explosion occurred in the Lanjo Saghari area, where unknown individuals had planted an underground landmine for sabotage purposes. Further investigation is underway.

Police said that over the past two months, around a dozen attempts had been made by miscreants to target the Jaffar Express. In a separate incident, a landmine blast in Dera Bugti district killed three goats and injured five others. Police said the explosion occurred in the Lanjo Saghari area, where unknown individuals had planted an underground landmine for sabotage purposes. Further investigation is underway.

      "summary": "DEAR MURAD JAMALI: A bomb planted on a railway track near Dera Murad Jamali exploded on Tuesday, damaging a section of the track, while another explosive device was defused by police. Police said unknown miscreants had planted an improvised explosive device (IED) on the main railway track near the Notal area of Nasirabad district. The device detonated before the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express, coming from Peshawar, reached the site. The explosion damaged a portion of the track, forcing the suspension of train services. “About four feet of the railway track was blown up in the powerful blast,” a senior police officer told Dawn , adding that another IED, weighing around 10 kilogrammes, was found planted at a similar distance from the first blast and was defused by the concerned authorities. Railway officials stopped the Jaffar Express at Dera Murad Jamali and suspended train services between Quetta and other provinces until repairs to the track are completed. Jaffar Express narrowly escapes another attack Following the blast, a heavy contingent of police, the bomb disposal squad, and security forces rushed to the site, cordoned off the area, and launched a search operation to arrest those involved.

      "title_orig": "Riwzan Ali suffers first MMA defeat as Ismail Khan erupts",
      "summary_orig": "In a night of stark contrasts that laid bare the brutal beauty of mixed martial arts, Pakistan’s fighting corps experienced both a poignant end and a violent new beginning at Brave CF 103 on Tuesday. The nation witnessed its undefeated king, Rizwan ’The Haider’ Ali, dethroned, only to see another warrior, Ismail ‘The Volcano’ Khan, announce his arrival as a genuine global force with a breathtaking finish. The main event carried the hopes of a nation on the shoulders of its brightest star, Rizwan. Entering the Bukhara arena with an unblemished 11-0 record and seven first-round finishes, the PAKMMA superstar faced a daunting task: defeating the local hero, Nozim ‘The Bukhara Warrior’ Kalandarov, in his own fortress. Trouble appeared before the fight even began, with the 28-year-old Rizwan missing the lightweight limit, forcing the bout to a 72kg catchweight. In the cage, a more critical problem emerged. Kalandarov executed a flawless grappler’s game plan, securing takedowns with ease in every round. Despite a valiant defensive effort, Rizwan, a feared striker, had no answer for the relentless control and top pressure. After three rounds of one-sided dominance, the judges’ unanimous decision was a mere formality, ending Rizwan’s historic unbeaten run. In a display of true sportsmanship and resilience, Rizwan addressed the setback directly. “I was the only undefeated fighter of Pakistan fighting on the highest stage — I took a fight against a hero in Central Asia,” Rizwan stated while talking to Dawn . “I carried an injury throughout the camp but still decided to go ahead. My loss will go a long way in teaching me lessons that will help me rise. Big thanks to the people who supported me and I will come back stronger.” The eruption of the volcano Earlier in the evening, the Pakistani flag was flown with ruthless authority by Ismail. Facing Kyrgyz submission specialist Rayimbek Tazhibaev in a 60.5kg catchweight bout, ‘The Volcano’ delivered a performance that was anything but catchweight in its significance. Displaying terrifying fight IQ, Ismail masterfully neutralised his opponent’s strengths. He battered Tazhibaev with heavy leg kicks and crisp boxing, even out-grappling the grappler by securing takedowns and maintaining crushing top control. In the second round, after rocking his foe with a clean combination, Ismail smelled blood. He secured a takedown, advanced to full mount, and seamlessly locked in his signature move — a vicious head-arm triangle choke. The submission was so tight it rendered Tazhibaev unconscious, forcing the referee to stop the fight. Pumping his fists and roaring in triumph, Ismail climbed the cage, embodying the explosive promise of his moniker. “The arm triangle is my favourite submission,” stated a confident Ismail in his post-fight interview. “I train it constantly.

      "summary_en": "In a night of stark contrasts that laid bare the brutal beauty of mixed martial arts, Pakistan’s fighting corps experienced both a poignant end and a violent new beginning at Brave CF 103 on Tuesday. The nation witnessed its undefeated king, Rizwan ’The Haider’ Ali, dethroned, only to see another warrior, Ismail ‘The Volcano’ Khan, announce his arrival as a genuine global force with a breathtaking finish. The main event carried the hopes of a nation on the shoulders of its brightest star, Rizwan. Entering the Bukhara arena with an unblemished 11-0 record and seven first-round finishes, the PAKMMA superstar faced a daunting task: defeating the local hero, Nozim ‘The Bukhara Warrior’ Kalandarov, in his own fortress. Trouble appeared before the fight even began, with the 28-year-old Rizwan missing the lightweight limit, forcing the bout to a 72kg catchweight. In the cage, a more critical problem emerged. Kalandarov executed a flawless grappler’s game plan, securing takedowns with ease in every round. Despite a valiant defensive effort, Rizwan, a feared striker, had no answer for the relentless control and top pressure. After three rounds of one-sided dominance, the judges’ unanimous decision was a mere formality, ending Rizwan’s historic unbeaten run. In a display of true sportsmanship and resilience, Rizwan addressed the setback directly. “I was the only undefeated fighter of Pakistan fighting on the highest stage — I took a fight against a hero in Central Asia,” Rizwan stated while talking to Dawn . “I carried an injury throughout the camp but still decided to go ahead. My loss will go a long way in teaching me lessons that will help me rise. Big thanks to the people who supported me and I will come back stronger.” The eruption of the volcano Earlier in the evening, the Pakistani flag was flown with ruthless authority by Ismail. Facing Kyrgyz submission specialist Rayimbek Tazhibaev in a 60.5kg catchweight bout, ‘The Volcano’ delivered a performance that was anything but catchweight in its significance. Displaying terrifying fight IQ, Ismail masterfully neutralised his opponent’s strengths. He battered Tazhibaev with heavy leg kicks and crisp boxing, even out-grappling the grappler by securing takedowns and maintaining crushing top control. In the second round, after rocking his foe with a clean combination, Ismail smelled blood. He secured a takedown, advanced to full mount, and seamlessly locked in his signature move — a vicious head-arm triangle choke. The submission was so tight it rendered Tazhibaev unconscious, forcing the referee to stop the fight. Pumping his fists and roaring in triumph, Ismail climbed the cage, embodying the explosive promise of his moniker. “The arm triangle is my favourite submission,” stated a confident Ismail in his post-fight interview. “I train it constantly. When it’s on, I know I can put any fighter to sleep.” The victory extends Ismail’s undefeated streak and marks his fourth consecutive win under the Brave CF banner, solidifying his position as one of the promotion’s most dangerous rising talents. While the loss of Rizwan’s ‘0’ marks the closing of a legendary chapter for Pakistani MMA, his gracious response and determined vow to return set the stage for a compelling comeback saga.

      "summary_orig": "PTI founder Imran Khan‘s sisters — Aleema Khan, Noreen Khan Niazi and Uzma Khan — ended their sit-in and left Rawalpindi’s Factory Naka on Tuesday night, hours after they were again barred from moving towards Adiala jail in a bid to meet the incarcerated ex-premier. Over the past several weeks, the PTI founder has been denied meetings in prison with his family, party members and lawyers, prompting them to stage sit-ins near or outside the prison complex every Tuesday and Thursday — the court-mandated days for visiting Imran. At times, police also used water cannons and baton charges to disperse them. A Dawn correspondent said that the PTI founder’s sisters left Factory Naka at around 9:30pm and moved towards Gorakhpur on foot, before heading home. Meanwhile, traffic resumed on the thoroughfare as soon as the 6-hour sit-in ended. Half an hour before that, the Saddar police station house officer arrived at the protest site and began negotiations with PTI’s Shaukat Basra and Meena Khan Afridi. After initial talks, the PTI leaders reached out to Imran’s sisters for consultation. An earlier post shared on the PTI’s official X account showed that the sit-in was ongoing at 7pm. In a video shared in the post, PTI workers are seen shouting slogans of “Prime Minister Imran Khan“. A Dawn correspondent confirmed that police had installed a riot fence near the Factory Naka in Rawalpindi, and upon reaching the spot, Imran’s sister, along with party workers, staged a sit-in. Earlier today, a PTI livestream showed crowds of party supporters marching towards the prison on Adiala Road, before being stopped in front of the riot fence, where they chanted slogans and waved Pakistani and PTI flags. On the occasion, Aleema said that Imran was being kept in “solitary confinement”, stressing that the “government had become so fearful of Imran’s message that they had resorted to breaking the law” — in a reference to the police presence at the scene. Speaking to reporters, Aleema said that the authorities are afraid of Imran, which is why they have jailed him. When asked about the statement issued after the TTAP’s two-day conference, she said it “was not a statement”. “The PTI people are saying that they want to negotiate (with the government), I responded by saying that Imran Khan has instructed Sohail Afridi to take to the streets and lead a movement,” she said. She added that this last message came from lawyer Salman Safdar, who represented the PTI founder when he was convicted in the Toshakhana 2 case on Saturday. “Whoever says that we should negotiate with the government after Imran gave these instructions, they cannot be a member of Imran Khan’s party,” Aleema stated. “We will sit here and we will not leave Imran Khan. She questioned what the government wants to negotiate when meetings with the PTI founder have been banned. “Tell me why I cannot have meetings (with Imran),“ she said. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja spoke to reporters and said that the party’s struggle is now a national one for democracy and judicial independence. “These punishments are unlawful and wrong,” Raja said when asked about Imran’s conviction. “Punishments have been handed out before. These are false cases. “We are standing against a system of lies and will file appeals. But the true cases will be fought in the public‘s court and Allah’s court,” he added. Raja said that Imran would be released when “the people decide on this case”. Asked about the street movement, the secretary general said that Imran instructed the KP CM to lead it in the province. “Sohail Afridi is ready and this will occur soon,” he replied, adding that when the time comes, there will be a similar movement in Punjab. In response to a question about negotiations with the government, Raja said: “These are false reports; Imran has given nobody in the party the power to start talks with the government. “Only [TTAP chief Mahmood Khan] Achakzai and [Senator] Allama Nasir have the power to do this,” he added. “Achakzai sahib gave his statement during the conference. He said that he will not negotiate with people who break into and rob his house.” Raja affirmed that the PTI would stand by its principles and their claim that the February 8 elections were “stolen”. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case. As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. On Monday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan would remain suspended till February 8. More to follow.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan Peoples Party Senator Palwasha Khan on Tuesday submitted a privilege motion in a Senate committee against Communications Minister Aleem Khan for reacting in a manner “highly unbecoming” to hold public office. A heated exchange was witnessed between Minister for Communications Aleem Khan and Senator Palwasha Khan last week during a meeting of the Senate Committee on Communications over a question related to the construction of a road project. Palwasha blamed Aleem for personal attacks as he reacted angrily to parliamentary scrutiny. “We will treat you the way we are treated,” Aleem had responded, saying that he cannot stand the allegations levelled against him. During a press conference in Islamabad today, the senator, along with other party members, condemned the behaviour of the communications minister. She emphasised that it was not a personal matter, but a question of the collective dignity of parliament, and that remaining silent on this would not be appropriate. View this post on Instagram “If we tolerate and don’t raise our voice against this, it will soon become the norm.” She clarified that she did not blame anyone. “I had submitted a written question a few months ago under the rights granted to lawmakers. However, the responsible officials never responded, which subsequently led to this question being added to the agenda of the Senate’s Standing Committee.” Palwasha elaborated that she raised a question over a road built by the National Highway Authority and funded by the taxpayers’ money. “I asked whether it was built for public benefit or to give an advantage to a specific society.” “Raising questions on the utilisation of public resources is the fundamental duty of the legislators,” she added. “Time will decide who was at fault and who was subjected to injustice,” The senator said. PPP senator thanked her party leadership for “clearly” declaring that the party will never compromise on the “dignity of the parliamentarians and the democratic rights of lawmakers”. “A Senate committee is not a drawing room; it is the extension of the parliament in which everyone is answerable, where not the voice but the argument should be strong.” “Unfortunately, people mix up indecency and coarseness with courage,” she indicated. She further stated that the communication minister’s behaviour was neither “democratic” nor “up to the standards of parliament”. “The dignity comes through the practices, not the personalities.” She further said, “Politics is not a circus, but it has become one in our country. We will resist this.” The senator maintained that her party had always defended the dignity of the parliament, women’s rights and democratic values. “I am not against anyone,” she said. “However, PM Shehbaz Sharif has to consider the attitude of his cabinet members. It is a collective responsibility, and the PM is primarily responsible for it.” The senator further stated that “disrespecting women cannot become a routine“, and added that she would also release media which will ”further expose the minister“. She also demanded that the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) be constituted to conduct a forensic audit of all matters related to the Communications Ministry based on the revelations in the IMF report. The senator also lamented the conduct of the committee chairman for “not giving a ruling or interrupting”. Earlier, PPP leader Sherry Rehman had said that Aleem must apologise following his heated exchange with Palwasha. “He must apologise. I am not even going to say that it is necessary because she is a woman. She is due that basic right of respect as an honourable member of Parliament from a federal minister,” she said. PPP on Sunday also termed the verbal attacks by the minister “disappointing”. “Humiliation of a party woman is intolerable and the PPP will not sit silent on the matter,” he said. Without naming the minister, the PPP secretary general said: “The arrogance of power was speaking loudly. The sanctity of the (standing) committee was marred,” Mr Khan said.",

      "summary_orig": "LAKKI MARWAT: Eight terrorists were killed in a search operation launched after five cops were martyred when their police mobile came under attack in Gurguri area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak on Tuesday. The district police spokesman, Shaukat Khan, confirmed the incident and the casualties, saying that all of the martyred personnel were constables. The martyred policemen were identified as constables Shahid Iqbal, Samiullah, Arif, Safdar and Muhammad Abrar, who was also the mobile’s driver, Khan added. He said that on the instructions of the Kohat Regional Police Office and the Karak district police officer, a joint operation between the Karak Police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) was launched in the area. “Eight terrorists were killed as they were pursued through tricky and mountainous terrain,” Khan said. “The bodies of the slain terrorists have been shifted to the hospital for a post-mortem, while the process of identifying them is underway.” While the exact details of the attack remain unclear, an image shared by the police spokesman showed what appeared to be the charred remains of the vehicle. Meanwhile, a press release from the Karak Police stated that funeral prayers had been offered for the five martyrs, who were presented with full honours. “In the funeral prayer ceremony, a decorated contingent of police offered a salute to the martyrs, while flowers were placed on the bodies of the martyrs wrapped in the national flag,” the press release read. Karak Police added that the funeral prayers were attended by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah and KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed, among other civilian and police officials. Karak Police offer funeral prayers for five personnel martyred in an attack on a police vehicle in Karak on December 23. — Photo courtesy Karak Police The CM and chief secretary “met the relatives of the martyrs, expressed their grief and sorrow and paid tribute to their great sacrifice”, the press release added. “The senior officers also assured the relatives of all possible cooperation, government benefits and welfare facilities.” The statement further said that IG stated that the martyred police personnel sacrificed their lives for the maintenance of law and order and the protection of the public, which will never be forgotten. He further clarified that the KP police would continue its fight against terrorism with full force, professionalism and determination, vowing retaliation for martyrs’ blood. CM Afridi was quoted as saying that the sacrifices of martyrs are expensive and that the police have always been on the front line in combating terrorism. He added that the government stands by the police, who are being provided with modern equipment. “Elements hostile to peace will not be forgiven under any circumstances. The sacrifices of the martyred police personnel are a source of pride not only for the police force but also for the entire nation, and their memories will always live on,” CM Afridi as quoted as saying. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the incident, expressing deep sorrow and grief over the lives lost and offering prayers for the martyred officers, according to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office. He extended his condolences to the bereaved families and assured them of the government’s full support during this difficult time. The prime minister paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police force, stating that police personnel had always played a frontline role in the war against terrorism and rendered “unparalleled” services to ensure peace and security in the country. “The entire nation salutes the martyrs who laid down their lives in the line of duty,” the prime minister said, adding that their sacrifices would never be forgotten. Reiterating the government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan remained fully committed to the complete elimination of terrorism in all its forms. Separately, district police spokesperson Asif Hassan told Dawn that an assistant sub-inspector, Rehmatullah, and a passerby were injured during an exchange of fire between police and wanted suspects in Lakki Marwat’s Tajori area. Today‘s attack on the vehicle is the latest in a series of incidents in which police personnel have been targeted in the province. Last week, a police official and his brother were martyred in a gun attack in KP’s Lakki Marwat. Earlier this month, a cop was martyred while five others were injured in a suicide blast targeting a police mobile in Lakki Marwat. In November, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in Hangu.",
