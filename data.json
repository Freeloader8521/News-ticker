      "summary_orig": "Violent clashes erupted along the Pak-Afghan border late on Saturday night after unprovoked attacks by Afghan Taliban forces targeted multiple posts. The Pakistan Army retaliated to the attacks and gave a strong response, said security sources. “In a prompt and intense response, Pakistani forces effectively targeted several Afghan border posts,” security officials confirmed. There are reports of significant damage inflicted on multiple Afghan posts and militant formations, according to security sources. Pakistan Army is reportedly used artillery, tanks, and both light and heavy weapons in its response, added security sources. The clashes broke out after Kabul accused Islamabad of carrying out air strikes on the Afghan capital earlier this week, according to Taliban border forces. “In retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces“, Taliban border forces in the east are “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas”, the Afghan military said in a statement. Taliban officials from the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika, Khost, and Helmand — all located on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan — confirmed the clashes. Islamabad did not confirm that it was behind the attacks, but called on Kabul “to stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on its soil”. A subsequent statement from security sources said: “Several Afghan soldiers were killed and kharijite formations retreated due to effective and intense retaliation by Pakistani forces. Afghan posts failed to provide covering fire to kharijites. Reports of heavy losses to several Afghan posts and kharijite formations.” “Kharijites and Daesh hideouts inside Afghanistan, operating under the patronage of the interim Afghan government, are being effectively targeted. Pakistan is using artillery, tanks, light, and heavy weapons. In addition, air resources and drones are also being used to target Daesh and kharijite hideouts. The headquarters of Afghan forces, which have been sheltering Daesh and Fitna al-Khawarij, are also being targeted.” In a series of posts on X, the state broadcaster issued the following statement quoting security sources: “Unprovoked firing from the Afghan side at Pak-Afghan border,a strong ,intense response from Pakistan Army. Afghan forces carried out unprovoked firing at several locations, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral, and Baramcha (Balochistan).” It said Pakistan was currently “targeting terrorist camps and hideouts of khawarij, ISIS located near the Pak-Afghan border inside Afghanistan with great precision. Afghan forces have retreated from several areas”. The Afghan Ministry of Defence stated that Afghan forces launched “retaliatory operations against Pakistani security forces” tonight. “The operations ended at midnight. If the opposing side violates Afghanistan’s territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly,” said the statement. The past week was particularly charged with statements to and fro from both sides as Pakistan suffered a string of martyrdoms of security forces in intelligence-based operations, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out,” Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly. Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups.\nAfghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan a day ago. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.” Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited India earlier this week, marking India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. Speaking about the Thursday night explosion in Kabul during a press conference in New Delhi a day ago, Muttaqi had condemned the incident and Pakistan for its alleged role in it. Earlier, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry did not directly respond when questioned whether Pakistan was responsible for the attacks. “To safeguard Pakistani lives and properties, what measures need to be taken will be taken,” he told reporters. The Foreign Office had avoided directly acknowledging strikes in Kabul, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil. Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.",

      "title_orig": "TLP protesters set up overnight camp in Muridke; dozens injured during clashes",
      "summary_orig": "Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) supporters have camped at Muridke for the night as they continued attempts to reach Islamabad to stage a protest in ‘solidarity with Palestinians’. Punjab Police, in an attempt to stop the march towards the federal capital, have reportedly dug a trench on the road. Earlier in the day, clashes between supporters of the religious party and police were reported in the Shahdara area of Lahore earlier today. At least 40 police personnel have been injured today, while the TLP claims that more than 10 of its workers have been killed in clashes with law enforcers. TLP began its protests in Lahore on Thursday and announced plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to voice its opposition to the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after two years of conflict in Gaza. The demonstrations turned violent on Friday, with police launching baton charges and firing tear gas at protesters who had pelted\nthem with rocks, AFP journalists saw. Arrests in Karachi Police in Karachi arrested over a dozen TLP workers on Saturday in a bid to break up their protest at the Karachi Press Club (KPC). Roads leading to JPC were blocked earlier in the day. DIG South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that 18 TLP workers were apprehended when they arrived at Regal Chowk in Saddar. A spokesperson for the religious party, Mohammad Rehan Khan, told Dawn.com that as part of the country-wide protest, they had planned to demonstrate outside the KPC against the Punjab government’s action against their protest rally in Lahore. He said since all roads leading to the KPC were blocked, they could not reach the venue and confirmed that some party workers were detained by the police. ‘Cleared them from Lahore’ Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran, addressing the media, said some police personnel were still admitted in hospitals and undergoing treatment, while others have been discharged. He added that TLP protesters have also damaged government property. “We have records of 15 calls from citizens stating that the protesters have stolen their vehicles. You have seen how this group behaves in the past. The common citizen is the one who is suffering the most, roads are blocked, and property has been damaged,” said the senior police officer. He elaborated that the police station in Shahdara was also ransacked by TLP supporters. “The frontline force for internal security is the police, and state institutions are backing us. We have cleared them from Lahore and the situation has settled somewhat. We are trying to make sure there is as little damage as possible.” Offering the religious party an olive branch, Kamran said that they are open to talks. “But if you continue to inconvenience the public and vandalise property, then the state is ready to deal with the situation.” Giving an overview of the situation, he said 112 police personnel have been injured since the start of the protest and added that some police personnel are also missing. “They [the TLP] are showing footage of where they are taking the abducted policemen,” said the DIG. Punjab Police question TLP’s motives Punjab Police posted a lengthy statement on X questioning the TLP’s motives behind the march. Video footage attached to the post showed policemen being beaten and cars with shattered windshields. “A peace agreement has been reached in Gaza, the Muslims there are celebrating and thanking Allah for the establishment of peace; why are the TLP demonstrators representing by wreaking havoc in Pakistan?” the police asked in the statement. “It is clear from such actions that the TLP people are also saddened by the establishment of peace in Gaza and this anarchist group is actively supporting the mission of Israeli Jews,” the statement added. The police questioned how kidnapping police personnel and engaging in widespread vandalism displayed loyalty to the people of Gaza. “Some anarchist groups from the TLP are misleading the public in the name of religion and trying to disrupt the peace,” the statement read. “Attacks on police officers and road closures will not be tolerated under any circumstances.” Punjab Police warned that people who take the law into their own hands would be dealt with an iron fist and urged the public to avoid supporting “mischievous elements”, be mindful of misinformation and cooperate with the authorities. Residents in twin cities face disruptions Residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have complained of road closures, traffic jams, and mobile network disruptions. Activities across the twin cities remained disrupted for the second consecutive day amid security measures and traffic restrictions, with authorities also suspending mobile internet connections and closing major roads. Shipping containers were being placed as barriers across major roads in the capital in anticipation of the arrival of the protesters. Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi told Dawn.com that no TLP protesters have entered the city, nor have any within the capital taken to streets to demonstrate. “With the exception of Faizabad, all roads in Islamabad are open,” he said in a voice note. “There are no issues. Some containers have been placed on certain roads, but traffic is still able to move.” According to an earlier notification issued by the Islamabad Traffic Police, “entry of all types of heavy vehicles into the capital will remain suspended until further notice.” “Traffic diversions are being implemented due to the law and order situation in Islamabad’s Faizabad area, and commuters are advised to use alternative routes to avoid inconvenience,” the notification added. Residents of the twin cities voiced frustration over the severe traffic disruptions. Shazia Tahir, a resident of Islamabad, told Dawn.com that her usual 20-minute commute to work took more than an hour due to multiple road closures. “I went to Radio Pakistan [office] this morning — the highway from Khanna was closed, and all connecting streets to Rawalpindi were blocked. Faizabad was also sealed. From the highway near Khanna Bridge, I had to take the service road through Sohan, then pass Margalla Town, take the road between Aabpara and F-6 to finally reach the Red Zone via Margalla Road. It took us one hour and fifteen minutes to get there,” she said. Others reported communication disruptions alongside traffic issues. Fauzia Kulsoom, a journalist from Rawalpindi, told Dawn.com that mobile services in Islamabad’s Blue Area remained suspended from 2pm to 5pm the previous day. “The Internet has been down for two days,” she said, adding that her work has been severely disrupted because of that. Some residents described partial closures and heavy congestion in several areas. Riaz Ali, a resident of Bahria Town, Islamabad, told Dawn.com that while containers had been placed and certain routes blocked, movement elsewhere remained possible. “Containers exist, some roads are blocked — Faizabad and GT Road — but things are otherwise open. I haven’t travelled over the past couple of days, but data services are still off,” he said. He added that on GT Road, near City Grammar School, containers had been placed on both sides, causing severe traffic jams. “There were large trucks, and only a few bikers managed to pass through the narrow gaps between the containers. Police presence was minimal, just a couple of officers. At the entrance to Bahria Phase 7, traffic was also backed up. In short, traffic was choked badly in this part of Bahria yesterday,” he said. Meanwhile, citizens in other parts of the country trying to travel to Islamabad also voiced frustration over the road closures and communication outages. Ramna Saeed, an Islamabad resident currently in Gujranwala, said she was unable to travel to the capital for her final LLB exam due to road closures. “All main entry points — Chanda Qila, Sadoki, Kamoki — were shut since morning, and trenches were dug overnight. We haven’t seen such measures here before,” she said. Ramna added that students and commuters were left stranded, with little information on when routes would reopen. “Mobile internet has also been disrupted, and although calls work, 3G and 4G services are barely functioning,” she said. Key intersections, including Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh Turn, DAV College Chowk, MH Chowk, and Naz Cinema, were closed to traffic. In the Saddar area, Haider Road, Suzuki Stand, and Murree Chowk were also blocked, while access roads leading to Kachehri Chowk remained inaccessible, per the traffic police notification. It said partial traffic movement resumed at Sawan Bridge and New Gulzar-i-Quaid, but major interchanges such as Chakri, Thalian, Brahma, and Mandara stayed closed, severing Rawalpindi’s access from major highways. The situation was similar at rural entry points, with Dholtala Mor, Misa Kaswal, Bai Khan Bridge, and GT Road near Gujar Khan all shut down. Meanwhile, motorway authorities said M-1 was open only towards Peshawar, while M-2 remained closed in both the Rawalpindi and Lahore directions. Friday clashes following protest call As many as 50 police officers were injured in Friday’s clashes, a senior police official told AFP , while TLP’s claims that some of its members had been killed could not be verified independently. The TLP said the protests had originally been organised to oppose the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Pakistan backed, but was now intended to express solidarity with Palestinians. “We have no demands, apart from showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad. “We have no idea when we will reach Islamabad, but the government is being brutal with us. We are not negotiating with the government at all,” Irfan said. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry vowed on Thursday not to let the protesters enter Islamabad. “There is no room for any radical activity in Islamabad,” he told reporters. “Why is an agreement that is acceptable to Hamas and Palestine not acceptable to you?” Israel declared a ceasefire and began pulling back its troops at around noon on Friday, as tens of thousands of Palestinians began walking back towards their devastated homes. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the deal on Thursday as a “historic opportunity to secure lasting peace”. “We will continue to work with partners, friends and the leaders of brotherly nations to ensure that peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people are established,” he said.

      "summary_en": "Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) supporters have camped at Muridke for the night as they continued attempts to reach Islamabad to stage a protest in ‘solidarity with Palestinians’. Punjab Police, in an attempt to stop the march towards the federal capital, have reportedly dug a trench on the road. Earlier in the day, clashes between supporters of the religious party and police were reported in the Shahdara area of Lahore earlier today. At least 40 police personnel have been injured today, while the TLP claims that more than 10 of its workers have been killed in clashes with law enforcers. TLP began its protests in Lahore on Thursday and announced plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to voice its opposition to the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after two years of conflict in Gaza. The demonstrations turned violent on Friday, with police launching baton charges and firing tear gas at protesters who had pelted\nthem with rocks, AFP journalists saw. Arrests in Karachi Police in Karachi arrested over a dozen TLP workers on Saturday in a bid to break up their protest at the Karachi Press Club (KPC). Roads leading to JPC were blocked earlier in the day. DIG South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that 18 TLP workers were apprehended when they arrived at Regal Chowk in Saddar. A spokesperson for the religious party, Mohammad Rehan Khan, told Dawn.com that as part of the country-wide protest, they had planned to demonstrate outside the KPC against the Punjab government’s action against their protest rally in Lahore. He said since all roads leading to the KPC were blocked, they could not reach the venue and confirmed that some party workers were detained by the police. ‘Cleared them from Lahore’ Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran, addressing the media, said some police personnel were still admitted in hospitals and undergoing treatment, while others have been discharged. He added that TLP protesters have also damaged government property. “We have records of 15 calls from citizens stating that the protesters have stolen their vehicles. You have seen how this group behaves in the past. The common citizen is the one who is suffering the most, roads are blocked, and property has been damaged,” said the senior police officer. He elaborated that the police station in Shahdara was also ransacked by TLP supporters. “The frontline force for internal security is the police, and state institutions are backing us. We have cleared them from Lahore and the situation has settled somewhat. We are trying to make sure there is as little damage as possible.” Offering the religious party an olive branch, Kamran said that they are open to talks. “But if you continue to inconvenience the public and vandalise property, then the state is ready to deal with the situation.” Giving an overview of the situation, he said 112 police personnel have been injured since the start of the protest and added that some police personnel are also missing. “They [the TLP] are showing footage of where they are taking the abducted policemen,” said the DIG. Punjab Police question TLP’s motives Punjab Police posted a lengthy statement on X questioning the TLP’s motives behind the march. Video footage attached to the post showed policemen being beaten and cars with shattered windshields. “A peace agreement has been reached in Gaza, the Muslims there are celebrating and thanking Allah for the establishment of peace; why are the TLP demonstrators representing by wreaking havoc in Pakistan?” the police asked in the statement. “It is clear from such actions that the TLP people are also saddened by the establishment of peace in Gaza and this anarchist group is actively supporting the mission of Israeli Jews,” the statement added. The police questioned how kidnapping police personnel and engaging in widespread vandalism displayed loyalty to the people of Gaza. “Some anarchist groups from the TLP are misleading the public in the name of religion and trying to disrupt the peace,” the statement read. “Attacks on police officers and road closures will not be tolerated under any circumstances.” Punjab Police warned that people who take the law into their own hands would be dealt with an iron fist and urged the public to avoid supporting “mischievous elements”, be mindful of misinformation and cooperate with the authorities. Residents in twin cities face disruptions Residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have complained of road closures, traffic jams, and mobile network disruptions. Activities across the twin cities remained disrupted for the second consecutive day amid security measures and traffic restrictions, with authorities also suspending mobile internet connections and closing major roads. Shipping containers were being placed as barriers across major roads in the capital in anticipation of the arrival of the protesters. Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi told Dawn.com that no TLP protesters have entered the city, nor have any within the capital taken to streets to demonstrate. “With the exception of Faizabad, all roads in Islamabad are open,” he said in a voice note. “There are no issues. Some containers have been placed on certain roads, but traffic is still able to move.” According to an earlier notification issued by the Islamabad Traffic Police, “entry of all types of heavy vehicles into the capital will remain suspended until further notice.” “Traffic diversions are being implemented due to the law and order situation in Islamabad’s Faizabad area, and commuters are advised to use alternative routes to avoid inconvenience,” the notification added. Residents of the twin cities voiced frustration over the severe traffic disruptions. Shazia Tahir, a resident of Islamabad, told Dawn.com that her usual 20-minute commute to work took more than an hour due to multiple road closures. “I went to Radio Pakistan [office] this morning — the highway from Khanna was closed, and all connecting streets to Rawalpindi were blocked. Faizabad was also sealed. From the highway near Khanna Bridge, I had to take the service road through Sohan, then pass Margalla Town, take the road between Aabpara and F-6 to finally reach the Red Zone via Margalla Road. It took us one hour and fifteen minutes to get there,” she said. Others reported communication disruptions alongside traffic issues. Fauzia Kulsoom, a journalist from Rawalpindi, told Dawn.com that mobile services in Islamabad’s Blue Area remained suspended from 2pm to 5pm the previous day. “The Internet has been down for two days,” she said, adding that her work has been severely disrupted because of that. Some residents described partial closures and heavy congestion in several areas. Riaz Ali, a resident of Bahria Town, Islamabad, told Dawn.com that while containers had been placed and certain routes blocked, movement elsewhere remained possible. “Containers exist, some roads are blocked — Faizabad and GT Road — but things are otherwise open. I haven’t travelled over the past couple of days, but data services are still off,” he said. He added that on GT Road, near City Grammar School, containers had been placed on both sides, causing severe traffic jams. “There were large trucks, and only a few bikers managed to pass through the narrow gaps between the containers. Police presence was minimal, just a couple of officers. At the entrance to Bahria Phase 7, traffic was also backed up. In short, traffic was choked badly in this part of Bahria yesterday,” he said. Meanwhile, citizens in other parts of the country trying to travel to Islamabad also voiced frustration over the road closures and communication outages. Ramna Saeed, an Islamabad resident currently in Gujranwala, said she was unable to travel to the capital for her final LLB exam due to road closures. “All main entry points — Chanda Qila, Sadoki, Kamoki — were shut since morning, and trenches were dug overnight. We haven’t seen such measures here before,” she said. Ramna added that students and commuters were left stranded, with little information on when routes would reopen. “Mobile internet has also been disrupted, and although calls work, 3G and 4G services are barely functioning,” she said. Key intersections, including Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh Turn, DAV College Chowk, MH Chowk, and Naz Cinema, were closed to traffic. In the Saddar area, Haider Road, Suzuki Stand, and Murree Chowk were also blocked, while access roads leading to Kachehri Chowk remained inaccessible, per the traffic police notification. It said partial traffic movement resumed at Sawan Bridge and New Gulzar-i-Quaid, but major interchanges such as Chakri, Thalian, Brahma, and Mandara stayed closed, severing Rawalpindi’s access from major highways. The situation was similar at rural entry points, with Dholtala Mor, Misa Kaswal, Bai Khan Bridge, and GT Road near Gujar Khan all shut down. Meanwhile, motorway authorities said M-1 was open only towards Peshawar, while M-2 remained closed in both the Rawalpindi and Lahore directions.

      "title_orig": "Deflecting responsibility can’t absolve Afghan govt of obligations towards regional peace: FO",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday night censured Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for remarks during his visit to India and said “deflecting” the responsibility of controlling terrorism could not absolve the Afghan authorities of their responsibilities towards regional peace. Muttaqi visited India earlier this week, marking India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. Speaking about a Thursday night explosion in Kabul during a press conference in New Delhi a day ago, Muttaqi had condemned the incident and Pakistan for its alleged role in it, saying: “Whatever the problems are in each country should be solved by themselves.” He said there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan. “If other countries achieve peace themselves as we did in Afghanistan, then there will be peace in the entire region. Since the last eight months, there has not been even a small incident in Afghanistan. In four years, no one has been harmed from Afghanistan’s soil. So this is the best proof that we have presented.” In a statement issued today, the FO said Pakistan’s strong reservations on the elements of the India-Afghanistan joint statement were conveyed to Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan by the additional foreign secretary (West Asia & Afghanistan) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. “Pakistan also strongly rejected the Afghan acting foreign minister’s assertion that terrorism is Pakistan’s internal problem,” the FO said, adding that Pakistan had repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan terrorist elements “operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan”. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “It was emphasised that by deflecting the responsibility of controlling terrorism towards Pakistan cannot absolve the Interim Afghan Government of its obligations towards ensuring peace and stability in the region and beyond,” the FO said. Elaborating on reservations regarding the joint statement, the FO said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The joint statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self-determination.” The FO said that Pakistan had “generously” hosted nearly four million Afghans for over four decades “in the spirit of good neighbourliness and Islamic brotherhood”. It said that with peace gradually returning to Afghanistan, it was time for unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan to return to their country. “Like all other countries and in line with international norms and practices, Pakistan has the right to regulate the presence of foreign nationals residing inside its territory. At the same time, along with the repatriation of Afghan nationals, Pakistan has also been generously issuing medical and study visas to address the medical and educational needs of Afghan nationals. In the spirit of Islamic brotherhood and good neighbourly relations, Pakistan will continue to extend humanitarian support to the people of Afghanistan.” “Pakistan is desirous of seeing a peaceful, stable, regionally connected and prosperous Afghanistan. Accordingly, Pakistan has extended all possible trade, economic and connectivity facilitation to Afghanistan. Such measures are aimed at promoting cooperation and socio-economic development of the two countries,” the FO added. At the same time, it said the government had the responsibility to “take all possible measures for the safety and security of its people”. The FO concluded by saying that Pakistan “expects the interim Afghan government to play its due role in supporting Pakistan to achieve this noble objective by taking concrete measures to prevent its territory from being used” by terrorist elements against Pakistan. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said earlier that Afghanistan’s export of terrorism would vitiate the atmosphere and cause a fissure in bilateral relations that Pakistan did not desire. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. The past week was particularly charged with statements to and fro from both sides as Pakistan suffered a string of martyrdoms of security forces in intelligence-based operations, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. Addressing the matter in an interview with Geo News , Asif said: “The terrorism they’re exporting to Pakistan, there will be a fissure created in relations in this environment, which is not our desire. We want our relations to continue respectfully.” The defence minister also called on people to monitor and take notice of any suspicious activity in their midst and take action as a community against any terrorist facilitators. “If you remain silent due to fear or any other reason, then I think it is understood as agreement.’’ Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out,” Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly. Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups. Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan a day ago. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.” Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.",

      "summary_en": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday night censured Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for remarks during his visit to India and said “deflecting” the responsibility of controlling terrorism could not absolve the Afghan authorities of their responsibilities towards regional peace. Muttaqi visited India earlier this week, marking India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. Speaking about a Thursday night explosion in Kabul during a press conference in New Delhi a day ago, Muttaqi had condemned the incident and Pakistan for its alleged role in it, saying: “Whatever the problems are in each country should be solved by themselves.” He said there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan. “If other countries achieve peace themselves as we did in Afghanistan, then there will be peace in the entire region. Since the last eight months, there has not been even a small incident in Afghanistan. In four years, no one has been harmed from Afghanistan’s soil. So this is the best proof that we have presented.” In a statement issued today, the FO said Pakistan’s strong reservations on the elements of the India-Afghanistan joint statement were conveyed to Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan by the additional foreign secretary (West Asia & Afghanistan) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. “Pakistan also strongly rejected the Afghan acting foreign minister’s assertion that terrorism is Pakistan’s internal problem,” the FO said, adding that Pakistan had repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan terrorist elements “operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan”. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “It was emphasised that by deflecting the responsibility of controlling terrorism towards Pakistan cannot absolve the Interim Afghan Government of its obligations towards ensuring peace and stability in the region and beyond,” the FO said. Elaborating on reservations regarding the joint statement, the FO said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The joint statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self-determination.” The FO said that Pakistan had “generously” hosted nearly four million Afghans for over four decades “in the spirit of good neighbourliness and Islamic brotherhood”. It said that with peace gradually returning to Afghanistan, it was time for unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan to return to their country. “Like all other countries and in line with international norms and practices, Pakistan has the right to regulate the presence of foreign nationals residing inside its territory. At the same time, along with the repatriation of Afghan nationals, Pakistan has also been generously issuing medical and study visas to address the medical and educational needs of Afghan nationals. In the spirit of Islamic brotherhood and good neighbourly relations, Pakistan will continue to extend humanitarian support to the people of Afghanistan.” “Pakistan is desirous of seeing a peaceful, stable, regionally connected and prosperous Afghanistan. Accordingly, Pakistan has extended all possible trade, economic and connectivity facilitation to Afghanistan. Such measures are aimed at promoting cooperation and socio-economic development of the two countries,” the FO added. At the same time, it said the government had the responsibility to “take all possible measures for the safety and security of its people”. The FO concluded by saying that Pakistan “expects the interim Afghan government to play its due role in supporting Pakistan to achieve this noble objective by taking concrete measures to prevent its territory from being used” by terrorist elements against Pakistan. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said earlier that Afghanistan’s export of terrorism would vitiate the atmosphere and cause a fissure in bilateral relations that Pakistan did not desire. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. The past week was particularly charged with statements to and fro from both sides as Pakistan suffered a string of martyrdoms of security forces in intelligence-based operations, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty.

      "summary_orig": "A session of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly was summoned for October 13 to elect the next chief minister, as Governor Faisal Karim Kundi confirmed the receipt of Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation from the top provincial slot on Saturday. KPA Speaker Babar Saleem Swati posted the schedule for Monday’s session on his X account. It said the election for the next chief minister would be held on the date. On Wednesday, Gandapur said that he resigned from his role as the provincial chief executive, while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the CM’s role. However, his resignation letter, which was shared with the media the previous night, had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s house denying having ever received it. “Today at 2:30 pm, the handwritten resignation advice of the CM Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was duly received and acknowledged by Governor House,” Kundi posted on X earlier today. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he added. ‘PTI will eradicate terrorism under KP’s new leadership’ PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said during a press conference today that under the leadership of incoming CM Sohail Afridi, the party will eradicate terrorism in KP. “Any complaints that have arisen recently from the government will be resolved,” he said. “On Monday, Sohail Afridi will be sworn in as the new KP chief minister.” “Afridi will be the first CM to hail from the tribal areas. He is young and determined,” Raja added. “This province will progress greatly under his leadership. We hope for an end to bloodshed through diplomacy, so we can eradicate terrorism in the region.” The PTI secretary general also noted that under Article 130(8) (the chief minister may, by writing under his hand addressed to the president, resign his office) of the Constitution, a chief minister can resign from office and does not require the acceptance or approval of the governor. Responding to a question about why no notification was issued for CM Gandapur’s resignation, Raja said that notifications “are just for information” and serve no purpose. Meanwhile, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in an interview on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan reiterated Raja’s point about the constitution granting the CM freedom to resign from their post. “It’s written in the constitution that if the governor accepts the resignation, then the house will select its leader and CM,” he said. “It is shameful that a local rivalry with the governor is being played upon like this “He (CM Gandapur) wants his resignation accepted immediately so that Sohail Afridi, [PTI founder] Imran Khan’s pick for CM, can sit in the seat. This cannot be left up in the air.” When asked to confirm if there would be a session at the KP assembly on Monday, Akram replied in the affirmative. “We have the numbers,” he said. “There is a clear majority if there is no misadventure.” When asked if the PTI will consult with the federal government about an alternative candidate, the party spokesperson replied: “We do not have to consult with the government about who we nominate. It is the PTI’s and Imran Khan’s mandate. Did the government consult us on bringing Maryam and Bugti in as CMs? “He (Afridi) has been a cabinet member for one and a half years. If he were a facilitator, then why did nobody say anything then?” The PTI information secretary reiterated that the PTI stands against terrorists but believes that collateral damage in military operations could create an insurgency and make the population vengeful and vindictive. “Khan sahib says we are against terrorism, but for the long-term benefit, you cannot mire the country in insurgencies,” he said. Earlier, Gandapur left for Dera Ismail Khan after saying farewell to his staff at the chief minister’s house. In his first media interaction after resi­g­ning, Gandapur had pressed for the swift acceptance of his resignation on Thu­rsday night. He said any delay in the process would be detrimental to the province.",

The parade, which began late on Friday, marked the 80th anniversary of the foundation of its ruling Workers’ Party and followed celebrations on Thursday. Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev, as well as Vietnam’s Communist Party chief To Lam, were seen at Kim’s side at the parade, while other foreign dignitaries looked on. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watches a military parade celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers Party, in Pyongyang, North Korea, in this picture released on October 11, by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency. —KCNA via Reuters In the military parade, nuclear-armed North Korea displayed its most advanced Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, described by KCNA as the country’s “strongest nuclear strategic weapon system.” The Hwasong series of ICBMs has given North Korea the capacity to target anywhere on the US mainland, but questions remain over the sophistication of its guidance system to reach a target, and the ability of a warhead it carries to withstand atmospheric re-entry. “The Hwasong-20 represents, for the moment, the apotheosis of North Korea’s ambitions for long-range nuclear delivery capabilities. We should expect to see the system tested before the end of this year,” said Ankit Panda of the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The system is likely designed for the delivery of multiple warheads… Multiple warheads will increase stresses on existing US missile defence systems and augment what Kim sees as necessary to achieve meaningful deterrence effects against Washington.” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends a military parade celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK), in Pyongyang, North Korea, picture released October 11, by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency. —KCNA via Reuters Other weapons on display included hypersonic ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, a new type of multiple rocket launcher and a launcher for suicide drones, said Hong Min, North Korea analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification. At the military parade, Kim gave a speech in which he expressed “warm encouragement” for North Korean troops in overseas operations, adding its military’s heroism will not only be seen in the defence of North Korea but also in “outposts of socialist construction,” KCNA said. “Our army should continue to grow into an invincible entity that destroys all threats,” Kim said.

Kim told Medvedev he hopes to continue strengthening cooperation with Russia and to closely engage in diverse exchanges to achieve common goals, KCNA said.

      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday assailed the PTI-led KP government for “facilitating terrorists, sowing division, and undermining national security,” stressing that the sacrifices of Pakistanis in the fight against terrorism will not be in vain. The information minister’s remarks come a day after the spokesperson for the military’s media wing, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, without naming anyone, said the “state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of a single person deemed most responsible for bringing terrorism back to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.” “In the past week alone, there have been several terrorist attacks which were bravely and courageously repelled by officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Army,” Tarar said. Referring to PTI, he said during this time, there remains only one party, “Tehreek-i-Inteshaar” (movement of chaos) which has no concern for the sacrifices of our martyrs, no concern for the integrity of the country, and whose only interest is in “further dividing KP, worsening the situation, and creating safe havens for terrorists within the province.” “This is not a story of today,” the minister continued. “For decades, Imran Khan and his party have followed this pattern, showing sympathy for terrorists at the local, regional, and even international levels, and acting as their facilitators.” “This nation has sacrificed so much. Pakistan is the only country whose children have also given their lives,” he said. “How can we forget the students of the APS Peshawar attack , those children who wrote a legendary chapter of sacrifice in blood, a story that will live forever in history. [How] can we forget the children martyred recently in Khuzdar , those who were attacked on a bus. How can we forget their sacrifices?” He said he had personally visited Khuzdar and Quetta.  “When we spoke to the parents of those children, they were such brave and remarkable people. One man, whose three sons were martyred, stood with complete courage and resolve and said, ‘My own life is also ready to be sacrificed for Pakistan.’” He said the province had borne the brunt of militancy for decades, yet its citizens had remained steadfast. “You will find countless examples of how the brave people of KP have rendered immense sacrifices for this country, whether they are from the armed forces, civilians, tradesmen, doctors, engineers, or shopkeepers and children; every segment of society has sacrificed for Pakistan,” Tarar said. “And when the entire country expressed its resolve to eradicate terrorism through the implementation of the National Action Plan, everyone saw how the armed forces, the federal government under Nawaz Sharif, and the provincial governments defeated terrorism through operations such as Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad .” Recalling the years when terrorism gripped the country, Tarar said it was a time when fear overshadowed daily life. “This was the time when our cricket grounds had become deserted, every city would witness a terrorist incident every other day; this was the time when our ulema, our citizens, our children were sacrificing their lives,” he added. He said the nation could not forget the Parade Lane mosque attack , in which retired officers, children, and citizens were martyred, adding that the terrorists have no caste, creed, or colour. “They only believe in violence and promoting terror. They have no god or prophet. They have nothing to do with any religion or Islam.” The minister said the State of Pakistan exists in the name of the Kalima; the whole world views it as a strong Islamic country. To attack the mosques of that state, to attack its armed forces, to attack the law enforcers of that state, to carry out terrorist activities inside that state; this is not permissible in any way, not by any standard, and Islam also does not permit it. He said the ulema have already issued fatwas (edicts) stating that no jihad can be waged against the state of Pakistan. “These terrorists do not spare even mosques,” he said, adding that the sacrifices of those people [against terrorism] will never go in vain. Criticising Imran, Tarar said there was one person in jail who believed the sacrifices of the nation held no value. “If there is respect, it is for how politics can be polished, and in that sense those people who chant the slogan ‘Khan Nahi, To Pakistan Nahi’ [we] regard such politics as a curse in which, by favouring a personality, you push Pakistan backwards and bring the personality forward,” he said. He added that no political party had ever resorted to such slogans before, recalling that when Benazir Bhutto was martyred, PPP workers chanted, ‘Pakistan khappay’ (long live Pakistan). “The leadership of the PML-N has always spoken for this country even in the most difficult circumstances,” he said, questioning, “What slogan have you [Imran Khan] given to your Pakistan? Is your personality the greatest, and everyone else below it?” Talking about Operation Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad, he asserted that peace was established in 2017, but in 2018, when the KP government took over, it invited and resettled terrorists in the province. He alleged there was a reason behind this — an illegal spectrum through which the KP government promotes smuggling, illegal trade, and an undocumented economy. “This includes non-custom-paid cars business, oil smuggling, food smuggling, tobacco and timber business, in which terrorists and the KP PTI government have a nexus. The KP govt, the PTI benefits through these,” he said, adding that these people also fund Imran. He said they settled the militants in populated areas, helped them establish businesses, and entered formal trade partnerships with them. That “successful scheme,” he remarked, is now haunting the nation as “we pick up bodies every day.” He added that this would not be allowed to continue. “The state of Pakistan will never permit any person or group to support these terrorists. The state of Pakistan has decided that it will defeat the terrorists. “When history is written, on one side will be our brave people and on the other the Tehreek-i-Inteshaar (PTI), which believed there was an advantage in supporting terrorists.” Talking about the newly appointed Chief Minister of KP, Sohail Afridi , he said that when it came to selecting a CM, they chose someone who has cases against him, “who is known to be involved in drug peddling and drug business”. Tarar added that this was part of the same black economy through which PTI gains benefits. The minister asserted that “there have been speculations that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was becoming the militant wing of PTI”. “I hope this is not true, but this is being speculated”, he said. ‘We stand for the blood of martyrs’: PTI Meanwhile, PTI leadership held a press conference in Islamabad today in response to DG ISPR’s presser, asserting that the party stands for the blood of the martyrs and warning that misrepresenting PTI would not erase the people’s love for Imran. “Yesterday, a very emotional press conference was held. We will not respond to it word for word, but we know that we are loyal to Pakistan, and ninety per cent of the country’s people stand with Imran Khan,” said PTI’s Secretary General, Salman Akram Raja. “Khan Sahib has always made us a nation; we were raised on Allama Iqbal’s ideals. We stand for the blood of the martyrs. Calling us traitors is a misunderstanding that will harm this country,” he said. “For God’s sake, come to your senses. The nation stands with Imran Khan and PTI. You cannot remove the love for Imran Khan from the hearts of the people. The Pakistani nation knows who is truly loyal to this country and this nation.”",

Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Peshawar Dr Mian Saeed told Dawn.com that three more terrorists had been intercepted and additional reinforcements dispatched for the operation. “Hasan Khel police, displaying courage, bravery and professionalism, have repelled the terrorist attack after a 2-hour fight,” he said in a statement. “The police used modern weapons like sniper guns during the encounter.” “There are fears that the terrorists may be killed during the exchange of fire, as the police thwarted their nefarious intentions through timely action,” the statement said, adding that heavy police force had been called in. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. A day ago, two terrorists, including one reported to be the mastermind behind the killing of four officials in April, were killed in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Bannu district, according to the Counter-Terrorism Department.

      "summary_orig": "Six policemen, including trainees, were martyred and 13 others — 12 policemen and a civilian — were injured in a terrorist attack on the Police Training School in Dera Ismail Khan district, which security forces and law enforcement personnel successfully repelled, the military’s media wing said on Saturday. According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), on the night of October 10–11, assailants attempted to breach the perimeter of the Police Training School, but “their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response of law enforcement personnel deployed on duty.” In their desperation, the attackers rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the gate of the complex, the statement added. “Displaying unwavering courage and professional excellence, police personnel engaged the intruders, eliminating three Khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij, the ISPR said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “While cornering the remaining two intruding Khwarij in a building complex, they were later neutralised by security forces in a deliberate clearance operation with precision,” the statement read. The military’s media wing said that during the intense exchange of fire, six brave policemen, including trainees, “embraced martyrdom after putting up a heroic fight”, while 12 policemen and one civilian were injured. “During this heinous attack, Khwarij attacked the mosque inside the school complex and not only desecrated the holy place of worship but also barbarically killed the imam [of] the masjid, an innocent civilian who was performing the duties of Imam at the school,” the statement read. ISPR said the sanitisation operation is continuing in the area, and the perpetrators of the “heinous and cowardly act will be brought to justice.” “The security forces, alongside law enforcement agencies of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain steadfast in their resolve to eradicate Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further strengthen our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the statement said. Earlier in the day, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) had also issued a statement, saying that the police had repulsed the attack. At the time, officials had said that at least three terrorists, including a suicide bomber, were killed in retaliatory fire by police forces. A report issued by the CTD, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , showed that seven cops were martyred while another 13 were injured in the incident. Dera Ismail Khan Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Hamid Siddiqui also confirmed the casualties to Dawn.com . According to the CTD report, the attack took place at 8:30pm on Friday within the limits of the Shorkot Police Station. “A National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) office near the training centre was also burnt down by terrorists,” Dera Ismail Khan AC told Dawn.com. The initial attack left one police officer dead, the police statement said. It further said that militants then proceeded to enter the school and started firing with heavy weapons and hand grenades, adding that police forces “retaliated bravely” and the exchange of fire went on for about five hours. “As soon as the news of the attack reached District Police Officer (DPO) Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmed, he rushed to the site with a heavy contingent of police,” the statement read. Regional Police Officer Syed Ashfaq Anwar was present as well, it said, adding that police were then joined by security forces. “The police and security forces jointly set an example of courage and bravery in the five-hour-long operation, killing five terrorists and recovering suicide jackets, explosives and ammunition from them,” as per the police statement. The area has been cleared of the terrorists, and a search operation was underway, the statement said. Lauding the efforts of the forces in thwarting the attack, KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed was quoted as saying, “The unparalleled bravery of the officers on the frontline has proven that the KP police is committed to eradicating terrorism.” Announcing compensation for the martyred, he assured that “their sacrifices will not go in vain”. The KP IG also announced special rewards for all those who participated in the operation. Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel. A senior army officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the DI Khan a day ago. A cop was martyred in the district after a police checkpoint came under attack from multiple sides by terrorists late on Wednesday. Last month, 13 terrorists were killed during an IBO in the district’s Daraban area. According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan captain Shan Masood believes taking 20 wickets, rather than piling up big scores, will be key to winning the upcoming two-match Test series against South Africa, as the hosts prepare spin-friendly conditions for the opener at the Gaddafi Stadium from Sunday. Speaking at the pre-series press conference at the venue on Saturday, Shan said Pakistan’s focus was on creating result-oriented pitches that suit their strengths. “We don’t want flat tracks where matches end in draws,” he remarked. “Sometimes you sacrifice runs to create situations where 20 wickets are possible.” The Pakistan skipper said the approach reflected lessons from the previous World Test Championship (WTC) cycle, where his side struggled to convert opportunities at home. “The idea is to use our home advantage wisely,” he added. The Gaddafi Stadium surface, hosting its first Test of the current WTC cycle from Sunday, is expected to offer assistance to spinners. Pakistan are likely to field up to three slow bowlers, with off-spinner Sajid Khan — now recovered from illness — likely to play a key role. Shan also pointed to the option of reverse swing from the pace attack, depending on conditions. Concerns remain over the recent form of Babar Azam and Salman Ali Agha, but Shan said individual numbers mattered less in low-scoring contests. “In such conditions, even a fifty can be a match-defining contribution,” he said.\nUnder scrutiny himself after a lean run, Shan noted that he finished among Pakistan’s top scorers in the last WTC cycle. “Performance should be judged in context — it’s about winning moments, not averages,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday that Qatar will be allowed to build an air force facility at Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho that will house F-15 fighter jets and pilots. The announcement comes soon after President Donald Trump signed an executive order vowing to defend the Gulf Arab state against attacks, following Israeli air strikes targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital Doha. “We’re signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho,” Hegseth said at the Pentagon, with Qatari Defence Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani at his side. “The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training” as well as “increase lethality, interoperability,” he said. “It’s just another example of our partnership. And I hope you know, your excellency, that you can count on us.” The Idaho base currently also hosts a fighter jet squadron from Singapore, according to its website. Hegseth also thanked Qatar for its “substantial role” as a mediator in the talks that led to a truce and hostage-prisoner swap deal between Israel and Hamas, and its assistance in securing the release of a US citizen from Afghanistan. The Qatari minister hailed the “strong, enduring partnership” and “deep defense relationship” shared by the two countries. The Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is Washington’s largest military facility in the Middle East. Trump’s close relationship with the leaders of Qatar has raised eyebrows, especially over its gift to the US president of a Boeing 747 to be used as Air Force One. Though the Idaho facility for Qatar had apparently been in the works since the last administration of Democrat Joe Biden, the deal prompted some hand-wringing on social media, including from far-right activist Laura Loomer, usually a Trump ally. “Never thought I’d see Republicans give terror financing Muslims from Qatar a MILITARY BASE on US soil so they can murder Americans,” Loomer wrote on X. Hegseth, who never said it was a base, later wrote on the platform: “Qatar will not have their own base in the United States — nor anything like a base.\nWe control the existing base, like we do with all partners.“",

      "summary": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday that Qatar will be allowed to build an air force facility at Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho that will house F-15 fighter jets and pilots. The announcement comes soon after President Donald Trump signed an executive order vowing to defend the Gulf Arab state against attacks, following Israeli air strikes targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital Doha. “We’re signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho,” Hegseth said at the Pentagon, with Qatari Defence Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani at his side. “The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training” as well as “increase lethality, interoperability,” he said. “It’s just another example of our partnership. And I hope you know, your excellency, that you can count on us.” The Idaho base currently also hosts a fighter jet squadron from Singapore, according to its website. Hegseth also thanked Qatar for its “substantial role” as a mediator in the talks that led to a truce and hostage-prisoner swap deal between Israel and Hamas, and its assistance in securing the release of a US citizen from Afghanistan. The Qatari minister hailed the “strong, enduring partnership” and “deep defense relationship” shared by the two countries. The Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is Washington’s largest military facility in the Middle East. Trump’s close relationship with the leaders of Qatar has raised eyebrows, especially over its gift to the US president of a Boeing 747 to be used as Air Force One. Though the Idaho facility for Qatar had apparently been in the works since the last administration of Democrat Joe Biden, the deal prompted some hand-wringing on social media, including from far-right activist Laura Loomer, usually a Trump ally. “Never thought I’d see Republicans give terror financing Muslims from Qatar a MILITARY BASE on US soil so they can murder Americans,” Loomer wrote on X. Hegseth, who never said it was a base, later wrote on the platform: “Qatar will not have their own base in the United States — nor anything like a base.\nWe control the existing base, like we do with all partners.“",

A huge column of displaced Gazans filed north through the dust and rubble towards Gaza City, the enclave’s biggest urban area, which had been under attack just days ago in one of Israel’s biggest offensives of the war. “Thank God my house is still standing,” said Ismail Zayda, 40, in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City. “But the place is destroyed, my neighbours’ houses are destroyed, entire districts have gone.” The Israeli military said the ceasefire agreement had been activated at noon local time (0900 GMT). Israel’s government ratified the ceasefire with Hamas in the early hours of Friday, clearing the way to partially pull back troops and fully suspend hostilities in Gaza within 24 hours. Hamas is expected to release the 20 living Israeli prisoners within 72 hours, after which Israel will release 250 Palestinians serving long terms in Israeli prisons, and 1,700 others detained in Gaza during the war. US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said the Israeli military had completed the first phase of a withdrawal in Gaza and the Israeli, prisoners’ release period had started. Once the agreement is operating, trucks carrying food and medical aid will surge into Gaza to help civilians, hundreds of thousands of whom have been sheltering in tents after Israeli forces destroyed their homes and razed entire cities. Israeli troop pullout In Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, some Israeli troops pulled back from the eastern area near the border, but tank shelling was heard, according to residents. In Nusseirat camp in the centre of the enclave, some Israeli soldiers dismantled their position and headed east towards the Israeli border, though other troops remained in the area after gunfire was heard in the early hours of Friday. Israeli forces pulled out from the road along the Mediterranean coast into Gaza City. “As soon as we heard the news of the truce and ceasefire, we were very happy and got ready to go back to Gaza City, to our homes. Of course there are no homes — they’ve been destroyed,” said Mahdi Saqla, 40. “But we are happy just to return to where our homes were, even over the rubble. That too is a great joy. For two years we’ve been suffering, displaced from place to place,” he added. US to deploy troops for Gaza task force The United States will deploy up to 200 troops to Israel to establish a task force to support stabilisation efforts in Gaza, but no Americans are expected to be deployed into the Palestinian enclave, US officials said on Thursday. The US military’s Central Command will stand up the task force, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Center, or CMCC, one of the officials said. The CMCC’s job will be to facilitate the flow of assistance into Gaza, including security assistance and humanitarian aid, officials said. Two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US troops would be the core of the CMCC, but it would also include representatives from Egypt’s military, Qatar, Turkiye and probably the United Arab Emirates. The officials said the joint control centre would coordinate with Israeli forces and other security forces to avoid clashes. “No US troops are intended to go into Gaza,” said one of the officials. Gaza reconstruction Meanwhile, Germany wants to organise an international conference with Egypt for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday, as Israel and Hamas edged closer to ending hostilities. The main goal of this conference “should be to address the most urgent needs, such as rebuilding water and energy supplies and medical care”, Merz said in a statement.

      "summary_orig": "• Law enforcers use tear gas, barricades to contain procession • Dozens of personnel hurt; TLP alleges casualties from police firing • Trenches dug up to block marchers on G.T. Road; Chenab, Jhelum bridges sealed • Talal warns against violence or ‘mob blackmail’ • ATC grants 12-day remand for 110 TLP activists LAHORE: The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) began marching towards Islamabad after Friday prayers, with a large number of supporters reaching Shahdara and staging a sit-in after clashes with police, partially paralysing the provincial capital. The law enforcers repeatedly tried to contain the procession near the group’s headquarters by erecting barricades and containers and using tear gas and other crowd-control measures. In the Gujrat district, local authorities on Friday night dug up trenches at least three locations along the G.T. Road to block the march headed towards Islamabad. However, the TLP, led by its chief Saad Rizvi, not only managed to take out the main procession in Lahore as part of its “Gaza March” but also kept on moving ahead amid religious slogans, rendering the police helpless. Reports suggest that protests turned violent following Friday sermons delivered by prominent religious figures of the organisation at local mosques before the march began to move towards Islamabad from Lahore’s Multan Road. Video circulating on social media appeared to show protesters commandeering heavy vehicles, including cranes reportedly belonging to government departments such as the Lahore Waste Management Company, Rescue 1122 and the Punjab police, to use them in the procession. Scuffles reportedly broke out soon after TLP chief Saad Rizvi delivered a major sermon at the main Friday congregation at the central mosque near the organisation’s headquarters on Multan Road. Later, he addressed a big rally and gave the party workers the go-ahead to move towards Islamabad as per the given plan. Confrontations were reported at multiple locations along Multan Road, including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, near the Civil Secretariat, Bhati Gate, Azadi Chowk and Ravi Bridge (Shahdara). Witnesses said some protesters occupied sections of the Orange Line track to throw stones at police, injuring several officers. Protesters were seen carrying sticks, rods and bricks. Police responded by firing tear-gas shells and, according to witnesses, warning shots in the air to disperse the crowd. On some occasions, the two sides were seen chasing and repelling each other. Sources said three police vehicles were seized and some personnel briefly taken hostage and assaulted, turning stretches of Multan Road into a battleground and disrupting life for nearby residents. A second wave of major scuffles was reported near Azadi Chowk, where several police vehicles were damaged and many officials were injured. Footage on social media showed officers retreating for cover; two superintendents of police were also seen taking positions at safer locations. One video showed an officer being knocked to the ground and bleeding. Police sources said dozens of officers were injured, some seriously, after being pelted with stones and attacked by baton-wielding protesters. The TLP said many of its supporters were injured and alleged that some had died from police firing during the march. Neither claim could be independently verified and no official casualty figures were released. Authorities also accused TLP-linked social media accounts of circulating old images and videos to inflame tensions. By evening, hundreds of TLP workers had gathered near Ravi Bridge awaiting further instructions from Mr Rizvi. Talal’s presser State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of holding protests to misuse the issue of corruption for political gain, reiterating that the government would not allow any group to use violence or blackmail the state. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, he said policy is clear: peaceful protest within the democratic and constitutional framework is a constitutional right. “There is no space for groups to blackmail others, to use mobs, or to use violence to achieve their demands or objectives,” he said. Mr Chaudhry said hundreds of suspects planning violence had been identified, and that provincial governments had already made arrests. “For the government, stopping around 2,000 people is not a problem, but a policy decision was made to use minimum force,” he noted. Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday handed 110 TLP activists to police on a 12-day physical remand in a case relating to violent protests and attacks on law enforcers. Police produced the suspects before the court and sought their custody for interrogation. ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill approved the remand and directed police to conduct the investigation strictly in accordance with the law. Nawankot police have registered an FIR alleging the suspects attacked law enforcement personnel, opened fire, resorted to violence and damaged public property during a protest. Those remanded include Qari Umar Farooq, Basharat Ali, Qari Shabbir Farooqi, Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar, Qari M. Hussain, Qari Muharram Aslam, Qari Khurshid, Hammad Ali, Imran Hussain, Ghulam Nabi, Nazir Hussain aka Nazir Chishti and Muhammad Usama. The judge ordered police to produce the suspects again upon completion of the remand for further proceedings. Meanwhile, local authorities in the Gujrat district on Friday night dug trenches at least three locations along the GT Road. Earlier in the day, both bridges over the Chenab and Jhelum rivers were sealed by parking heavy vehicles across the carriageways. Entry to and exit from Gujrat via several other points were also curtailed for vehicular traffic. However, pedestrians were still allowed to cross the bridges, though officials warned this may become difficult today if further vehicles are added to the barriers. Trenches have been dug near the Jhelum bridge at Sarai Alamgir and on the Wazirabad side of the Chenab. For the first time, a trench has also been dug on GT Road within Kharian city to render vehicular movement virtually impossible. Previously, such trenches were typically limited to approaches near river bridges, including during the 2021 TLP march. A senior law-enforcement official said preparations were in place to create additional trenches at various points along GT Road within the Gujrat district if the march cannot be contained in Gujranwala. Heavy containers have also been parked at multiple locations in Gujrat city and in the towns of Lalamusa, Kharian and Sarai Alamgir. The closures have paralysed daily life, with numerous social and business events postponed. The local business fraternity voiced concern over the prolonged blockade and urged the government to adopt a viable policy to tackle such situations without crippling commercial activity.

      "title": "TLP protesters clash with police as march heads to Islamabad",
      "summary": "• Law enforcers use tear gas, barricades to contain procession • Dozens of personnel hurt; TLP alleges casualties from police firing • Trenches dug up to block marchers on G.T. Road; Chenab, Jhelum bridges sealed • Talal warns against violence or ‘mob blackmail’ • ATC grants 12-day remand for 110 TLP activists LAHORE: The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) began marching towards Islamabad after Friday prayers, with a large number of supporters reaching Shahdara and staging a sit-in after clashes with police, partially paralysing the provincial capital. The law enforcers repeatedly tried to contain the procession near the group’s headquarters by erecting barricades and containers and using tear gas and other crowd-control measures. In the Gujrat district, local authorities on Friday night dug up trenches at least three locations along the G.T. Road to block the march headed towards Islamabad. However, the TLP, led by its chief Saad Rizvi, not only managed to take out the main procession in Lahore as part of its “Gaza March” but also kept on moving ahead amid religious slogans, rendering the police helpless. Reports suggest that protests turned violent following Friday sermons delivered by prominent religious figures of the organisation at local mosques before the march began to move towards Islamabad from Lahore’s Multan Road. Video circulating on social media appeared to show protesters commandeering heavy vehicles, including cranes reportedly belonging to government departments such as the Lahore Waste Management Company, Rescue 1122 and the Punjab police, to use them in the procession. Scuffles reportedly broke out soon after TLP chief Saad Rizvi delivered a major sermon at the main Friday congregation at the central mosque near the organisation’s headquarters on Multan Road. Later, he addressed a big rally and gave the party workers the go-ahead to move towards Islamabad as per the given plan. Confrontations were reported at multiple locations along Multan Road, including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, near the Civil Secretariat, Bhati Gate, Azadi Chowk and Ravi Bridge (Shahdara). Witnesses said some protesters occupied sections of the Orange Line track to throw stones at police, injuring several officers. Protesters were seen carrying sticks, rods and bricks. Police responded by firing tear-gas shells and, according to witnesses, warning shots in the air to disperse the crowd. On some occasions, the two sides were seen chasing and repelling each other. Sources said three police vehicles were seized and some personnel briefly taken hostage and assaulted, turning stretches of Multan Road into a battleground and disrupting life for nearby residents. A second wave of major scuffles was reported near Azadi Chowk, where several police vehicles were damaged and many officials were injured. Footage on social media showed officers retreating for cover; two superintendents of police were also seen taking positions at safer locations. One video showed an officer being knocked to the ground and bleeding. Police sources said dozens of officers were injured, some seriously, after being pelted with stones and attacked by baton-wielding protesters. The TLP said many of its supporters were injured and alleged that some had died from police firing during the march. Neither claim could be independently verified and no official casualty figures were released. Authorities also accused TLP-linked social media accounts of circulating old images and videos to inflame tensions. By evening, hundreds of TLP workers had gathered near Ravi Bridge awaiting further instructions from Mr Rizvi. Talal’s presser State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of holding protests to misuse the issue of corruption for political gain, reiterating that the government would not allow any group to use violence or blackmail the state. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, he said policy is clear: peaceful protest within the democratic and constitutional framework is a constitutional right. “There is no space for groups to blackmail others, to use mobs, or to use violence to achieve their demands or objectives,” he said. Mr Chaudhry said hundreds of suspects planning violence had been identified, and that provincial governments had already made arrests. “For the government, stopping around 2,000 people is not a problem, but a policy decision was made to use minimum force,” he noted. Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday handed 110 TLP activists to police on a 12-day physical remand in a case relating to violent protests and attacks on law enforcers. Police produced the suspects before the court and sought their custody for interrogation. ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill approved the remand and directed police to conduct the investigation strictly in accordance with the law. Nawankot police have registered an FIR alleging the suspects attacked law enforcement personnel, opened fire, resorted to violence and damaged public property during a protest. Those remanded include Qari Umar Farooq, Basharat Ali, Qari Shabbir Farooqi, Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar, Qari M. Hussain, Qari Muharram Aslam, Qari Khurshid, Hammad Ali, Imran Hussain, Ghulam Nabi, Nazir Hussain aka Nazir Chishti and Muhammad Usama. The judge ordered police to produce the suspects again upon completion of the remand for further proceedings. Meanwhile, local authorities in the Gujrat district on Friday night dug trenches at least three locations along the GT Road. Earlier in the day, both bridges over the Chenab and Jhelum rivers were sealed by parking heavy vehicles across the carriageways. Entry to and exit from Gujrat via several other points were also curtailed for vehicular traffic. However, pedestrians were still allowed to cross the bridges, though officials warned this may become difficult today if further vehicles are added to the barriers. Trenches have been dug near the Jhelum bridge at Sarai Alamgir and on the Wazirabad side of the Chenab. For the first time, a trench has also been dug on GT Road within Kharian city to render vehicular movement virtually impossible. Previously, such trenches were typically limited to approaches near river bridges, including during the 2021 TLP march. A senior law-enforcement official said preparations were in place to create additional trenches at various points along GT Road within the Gujrat district if the march cannot be contained in Gujranwala. Heavy containers have also been parked at multiple locations in Gujrat city and in the towns of Lalamusa, Kharian and Sarai Alamgir. The closures have paralysed daily life, with numerous social and business events postponed. The local business fraternity voiced concern over the prolonged blockade and urged the government to adopt a viable policy to tackle such situations without crippling commercial activity.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Friday avoided directly acknowledging strikes in Kabul, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil. The FO, moreover, also emphasised the need for continued dialogue and cooperation with Kabul to address cross-border terrorism. At the weekly FO briefing , spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the security and well-being of its people.” Pakistan “respects the sovereignty of Afghanistan, and remains steadfast in its commitment to fostering dialogue and cooperation with our neighbour to address the shared challenges of terrorism”, the spokesperson said, adding that the security operations were intelligence-driven and aimed at protecting its citizens from terrorist groups, including the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The statement came after twin explosions shook Kabul on Thursday night. Local Afghan media, quoting witnesses, reported fighter jet overflights and bursts of automatic gunfire. They described the blasts as precision air strikes that hit a vehicle and a compound linked to the TTP, suggesting that the intended target was TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud. Meanwhile, reports on Noor Wali Mehsud’s fate were conflicting. Some Pakistan military-linked social media hailed the strike as a potential blow to the TTP leadership, while pro-TTP channels released an audio message purportedly from the TTP chief denying his death and calling the reports “enemy propaganda”. The incident marks one of the most serious escalations between the two neighbours since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. Stresses continued dialogue, cooperation with Kabul to address cross-border terrorism, says Afghanistan’s sovereignty is respected Analysts say that if confirmed a Pakistani strike inside Kabul would be the first such incident in the Afghan capital, although Pakistan has previously conducted operations against TTP targets in other parts of Afghanistan. Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces patience has worn out,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said a day earlier in the National Assembly. Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups. Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the Foreign Office briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said. Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.” India-Afghanistan agreement The Foreign Office refrained from commenting on the agreement between New Delhi and Kabul to reopen their long-shuttered embassies. The agreement was reached during talks in New Delhi between Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Afghanistan’s Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, which marked India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. “Our position on Afghanistan’s bilateral relations with any other country remains that it is a matter between those two countries,” Mr Khan said, adding, “Afghanistan is a sovereign, independent country, and we do not have any particular comment to offer on it.” He further noted that Pakistan’s consistent request to Afghanistan, while respecting its sovereign right to pursue an independent foreign policy, has been that Afghan territory should not be used against Pakistan.
