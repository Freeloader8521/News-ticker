      "summary_orig": "IT has been some years since Anatol Lieven called Pakistan a ‘hard country’, a phrase which didn’t really get much traction. It just didn’t carry enough negative connotations; the rest of the world preferred sobriquets such as ‘failed state’ or ‘the most dangerous country in the world’. It left most of us who live in Pakistan with the sense that we had a tendency to attract attention for all the wrong reasons. And whatever our image, it wasn’t going to be one highlighting our softer attributes. Now, it seems, we ourselves are trying to create a tough brand. Of being known as hard, a powerful state which no one can ride roughshod over, be it enemies within Pakistan or external. These are not mere words. Just over the recent week, a protest originating from Lahore was not allowed to make its way to Islamabad , a destination which has been overrun by many others in the past. This was followed by a crackdown on the TLP, which had announced the protest, combined with allegations of state violence leading to loss of life. And while, the TLP itself has been guilty of violence on more than one occasion, the pattern of the state’s reaction has now become familiar. In the past couple of years, there have been protests in different parts of the country where political parties such as the PTI as well as citizen rights movements such as the PTM or BYC have all alleged loss of life. Religio-political organisations such as the TLP were treated a bit differently but not anymore. Those who convey the master’s message claim that the party will now be disbanded. Around the same time, Islamabad’s relations with Kabul are also at an all-time low. It seems as if the time for playing nice is over and if the terrorist attacks in Pakistan continue, Islamabad will inflict pain on Afghanistan to change its big, bad ways. If earlier the pain was inflicted through refugee repatriation or border controls, now there will be more — the targeting of terrorists based there and skirmishes on the border. Over the weekend, these tensions led to our Gulf brethren entering the fray to soothe the two neighbours . What a turnaround; once seen as the patrons of the Afghan Taliban, Pakistan now needs intermediaries to make nice with them. Picking so many battles leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time. And these battles are being fought at a time when there are reports aplenty of another aggression from India. Be it official or unofficial voices, or even some from across the border, there are warnings enough of unfinished business on the eastern border. And what if this happens at a time when the western border is also tense? Especially as it’s not just the borders which can pose a threat? The tensions with both the neighbours are closely linked to the deteriorating security situation in two provinces — Balochistan and KP. Pakistan’s view is that the eastern and western neighbours are encouraging infiltration of terrorists and providing them with the finances. And so serious is this external factor that the debate over how the discontent in these provinces has been feeding into the violence has been abandoned. In the tough posturing with aggressive neighbours and militant groups, there is confidence that Punjab and Sindh are under control. At this time and age, the absence of a mass people’s movement and violence means all is well. And if in one province, the water issue has led to simmering anger and in the other the government’s legitimacy is under question, these are smaller problems, for repression or concessions (as in Sindh on the water issue and in Azad Kashmir) can lead to a sense of quiet. So much so that the state felt confident in cracking down on the TLP. Success has been declared, for there was no pushback and the street remained quiet. And there is so much applause that few are brave enough to ask what this will mean for the PML-N, whose members may have to face a backlash in their constituencies, as they did in 2018. This security threat will be an additional burden for them. But overall, between the crackdowns on the people, parties, rights movements, militants and angry neighbours, it is difficult not to wonder whether the tough posturing or the effort at shaping a hard state may also be one that is overstretched. At odds with forces within as well as enemies without, what if the burden proves too much? This is not to say it can’t win all these battles. Perhaps it can, though it is worth cautioning against excessive confidence. But there is another downside. Picking so many battles, especially with genuine grassroots movements or mainstream political parties, leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time. Indeed, it is so busy fearing and controlling the people in general that it has no space and goodwill left to push through any reform which is politically hard. If an election has been managed in order to impose unpopular leaders, who is going to push the traders to pay taxes? It is easier to keep them happy and burden others. If a right-wing organisation has to be brought down, who will plan to improve the education sector and take on the wrath of the teachers who may take to the streets? One can only imagine decisions that have been postponed because Imran Khan and Ali Wazir have to be kept behind bars. The list can go on and on. There is a price to be paid for this tough posturing. And what it really cost the hapless people of Pakistan will continue to be calculated for long after this period is over. For the moment, we can only guess what the eventual burden might be.

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least eight alleged terrorists were gunned down by security forces in an operation on Monday, after a team from Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) came under attack near the Kot Lalu area in Daraban, Dera Ismail Khan. The action came in an apparent response to an attack on the SNGPL team, in which security forces reportedly also suffered casualties. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) or other security agencies about their losses until going to press. Sources said the militants were killed after intelligence reports were received about their presence in a nearby jungle, prompting the security forces to launch an offensive in which eight suspects were gunned down. Following the action, the forces cordoned off the area and initiated wide-ranging search-and-clearance operations in the surrounding terrain. Reinforcements were dispatched to secure the site and to pursue the fleeing suspects. Two suspects killed in Swabi encounter; attack on Bannu police station repulsed Officials told reporters that the slain militants allegedly were members of a cell that had been planning a direct attack on the pipeline project. They said the group intended to sabotage the installation — a project of national importance aimed at providing energy, employment and improved services to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Investigations were ongoing and local authorities said they would share further details as the clearance operation and forensic work proceeded. Two killed in Swabi Separately, two militants were killed in a joint operation conducted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Mardan and the Swabi district police before midnight, Ziauddin Ahmad, the district police officer, said on Monday. The incident took place three days after a hand grenade was hurled at the Kalabat police post by unidentified men, in which a constable was martyred. According to a separate press release, the CTD and Swabi police were engaged in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in mountainous Maini village when four alleged militants riding two motorcycles opened fire on the law enforcers. “The CTD operation party retaliated with full vigour.

The official said that after hearing about the attack on the police station, local residents armed with weapons also came out of their houses and assisted police in their action against terrorists. He said that all policemen remain safe in the attack. Meanwhile, two policemen who had been kidnapped from the Peepal Bazaar in Bannu on Monday were freed by their captors.

      "summary_en": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least eight alleged terrorists were gunned down by security forces in an operation on Monday, after a team from Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) came under attack near the Kot Lalu area in Daraban, Dera Ismail Khan. The action came in an apparent response to an attack on the SNGPL team, in which security forces reportedly also suffered casualties. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) or other security agencies about their losses until going to press. Sources said the militants were killed after intelligence reports were received about their presence in a nearby jungle, prompting the security forces to launch an offensive in which eight suspects were gunned down. Following the action, the forces cordoned off the area and initiated wide-ranging search-and-clearance operations in the surrounding terrain. Reinforcements were dispatched to secure the site and to pursue the fleeing suspects. Two suspects killed in Swabi encounter; attack on Bannu police station repulsed Officials told reporters that the slain militants allegedly were members of a cell that had been planning a direct attack on the pipeline project. They said the group intended to sabotage the installation — a project of national importance aimed at providing energy, employment and improved services to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Investigations were ongoing and local authorities said they would share further details as the clearance operation and forensic work proceeded. Two killed in Swabi Separately, two militants were killed in a joint operation conducted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Mardan and the Swabi district police before midnight, Ziauddin Ahmad, the district police officer, said on Monday. The incident took place three days after a hand grenade was hurled at the Kalabat police post by unidentified men, in which a constable was martyred. According to a separate press release, the CTD and Swabi police were engaged in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in mountainous Maini village when four alleged militants riding two motorcycles opened fire on the law enforcers. “The CTD operation party retaliated with full vigour. As a result, terrorists were killed on the spot, and their two accomplices escaped, taking advantage of darkness,” said DPO Ahmad.

      "summary_orig": "AFTER over a week of hostilities during which some of the fiercest exchanges took place between Pakistan and Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, a fragile calm between the two countries has been established. A long-term ceasefire was reached in Doha early on Sunday, where both sides pledged to continue the diplomatic process and find a permanent solution to the prevailing problem — cross-border incursions by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups. Qatar and Turkiye have played a key role in bringing about the truce, and representatives of both Islamabad and Kabul will meet in Istanbul on Saturday to take the process forward. Though the Pakistani state and the Afghan Taliban once maintained cordial relations, matters have nosedived during the hard-line group’s second innings. At the heart of the matter is the sanctuary provided by the Afghan Taliban to the banned TTP and other militant groups that have staged bloody attacks in Pakistan. Though the Taliban deny this, there is overwhelming evidence that suggests that terrorist groups indeed have havens in Afghanistan. Over the last few months, the attacks have increased significantly — over 600 attacks over the past year, according to one report — causing heavy casualties amongst Pakistani security men. It is because earlier attempts at dialogue failed to stop such attacks that the state took action, hitting militant targets across the border. But while this may have sent a strong message to Kabul, if the hostilities continue, it will bode ill for peace in South Asia, as Pakistan will have to face adversaries on two hostile borders. Therefore, the state may have to combine deterrence through military means — in case of further attacks — with sustained diplomacy through common friends and regional allies to arrive at a long-term solution. After the Doha parleys, the Taliban spokesman said there would be no “hostile actions” against Pakistan. While such promises have been made during earlier diplomatic encounters as well, for example earlier this year under Chinese auspices, it is hoped this time the Kabul regime is serious about stopping cross-border militant activity. As Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar noted, a “verifiable monitoring mechanism” is needed to implement the broad details agreed to in Doha, which should be the goal during the next meeting in Turkiye. Though the Taliban may remain in denial, the international community agrees that they continue to host terrorist groups. Therefore, as the de facto government in Afghanistan, it is their duty to prevent these outfits from harming neighbouring states. While some militant groups — the TTP, Al Qaeda — may respond to the Taliban ‘requests’, others, such as IS-K, are unlikely to oblige. However, it is the Taliban’s job as the governing entity in Afghanistan to ensure the security of regional states is not harmed by groups based on its soil. Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2025",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan-Afghanistan peace hinges on Taliban halting incursions: Defence Minister Asif",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that the ceasefire agreement between Islamabad and Kabul was linked to the Afghan Taliban’s ability to rein in terrorists attacking Pakistan from neighbouring soil. The two countries agreed to a ceasefire in Doha at the weekend after days of border clashes that killed dozens, the worst such violence since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021. Ground fighting between the one-time allies and Pakistani airstrikes across their contested 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control terrorists it says operate from safe havens in Afghanistan. “Anything coming from Afghanistan will be [a] violation of this agreement,” Asif said in his office at Parliament in Islamabad. “Everything hinges on this one clause.” The Taliban administration and Afghanistan’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “In the agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkiye and Qatar, it was clearly spelled out that there would not be any incursions,” the minister said. “We have a ceasefire agreement as long as there is no violation of the agreement which is already in force.” The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group operated out of Afghanistan to attack Pakistan “in connivance” with the Taliban, the defence minister said. Kabul has previously denied such accusations. In a separate interview to Al-Jazeera Arabic , he said the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement was to “eliminate the menace of terrorism”. Asif added that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years. He elaborated that both countries concluded that the immediate eradication of terrorism was essential. The two sides, he added, would make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats. Asif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that both countries’ presence served as a guarantee for the accord. The defence minister also appreciated the role played by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in facilitating the agreement. Asif maintained that another meeting would be held next week in Istanbul to finalise the details of the agreement, and an effective mechanism would also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries. He further said that his Afghan counterpart had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which would now be addressed. The defence czar stated that Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years due to terrorism. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalise. As a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities would resume, enabling the latter to use the former’s ports once again. Asif also added that Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents would be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees would continue to be repatriated, he added. The minister said it was premature to claim satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. “We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,” he said. In a separate interview to Arab News , he ruled out the notion that Pakistan had conducted the airstrikes in Kabul on the urging of the United States, saying: “It is total nonsense and nothing else.” He questioned why Pakistan would do so, saying the country had had enough of its involvement in Afghanistan for the past few decades. “We want to stay away and live like decent neighbours. We don’t want to have any involvement in Afghan affairs,” Asif said, adding that Pakistan had “no business” in Afghanistan’s relationship with India or any other country. “Absolutely not. Whatever they want to do in their own territory and doesn’t spill over to our territory, doesn’t become our business.” Doha talks and press release controversy Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said the Doha talks were not held in a bitter atmosphere and credited the Qatari and Turkish officials for it. “Not even an opportunity for confrontation was provided on any conflicting point,” he said, adding that all talk of amendments and additions or deletions was done through the Qatari and Turkish officials. “Direct interaction only happened at the opening, where both sides talked … but all of the engagement was done through Qatar and Turkiye.” Asif added the draft agreement was only one page, contrary to a longer version he said was circulating on social media. He added that an upcoming meeting in Turkiye would further refine the details, such as the mechanism to implement the deal’s aspects. Questioned about his own thoughts about whether the ceasefire would hold, the defence minister said: “I have guarded optimism on the matter; I am hopeful but also remain cautious. Can only say something conclusively given the circumstantial evidence. It is too early at the moment, we must remain hopeful of course.” The minister added that he hoped that the Afghan Taliban would act as a “unified government” and conclude the matter with Pakistan instead of returning tomorrow and saying that separate factions were behind the tensions. He elaborated that in the case of any violation, Qatar and Turkiye would be asked to play their role. Asif added that the mechanism for this entire process would be decided in the meeting on the October 25. The defence minister also stated that the entire TTP leadership was present in Afghanistan, adding that the matter would be taken up in Istanbul as well. He further said that the talks should not be taken to mean that Pakistan would negotiate or hold talks with the TTP, dismissing such a notion. Questioned about changes in Qatar’s press releases on the ceasefire with “tensions on the border” removed in a subsequent statement, Asif acknowledged that there was debate on wherever the word was used, but ultimately Qatar’s press release had nothing to do with the draft of the agreement, adding that he could not divulge its contents. “It is between them. It has absolutely no effect on the agreement,” he said, adding that the incident had no particular implications as were being derived by others.",

Whatever they want to do in their own territory and doesn’t spill over to our territory, doesn’t become our business.” Doha talks and press release controversy Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said the Doha talks were not held in a bitter atmosphere and credited the Qatari and Turkish officials for it. “Not even an opportunity for confrontation was provided on any conflicting point,” he said, adding that all talk of amendments and additions or deletions was done through the Qatari and Turkish officials. “Direct interaction only happened at the opening, where both sides talked … but all of the engagement was done through Qatar and Turkiye.” Asif added the draft agreement was only one page, contrary to a longer version he said was circulating on social media. He added that an upcoming meeting in Turkiye would further refine the details, such as the mechanism to implement the deal’s aspects. Questioned about his own thoughts about whether the ceasefire would hold, the defence minister said: “I have guarded optimism on the matter; I am hopeful but also remain cautious. Can only say something conclusively given the circumstantial evidence. It is too early at the moment, we must remain hopeful of course.” The minister added that he hoped that the Afghan Taliban would act as a “unified government” and conclude the matter with Pakistan instead of returning tomorrow and saying that separate factions were behind the tensions. He elaborated that in the case of any violation, Qatar and Turkiye would be asked to play their role. Asif added that the mechanism for this entire process would be decided in the meeting on the October 25. The defence minister also stated that the entire TTP leadership was present in Afghanistan, adding that the matter would be taken up in Istanbul as well. He further said that the talks should not be taken to mean that Pakistan would negotiate or hold talks with the TTP, dismissing such a notion. Questioned about changes in Qatar’s press releases on the ceasefire with “tensions on the border” removed in a subsequent statement, Asif acknowledged that there was debate on wherever the word was used, but ultimately Qatar’s press release had nothing to do with the draft of the agreement, adding that he could not divulge its contents. “It is between them. It has absolutely no effect on the agreement,” he said, adding that the incident had no particular implications as were being derived by others.",
      "title": "Pakistan-Afghanistan peace hinges on Taliban halting incursions: Defence Minister Asif",
      "summary": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that the ceasefire agreement between Islamabad and Kabul was linked to the Afghan Taliban’s ability to rein in terrorists attacking Pakistan from neighbouring soil. The two countries agreed to a ceasefire in Doha at the weekend after days of border clashes that killed dozens, the worst such violence since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021. Ground fighting between the one-time allies and Pakistani airstrikes across their contested 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control terrorists it says operate from safe havens in Afghanistan. “Anything coming from Afghanistan will be [a] violation of this agreement,” Asif said in his office at Parliament in Islamabad. “Everything hinges on this one clause.” The Taliban administration and Afghanistan’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “In the agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkiye and Qatar, it was clearly spelled out that there would not be any incursions,” the minister said. “We have a ceasefire agreement as long as there is no violation of the agreement which is already in force.” The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group operated out of Afghanistan to attack Pakistan “in connivance” with the Taliban, the defence minister said. Kabul has previously denied such accusations. In a separate interview to Al-Jazeera Arabic , he said the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement was to “eliminate the menace of terrorism”. Asif added that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years. He elaborated that both countries concluded that the immediate eradication of terrorism was essential. The two sides, he added, would make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats. Asif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that both countries’ presence served as a guarantee for the accord. The defence minister also appreciated the role played by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in facilitating the agreement. Asif maintained that another meeting would be held next week in Istanbul to finalise the details of the agreement, and an effective mechanism would also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries. He further said that his Afghan counterpart had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which would now be addressed. The defence czar stated that Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years due to terrorism. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalise. As a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities would resume, enabling the latter to use the former’s ports once again. Asif also added that Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents would be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees would continue to be repatriated, he added. The minister said it was premature to claim satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. “We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,” he said. In a separate interview to Arab News , he ruled out the notion that Pakistan had conducted the airstrikes in Kabul on the urging of the United States, saying: “It is total nonsense and nothing else.” He questioned why Pakistan would do so, saying the country had had enough of its involvement in Afghanistan for the past few decades. “We want to stay away and live like decent neighbours.

      "summary_orig": "Saudi Arabia joined other nations on Monday in welcoming the ceasefire agreed between Pakistan and Afghanistan after days of border hostilities, affirming its support for efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability between the two countries. The ceasefire was agreed early yesterday morning during talks between Afghan and Pakistani delegations in Doha with the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye. A next round of negotiations between the two sides is scheduled to be held in Istanbul on October 25. A statement posted on the Saudi foreign ministry’s X account said it “expresses the kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s welcome of the signing by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Afghanistan of an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries, during the round of negotiations held in Doha.” “The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security that achieves stability and prosperity for the brotherly peoples of Pakistan and Afghanistan. “This kingdom hopes that this positive step will lead to an end to tensions on the border between the two countries,” the statement said. Saudi Arabia — which signed a defence pact with Pakistan last month under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both —  also appreciated the “diplomatic efforts and constructive role” of Turkiye and Qatar in mediating the ceasefire between Islamabad and Kabul. Yesterday, Turkiye’s, Oman’s and Qatar’s foreign ministries had also issued statements welcoming the ceasefire. China, Russia welcome Pak-Afghan ceasefire Meanwhile, in separate statements issued on Monday, China and Russia welcomed the ceasefire agreement reached between Pakistan and Afghanistan. “China welcomes the immediate ceasefire agreed between Pakistan and Afghanistan and commends the peace effort of countries who contributed to the ceasefire,” the Chinese foreign ministry said. China vowed to “continue playing a constructive role for the improvement and development of Pakistan-Afghanistan relations”. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, welcomed the agreement as well, calling on both countries to “expand their cooperation, including in countering terrorism,“ Anadolu Agency reported. Islamabad and Kabul’s intention to engage in dialogue and resolve their disagreements through diplomatic means “forms the basis for maintaining peace between the two countries, which are friendly to us, and serves as an important factor in ensuring regional security,“ the Turkish news agency quoted her as saying. Border clashes The skirmishes on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan began on the night of October 11, when Afghan forces launched an attack on Pakistani border posts. According to the media affairs wing of the Pakistani military, its 23 troops were martyred in the clashes that continued into Oct 12 while over 200 Taliban and affiliated militants were killed. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . Later, clashes again broke out on the night of Oct14 along the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram sector. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said\nthe Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khawarij — the term state has designated for the banned  terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had tried to attack Pakistani border posts in the area but the attacks were effectively repulsed. Subsequently on Oct 15, the ISPR said security forces had repulsed another attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban. However, the Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid alleged earlier in the day that Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. Later in the day, state media reported citing security sources that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghan capital Kabul and the province of Kandahar, targeting terrorists’ hideouts and leadership. This was a little before a 48-hour ceasefire was announced between the two sides. Dawn reported that it was the second ceasefire between the neighbours since hostilities erupted on Oct 11, though the first truce was not publicly announced. It quoted diplomatic insiders as saying that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar had intervened on that occasion to defuse tensions. The ceasefire was extended on October 17. While delegations from Pakistan and Afghanistan were expected to meet in Doha for talks to end border hostilities, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Oct 17, according to a Dawn report . It said incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters. This development followed a gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan. The border clashes had erupted against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists. Pakistan has been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan, since the TTP broke a ceasefire deal with the government and vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel. Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Islamabad had hoped for cooperation on counterterrorism, particularly against TTP. Instead, the Taliban’s refusal to rein in the TTP has become the core irritant. Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations.",

      "summary_orig": "At least two people, both workers of the outlawed Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), were shot dead in a suspected targeted attack in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi on Monday. The attack comes over a week after another worker of the ASWJ was shot dead on the main University Road in Karachi, while in a separate attack in March, a local leader of the party was shot. “A religious scholar-cum-shopkeeper and his employee were shot dead in a suspected targeted attack at Nagan Chowrangi on Monday evening,” SSP Central Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi told Dawn.com. The incident occurred near an ASWJ office, he said. “Armed pillion riders resorted to direct fire on the shopkeeper and his employee and fled,” said Siddiqi, adding that the incident “appeared to be a targeted killing” but the exact motive has not yet been ascertained. “They sustained critical bullet injuries and were transported to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced them dead on arrival,” added the police official. “The deceased have been identified as 32-year-old Shah Ahmed, and 30-year-old Abu Bakar,” New Karachi police said in a separate statement. “One of the deceased, Shah Ahmed, used to sell caps and perfumes,” SSP Central told Dawn.com. Giving details of the investigation, he said, “Investigators have collected five bullet casings fired from a 9mm pistol. CCTV footage has also been obtained from the spot”. AWSJ spokesperson Umar Muawiyah, told Dawn.com that the incident marked the second such attack against their party leaders in recent times, decrying the lack of security around their head office at Nagan Chowrangi. However, Siddiqi told Dawn.com that they had enhanced vigilance in the area “informally.” The ASWJ, a splinter group of the Sipah-e-Sahaba (SS), was formed after the government of former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf banned a handful of religious parties, including the SS in 2002.

      "summary": "At least two people, both workers of the outlawed Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), were shot dead in a suspected targeted attack in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi on Monday. The attack comes over a week after another worker of the ASWJ was shot dead on the main University Road in Karachi, while in a separate attack in March, a local leader of the party was shot. “A religious scholar-cum-shopkeeper and his employee were shot dead in a suspected targeted attack at Nagan Chowrangi on Monday evening,” SSP Central Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi told Dawn.com. The incident occurred near an ASWJ office, he said. “Armed pillion riders resorted to direct fire on the shopkeeper and his employee and fled,” said Siddiqi, adding that the incident “appeared to be a targeted killing” but the exact motive has not yet been ascertained. “They sustained critical bullet injuries and were transported to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced them dead on arrival,” added the police official. “The deceased have been identified as 32-year-old Shah Ahmed, and 30-year-old Abu Bakar,” New Karachi police said in a separate statement. “One of the deceased, Shah Ahmed, used to sell caps and perfumes,” SSP Central told Dawn.com. Giving details of the investigation, he said, “Investigators have collected five bullet casings fired from a 9mm pistol. CCTV footage has also been obtained from the spot”. AWSJ spokesperson Umar Muawiyah, told Dawn.com that the incident marked the second such attack against their party leaders in recent times, decrying the lack of security around their head office at Nagan Chowrangi. However, Siddiqi told Dawn.com that they had enhanced vigilance in the area “informally.” The ASWJ, a splinter group of the Sipah-e-Sahaba (SS), was formed after the government of former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf banned a handful of religious parties, including the SS in 2002. In a first, suspect arrested via ‘facial recognition’ Separately, in a first for Karachi Police, a man was arrested using a “facial recognition” camera. Detailing the development, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said, “an alert was received by ERV data operator that a motorcycle rider was passing through an area having a criminal history”. “EVR staff immediately responded, stopped the person and checked his CNIC”, confirming the suspect’s identity. DIG South, in his statement said, “There were six FIRs registered against him including under terror charges, Telegraph Act at different police stations.” “He was arrested in five cases in the recent past while was declared as absconder in other cases,” he added.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government. The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations , which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements . Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan . A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil. In his first official high-level meeting since he assumed the role of the KP CM on October 15, Afridi presented “important policy directives and announcements”, a post on his office’s X account said. “Terrorism has returned to the province due to the federal government’s wrong policy,” the post quoted CM Afridi as saying. He further claimed that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other Constitutional rights”. “The Centre should realise our sacrifices and release our funds on time. We can only strengthen our police and combat terrorism once we get our funds,” the chief minister said, lauding the KP police’s “unparalleled sacrifices” to eradicate terrorism. “The bulletproof cars provided by the interior minister (Mohsin Naqvi) are defective and old. This is a mockery of KP Police. These vehicles should be recalled,” Afridi said. Affirming that law and order were the provincial government’s top priority, he vowed there would be no compromise on it. “The police would not face a shortage of funds. All required resources will be provided on a priority basis. The police will be equipped with modern equipment and arms.” Responding to the KP chief minister later in the day, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry alleged that funds provided by the federal government were not appropriately used by the provincial government in the fight against terrorism. He asserted that the vehicles dismissed as being inferior by the chief minister were of international standards and the same as those used by federal ministers, institutional officers and anti-terror operations. “Losses are close to zero wherever these vehicles are used.” The state minister alleged that the provincial police was being thrown before terrorists with the move and nothing was being made available to it. He said the move reflected CM Afridi’s “immature thinking”, proved his detractors right and increased the threat to law enforcement agencies. “This is a highly unfortunate decision.” Afridi vows no MPO detention or ‘political’ cases CM Afridi also vowed that “no political individual” will be detained in KP under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, which gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected individuals to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order. In a petition to the Supreme Court last year, PTI founder Imran Khan sought a bar on “indiscriminate and unlawful use of detention orders” under the MPO against political workers, rights activists and political opponents. “Freedom of expression and constructive criticism is a fundamental Constitutional right of everyone,” Afridi was quoted as saying in the post. He further said that no one will be arrested under a “political” first information report (FIR). “These FIRs were registered due to political vendetta. The province has its own specific political culture; we will not let it be ruined. The [KP] police will never subject anyone to political vendettas. No FIR should be registered against any student,” said Afridi, who has remained the provincial president of the PTI’s student wing, the Insaf Students Federation (ISF). “The situation of KP Police should under no circumstances be like that of Punjab Police,” the chief minister quipped, ordering strictly that there should be no torture of prisoners. While vowing there would be no political interference in the police, the KP CM also warned that there should be no public complaints against it. He further said there should be separate enclaves for the police and the media in the provincial government’s housing schemes. ‘Strict action against those who succumbed to pressure’ While alleging that there was an attempt to “steal the public mandate” during the 2024 general elections in KP, Afridi hailed the provincial bureaucracy and police for “protecting the mandate of the province’s people”. “However, unfortunately, some government officials could not bear the pressure and did not protect the public mandate,” the PTI leader said. He vowed to reward those who stood with the people during last year’s elections and to take “strict action” against those who did not do so, directing the chief secretary to identify such people. CM Afridi further asserted, “Zero-tolerance policy against corruption is our party’s most important agenda. […] Strict action will be taken against whoever engages in corruption.” The chief minister also warned that if the public was not satisfied with any government official’s performance, that official would be removed from their role. “I have not come to work in the traditional way. We will have to work outside the traditional manner,” Afridi was quoted as saying. He also announced the establishment of Tribal Medical College and Tribal University of Modern Sciences for the merged districts, adding that playgrounds will be built on the tehsil level in all merged districts (erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas). A Safe City project aimed at reducing crime was also announced for these areas. The PTI leader said a “University of Investigation and Modern Journalism” dedicated to slain journalist Arshad Sharif will be built, while announcing another Revival Plan for Peshawar’s development. The chief minister also pledged to end the “reference culture” for postings and transfers of government employees and to ensure implementation of the two-year policy for these.",

      "summary_orig": "An anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi on Monday again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, in a case pertaining to the November 26, 2024 protests by the PTI. The warrant was reissued due to Aleema’s continued absence from case proceedings. On November 26 last year, more than 10,000 PTI supporters surged into the federal capital, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. As the demonstrators inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk, the police and security troops employed intense teargas shelling to disperse them. Earlier this month, the ATC had issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over non-appearance in the court in the same case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, adjourning the hearing to October 11. Later, on Oct 14, the court issued a non-bailable warrant due to her continued absence, noting that she had now failed to appear twice. During today’s hearing, presided over by ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah, the court once again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for the PTI founder’s sister, as she did not appear in court. The judge directed Superintendent of Police Rawal Division Muhammad Saad to arrest the accused and present her before the court on Oct 22 (Wednesday). The court also issued arrest warrants for Aleema’s guarantor, along with a show-cause and ordered the confiscation of the surety bond. The Rawalpindi ATC also ordered that the property documents filed by the guarantor be sent to deputy commissioner Rawalpindi for verification. Earlier in September, the Rawalpindi police booked Aleema, party lawyer Naeem Panjutha and 40 other PTI-linked activists for alleged violence against a journalist outside Adiala Jail. In Oct last year, Aleema, her sister Uzma, and other PTI supporters were arrested from Islamabad’s D-Chowk for clashing with the police and violating Section 144, a legal provision that restricts gatherings of four or more people in an area to prevent public disorder or unrest. A few days later, they were released from the Jhelum District Jail after a judge granted them bail. Islamabad ATC issues warrants for PTI leaders Separately, an Islamabad ATC issued non-bailable arrest warrants for PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Zain Qureshi, Zartaj Gul, and Ali Bukhari in relation to PTI’s Sangjani rally , held in Sept 2024, it emerged on Monday. On Sept 8, 2024, clashes took place between PTI leaders and the Islamabad police as party supporters rallied on the outskirts of the city, demanding the “immediate release” of ex-premier Imran Khan and criticising the government for marginalising the party. Following that, at least 10 PTI MNAs were arrested. Earlier this month, the court had issued bailable arrest warrants for PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Zartaj Gul and central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram in the case. ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over the hearing today in which the court ordered that the PTI leaders, including Omar Ayub, Zain Qureshi, Zartaj Gul, and Ali Bukhari, be arrested and produced before the court. PTI’s Sher Afzal Marwat appeared on behalf of the accused, and filed an application for the transfer of the case, over which the court has sought arguments. Judge Sipra adjourned the hearing till Oct 23.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump reiterated on Sunday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told him India will stop buying Russian oil, while warning that New Delhi would continue paying “massive” tariffs if it did not do so. “I spoke with Prime Minister Modi of India, and he said he’s not going to be doing the Russian oil thing,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. Asked about India’s assertion that it was not aware of any conversation between Modi and Trump, Trump replied: “But if they want to say that, then they’ll just continue to pay massive tariffs, and they don’t want to do that.” Russian oil has been one of the main irritants for Trump in prolonged trade talks with India — half of his 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods are in retaliation for those purchases. The US government has said that petroleum revenue funds Russia’s war in Ukraine. India has become the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian oil sold at a discount after Western nations shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Trump on Wednesday said Modi had assured him that day that India would stop its Russian oil purchases. India’s foreign ministry said it was not aware of any telephone conversation between the leaders that day, but said that New Delhi’s main concern was to “safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer.” A White House official said on Thursday that India has halved its purchases of Russian oil, but Indian sources said no immediate reduction had been seen. The sources said Indian refiners already placed orders for November loading, including some slated for December arrival, so any cut may start showing up in December or January import numbers. India’s imports of Russian oil are set to rise about 20pc this month to 1.9 million barrels per day, according to estimates from commodities data firm Kpler, as Russia ramps up exports after Ukrainian drones hit its refineries.",
