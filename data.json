In August, Flyadeal, the Saudi low-cost carrier, expanded its operations to Pakistan with inaugural flights landing in Islamabad and Peshawar. The aircraft from Riyadh landed ahead of schedule at 6:08am with 65 passengers on board and was accorded a traditional water salute. In May, Emirati low-cost airline Flydubai commenced operations at Bacha Khan International Airport, with the arrival of flight FZ-375 from Dubai.

      "title_orig": "Who is Tony Blair, the man being touted to run Gaza post war",
      "summary_orig": "Tony Blair, the ex-prime minister who led Britain into a war based on what later turned out to be false claims, is now reportedly eyeing a key role in running post-war Gaza. According to a Financial Times , the former British premier is seeking a senior role in running the war-torn territory under a plan being prepared by US President Donald Trump’s administration. The report by the British daily quoted an anonymous source privy to the details as saying that Blair had been “proposed as the chair of the board of a ‘Gaza International Transitional Authority (Gita)’”. Meanwhile, a BBC report said this governing authority would have the support of the United Nations and Gulf countries. Blair would lead the body before handing back control to Palestinians, it added, and further quoted his office as saying that he would not support any proposal including the displacement of Gazans. Earlier, The Telegraph had reported that a plan — which also envisioned the establishment of Gita — prepared by the ex-PM’s Tony Blair Institute (TBI) for Gaza, had Trump’s backing. These reports emerged after Blair visited the White House in late August to participate in a meeting presided over by Trump. The meeting was called to discuss the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza, as well as post-war plans for the Palestinian territory. If these developments lead to Blair assuming a prominent role in governing the Gaza post war, the question may arise whether he is the right person for the job, particularly in light of his role in the 2003 Iraq war. Blair in office Blair won his first term in office in 1997 as his Labour party swept to power after a gap of 18 years . It marked the inception of Blair’s decade-long premiership, during which he would see two more electoral wins. A BBC report that outlined his tenure in the top office described the Labour party that came into power in 1997 as a “product of a tight-knit group” headed by Blair, his immediate successor in office, Gordon Brown, media chief Alastair Campbell, and British politician Peter Mandelson. The report further described Blair’s first cabinet as a “mix of old and new Labour figures” in which “the hard left was banished to the wilderness”. “And it quickly became clear that only Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown really mattered when it came to the big decisions […] Ministers seemed to come and go with dizzying speed, as the cabinet reshuffle became Blair’s signature move.” Blair’s government gave Britain 10 years of steady economic growth, boosted employment, poured money into schools and hospitals and brought peace to Northern Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement , to put it briefly. In 2004, his government also pressed ahead with plans to open the United Kingdom’s doors to Eastern European migrants. But there were downsides, too, especially in terms of foreign policy. Role in Iraq War One of the most significant factors defining Blair’s time in power was his role in the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq . He led Britain into the war — a move that has been singled out as his biggest failure as the premier. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001 in New York, Blair had expressed support for the US, saying the UK would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Washington. Two years later, the UK would join the US in launching a war in Iraq. The two main US-British arguments in favour of the war were that then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein possessed deployable weapons of mass destruction and posed an immediate or near-term threat to the region, as well as to the US and the UK. A BBC report report recalls that in 2003, “Blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for joining the US-led invasion to MPs and the wider public”. However, the caucus belli began evaporating soon. A Guardian report recounts that just around a month into the war, then-UK spy chief Sir John Scarlett went to Blair’s press secretary Alastair Campbell’s office and asked: “How difficult would it be if it transpired we do not find evidence of Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction programme?” Campbell’s reply was, “Very, very, very difficult.” The then-press secretary’s words would come true for Blair in the years to come when a public inquiry into Britain’s role in the Iraq war would release its findings. Led by John Chilcot, a five-member committee began investigating the matter in 2009 and conclude seven years later that Britain’s decision to go to war in Iraq was a failure born of flawed intelligence, lack of foresight and “wholly inadequate” planning. The Chilcot inquiry, as it came to be known, found that Blair’s decision in 2003 had a “far from satisfactory” legal basis and his case for military action was over-hyped. These findings were released nine years after Blair stepped down as the prime minister in 2007, with his popularity plunging, in which his decision to join the Iraq War seemingly played an instrumental role. The legacy Blair, who had told cheering supporters after his landslide victory in 1997: “A new dawn has broken”, went from being the most popular prime minister in British history to one of the least. When he came to power, his Downing Street residence was “Corporate Headquarters of Cool Britannia”. In 2007, as he prepared to step down, polls showed the British were affluent but disillusioned. The charismatic politician promising to be “purer than pure” ended up the first British prime minister to be quizzed by police in a criminal inquiry , as detectives probed to see if loans were offered to parties in exchange for state honours. On taking power, Blair had said: “Mine is the first generation able to contemplate the possibility that we may live our entire lives without going to war or sending our children to war.” But by the time he left office, from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Kosovo to Sierra Leone, he had sent British troops into battle more than any other preceding British prime minister since World War II. For novelist Robert Harris, the decade of Blair leading Britain was a tragedy. “Blair was of my generation, and this was our shot, if you like. I won’t say we’ve messed it up, but it perhaps hasn’t lived up to all the expectations of that rosy-fingered dawn of May 1, 1997.” And after 10 years interviewing and observing Blair, BBC documentary-maker Michael Cockerell had encapsulated the paradoxes of Blair’s emotional relationship with the British people. “It began when the charismatic prime minister swept people off their feet. But the early glow has long since dimmed, and at the end of the affair, both sides are sadder but wiser,” he had said. Blair as the Middle East envoy After leaving Downing Street, Blair served as the Middle East envoy for a group of international powers, the Quartet, comprising the US, European Union, Russia and the United Nations. The group’s website says its mandate “is to help mediate Middle East peace negotiations and to support Palestinian economic development and institution building”. But according to a report by Al Jazeera , given his role in the Iraq war, Blair was not seen as the right person to facilitate peace in the Middle East right from the start. Francis Beckett, a political writer and co-author of ‘Blair Inc: The Man Behind the Mask’, pointed out to Al Jazeera that “most fatally of all, the difficulty was that when he went to meetings in the Middle East, nobody knew which Tony Blair they were seeing — whether it was Tony Blair the Quartet envoy or Tony Blair the patron of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation or Tony Blair the principle of the consultancy firm Tony Blair Associates”. Al Jazeera reported that Blair’s dealings after the end of his time as the prime minister included “advising Arab governments and consultancy work for the US investment bank JP Morgan”. These dealings, “reportedly netted him millions of pounds” and “left him exposed to accusations of greed from many hardened critics, including those from within the party he led from 1994 to 2007”. Blair’s reported plan for Gaza Blair quit as the Middle envoy for the Quartet in 2015 and set up a non-profit organisation , the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the very next year. According to The Telegraph , the same organisation has now come up with a proposal to establish “a temporary body to rule Gaza, with no displacement of civilians, and a multinational effort to prevent the resurgence of Hamas”. The British daily reported, citing sources, that the plan is known as the “day after”, on which Blair has been working since Israel began its genocide in Gaza in October 2023. The report details that the plan includes the establishment of a Property Rights Preservation Unit, “which would aim to strengthen the rights of Gazans who voluntarily leave the territory by giving them a right to return”. It also mentions the creation of Gita, which, it says, “would rule the post-war strip for several years before handing it over to the Palestinian Authority, which would be expected to undergo significant reforms beforehand”. Meanwhile, questions over Blair’s potential role in running Gaza after the war remain. A recent report by Al Jazeera highlighted: “Palestinian commentators have also said Blair failed them as (Middle East) peace envoy despite the quintessential British role in the conflict stretching over a century. They have argued that while he oversaw economic projects during his tenure, he did little to halt illegal Israeli settlement expansion and settler violence, or advance Palestinian statehood, with some even accusing him of impeding statehood as a friend of Israel.“",

Led by John Chilcot, a five-member committee began investigating the matter in 2009 and conclude seven years later that Britain’s decision to go to war in Iraq was a failure born of flawed intelligence, lack of foresight and “wholly inadequate” planning. The Chilcot inquiry, as it came to be known, found that Blair’s decision in 2003 had a “far from satisfactory” legal basis and his case for military action was over-hyped. These findings were released nine years after Blair stepped down as the prime minister in 2007, with his popularity plunging, in which his decision to join the Iraq War seemingly played an instrumental role. The legacy Blair, who had told cheering supporters after his landslide victory in 1997: “A new dawn has broken”, went from being the most popular prime minister in British history to one of the least. When he came to power, his Downing Street residence was “Corporate Headquarters of Cool Britannia”. In 2007, as he prepared to step down, polls showed the British were affluent but disillusioned. The charismatic politician promising to be “purer than pure” ended up the first British prime minister to be quizzed by police in a criminal inquiry , as detectives probed to see if loans were offered to parties in exchange for state honours. On taking power, Blair had said: “Mine is the first generation able to contemplate the possibility that we may live our entire lives without going to war or sending our children to war.” But by the time he left office, from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Kosovo to Sierra Leone, he had sent British troops into battle more than any other preceding British prime minister since World War II. For novelist Robert Harris, the decade of Blair leading Britain was a tragedy. “Blair was of my generation, and this was our shot, if you like. I won’t say we’ve messed it up, but it perhaps hasn’t lived up to all the expectations of that rosy-fingered dawn of May 1, 1997.” And after 10 years interviewing and observing Blair, BBC documentary-maker Michael Cockerell had encapsulated the paradoxes of Blair’s emotional relationship with the British people. “It began when the charismatic prime minister swept people off their feet. But the early glow has long since dimmed, and at the end of the affair, both sides are sadder but wiser,” he had said. Blair as the Middle East envoy After leaving Downing Street, Blair served as the Middle East envoy for a group of international powers, the Quartet, comprising the US, European Union, Russia and the United Nations. The group’s website says its mandate “is to help mediate Middle East peace negotiations and to support Palestinian economic development and institution building”. But according to a report by Al Jazeera , given his role in the Iraq war, Blair was not seen as the right person to facilitate peace in the Middle East right from the start. Francis Beckett, a political writer and co-author of ‘Blair Inc: The Man Behind the Mask’, pointed out to Al Jazeera that “most fatally of all, the difficulty was that when he went to meetings in the Middle East, nobody knew which Tony Blair they were seeing — whether it was Tony Blair the Quartet envoy or Tony Blair the patron of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation or Tony Blair the principle of the consultancy firm Tony Blair Associates”. Al Jazeera reported that Blair’s dealings after the end of his time as the prime minister included “advising Arab governments and consultancy work for the US investment bank JP Morgan”. These dealings, “reportedly netted him millions of pounds” and “left him exposed to accusations of greed from many hardened critics, including those from within the party he led from 1994 to 2007”. Blair’s reported plan for Gaza Blair quit as the Middle envoy for the Quartet in 2015 and set up a non-profit organisation , the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the very next year. According to The Telegraph , the same organisation has now come up with a proposal to establish “a temporary body to rule Gaza, with no displacement of civilians, and a multinational effort to prevent the resurgence of Hamas”. The British daily reported, citing sources, that the plan is known as the “day after”, on which Blair has been working since Israel began its genocide in Gaza in October 2023. The report details that the plan includes the establishment of a Property Rights Preservation Unit, “which would aim to strengthen the rights of Gazans who voluntarily leave the territory by giving them a right to return”. It also mentions the creation of Gita, which, it says, “would rule the post-war strip for several years before handing it over to the Palestinian Authority, which would be expected to undergo significant reforms beforehand”. Meanwhile, questions over Blair’s potential role in running Gaza after the war remain. A recent report by Al Jazeera highlighted: “Palestinian commentators have also said Blair failed them as (Middle East) peace envoy despite the quintessential British role in the conflict stretching over a century. They have argued that while he oversaw economic projects during his tenure, he did little to halt illegal Israeli settlement expansion and settler violence, or advance Palestinian statehood, with some even accusing him of impeding statehood as a friend of Israel.“",

      "summary_orig": "Sialkot police registered a first information report (FIR) on Monday against multiple suspects for allegedly vandalising the properties of and attacking the members of the Ahmadi community the previous night. The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com ,  was registered at Moutra police station on behalf of Sub-Inspector Amir Ali Sindhu. It invokes Sections 395 (punishment for dacoity), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy a house), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 324 (attempt to commit murder), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of a common object) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. In the FIR, the complainant said he, along with other policemen, was patrolling and checking security arrangements at Bhalowali Chowk on Sunday when they received reports around 8pm of some people having riled others up against the Ahmadi community and gathering them in large numbers at Piro Chak village. There were also reports of them looting and setting properties on fire. “When I reached the spot, around 200-250 people armed with weapons and sticks were present there,” he said, adding that upon seeing the police, they lunged toward them and snatched weapons from two of the policemen. According to the FIR, it was not possible for the police to immediately control the mob as law enforcement personnel were few in number. “So, I contacted the control room after which more personnel were sent,” the FIR quoted the complainant as saying. He added that there was commotion at the site of the incident as residents were “terrorised”. The complainant said the initial probe revealed that on September 21, a woman from the Ahmadi community had died in the village whose burial was not allowed. Meanwhile, he continued, “hatred on basis of religion and enmity” was promoted against the community, causing the law and order situation to deteriorate. Five people were injured during this, the complainant said, adding that they were sent to the hospital. The FIR said further facts of the incidents would become clear after the injured and affected people would be included in the inquiry. It alleged the suspects of “deliberately promoting enmity against the Ahmadi community”, hurting their sentiments, setting their properties on fire, looting them, opening fire on them with the intention to kill, attacking a police party and snatching weapons from them and spreading fear among the residents of the area where the incident took place. The complainant asked for an investigating officer to be assigned to probe the incident. Meanwhile, Sialkot District Police Officer (DPO) Faisal Shehzad told Dawn.com on Sunday night that eight people were injured in the incident, “five of whom are from the Ahmadi community and three from the TLP (Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan)”. He said among the injured from the Ahmadi community, one person was shot at, adding that condition of all the injured was stable. The DPO also said the issue began when the burial of an Ahmadi woman was not allowed at a graveyard established in 1945. Later, some members of the Ahmadi community tortured some others. Two cases were registered — one against the members of the Ahmadi community and another against their adversaries, he added. On Saturday, he continued, some members of the Ahmadi community “beat another person, following which TLP members set two to three of their farm houses and a shop on fire”. The official said they also “tortured” members of the Ahmadi community. “Anti-riot police were called and situation is now normal,” he said, adding that “a case will be registered against (members of) the TLP”. Sunday’s incident comes less than a months after 300 people were booked on terrorism charges in two cases for setting two worship places of the Ahmadi community on fire in Faisalabad. According to the FIRs, TLP ticket-holder Hafiz Rafaqat led the mob, which was armed with rods and bricks. Members of the community who tried to resist were severely beaten, leaving several injured. Previously in July, 51 people were arrested and 142 booked for attacking police and an Ahmadi place of worship in Daska. In April, a 46-year-old businessman was lynched when a few hundred supporters of the TLP had stormed a place of worship belonging to the Ahmadi community in Karachi’s Saddar area to prevent it from observing religious rituals.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday said his government nominated US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize because “he helped save the region from destruction” during a period of Pakistan-India escalation. The Pakistani government in June had decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” to end the India-Pakistan escalation in May. The conflict began after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, launched airstrikes in Pakistan, and faced retaliation . Amid easing tensions following a ceasefire bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations. Responding to a reporter’s question about Pakistan nominating Trump for the Nobel Prize during a press conference in London today, the PM said, “Mr Trump eased tension between Pakistan and India and has saved the region from major destruction.” He emphasised that if Trump had not intervened in the Pakistan-India escalation, “there would be more destruction and loss of lives.” The premier added that Trump has eased tension between Ethiopia and Egypt, and even in Ukraine.” ‘Washington visit very fruitful’ Speaking about his recent meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, PM Shehbaz said that his visit to Washington “was very fruitful; it was very successful.” He said the best thing that happened was that in the UN building, President Trump co-chaired a meeting on Gaza, and he invited Pakistan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia. “There, a very constructive discussion took place, and as a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire,” he said. “Since 2023 in Gaza, the market of oppression and tyranny has been heated, and innocent Muslims are being martyred, including children, mothers, sisters, and youngsters. I believe that this much cruelty and intensity has rarely been witnessed in modern times, and for that, alhamdulillah, we have raised a strong voice at the UN and expressed complete solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters.” Conflict with India PM Shehbaz said that during his meeting with Trump, he also talked about the escalation with India, and how New Delhi weaponised the Indus Waters Treaty against the people of Pakistan. “[I talked about] the way our forces defeated India and, by the grace of Almighty Allah, made India learn a lesson which they will remember for a lifetime,” he said. “I also said that Pakistan won the war, by the grace of God, through our brave armed forces, who fought with great courage and outstanding professional equipment, led by Field Marshal Saeed Asim Munir, who led from the front and whose resolve was unwavering, and the entire nation was behind our own forces. “And our air forces, led by Air Marshal Zaheer Babar and his brave fighters, made a strong defence. The world came to realise that not only is Pakistan a nuclear power, but purely meant for our defence. And now the purpose: Pakistan is also very accomplished in traditional warfare, conservative warfare.” 2025 floods The premier said that while the country’s economy had become stabilised on a macro level, the effects of climate change were taking their toll. He talked about the massive floods in the country that have struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery. “Unfortunately, due to climate change, which caused the recent floods, there has been much destruction,” he said. “In 2022, it caused devastation in Sindh; this time Punjab became the target of this flood due to which more than 1,000 people lost their lives, hundreds of thousands of people were injured, thousands of remote areas were submerged, farms were destroyed, and installations suffered immense damage, for which, at this time, we are collecting data to see how much loss has occurred. “But our spirits are high and we are facing this completely, and Inshallah we will overcome this and move forward,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "Afghan political leaders and women activists on Monday opened a two-day dialogue in Islamabad to explore ways for “shaping a collective, regionally supported vision for Afghanistan’s peaceful future”, according to organisers. Pakistan and Afghanistan have witnessed an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee and upgrading diplomatic ranks. This is the first ever gathering of political opponents of the Afghan Taliban since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, which organisers insist is “not against the Taliban government.” They argued that the primary aim of the moot was to “promote inclusive and constructive discussions among leaders, including men and women from diverse segments of society in Afghanistan, to develop a shared understanding and identify common principles for Afghanistan’s future stability, inclusivity, and peaceful settlement,” the organisers said in a statement. The dialogue was previously scheduled on Aug 25-26 but was postponed, apparently over criticism by some known personalities, including Zalmay Khalilzad, the former United States special envoy. Khalilzad had termed the meeting “unwise” due to the participation of some who oppose the Taliban. “Afghan citizens are entitled to their political views, but Pakistan’s seeming support of them by hosting their conference is hugely unwise and an intended provocation,” he wrote on X. Former Afghan parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi opposed the remarks, saying, “Isn’t it time to let us craft what is good for us?” The first day of the closed-door meeting was dedicated to Afghan leaders to “engage openly, exchange perspectives and define shared principles for stability, rule of law, and reaffirming the support to women’s rights and inclusion”, according to the organisers. Dawn.com has seen a list of 37 Afghans invited to the event. They were part of the previous governments of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, including governors, ministers, lawmakers and women activists. A participant said some of the invitees were not attending the meeting due to visa issues. “The aim of this timely and important dialogue is to promote an inclusive dialogue among diverse groups of Afghan leaders (women and men) alongside Pakistani counterparts to foster inclusive dialogue, mutual understanding and lasting cooperation,” the organisers said. Women for Afghanistan (WFA) and the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (Sassi) University jointly held the first Regional Dialogue titled “Towards Unity and Trust”. Koofi, who leads WFA, lives in exile and has organised a series of meetings, mainly comprising women activists against the Taliban policies. She is one of the critics of Taliban rule. Dr Maria Sultan, a defence analyst, heads Sassi. On the second day, on September 30th, a Joint Pak-Afghan Session will hold “focused discussions aimed at building trust, identifying common ground and advancing a people-centric approach to address regional challenges”. The organisers, while explaining the objectives of the dialogue, say that the event is aimed at strengthening cooperation between Afghan and Pakistani leaders. The dialogue will also promote sustainable development, stability and peace rooted in shared values and highlight the importance of women’s participation and inclusive governance. The gathering would encourage regional cooperation with a focus on economic development and trust-building, the statement added. “The dialogue underscores a simple truth: peace between people leads to peace between nations. By prioritising dialogue, inclusivity and cooperation, WFA and SASSI University believe this initiative can pave the way for stronger, more mutually beneficial relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, grounded in unity and trust.“ In addition, the event will be helpful in fostering a deeper understanding between the people of the two nations for a more sustained development and peace in the region. “The commonality and the importance of the dialogue and the process stems from the need that Afghans must have the space to speak, engage and think together to promote their common values and interests for their country and their people,“ it added. The dialogue will also serve to identify common grounds for cooperation between Afghan leaders and their Pakistani counterparts on an engagement basis of developing people-centric approaches to find common solutions for regional challenges and to build trust and stability, the statement said. “We believe that a more people-centric approach focused on economic development and regional cooperation will lead to an enhanced and meaningful relationship between the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.” Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul in July, where an agreement was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional connectivity. Later that month, Dar said Pakistan received “recent assurances” from Afghan authorities that the neighbouring country’s soil would not be used for terrorism. Islamabad has repeatedly demanded that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). In January, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the only point of contention between the two countries was the presence of the TTP and cross-border attacks.",

      "summary_orig": "Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief Mohsin Naqvi on Monday warned India against “dragging war” into sports, saying that doing so only exposed the neighbouring country’s “desperation” in a response aimed at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who politicised India’s Asia Cup final win against Pakistan. In a post on X on Sunday night, Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on scoring a win in the final against the Green Shirts, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor — an operation that was launched against Pakistan during the four-day military conflict between the two countries in May. “ #OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he said. In response to Modi’s post, Naqvi said, “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”. “Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he said. The exchange also follows the Indian cricket team refusing to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. “I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said on Sunday night. PCB donates match fee to May 7 victims Separately, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Monday that it would donate the team’s match fees to the civilians martyred during the May 7 Indian attack on Pakistan, after India’s SuryaKumar Yadav announced that he would donate his match fee to victims on the Indian side. In a post on X, the the cricketing board said, “The Pakistan Cricket Team has dedicated its Asia Cup final match fees to the innocent victims martyred in the May 7 attack, in which civilians, including children, lost their lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families.” India’s actions ‘disrespected cricket’: Salman Agha Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Salman Agha said that India’s actions had “disrespected cricket” while speaking to reporters after the match, accroding to AFP . “I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing,” Agha said. “If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.” “What they did today, a good team doesn’t do that. Good teams do what we have done. We waited for our medals and took them. “It’s been seen for the first time. I do not know where it will stop. What has happened in this tournament is bad for cricket,” he said. Meanwhile, Yadav claimed that India was “denied” the trophy, but then went on to say that the team “took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy”. “If you tell me about the trophies, my trophies are sitting in my dressing room — all the 14 players and support staff. They are the real trophies for me,” said Yadav. ‘Lack of sportsmanship’ Although the Pakistan-India matches went ahead despite calls from the Indian side to boycott them, all three were marred by controversy and high tensions between the two countries in the wake of their four-day military standoff in May. India displayed consistent hostility towards the Pakistan team throughout each of their clashes, including refusing to shake hands with the players at the end of the games. In addition, after the first victory against Pakistan on September 14, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was accused of politicising the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May, for which India blamed Islamabad without evidence. Naqvi had expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X and lodged a complaint with the ICC, which launched a probe into the remarks. Further, during the September 21 match , when the rivals met for the second time, Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the match. The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which killed more than two dozen people. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention . Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.",

      "title_orig": "Beyond the security paradigm: What Pakistan must do to truly leverage the defence pact with Saudi Arabia",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA), signed at Al Yamamah Palace on Sept 17, is an inflection point for the bilateral relationship as well as the broader region. The pact’s core commitment is unambiguous: an attack on one will be treated as an attack on both. That collective-defence clause matters in a region recalibrating its security architecture and hedging against external shocks. But the real test of this agreement lies in how Islamabad and Riyadh can pivot from security symbolism to a joint economic mission anchored in reform, productivity and strategic integration across the security, industrial, and technological domains. This requires Pakistan and Saudi Arabia working across multiple pillars to pursue economic, defence, and technological integration between the two economies. The strategy should be anchored in a clear economic agenda aligned with both countries’ need to reorient their economies. On the Saudi side, this reorientation requires investments in building a competitive industrial and digital ecosystem, and on the Pakistani side, the goal is to generate economic growth through sectors that expand the country’s ability to sustainably earn foreign exchange. Given this need, a Pakistani strategy that chases cheap loans, deferred oil payments or one-off discounts from Saudi Arabia in lieu of the SDMA would be futile and disastrous. The Saudis have clearly signalled that the era of handouts is over, and Pakistani policymakers should pay heed to this signalling. The need of the hour therefore is to pursue a strategy that plugs Pakistan into Saudi Arabia’s investment, technology and supply-chain ambitions. This would require doing the hard work at home to direct Saudi capital into sectors that deliver mutually beneficial outcomes for both nations. The big picture Within this context, the defence track can be a bridge to industrial cooperation and economic integration. As Dr Jamal Al Harbi, the Saudi Media Attaché in Islamabad put it in a recent article, the pact “includes defence industry collaboration, with potential for technology transfer and co-production of military equipment, as well as capacity building and training, building on the longstanding tradition of Pakistani military personnel working with Saudi forces.” This perspective points to a broader state of play between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and if pursued effectively, the SDMA is likely to lead to a strategic embrace that links security with industrial production, technology cooperation, and defence integration. The first area of focus must be Pakistan’s energy markets, which remain trapped in a cycle of inefficiency, political paralysis, and circular debt. An ambitious deregulation programme to open the entire energy value chain, including oil, gas, refineries, and battery energy storage, would help attract Saudi capital under clear, rules-based frameworks. For this to work, Islamabad would need to commit to time-bound reforms, ensure predictable contract enforcement, and empower regulators while disempowering the administrative state that insists on running the energy ecosystem, to disastrous effects. This initiative should also look at emerging technologies in energy, including electric vehicles, battery energy storage, and decentralised grids. Such a programme would provide Riyadh the opportunity to acquire long-duration assets in Pakistan. It would also align with Vision 2030’s ambition to make Saudi Arabia an international investor in energy and industrial platforms, especially in emerging energy solutions. For Pakistan, it promises stable supplies, reduced fiscal pressure, and a credible pathway for private capital to flow into a critical sector that is in dire need of reforms. In addition, Saudi capital can support Pakistan to build a future ready clean energy ecosystem paired with electric vehicles and large-scale battery energy storage capabilities. Secondly, as articulated by Dr Al Harbi, the defence pact should evolve into industrial co-production. Aligning with Saudi Arabia’s defence-localisation targets, Pakistan can set up co-production hubs for drones, conventional platforms, secure communications, and cyber capabilities. These facilities would need to emphasise local content, testing and qualification labs, and joint research and development. Other partners could also be plugged into this framework — some of this is already being signalled — creating a regional defence industrial ecosystem over the coming years that would allow for diversification of supply-chains and greater interoperability. For Riyadh, this initiative would help diversify supply chains while advancing sovereign capabilities consistent with Vision 2030. For Pakistan, it provides industrial upgrading, skilled jobs, and technological gains that can spill over into other sectors and bilateral relationships. The third pillar is investment, particularly through the Public Investment Fund (PIF). In addition to the energy sector, PIF investments can be directed into Pakistan’s emerging critical minerals sectors, including copper, gold, and rare earths, as well as initiatives for defence cooperation. Pakistan is already collaborating with the United States on critical minerals and mining, and bringing in PIF would further diversify interests and investments in Pakistan. As Barrick Mining’s flagship Reko Diq project becomes operational, its success can be leveraged to access PIF investment for processing and value-add capabilities in the mining sector. For Saudi Arabia, such investments would help secure inputs for electric vehicles, defence systems, and clean-energy supply chains, while creating deal flow for PIF and companies like Ma’aden. For Pakistan, the flow of funds would lead to sustainable exports, adding to overall macroeconomic stability while lowering risk premium for finance and crowding in other investors. In addition, scaling up defence industrial capabilities would add to the country’s overall ability to defend itself and deter its rivals in the region. The fourth opportunity lies in skills and technology. Both countries need to build their capacities when it comes to artificial intelligence, fintech, cybersecurity, and data processing at scale. This initiative could be led through joint startup accelerators in Riyadh, Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, along with reciprocal seed funds to support founders building products for the region. Such an initiative would help support Riyadh’s needs for securing access to a young and cost-effective talent pool that can power Vision 2030’s execution. For Pakistan, it would add further momentum to the country’s emerging information technology sector, creating middle-class jobs that earn foreign exchange while embedding the country’s technology firms in regional innovation. Opportunities for fintech The final pillar should seek to build joint capabilities around financial technology and inclusion. Pakistan is one of the largest recipients of remittances from Saudi Arabia, yet much of these flows remain expensive. A dedicated fintech vertical that is designed to cut financial friction within both economies, as well as in the flow of remittances, would be extremely impactful. In a world where Pakistani talent integrates with Saudi Arabia’s technology ecosystem, the increase in financial flows would require even greater investments in financial integration and innovation. By linking Saudi fintechs and banks directly with Pakistani institutions, and integrating instant payments, shared e-KYC, and robust AML protocols, both countries could benefit. Pakistan would see billions of dollars move into the formal economy, stabilising foreign-exchange reserves and improving worker welfare. Saudi Arabia would deepen its fintech ecosystem, while offering faster, more transparent channels for its expatriate community. The additional dividends through the development of credit histories for workers, wage-linked savings, and micro-insurance would create a virtuous cycle of financial inclusion. All of this, however, will remain aspirational unless anchored in credible execution. What Pakistan needs is the discipline to turn this defence pact into an economic one that advances reform, productivity, and integration into regional value chains. If pursued with clarity, the SMDA could be remembered not just as a security commitment, but as the moment Islamabad and Riyadh truly began to reshape their economies together through integration. But if leveraged to secure access to cheap financial bailouts and discounted oil, the SDMA is likely to lead to disappointing outcomes.

Saudi Arabia would deepen its fintech ecosystem, while offering faster, more transparent channels for its expatriate community. The additional dividends through the development of credit histories for workers, wage-linked savings, and micro-insurance would create a virtuous cycle of financial inclusion.

      "title": "Beyond the security paradigm: What Pakistan must do to truly leverage the defence pact with Saudi Arabia",
      "summary": "Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA), signed at Al Yamamah Palace on Sept 17, is an inflection point for the bilateral relationship as well as the broader region. The pact’s core commitment is unambiguous: an attack on one will be treated as an attack on both. That collective-defence clause matters in a region recalibrating its security architecture and hedging against external shocks. But the real test of this agreement lies in how Islamabad and Riyadh can pivot from security symbolism to a joint economic mission anchored in reform, productivity and strategic integration across the security, industrial, and technological domains. This requires Pakistan and Saudi Arabia working across multiple pillars to pursue economic, defence, and technological integration between the two economies. The strategy should be anchored in a clear economic agenda aligned with both countries’ need to reorient their economies. On the Saudi side, this reorientation requires investments in building a competitive industrial and digital ecosystem, and on the Pakistani side, the goal is to generate economic growth through sectors that expand the country’s ability to sustainably earn foreign exchange. Given this need, a Pakistani strategy that chases cheap loans, deferred oil payments or one-off discounts from Saudi Arabia in lieu of the SDMA would be futile and disastrous. The Saudis have clearly signalled that the era of handouts is over, and Pakistani policymakers should pay heed to this signalling. The need of the hour therefore is to pursue a strategy that plugs Pakistan into Saudi Arabia’s investment, technology and supply-chain ambitions. This would require doing the hard work at home to direct Saudi capital into sectors that deliver mutually beneficial outcomes for both nations. The big picture Within this context, the defence track can be a bridge to industrial cooperation and economic integration. As Dr Jamal Al Harbi, the Saudi Media Attaché in Islamabad put it in a recent article, the pact “includes defence industry collaboration, with potential for technology transfer and co-production of military equipment, as well as capacity building and training, building on the longstanding tradition of Pakistani military personnel working with Saudi forces.” This perspective points to a broader state of play between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and if pursued effectively, the SDMA is likely to lead to a strategic embrace that links security with industrial production, technology cooperation, and defence integration. The first area of focus must be Pakistan’s energy markets, which remain trapped in a cycle of inefficiency, political paralysis, and circular debt. An ambitious deregulation programme to open the entire energy value chain, including oil, gas, refineries, and battery energy storage, would help attract Saudi capital under clear, rules-based frameworks. For this to work, Islamabad would need to commit to time-bound reforms, ensure predictable contract enforcement, and empower regulators while disempowering the administrative state that insists on running the energy ecosystem, to disastrous effects. This initiative should also look at emerging technologies in energy, including electric vehicles, battery energy storage, and decentralised grids. Such a programme would provide Riyadh the opportunity to acquire long-duration assets in Pakistan. It would also align with Vision 2030’s ambition to make Saudi Arabia an international investor in energy and industrial platforms, especially in emerging energy solutions. For Pakistan, it promises stable supplies, reduced fiscal pressure, and a credible pathway for private capital to flow into a critical sector that is in dire need of reforms. In addition, Saudi capital can support Pakistan to build a future ready clean energy ecosystem paired with electric vehicles and large-scale battery energy storage capabilities. Secondly, as articulated by Dr Al Harbi, the defence pact should evolve into industrial co-production. Aligning with Saudi Arabia’s defence-localisation targets, Pakistan can set up co-production hubs for drones, conventional platforms, secure communications, and cyber capabilities. These facilities would need to emphasise local content, testing and qualification labs, and joint research and development. Other partners could also be plugged into this framework — some of this is already being signalled — creating a regional defence industrial ecosystem over the coming years that would allow for diversification of supply-chains and greater interoperability. For Riyadh, this initiative would help diversify supply chains while advancing sovereign capabilities consistent with Vision 2030. For Pakistan, it provides industrial upgrading, skilled jobs, and technological gains that can spill over into other sectors and bilateral relationships. The third pillar is investment, particularly through the Public Investment Fund (PIF). In addition to the energy sector, PIF investments can be directed into Pakistan’s emerging critical minerals sectors, including copper, gold, and rare earths, as well as initiatives for defence cooperation. Pakistan is already collaborating with the United States on critical minerals and mining, and bringing in PIF would further diversify interests and investments in Pakistan. As Barrick Mining’s flagship Reko Diq project becomes operational, its success can be leveraged to access PIF investment for processing and value-add capabilities in the mining sector. For Saudi Arabia, such investments would help secure inputs for electric vehicles, defence systems, and clean-energy supply chains, while creating deal flow for PIF and companies like Ma’aden. For Pakistan, the flow of funds would lead to sustainable exports, adding to overall macroeconomic stability while lowering risk premium for finance and crowding in other investors. In addition, scaling up defence industrial capabilities would add to the country’s overall ability to defend itself and deter its rivals in the region. The fourth opportunity lies in skills and technology. Both countries need to build their capacities when it comes to artificial intelligence, fintech, cybersecurity, and data processing at scale. This initiative could be led through joint startup accelerators in Riyadh, Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, along with reciprocal seed funds to support founders building products for the region. Such an initiative would help support Riyadh’s needs for securing access to a young and cost-effective talent pool that can power Vision 2030’s execution. For Pakistan, it would add further momentum to the country’s emerging information technology sector, creating middle-class jobs that earn foreign exchange while embedding the country’s technology firms in regional innovation. Opportunities for fintech The final pillar should seek to build joint capabilities around financial technology and inclusion. Pakistan is one of the largest recipients of remittances from Saudi Arabia, yet much of these flows remain expensive. A dedicated fintech vertical that is designed to cut financial friction within both economies, as well as in the flow of remittances, would be extremely impactful. In a world where Pakistani talent integrates with Saudi Arabia’s technology ecosystem, the increase in financial flows would require even greater investments in financial integration and innovation. By linking Saudi fintechs and banks directly with Pakistani institutions, and integrating instant payments, shared e-KYC, and robust AML protocols, both countries could benefit. Pakistan would see billions of dollars move into the formal economy, stabilising foreign-exchange reserves and improving worker welfare. Saudi Arabia would deepen its fintech ecosystem, while offering faster, more transparent channels for its expatriate community. The additional dividends through the development of credit histories for workers, wage-linked savings, and micro-insurance would create a virtuous cycle of financial inclusion. All of this, however, will remain aspirational unless anchored in credible execution. What Pakistan needs is the discipline to turn this defence pact into an economic one that advances reform, productivity, and integration into regional value chains. If pursued with clarity, the SMDA could be remembered not just as a security commitment, but as the moment Islamabad and Riyadh truly began to reshape their economies together through integration.

      "summary_orig": "The Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Imran Nazir said on Monday that the province was extending the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign until Wednesday, hoping to achieve a target of 100 per cent. Earlier in September, Pakistan rolled out the HPV vaccine nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. However, vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities. “Success rate in Punjab has been 72pc,” Punjab’s health minister said during an interview with Geo News show “Geo Pakistan”. “But we have not ended the campaign; instead, we have extended it for three days.” He added, “The primary reason is that if we administer this vaccine to our girls now, those aged 9 to 14 will get it for free. But after the campaign ends, people will have to pay money for it, and only 9-year-old girls will be able to get it free of charge.” Referring to the attacks on women health workers while administering vaccines in Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin district, the minister said he has ensured the suspects were arrested and that security measures have been put in place to protect health workers. In the latest incident this week, the HPV vaccination team was performing its duty in a non-formal education school in the village of Ratuwal, within the limits of Kathian Sheikhan police station, when a 55-year-old resident of the village entered the school and attempted to attack a female health supervisor. He said the rate of refusals was greater at the beginning of the campaign, with only 250,000 girls receiving the vaccine on the first day. However, towards the end, the number of refusals dropped to 90,000 from 300,000 after counselling was provided through their teams. “More than 5.2 million girls have been vaccinated; however, our target was 7.2 million, which we hope to achieve by Wednesday,” the minister said.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: As the National Assembly convenes today, the house is expected to witness a heated debate on flood relief measures , particularly the use of the Benazir Income Support Programme to help survivors, besides a discussion on the law and order situation in Azad Jammu Kashmir. According to a statement issued on Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned the NA session at the Parliament House on Monday (today) at 5 pm. Before the sitting, a meeting of parliamentary leaders summoned by Speaker Ayaz Sadiq will be held at 4pm to finalise the agenda. Another highlight of the session would be PML-N leader Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry thanking the president for his address to both houses on March 10. The NA meeting comes amid disagreements between the PML-N and PPP on flood relief measures. Parliamentary experts believe that both sides will again exchange barbs regarding the proposed use of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) to help flood victims — a move opposed by some in the government. The issue of current tensions in AJK and a protest scheduled for today (Monday) by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee will also likely be discussed in the house. Govt to table three bills; speaker calls meeting ahead of session to ‘finalise’ agenda The government is also likely to take credit for its recent foreign policy achievements. Three bills to be moved The government is also expected to table three bills. On the first day, state minister for finance and revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani will move a bill for reforms of the regulatory regime applicable to business, trade and investment by removing complex regulatory requirements and to establish the Pakistan Regulatory Registry and Pakistan Business Portal (Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025). Senator Ahad Cheema will seek amendments to the Civil Servants Act 1973 through the Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill 2025. Housing minister Riaz Hussain Pirzada will table the Pakistan Infrastructure Deve­lopment and Assets Management Authority Bill 2025 for the establishment of the assets management authority. In a calling attention notice, MNA Riaz Fatyana will invite the attention of the minister-in-charge of the Cabinet Secretariat to the “poor performance” of the NDMA in Kamalia, Pir Mehal, Tandlianwala and Chichawatni in Toba Tek Singh during the recent floods. Likewise, MNA Anjum Aqeel Khan will invite the attention of the interior minister to the delay in payment to persons whose land was acquired by Islamabad CDA in sectors E-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16 and H-16.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he has received a “very good response” to his proposal for ending the Gaza war and is optimistic about getting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to back it when the two meet on Monday. He said US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law who was a Middle East envoy during his first term, were having talks with Netanyahu in New York ahead of the meeting at the White House. “Were getting a very good response because Bibi wants to make the deal too,” Trump said in a telephone interview, using Netanyahu’s nickname. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump earlier hinted at a breakthrough in the Middle East crisis. “We have a real chance for GREATNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,” Trump said. “ALL ARE ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!!” US envoy to Israel’s rare visit to Egypt postponed; 21 Palestinians killed as Israeli tanks thrust deeper into Gaza When international leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York this week, the US unveiled a 21-point Middle East peace plan to end the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. That plan calls for the return of all prisoners, living and dead, no further Israeli attacks on Qatar and a new dialogue between Israel and Palestinians for peaceful coexistence, a White House official said. A Hamas representative earlier said the group had not seen the US plan. Trump on Sunday credited the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt and Jordan, among others, for helping in the process. He said the deal would not only end the Gaza conflict but would work towards a broader peace in the Middle East. “Everybody’s involved,” he said. “Everybody wants it, and Hamas wants it, and one of the reasons is because everybody’s tired”. Netanyahu, in an interview on Fox News channel’s “The Sunday Briefing,” said it is possible to have amnesty for Hamas leaders under terms of the agreement. “The details of this have to be worked out,” he said. Meanwhile, a visit to Egypt by Washington’s top envoy to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has been postponed, a US official said on Sunday. Huckabee was scheduled to visit Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials. Egypt, along with the United States and Qatar, has been mediating between Israel and Hamas in efforts to end the war. Cairo has criticised Israel’s ongoing air and ground assault in Gaza City, where the United Nations estimated a million people resided before the offensive began. Since the war broke out, Egypt has repeatedly warned that the fighting risks driving hundreds of thousands of Palestinians across its border into the Sinai Peninsula. Israeli tanks thrust deeper into Gaza In Gaza Israeli tanks moved deeper into Gaza City’s residential districts on Sunday, as local health authorities said they have been unable to respond to dozens of desperate calls, expressing concern about the fate of residents in the targeted areas. Witnesses and medics said Israeli tanks had deepened their incursions in the Sabra, Tel Al-Hawa, Sheikh Radwan and Al-Naser neighborhoods, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering. The Civil Emergency Service in Gaza said late on Saturday that Israel had denied 73 requests, sent via international organisations, to rescue injured Palestinians in Gaza City. Over the past 24 hours, the Israeli air force had struck 140 infrastructures what it described as ‘military targets’ across Gaza. Medics reported 16 more deaths in strikes on houses in central Gaza, bringing Sunday’s death toll to 21. Israeli forces have already killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in past two years. Meanwhile, Hamas asked the Israeli military to temporarily halt strikes as it tried to locate the two Israeli prisoners it said it had lost contact with. “The lives of the two prisoners are in real danger, and (Israeli) forces must immediately withdraw to the south of Street 8 and halt aerial operations for 24 hours starting from 18:00 today to allow attempts to rescue the prisoners,” wrote the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades in a statement. In a previous announcement, the armed group said the loss of contact was due to Israeli military operations in two southern Gaza City neighbourhoods over the previous 48 hours.

Meanwhile, Hamas asked the Israeli military to temporarily halt strikes as it tried to locate the two Israeli prisoners it said it had lost contact with. “The lives of the two prisoners are in real danger, and (Israeli) forces must immediately withdraw to the south of Street 8 and halt aerial operations for 24 hours starting from 18:00 today to allow attempts to rescue the prisoners,” wrote the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades in a statement. In a previous announcement, the armed group said the loss of contact was due to Israeli military operations in two southern Gaza City neighbourhoods over the previous 48 hours.

      "summary_orig": "The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Asian Cricket Council chief Mohsin Naqvi, as politics continued to spill over the pitch. India had earlier beaten Pakistan by five wickets in the last over after a close contest to win a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, but they caused the post-final formalities to be inordinately delayed due to their refusal to budge from their stance. There were no customary handshakes between the teams after India refused, with tensions high from their previous two clashes in the competition, which witnessed political posturing and aggressive on-field behaviour. The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Naqvi, who is also the Interior Minister, was supposed to present the winners’ trophy, but there were indications that India would resent that when their captain Suryakumar Yadav did not participate in the customary pre-toss photoshoot before the final. “I have been informed by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said. When asked about his refusal to collect the trophy at the post-match press conference and their actions leading to the politicisation of the game, the Indian skipper declined to answer the question. The post-final ceremony saw Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha receive the runners-up trophy while Indian players Tilak Varma, Kuldeep Yadav and Abhishek Sharma collect their respective individual awards. India’s refusal to collect the trophy from Naqvi marks a historic low in the cricketing relations between the neighbours, with the game having acted as a stage for diplomacy in the past. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a political reference in his post on X congratulating the Indian team. “Operation Sindoor on the game’s field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he wrote. Suryakumar’s men had earlier capped a remarkable unbeaten run with their third victory against Pakistan at the Asia Cup. Put into bat, Pakistan could not capitalise on an 84-run opening stand between Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) and were bundled out for 146 with five deliveries still left in their innings. Pakistan lost their last nine wickets for 33 runs in a spectacular meltdown, with India’s left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (4-30) being the wrecker-in-chief. The Green Shirts struck back to leave India reeling at 20-3 with their top 3, including captain Suryakumar Yadav, back in the dugout. India lost their in-form opener Abhishek Sharma, also the tournament’s leading scorer, and the skipper inside the first 10 deliveries of their innings. Varma and Sanju Samson (24) got to rebuilding the innings. Even that recovery would not have been possible but for the reprieve Samson, then on 12, got when Hussain Talat dropped him in the deep. Abrar Ahmed dismissed Samson to break the 57-run stand, but Shivam Dube (33) combined with Varma to take India closer to the target before falling in the penultimate over. Needing 10 runs from the last over from Haris Rauf, Varma hit the second ball for a six to effectively seal India’s thrilling victory and triggering wild celebrations in the Indian camp. “It’s a tough pill to swallow,” Pakistan captain Salman said at the presentation ceremony. “We could not finish well in the batting. Bowling, we gave everything. If we could have finished well, it would have been a different story. “We could not rotate the strike properly, and we lost too many wickets. That was the reason we could not score what we wanted. We have to sort out our batting very soon. They bowled really well, outstandingly well. They needed 63 off six overs. I thought we had the game. The bowlers bowled really well; we have to give them credit, but the batting was a concern. “We fought really well. We are proud as a team. So much to look forward to, we will improve and come back stronger.”",

The post-final ceremony saw Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha receive the runners-up trophy while Indian players Tilak Varma, Kuldeep Yadav and Abhishek Sharma collect their respective individual awards. India’s refusal to collect the trophy from Naqvi marks a historic low in the cricketing relations between the neighbours, with the game having acted as a stage for diplomacy in the past. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a political reference in his post on X congratulating the Indian team. “Operation Sindoor on the game’s field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he wrote. Suryakumar’s men had earlier capped a remarkable unbeaten run with their third victory against Pakistan at the Asia Cup. Put into bat, Pakistan could not capitalise on an 84-run opening stand between Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) and were bundled out for 146 with five deliveries still left in their innings. Pakistan lost their last nine wickets for 33 runs in a spectacular meltdown, with India’s left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (4-30) being the wrecker-in-chief. The Green Shirts struck back to leave India reeling at 20-3 with their top 3, including captain Suryakumar Yadav, back in the dugout. India lost their in-form opener Abhishek Sharma, also the tournament’s leading scorer, and the skipper inside the first 10 deliveries of their innings. Varma and Sanju Samson (24) got to rebuilding the innings. Even that recovery would not have been possible but for the reprieve Samson, then on 12, got when Hussain Talat dropped him in the deep. Abrar Ahmed dismissed Samson to break the 57-run stand, but Shivam Dube (33) combined with Varma to take India closer to the target before falling in the penultimate over. Needing 10 runs from the last over from Haris Rauf, Varma hit the second ball for a six to effectively seal India’s thrilling victory and triggering wild celebrations in the Indian camp. “It’s a tough pill to swallow,” Pakistan captain Salman said at the presentation ceremony. “We could not finish well in the batting. Bowling, we gave everything. If we could have finished well, it would have been a different story. “We could not rotate the strike properly, and we lost too many wickets. That was the reason we could not score what we wanted. We have to sort out our batting very soon. They bowled really well, outstandingly well. They needed 63 off six overs. I thought we had the game. The bowlers bowled really well; we have to give them credit, but the batting was a concern. “We fought really well. We are proud as a team. So much to look forward to, we will improve and come back stronger.”",

      "summary": "The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Asian Cricket Council chief Mohsin Naqvi, as politics continued to spill over the pitch. India had earlier beaten Pakistan by five wickets in the last over after a close contest to win a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, but they caused the post-final formalities to be inordinately delayed due to their refusal to budge from their stance. There were no customary handshakes between the teams after India refused, with tensions high from their previous two clashes in the competition, which witnessed political posturing and aggressive on-field behaviour. The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Naqvi, who is also the Interior Minister, was supposed to present the winners’ trophy, but there were indications that India would resent that when their captain Suryakumar Yadav did not participate in the customary pre-toss photoshoot before the final. “I have been informed by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said.

      "summary_orig": "Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on Sunday told a US delegation in Kabul that American citizen Amir Amiri had been released from prison, the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement. United States President Donald Trump’s special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler, welcomed the decision to release the American citizen and called it a good moment for him, the statement read. Muttaqi was quoted as saying, “The Afghan government does not view the issues of its citizens from a political angle and makes it clear that ways can be found to resolve the issues through diplomacy.” He added that the step taken by his government to release the American citizen was a positive development and thanked the government of Qatar for its role in facilitating the release of the prisoner. According to the statement, Boehler described the previous round of talks between Kabul and Washington as “constructive” and expressed hope that talks on the remaining issues would continue. This was the second visit to Kabul by the American delegation. The Afghan ministry said that during its last visit, the US delegation demanded the release of American prisoners; however, Taliban leaders had called for the release of Afghan national Mohammad Rahim, who is believed to be imprisoned in the Guantanamo Bay detention centre. The US delegation had agreed in principle to free Rahim, who would be brought to Qatar and remain there. However, the Afghan Foreign Ministry statement did not mention whether Rahim would be released or not. An elderly British couple detained in Afghanistan for almost eight months were released earlier this month, Taliban authorities said, after pressure built to free the pair due to fears over their health. Taliban officials have refused to detail why Peter Reynolds, 80, and his wife Barbara, 76, were arrested in February as they were returning to their home. “We’ve been treated very well. We’re looking forward to seeing our children,” said Barbara, in a red headscarf, standing next to her bearded husband, near a plane on the tarmac of Kabul airport.",

      "summary_orig": "Anchorperson Imtiaz Mir, who was shot and wounded last week in Karachi’s Malir area, succumbed to his injuries on Sunday, according to his family and police. Mir, an anchorperson for private TV channel Metro 1 News , was headed home in a car driven by his older brother, Mohammed Salih, when six suspects riding two motorcycles began firing on their vehicle in Malir.  Mir and his brother were both injured and admitted to Liaquat National Hospital. His brother, Riaz Ali, who is the complainant in the case, told Dawn.com on Sunday night that his brother had succumbed during treatment. Saudabad police Station House Officer (SHO) Ateequr Rehman also confirmed the death of the journalist, as the incident took place in his jurisdiction. “Police have registered a case against a man and his sons over the attack on the journalist,” the SHO said. “The incident was motivated by a land dispute in the town of Thul in Jacobabad. A hitherto little-known group claimed responsibility for the attack, but it lacked credibility.” Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed his regret over Mir’s death and directed the Sindh inspector general of police to arrest the killers immediately. “The killers of Imtiaz Mir will be brought to justice,” CM Shah vowed, according to the statement. “The services of the late journalist to the media will be remembered and the government will take this case to its logical conclusion.” Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon issued a statement expressing grief over Mir’s passing, hailing the late journalist as “a hardworking and fearless journalist, who always highlighted public issues”. “The Sindh government will leave no stone unturned to bring those involved in the attack on Imtiaz Mir to justice,” Memon said. “The Sindh government is committed to protecting the lives and property of journalists.”",

A hitherto little-known group claimed responsibility for the attack, but it lacked credibility.” Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed his regret over Mir’s death and directed the Sindh inspector general of police to arrest the killers immediately. “The killers of Imtiaz Mir will be brought to justice,” CM Shah vowed, according to the statement. “The services of the late journalist to the media will be remembered and the government will take this case to its logical conclusion.” Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon issued a statement expressing grief over Mir’s passing, hailing the late journalist as “a hardworking and fearless journalist, who always highlighted public issues”. “The Sindh government will leave no stone unturned to bring those involved in the attack on Imtiaz Mir to justice,” Memon said. “The Sindh government is committed to protecting the lives and property of journalists.”",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed on Sunday the hope for “encouraging” outcomes of US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Muslim leaders in Washington earlier this week where the American head of the state presented his plan to end Israel’s invasion of Gaza. “We fully participated in the meeting on Gaza, and God willing, its encouraging results will come out soon,” he said, flanked by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar while addressing overseas Pakistanis at the High Commission in London. According to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan , he also said that Pakistan was also part of Trump-led efforts to bring peace to Palestine and end oppression against the people of Gaza. The premier also expressed distress over the situation in Gaza, which has been subjected to Israeli onslaught since October 2023, and prayed that the cruelty and barbarity being witnessed there ends soon. Trump’s meeting with Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York had brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, and Indonesia. Ahead of formal consultations, Trump told his guests: “We have to get the hostages back … This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world … so it’s an honour to be with you.” Trump also emphasised the urgency of ending the conflict: “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started.” According to reports from Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios , President Trump’s plan envisions an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, both alive and deceased; phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza\nGovernance excluding Hamas but incorporating the Palestinian Authority; deployment of Arab and Muslim peacekeepers to secure Gaza and facilitate Israel’s withdrawal; and internationally supported reconstruction and transition programmes funded by regional contributors. These details were reportedly shared with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though Israel did not draft the plan. Dar, who also attended the meeting with Trump, also expressed the hope for positive outcomes of the meeting, saying that once these results materialised, “we will share them with the nation”. He also said that follow-up communications after the meeting were going on until last night. Earlier during the talk, PM Shehbaz also referred to his engagements in New York, where he led Pakistan’s delegation to the UNGA’s 80th session. He said his speech at the UNGA was a reflection of the sentiments of Pakistanis and that he fought the case of India-occupied Kashmir there. The PM also touched upon his bilateral meeting with Trump in Washington during the recent US trip, saying that it was a “productive” and “constructive” engagement. “It was held in a conducive environment,” he said, adding that he hoped it would help further strengthen Pakistan-US ties.",
