      "summary_orig": "The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said on Monday it was “deeply shocked” to hear about reports of the killing of several civilians caused by alleged “aerial bombing” in the Tirah area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and demanded a probe into the matter. The “HRCP is deeply shocked to learn that a number of civilians, including children, have been killed, allegedly as a result of aerial bombing in Tirah, Khyber district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the organisation posted on X. It demanded that “the authorities carry out an immediate and impartial inquiry into the incident and hold to account those responsible”. “The state is constitutionally bound to protect all civilians’ right to life, which it has repeatedly failed to secure,” the HRCP statement read. So far, no official statement sharing the details of the reported incident has been issued by the relevant authorities. Meanwhile, Mohammad Iqbal Khan Afridi, member of the National Assembly from Khyber, expressed sorrow over it in a video message in Pashto, which he shared with the media. He said elderly women and children were killed in “shelling by jets” in Tirah and urged the people to reach the site of the incident to protest the killings. The MNA said it was not the first time that such an incident had taken place. “The killing of civilians has become a routine.” In a similar incident in May, 22 people, including seven children, were injured in an alleged quadcopter strike in the Wana tehsil of KP’s South Waziristan district. Around a week earlier, four children were killed and five others were injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions drop in Mir Ali tehsil of the North Waziristan district in KP. Later, the military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).",

      "title_orig": "Power to the people strongest: 70 years ago, the apex court sealed Pakistan’s fate. Its effects still echo today",
      "summary_orig": "It started with the judiciary. Or, at least, what the judiciary was capable of. Just a few months before they finalised the Constitution on September 21 — that is, 71 years ago this week — Pakistan’s first parliament introduced a safety valve in the system. It was called writ jurisdiction. The change didn’t require a lawyer to understand: the superior courts could now issue special orders called writs. These would direct the executive to protect fundamental rights, or restrain it from abusing its powers. And the House knew a thing or two about such abuse: the year was 1954, and the law — and who got to pass it — was at the heart of democracy’s future. Khwaja Nazimuddin’s ministry had just fallen to the deep state, with battle lines drawn between them: at times dubbed the Bengal and Punjab groups (reductive), or federalists and centralisers (misleading). Yet the real fight was between the elected and unelected: a forum group versus a fortress group. In fairness, it could well be said that the first was quite capable of excesses, just as the second was of sound decisions. What can’t be said, however, is that both were legitimate. Ultimately, however, the judiciary would decide that question, the new amendment having boosted its standing. Writs, as Justice M. R. Kayani told college kids in Lahore, “are flowers of paradise, and the whole length and breadth of Pakistan is not wide enough to contain their perfume”. Provided, of course, parliament stood by the judges. “It is the force of opinion which makes good laws,” said Justice Kayani, “and in this particular case, you must pray for the long life of the Bengali members who made the necessary noise.” Justice M. R. Kayani, photo courtesy Rashid Ashraf. Flowers of paradise: the First Amendment Those noises were originally made in the summer of 1954, when that year’s first amendment to the Government of India Act — Pakistan’s makeshift constitution — brought in writs. At the centre of attention was legal genius A. K. Brohi, whose own allegiances were a matter of season: too savvy for forum or fortress, Brohi would, at various points in that pitched battle, lean with whoever was ahead. Writs enabled justice, he told the assembly, “far more speedily than by resort to the ordinary procedure”. The high courts would thus become “custodians of the rights of the people”. A. K. Brohi Even the opposition’s Dhirendra Nath Datta, of the tragic Pakistan National Congress, agreed. “… The way in which indiscriminate arrests have been made in my province … the morale of the people has been completely broken.” One wonders what Datta would make of terrorism FIRs against protesting lawyers today. He nonetheless concluded, “I cannot but congratulate the government for introducing a bill like this, which is aimed at safeguarding the interests of the people from the executive zulm .” The first amendment was so passed. Zulm , it was hoped, would be made that much harder. Open to abuse: ‘transferring’ judges Interestingly, there were also heated debates, over a half-century before Lahore’s Justice Sarfraz Dogar showed up in the Islamabad High Court, on whether or not to pass a law providing for judges being transferred from high court to high court. Murmurs came from the forum group’s Abdur Rab Nishtar and Mahmud Husain, recently purged from the cabinet in Pakistan’s first coup in 1953 (their removals informed, as cables in London revealed, by hatreds jointly felt by Iskander Mirza and British mandarins). Nishtar hoped they could “avoid” such a law altogether: in a federal system, there had to be an autonomous judiciary in all provinces. Otherwise, the law would “give opportunity to a gentleman outside a particular judicial unit to exercise administrative powers”, which might hurt his adopted high court. Mahmud Husain, too, thought a law meant to secure judicial independence could go wrong if the executive started ping-ponging judges: “It may be under certain circumstances that this power is abused.” He suggested such transfer happen only if “the initiative is to come from the judiciary itself”, and on the recommendation of the chief justice of Pakistan. Left unsaid was what would happen if the chief justice, as well as his judges, were also chosen by the executive — as the 26th Amendment trainwreck now allows. Reasons to fight With the power to issue writs in place, the Long Parliament finally took aim at the governor-general, a relentless old man backed by Iskander Mirza’s bureaucrats and Ayub Khan’s generals. To be sure, the forum group’s humiliations at the hands of the fortress group had been bitter and many: martial law in Lahore, coups in Karachi, and emergency in Dhaka, all within a year. But the solution, the members knew, could only be through a permanent political settlement — one their departed boss Muhammad Ali Jinnah had promised they would get to write. In sum, democracy, to be delivered via a Fifth Amendment. Deposed in the first coup: Nazimuddin, Nishtar, Mahmud Husain Lesser motives varied. The late cabinet’s Nazimuddin and Mahmud Husain, had neither forgiven nor forgotten the governor-general’s purge; they now had their sights on a federal future. Their rivals in the present cabinet, mostly loath to poke the bear that had selected them, had outliers like Brohi, who saw the advantage of shutting out the gloved hand for good. Meanwhile, members from East Bengal, like the brash and bold Fazlur Rahman (not to be confused with today’s maulana), were sick of the Punjab gentry’s plans to fuse West Pakistan’s seats into one bloc. If the Bengalis were a majority of the people, then they had to be a majority in parliament. Self-preservation also played a part: more thuggish members, like Qaiyum Khan, feared PRODA, the anti-corruption law of the time, as a stick the governor-general would soon beat them over the heads with. Finally, the prime minister and leader of the house, Bogra, hadn’t been told anything by the rebels until right before. He would go along anyway. Because passing the Constitution, it was thought, could cure such afflictions. In the words of one bemused British cable from that month, “The motives which inspire Pakistani politicians are so mixed that it is almost impossible to predict in advance what line they will take”. All that could be said is “the fact that the new Constitution is now very close”. September rebels: the governor-general defanged In the wee hours of September 21, 1954, that new Constitution was given its final touches. By then, the only Leaguers left in the assembly were the Bill’s 29 supporters, 28 of whom were from outside the Punjab. Part of the reason this fightback would merit such little coverage was its stodgy authors: League conservatives from East Bengal, Sindh, and today’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in direct opposition to Punjab one-uniters, Bengali nationalists, and the military establishment. But their Bill was explosive: the Fifth Amendment, tabled by Sindh’s M. H. Gazdar, and hurried along by speaker Tamizuddin. The ayes rang out in 10 minutes: the establishment was rebuked, the governor-general’s powers to sack the centre scuppered, and the cabinet made dependent on the assembly’s confidence. In the September vote, 29 ayes in just 10 minutes clipped the Governor-General’s powers and bound the cabinet to the assembly’s confidence. The draft Constitution of 1954 also raised Bengali to a national language, entrusted judicial appointments to the country’s chief justice, and buried One Unit out of hand. “One can only say to the country that the best has been done,” closed Brohi, adding that “posterity alone can be the sole and competent judge.” The Constitution was sent to the printers, to cheers from the press. “Democracy in Pakistan has come alive,” Dawn said, hailing the “zeal, speed, and determination” of the assembly. After years of heartache, it had fulfilled its mission. Others weren’t so enthused: upon hearing the news, London sweated that the forum crew would ditch the Western alliance; that they might reject the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (Seato) and even step out of the Commonwealth. Punjab’s landed gentry wept at having to concede the Bengalis their majority. And future field marshal Ayub likened the whole session to a murder in the night. Soon enough, it was hard to find a power centre that wasn’t offended by the assembly. Nor did it help that the League, having repaired its fortunes, was now asking Fatima Jinnah to take over the party. By nearly all metrics, the fortress group was ending 1954 in the middle of its own personal nightmare. Fatima Jinnah was asked to lead the Muslim League, just as Ayub Khan was moving to evict it from the assembly. Their rivalry would climax 11 years later, during the presidential election of 1965. But it woke up soon enough: the governor-general, resting in the north, rushed back. The memoirs of generals Ayub and Musa roughly corroborate each other as to the fortress group’s tailspin over the next few weeks: in one surreal meeting at Ghulam’s residence on 23 October, the governor-general — lying prone on hardboard — screamed abuse at his guests, ordered Ayub to take over, and refused to give Bogra another chance. A happy medium was worked out the next night: Ayub moved his soldiers, Mirza padlocked the assembly, and the new Constitution was stillborn 72 hours before its scheduled passage. To little pushback, prime minister Bogra caved almost immediately to the coup. East Bengal’s two biggest leaders buckled soon after — the price of Suhrawardy and Fazlul Huq’s acquiescence turned out to be a ministry each. The rest of the press was smacked with censorship. Foreign journals were instead treated to Iskander Mirza, who told them the electorate was bound to act “foolish”; democracy having “run riot during seven years in Pakistan”. Tamizuddin, 70 years on If there was resistance, it came from the speaker — heavily surveilled Tamizuddin Khan — who left for court in a burqa , and whose London barrister,  D. N. Pritt, flew into Karachi disguised as a surgeon. Tamizuddin couldn’t afford Pritt’s fees; they had to be covered by philanthropist and insurance magnate Roshan Ali Bhimjee. This would be in stark contrast to the state’s treasure chest: Ghulam’s lawyer, Sir Ivor Jennings, would be paid seven times the chief justice’s annual compensation. Of course, Jennings’s case was also much tougher: the governor-general, acting as the shadow of an alien queen, had dissolved a sovereign assembly, seized power, and installed a regime of his own. And while Ghulam had declared that the constitutional machinery had “broken down”, the opposite was true — it had whirred to life. The reason for sacking the assembly wasn’t that it had failed to come up with a Constitution. It was that it had succeeded. Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad. So the deep state tried another tack: that parliament had lost its representative character, having chugged on for so many years. Yet this would have been believable had it been shuttered after the ruling party’s thrashing at the polls in East Bengal in 1954. That it was left alive only proved the assembly was meant to finish its task. Not least, whatever the sins of parliament, nothing in the law allowed for the governor-general to handpick a cabinet of his own — hence ministers Ayub and Mirza named as respondents in Tamizuddin’s petition. Up against such strongmen, Tamizuddin hoped the court’s writs would act as no less than flowers from heaven. And they did: after several packed hearings, with citizens sitting on prayer mats in front of the domed Sindh Chief Court, the judges found for Tamizuddin by unanimous decision. Not only was parliament sovereign, “I am unshaken in my belief,” held Justice M. Bukhsh Memon, “that the Governor-General had no power of any kind to dissolve the Constituent Assembly.” The Munir court Beaten on all fronts, Jennings switched strategies: in an unwinnable case, best to dodge the merits altogether. In its appeal before the Federal Court (now the Supreme Court), the state argued that the Sindh Chief Court never had the power to issue writs, because the law providing for such powers had never been assented to by the governor-general. Chief Justice Munir. And the governor-general’s assent was very much required, given Pakistan was still a dominion under the queen. It was a lawyer’s loophole; one that Justice Muhammad Munir had already closed in Khuhro vs Federation in 1950, holding that no such assent was required. We now know Munir was all set to change his mind, and that he was in constant touch with Ghulam through coded messages, relayed via secretary. Less discussed, however, is just how blatantly Ghulam and his lawyers signalled that an adverse verdict would never be honoured. Silky threats were framed in polite legalese: the governor-general felt it undesirable, his senior lawyer Diplock told Munir in open court, “to abrogate that other essential feature of the democratic constitution: the rule of force, to prevent the matter coming before the courts”. Translation: The governor-general could have used naked coercion to stop you judges from hearing this case — but he hasn’t yet. “My Lords,” Diplock carried on, “it may be, indeed it would have been his duty, had circumstances so necessitated, to take those steps without regard to the writ which had been issued, because salus populi suprema lex : to go as far as that — fortunately — it has not been necessary at present.” Translation: The people’s safety comes first (salus populi suprema lex). That means he can ignore your orders, as and when you make that necessary. And Ghulam’s continued control over the coercive apparatus weighed heavy on the chief justice, as he himself would admit years later. Hence, in contravention of all law, precedent, and basic sense, the Munir court axed the assembly — Jinnah’s greatest hope. Most incredible of all, it never decided the core question: whether the assembly was dissolved rightly or wrongly. In his farewell speech, Justice Munir said that had he gone another way in Tamizuddin , “I am quite sure that there would have been chaos in the country and a revolution would have been formally enacted, possibly by bloodshed.” Yet such a decision only sped up the ‘revolution’ when it came — in 1958, led by Ayub — which the judge blessed at once. Brute strength is its own excuse. Even so, it’s hard to overemphasise just how much Munir’s verdict in Tamizuddin altered Pakistan’s destiny. As scholar Allen McGrath writes, “One of the most important differences between Ghulam Muhammad’s Pakistan and the nation as it was under Jinnah, Liaquat, and Nazimuddin was that the Constituent Assembly no longer possessed the sovereign power of the state.” And when Munir denied the existence of the assembly’s sovereignty, he destroyed the country’s existing constitutional basis. In essence, sovereign power in Pakistan would become a prize, to be seized by the strongest. It still is. Final frontiers A smidge over 70 years to the day, the relationship between power and legitimacy remains as tenuous. The Supreme Court, too, finds itself having to face, in full view, the high courts’ ‘demolition’, to quote from the plea moved by five Islamabad judges. “This petition,” they submit, “is a desperate measure of the last resort.” And the choice is a stark one: that fidelity to the Constitution either demands hanging up their robes, “or to beseech the Supreme Court to answer some hard truths”. Will that Court answer the call to its conscience the way it did the first time?",

      "summary_en": "It started with the judiciary. Or, at least, what the judiciary was capable of. Just a few months before they finalised the Constitution on September 21 — that is, 71 years ago this week — Pakistan’s first parliament introduced a safety valve in the system. It was called writ jurisdiction. The change didn’t require a lawyer to understand: the superior courts could now issue special orders called writs. These would direct the executive to protect fundamental rights, or restrain it from abusing its powers. And the House knew a thing or two about such abuse: the year was 1954, and the law — and who got to pass it — was at the heart of democracy’s future. Khwaja Nazimuddin’s ministry had just fallen to the deep state, with battle lines drawn between them: at times dubbed the Bengal and Punjab groups (reductive), or federalists and centralisers (misleading). Yet the real fight was between the elected and unelected: a forum group versus a fortress group. In fairness, it could well be said that the first was quite capable of excesses, just as the second was of sound decisions. What can’t be said, however, is that both were legitimate. Ultimately, however, the judiciary would decide that question, the new amendment having boosted its standing. Writs, as Justice M. R. Kayani told college kids in Lahore, “are flowers of paradise, and the whole length and breadth of Pakistan is not wide enough to contain their perfume”. Provided, of course, parliament stood by the judges. “It is the force of opinion which makes good laws,” said Justice Kayani, “and in this particular case, you must pray for the long life of the Bengali members who made the necessary noise.” Justice M. R. Kayani, photo courtesy Rashid Ashraf. Flowers of paradise: the First Amendment Those noises were originally made in the summer of 1954, when that year’s first amendment to the Government of India Act — Pakistan’s makeshift constitution — brought in writs. At the centre of attention was legal genius A. K. Brohi, whose own allegiances were a matter of season: too savvy for forum or fortress, Brohi would, at various points in that pitched battle, lean with whoever was ahead. Writs enabled justice, he told the assembly, “far more speedily than by resort to the ordinary procedure”. The high courts would thus become “custodians of the rights of the people”. A. K. Brohi Even the opposition’s Dhirendra Nath Datta, of the tragic Pakistan National Congress, agreed. “… The way in which indiscriminate arrests have been made in my province … the morale of the people has been completely broken.” One wonders what Datta would make of terrorism FIRs against protesting lawyers today. He nonetheless concluded, “I cannot but congratulate the government for introducing a bill like this, which is aimed at safeguarding the interests of the people from the executive zulm .” The first amendment was so passed. Zulm , it was hoped, would be made that much harder. Open to abuse: ‘transferring’ judges Interestingly, there were also heated debates, over a half-century before Lahore’s Justice Sarfraz Dogar showed up in the Islamabad High Court, on whether or not to pass a law providing for judges being transferred from high court to high court. Murmurs came from the forum group’s Abdur Rab Nishtar and Mahmud Husain, recently purged from the cabinet in Pakistan’s first coup in 1953 (their removals informed, as cables in London revealed, by hatreds jointly felt by Iskander Mirza and British mandarins). Nishtar hoped they could “avoid” such a law altogether: in a federal system, there had to be an autonomous judiciary in all provinces. Otherwise, the law would “give opportunity to a gentleman outside a particular judicial unit to exercise administrative powers”, which might hurt his adopted high court. Mahmud Husain, too, thought a law meant to secure judicial independence could go wrong if the executive started ping-ponging judges: “It may be under certain circumstances that this power is abused.” He suggested such transfer happen only if “the initiative is to come from the judiciary itself”, and on the recommendation of the chief justice of Pakistan. Left unsaid was what would happen if the chief justice, as well as his judges, were also chosen by the executive — as the 26th Amendment trainwreck now allows. Reasons to fight With the power to issue writs in place, the Long Parliament finally took aim at the governor-general, a relentless old man backed by Iskander Mirza’s bureaucrats and Ayub Khan’s generals. To be sure, the forum group’s humiliations at the hands of the fortress group had been bitter and many: martial law in Lahore, coups in Karachi, and emergency in Dhaka, all within a year. But the solution, the members knew, could only be through a permanent political settlement — one their departed boss Muhammad Ali Jinnah had promised they would get to write. In sum, democracy, to be delivered via a Fifth Amendment. Deposed in the first coup: Nazimuddin, Nishtar, Mahmud Husain Lesser motives varied. The late cabinet’s Nazimuddin and Mahmud Husain, had neither forgiven nor forgotten the governor-general’s purge; they now had their sights on a federal future. Their rivals in the present cabinet, mostly loath to poke the bear that had selected them, had outliers like Brohi, who saw the advantage of shutting out the gloved hand for good. Meanwhile, members from East Bengal, like the brash and bold Fazlur Rahman (not to be confused with today’s maulana), were sick of the Punjab gentry’s plans to fuse West Pakistan’s seats into one bloc. If the Bengalis were a majority of the people, then they had to be a majority in parliament. Self-preservation also played a part: more thuggish members, like Qaiyum Khan, feared PRODA, the anti-corruption law of the time, as a stick the governor-general would soon beat them over the heads with. Finally, the prime minister and leader of the house, Bogra, hadn’t been told anything by the rebels until right before. He would go along anyway. Because passing the Constitution, it was thought, could cure such afflictions. In the words of one bemused British cable from that month, “The motives which inspire Pakistani politicians are so mixed that it is almost impossible to predict in advance what line they will take”. All that could be said is “the fact that the new Constitution is now very close”. September rebels: the governor-general defanged In the wee hours of September 21, 1954, that new Constitution was given its final touches. By then, the only Leaguers left in the assembly were the Bill’s 29 supporters, 28 of whom were from outside the Punjab. Part of the reason this fightback would merit such little coverage was its stodgy authors: League conservatives from East Bengal, Sindh, and today’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in direct opposition to Punjab one-uniters, Bengali nationalists, and the military establishment. But their Bill was explosive: the Fifth Amendment, tabled by Sindh’s M. H. Gazdar, and hurried along by speaker Tamizuddin. The ayes rang out in 10 minutes: the establishment was rebuked, the governor-general’s powers to sack the centre scuppered, and the cabinet made dependent on the assembly’s confidence. In the September vote, 29 ayes in just 10 minutes clipped the Governor-General’s powers and bound the cabinet to the assembly’s confidence. The draft Constitution of 1954 also raised Bengali to a national language, entrusted judicial appointments to the country’s chief justice, and buried One Unit out of hand. “One can only say to the country that the best has been done,” closed Brohi, adding that “posterity alone can be the sole and competent judge.” The Constitution was sent to the printers, to cheers from the press. “Democracy in Pakistan has come alive,” Dawn said, hailing the “zeal, speed, and determination” of the assembly. After years of heartache, it had fulfilled its mission. Others weren’t so enthused: upon hearing the news, London sweated that the forum crew would ditch the Western alliance; that they might reject the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (Seato) and even step out of the Commonwealth. Punjab’s landed gentry wept at having to concede the Bengalis their majority. And future field marshal Ayub likened the whole session to a murder in the night. Soon enough, it was hard to find a power centre that wasn’t offended by the assembly. Nor did it help that the League, having repaired its fortunes, was now asking Fatima Jinnah to take over the party. By nearly all metrics, the fortress group was ending 1954 in the middle of its own personal nightmare. Fatima Jinnah was asked to lead the Muslim League, just as Ayub Khan was moving to evict it from the assembly. Their rivalry would climax 11 years later, during the presidential election of 1965. But it woke up soon enough: the governor-general, resting in the north, rushed back. The memoirs of generals Ayub and Musa roughly corroborate each other as to the fortress group’s tailspin over the next few weeks: in one surreal meeting at Ghulam’s residence on 23 October, the governor-general — lying prone on hardboard — screamed abuse at his guests, ordered Ayub to take over, and refused to give Bogra another chance. A happy medium was worked out the next night: Ayub moved his soldiers, Mirza padlocked the assembly, and the new Constitution was stillborn 72 hours before its scheduled passage. To little pushback, prime minister Bogra caved almost immediately to the coup.

Translation: The governor-general could have used naked coercion to stop you judges from hearing this case — but he hasn’t yet. “My Lords,” Diplock carried on, “it may be, indeed it would have been his duty, had circumstances so necessitated, to take those steps without regard to the writ which had been issued, because salus populi suprema lex : to go as far as that — fortunately — it has not been necessary at present.” Translation: The people’s safety comes first (salus populi suprema lex). That means he can ignore your orders, as and when you make that necessary. And Ghulam’s continued control over the coercive apparatus weighed heavy on the chief justice, as he himself would admit years later. Hence, in contravention of all law, precedent, and basic sense, the Munir court axed the assembly — Jinnah’s greatest hope. Most incredible of all, it never decided the core question: whether the assembly was dissolved rightly or wrongly. In his farewell speech, Justice Munir said that had he gone another way in Tamizuddin , “I am quite sure that there would have been chaos in the country and a revolution would have been formally enacted, possibly by bloodshed.” Yet such a decision only sped up the ‘revolution’ when it came — in 1958, led by Ayub — which the judge blessed at once. Brute strength is its own excuse. Even so, it’s hard to overemphasise just how much Munir’s verdict in Tamizuddin altered Pakistan’s destiny. As scholar Allen McGrath writes, “One of the most important differences between Ghulam Muhammad’s Pakistan and the nation as it was under Jinnah, Liaquat, and Nazimuddin was that the Constituent Assembly no longer possessed the sovereign power of the state.” And when Munir denied the existence of the assembly’s sovereignty, he destroyed the country’s existing constitutional basis. In essence, sovereign power in Pakistan would become a prize, to be seized by the strongest. It still is. Final frontiers A smidge over 70 years to the day, the relationship between power and legitimacy remains as tenuous. The Supreme Court, too, finds itself having to face, in full view, the high courts’ ‘demolition’, to quote from the plea moved by five Islamabad judges. “This petition,” they submit, “is a desperate measure of the last resort.” And the choice is a stark one: that fidelity to the Constitution either demands hanging up their robes, “or to beseech the Supreme Court to answer some hard truths”. Will that Court answer the call to its conscience the way it did the first time?",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan’s floods leave lasting scars on its children",
      "summary_orig": "Azan “has seen everything. He knows his parents are gone. He just doesn’t yet understand how to live without them.” Shams ur Rehman is talking about his nine-year-old nephew Muhammad Azan, who has been staying with him and his family in Buner, a district in north-western Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Azan’s parents, as well as his three brothers, were killed when flash floods tore through the valley in the middle of August. Also in Buner, 17-year-old Qadir Ahmed has to carry another burden. On 15 August, his family house collapsed in the floods. “The water carried away my mother… now, I must look after my [four] younger brothers and sisters.” Not long ago, Ahmed passed his matriculation exams and aspired to go to college. Now, suddenly, he has to step in as the head of the family. “My education has stopped,” he says. “It is very difficult to take care of my siblings after losing our home and our mother.” Pakistan has been experiencing unprecedented floods and landslides. The country’s National Disaster Management Authority ( NDMA ) reports that since late June, more than 1,000 people have been killed, with nearly 1,100 left injured due to monsoon-related disasters. Around half of all deaths have been in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where nearly 4,700 homes have been destroyed or damaged. The floods have not spared other parts of the country. In Punjab, several major rivers faced large swells due to historic levels of rain in mid-August. Water discharges from across the Indian border have also contributed to villages and farmlands becoming submerged. More than two million people have been evacuated and outbreaks of skin- and water-borne diseases are expected. In the northern administrative territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, entire valleys have been cut off due to landslides, and more than 3,000 displaced people are staying in temporary camps. In Sindh, southern Pakistan, at least 150,000 people had been evacuated to safer areas as of 12 September. Ahmed and Azan’s experiences are just two examples of how the floods in Pakistan are devastating the lives of children and causing trauma with long-lasting impacts. Trauma without treatment In Khalti village in Gilgit-Baltistan, Waseem Akram, a teacher, saw his private school shut down in mid-August when floods washed away houses and caused landslides that blocked roads. “Children are not going to school. They don’t have books, uniforms or shelter. Their behaviour has changed; they show anger, fear or silence,” he says, adding: “Many may drop out entirely.” Muhammad Sohail, media coordinator for Rescue 1122, a government emergency service for disaster rescue, says that at present, Pakistan’s disaster response is focused only on physical rescue. “But mental health is just as important.” He notes that systematic trauma care is practically unavailable. “Some officers are trained in Psychological First Aid, but there is no long-term counselling for children… This gap leaves scars that last for years.” Fariha Sheikh is a social worker volunteering with the collection and distribution of food, period kits and other supplies in flood-hit villages on the outskirts of Sialkot and Narowal districts in Punjab, eastern Pakistan. She observes that children have been one of the most vulnerable groups. “Families are displaced, many of them living under open skies or in temporary shelters… kids from the villages have lost everything,” she says. Some officers are trained in Psychological First Aid, but there is no long-term counselling for children… this gap leaves scars that last for years “You can see the fear and uncertainty in their eyes… their normal life has just been snatched away,” she adds, noting that many are experiencing panic attacks. Through her volunteer work, Sheikh has encountered children who have lost their parents. “It’s heartbreaking. Some kids don’t even fully realise what has happened, but they know their parents are not there anymore,” she says. Added to these devastating upheavals are the physical dangers and changes they face. “Children are falling sick because of dirty water [from the floods] and a lack of food, and schools are either destroyed or being used as shelters,” Sheikh notes. The trauma faced by children experiencing floods are exacerbated by the dangers they face from poverty, displacement and school closures. In Punjab alone, over 700,000 children have been affected by disruption to their education, with more than 2,900 schools forced to shut down due to the floods as of mid-September, according to The Nation. Unicef warned in the aftermath of Pakistan’s 2022 floods that the longer schools remained closed, the higher the risk of impacted children dropping out, which then increases the likelihood of them being forced into child labour and marriage. When policies fail children Amid the tragedy is the question of Pakistan’s lack of preparedness for such extreme weather. According to Yasir Darya, founder of environmental consultancy Darya Lab and the Karachi-based Climate Action Center, institutional failures have caused disasters to become even deadlier. He highlights how early warning mechanisms planned after the 2022 flood did not come to fruition, and blames poor governance. “Communities remain cut off and unprotected,” he says. “It is a societal crisis as much as a climate one.” These failures mean greater devastation from extreme weather and climate events, which will continue to severely impact children’s mental health. We don’t just need rations; we need proper houses, schools, hospitals, libraries and recreational spaces so children can feel normal again Earlier this year, researchers coined the term “Environmentally driven Adverse Childhood Experiences ( E-ACEs )” to refer to severe stressors children may face when exposed to prolonged, recurring or intense extreme weather and climate events. These can cause toxic stress similar to that seen in children experiencing abuse or neglect. The researchers caution that repeated experiences with floods, displacement and family separation may impair their brain development and increase their vulnerability to long-term health risks. They also refer to climate-related adverse childhood experiences as a humanitarian crisis of the 21st century that particularly impact children of low- and middle-income countries such as Pakistan, where more people are being displaced. Despite the clear need to protect children from climate change impacts, they remain largely absent from climate policies. Analysis published this year by the Early Childhood Development Action Network ( ECDAN ) found that of the 10 countries expected to have the largest populations by 2100, only six, including Pakistan, mention children or youth in their national climate policies. And even these largely fail to address the specific needs of young children. In the case of Pakistan, references to children in its policies only focused on child mortality rates without addressing broader early childhood development needs, including the sustained provision of nutrition, education and healthcare during climate shocks. In northern Pakistan, families such as those of Azan and Qadir see few signs of such planning. Displaced communities receive food and tents lasting just days, while education is disrupted for months, they told Dialogue Earth. Beyond survival Akram, the teacher, stresses that aid should not be limited to emergency tents and food, but focused on rebuilding, as young flood survivors need stability in their lives. “We don’t just need rations; we need proper houses, schools, hospitals, libraries and recreational spaces so children can feel normal again,” he says. “Otherwise, these children will lose their futures.” Sheikh, the social worker, echoes these concerns, saying: “[Children] need food, clean water, medicines, but also safe spaces and care. Their mental and emotional state matters as much as their physical survival. For a child, losing home and safety is too much to carry.” As the water begins to recede in parts of Pakistan, families returning to their homes look to the significant task of rebuilding. For many impacted children, the trauma they have experienced is evident. Azan now clings tightly to his uncle during storms. Unless there is rapid investment in adaptation and trauma care, as well as the inclusion of children in national climate adaptation policies, Pakistan is at risk of raising a generation characterised not by its potential, but by its losses.

      "summary_en": "Azan “has seen everything. He knows his parents are gone. He just doesn’t yet understand how to live without them.” Shams ur Rehman is talking about his nine-year-old nephew Muhammad Azan, who has been staying with him and his family in Buner, a district in north-western Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Azan’s parents, as well as his three brothers, were killed when flash floods tore through the valley in the middle of August. Also in Buner, 17-year-old Qadir Ahmed has to carry another burden. On 15 August, his family house collapsed in the floods. “The water carried away my mother… now, I must look after my [four] younger brothers and sisters.” Not long ago, Ahmed passed his matriculation exams and aspired to go to college. Now, suddenly, he has to step in as the head of the family. “My education has stopped,” he says. “It is very difficult to take care of my siblings after losing our home and our mother.” Pakistan has been experiencing unprecedented floods and landslides. The country’s National Disaster Management Authority ( NDMA ) reports that since late June, more than 1,000 people have been killed, with nearly 1,100 left injured due to monsoon-related disasters. Around half of all deaths have been in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where nearly 4,700 homes have been destroyed or damaged. The floods have not spared other parts of the country. In Punjab, several major rivers faced large swells due to historic levels of rain in mid-August. Water discharges from across the Indian border have also contributed to villages and farmlands becoming submerged. More than two million people have been evacuated and outbreaks of skin- and water-borne diseases are expected. In the northern administrative territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, entire valleys have been cut off due to landslides, and more than 3,000 displaced people are staying in temporary camps. In Sindh, southern Pakistan, at least 150,000 people had been evacuated to safer areas as of 12 September.

In Nepal’s case, it was the suspension of several popular social networks – but the anger ran much deeper.",

      "summary_orig": "An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad on Monday issued a bailable arrest warrant for PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser in a case related to the March 2023 clashes outside the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC). Hours-long clashes took place between PTI workers and the Islamabad police on March 18, 2023, when former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the FJC to attend a hearing in the first Toshakhana case , in which he was later arrested in August that year and has been behind bars since then. The same day, the Punjab police personnel had entered Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore, which had also been the venue of a chaotic stalemate between the cops and the PTI just days before. ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over today’s hearing. Advocate Sardar Masroof Khan, Amna Ali and others appeared as the legal team for the PTI leaders, while Advocate Sardar Muhammad Razzaq was present as former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi’s counsel. The judge issued a bailable arrest warrant for Qaiser, ordering that he be produced before the court. The judge accepted the applications seeking exemption from appearance for Elahi, former finance minister Asad Umar and PTI’s Shibli Faraz, who was recently disqualified from his role as the Senate opposition leader. Subsequently, the judge adjourned the proceedings till October 6. The case, registered at the Counter-Terrorism Department police station under Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997, had also named Imran. A letter had been written to the law ministry about the proceedings against the ex-premier and a response was awaited. ATA case over Federal Judicial Complex violence As of March 22, 2023, the Islamabad Police had arrested a total of 316 PTI supporters for allegedly attacking police officers and causing chaos outside the FJC. The case had also invoked sections 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc), 395 (punishment for dacoity), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage to amount of one hundred rupees), 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code. The first information report (FIR) named 18 people involved in causing damage to the FJC, 22 others involved in causing damage in the FJC’s parking area and lighting up fires, and 19 others involved in allegedly injuring police officials. It also mentioned that stones, lighters and bottles filled with petrol were recovered from some of them.",

      "summary_orig": "The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) has arrested 89 terrorists in 940 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) launched across Punjab over the past three months, the department said in a statement on Monday. There has been a recent uptick in terror attacks in Pakistan over the past year. The CTD regularly carries out operations to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. During the three months, 14 terrorists were arrested in Lahore, 14 in Rawalpindi, seven each in Faisalabad and Bahawalpur, six each in Jhang and Sargodha, five in Sahiwal, four from Gujranwala and three each from Bahawalnagar and Gujrat, the statement read. “Of the arrested terrorists, 55 belong to Fitna al Khawarij , five are from ISIS (Islamic State), and two each are from Al-Qaeda, Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Jeay Sindh,” the statement added. The state uses the term Fitna al Khawarij to refer to terrorists of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). According to the CTD, items seized during the raids include 20.2 kilogrammes of explosive material, 85 detonators, 183 feet of safety fuse wire, 717 pamphlets belonging to a banned organisation, magazines, detonating cord, mobile phones and cash. The CTD added that 87 criminal cases have been registered against the arrested suspects, and investigations are underway. “The arrested individuals had been planning attacks on important buildings in several cities,” the statement read. “CTD Punjab remains vigilant and committed to the ‘Safe Punjab’ objective. We will spare no effort to bring terrorists and anti-state elements to justice. “In related security activity during the current week, local police and security agencies carried out 13,521 combing operations, checked 552,692 people, arrested 1,131 suspicious persons, registered 1,061 FIRs (first information reports) and achieved 906 recoveries. Earlier this week, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CTD neutralised three terrorists, including an Afghan national, during an IBO carried out in Khyber district. Two of the three militants killed during the IBO were involved in a suicide bombing in Peshawar, which led to the deaths of a sub-inspector and a constable.

      "summary_en": "The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) has arrested 89 terrorists in 940 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) launched across Punjab over the past three months, the department said in a statement on Monday. There has been a recent uptick in terror attacks in Pakistan over the past year. The CTD regularly carries out operations to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. During the three months, 14 terrorists were arrested in Lahore, 14 in Rawalpindi, seven each in Faisalabad and Bahawalpur, six each in Jhang and Sargodha, five in Sahiwal, four from Gujranwala and three each from Bahawalnagar and Gujrat, the statement read. “Of the arrested terrorists, 55 belong to Fitna al Khawarij , five are from ISIS (Islamic State), and two each are from Al-Qaeda, Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Jeay Sindh,” the statement added. The state uses the term Fitna al Khawarij to refer to terrorists of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). According to the CTD, items seized during the raids include 20.2 kilogrammes of explosive material, 85 detonators, 183 feet of safety fuse wire, 717 pamphlets belonging to a banned organisation, magazines, detonating cord, mobile phones and cash. The CTD added that 87 criminal cases have been registered against the arrested suspects, and investigations are underway. “The arrested individuals had been planning attacks on important buildings in several cities,” the statement read. “CTD Punjab remains vigilant and committed to the ‘Safe Punjab’ objective. We will spare no effort to bring terrorists and anti-state elements to justice. “In related security activity during the current week, local police and security agencies carried out 13,521 combing operations, checked 552,692 people, arrested 1,131 suspicious persons, registered 1,061 FIRs (first information reports) and achieved 906 recoveries. Earlier this week, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CTD neutralised three terrorists, including an Afghan national, during an IBO carried out in Khyber district. Two of the three militants killed during the IBO were involved in a suicide bombing in Peshawar, which led to the deaths of a sub-inspector and a constable. A statement issued by the CTD said that the department conducted the operation based on the reported presence of Fazal Noor, a commander of the banned militant group Islamic State Khorasan Province and his group members in the Ali Masjid area of the district.",

      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reached New York on Monday to attend the United Nations General Assembly’s (UNGA) 80th session, where the Palestine issue and Gaza are set to dominate the proceedings. The high-level segment of the UNGA session is to be held from September 22 to 26, with Pakistan’s delegation to be led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according to the Foreign Office (FO). At the UN, PM Shehbaz will call for the resolution of the occupied Kashmir and Palestine issues. “On arrival, FM Dar was received by Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, Ambassador Rizwan Saeed Shiekh, Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States and senior officials of the Mission,” the FO said on X. “The DPM/FM will have a busy programme in New York. Besides accompanying the PM to his many engagements, the DPM/FM will represent Pakistan in numerous ministerial and high-level meetings and also hold over a dozen bilateral meetings with his counterparts,” the statement added. As nearly 150 world leaders gather to mark the UN’s 80th anniversary, the global peace forum finds itself surrounded by protests and engulfed in wars. From its inception, the unresolved question of Palestine has haunted the UN, testing both its credibility and its capacity to deliver peace. The high-level international conference for the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution”, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, aims to revive support for a two-state solution. In a break with convention, the UNGA last week voted to allow Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to address the event by video link, after the US denied him and his delegation visas to attend the meeting. PM Shehbaz to call for resolution of Palestine, Kashmir issues PM Shehbaz, in his address to the UNGA, will “urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination” for India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine, according to state-run Radio Pakistan . The premier will also draw the attention of the global community towards the “grave crisis in Gaza and call for decisive action to end the suffering of the Palestinians”. “He will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development,” the report added. The FO said yesterday that PM Shehbaz will be among the attendees of a meeting of “select” Muslim leaders with United States President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA session in New York to exchange views on issues pertaining to regional and international peace and security. “The prime minister will have bilateral meetings on the sidelines with several world leaders and senior UN officials for exchange of views on issues of mutual interest,” the FO’s statement added. “He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN Member States to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council.” More to follow",

      "summary_orig": "Floodwaters are now heading for their ultimate destination: the Arabian Sea. The Indus River meets the sea in the coastal districts of Thatta and Sujawal through various creeks. Flash floods triggered by extreme weather events this year were initially reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, resulting in massive loss of life and property. Then, after a long time, floods were seen in the eastern rivers: Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej. Chenab had a massive flow of close to 1.1 million cusecs in late August, spelling disaster in south Punjab. Till the third week of September, the Punjab government remained busy in flood fighting. That economic and infrastructural losses would be worth billions in two provinces was a foregone conclusion. Flooding and breaches caused widespread damage to the agriculture sector of the largest province, besides population displacement. After a decade, a flow involving over 600,000 cusecs discharge passed through Guddu and Sukkur. Back in 2015, Guddu had passed 735,246 cusecs of flow after receiving a discharge of 754,005 cusecs on August 3, 2015. Sukkur received an inflow of 703,656 cusecs on Aug 4, passing 660,276 cusecs discharge downstream. Water regulators and farmers anticipate a comfortable 2025-26 Rabi season after flood hardships and lost crops in May Kotri barrage, however, had an inflow of 626,193 cusecs and an outflow of 600,018 cusecs in Sept 2022 but only on account of flooding from Balochistan that ended up in Manchhar Lake. The lake was breached to let flows enter the Indus River. Kotri, however, is expected to pass a discharge of 400,000-450,000 cusecs now. As far as Sindh, the tail-end province of the Indus River system, is concerned, regeneration of riverine forests, replenishing of groundwater aquifers, growth in mangroves (coastal forests) and a relatively better Rabi crop season is now likely in view of this flooding. Floodwaters have inundated most of the low-lying riverine area and at some locations touched both dykes of the river. Even highlands in katcha areas were submerged, leading to the evacuation of dwellers. Water regulators and farmers anticipate a comfortable 2025-26 Rabi season that will start in October. Last year 20 per cent water shortage was predicted by the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) in Rabi season, but Irsa’s Director of Operations Khalid Idrees Rana seems complacent. “We are entering the Rabi season with a carryover in two reservoirs. Tarbela Dam currently has a storage of 5.8 million acre feet (MAF) and Mangla Dam 7 MAF, so Mangla is considered to have more storage capacity than Tarbela,” he explained. He optimistically expects to have 1 MAF carryover cumulatively in Tarbela and Mangla Dams by March 31, 2026, when the Kharif season will commence — if the winter rainfall system remains supportive — and if the link canals’ operation are not be needed early in the season to divert water from the Indus to the Jhelum-Chenab zone. He mentioned that currently Mangla flows were being used only for the Upper Jhelum Canal, which doesn’t have any other water source. Inflows at Mangla had dropped only in Sept 2019; otherwise, it invariably had 25,000 to 30,000 cusecs of inflows. Sindh’s member in Irsa, Mohammad Ehsan Leghari , pointed out that if run-of-the-river flows came into effect, the situation would be better. “Soil in many areas has moisture, thus needs less water for winter cropping. Still, the Irsa Advisory Committee will be in a better position in October to assess water availability,” he said. This Kharif season, initially, severe water shortage had hit Sindh, especially at the time of flowering and fruit setting of mangoes. Furthermore, it had negative implications for cotton, whose acreage dropped significantly as per the agriculture department’s figures. “It appears to be all good news for Sindh in terms of floods that offer a chance to the river’s ecosystem to live, although most of its riverine forests have been eradicated,” remarked Sindh Abadgar Board president Mahmood Nawaz Shah. Still, he said, floods have regenerated aquifers and water bodies. “I don’t rule out bumper Kharif crops in the current year due to better water availability and beneficial rainfall,” he said. He, however, also called for modernising the irrigation system and said floods were once again a stark reminder for decision makers to free natural waterways. River flows — a finite source — have brought plenty of silt, in addition to water flows, not only to benefit riverine soil for regeneration of the forests but also for improving the biodiversity of the belt. An informal assessment done by Vice Chancellor Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Tandojam Prof Dr Altaf Siyal estimated 9.4 MAF conveyance losses of water from April to date between Guddu and Kotri barrages. “A major part, or 80pc, of this 9.4 MAF has gone into soil through seepage, thus recharging the groundwater aquifer,” he said. According to the break-up of his calculation, out of 9.4 MAF, 2.4 MAF was recorded between Guddu and Sukkur and 7 7MAF between Sukkur and Kotri. Conveyance losses are more between Guddu and Sukkur (230 cusecs per km) than between Sukkur and Kotri (110 cusecs per km). Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, September 22nd, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "A new phase of distancing between Bangladesh and India has been brought on by recent changes in bilateral trade along their shared border. Although India has traditionally viewed Bangladesh as a significant ally in South Asia, its current steps appear more severe, even punitive. Its displeasure with Dhaka’s political shift has been demonstrated by Delhi’s employing a range of strategies, including sudden trade restrictions, public demonstrations, and heightened strategic posturing. India appears to be unhappy about the collapse of the Awami League government and the emergence of an interim government led by Dr Muhammad Yunus, despite it being a domestic issue. Delhi now faces a less predictable opponent after years of supporting the previous government. Border pressure, a diplomatic freeze, and trade retaliation seem to be more reactive than proactive. Since May 7, India’s border force is said to have pushed more than 1,600 individuals into Bangladesh, including Indian citizens and the displaced Rohingya. Such actions are against international norms. During a vulnerable time of political transition, these unannounced arrivals have placed strain on Bangladesh’s internal security and the local government. This has also led to public discontent and instability. When pressure is put on Bangladesh’s security forces to react, there is a greater chance that the situation may escalate. The tactic fits into what some argue is a broader pattern in India’s regional playbook that disseminates political concepts through strategic pressure. The issue is exacerbated by India’s aggressive efforts to upgrade its infrastructure. Over the past decade, India has effectively encircled Bangladesh with an extensive network of rivers, trains, and roads, connecting the northeast to the mainland. India possesses significant logistical capabilities, thanks to projects such as the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit via Myanmar and transportation corridors through Bangladesh. New Delhi is unhappy after Dhaka’s recent diplomatic engagements with Pakistan Dr Yunus’s statement that “Bangladesh is their sole path to the sea” was viewed as a strategic issue in Delhi due to the “landlocked” nature of the northeastern Indian provinces. In response, India has resumed military preparations around key locations and reactivated the airbase in Kailashahar, Tripura. Delhi is even more uneasy about Bangladesh’s decision to revive Lalmonirhat airport, given its proximity to the Siliguri Corridor. Critical supply networks for Bangladeshi exports, which primarily include processed foods, apparel, and home goods, have been impacted by India’s sudden restrictions. Order delays and stopped shipments are affecting small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly those that supply to northeastern India. This move, which is sometimes interpreted as a response to Bangladesh’s ban on importing Indian yarn, highlights the significant trade imbalance. In FY2023-24, Bangladesh exported less than $1.6 billion worth of goods to India, but imported approximately $9 billion worth of goods from there. Indian traders are also facing shortages and higher prices in West Bengal and the northeast. Electricity is another weakness. Approximately 2,500MW, or 17 percent of Bangladesh’s total electricity supply, is sourced from imports from India. Any disruption in this may cause serious problems for the urban and industrial sectors in Bangladesh. When evaluating India’s current position, it is essential to consider broader geopolitical developments. Delhi is now on the defensive due to the Modi government’s return with a smaller mandate and growing international criticism, particularly from the US, on issues of religious freedom and democratic backsliding. Not to be overlooked are Dhaka’s recent diplomatic engagements with Pakistan and China . Proposals for a humanitarian channel/corridor to Myanmar’s Rakhine state and preliminary talks on infrastructure cooperation between the three countries have heightened Indian concerns. Delhi is concerned about a shift in the strategic centre of the Bay of Bengal as it may diminish India’s long-standing influence over the region. Employed initially as a catchphrase supporting democratic rebirth, the term “New Bangladesh” has come to be seen by Indian observers as a rejection of India’s long-standing role in Bangladesh. The diplomatic situation has become more complex as a result of this shift in narrative. Back-channel communication has deteriorated, and high-level visits have slowed. In response to Dhaka’s repeated requests for cooperation based on respect for each other’s sovereignty, India has, at best, been reticent. Bangladesh and India have a complex and multifaceted connection. Bangladesh provides India with essential access to its northeast, and India remains Bangladesh’s most significant regional business partner. However, the relationship is unbalanced. Bangladesh’s heavy reliance on Indian energy, trade, and transportation puts it at risk. Given their proximity and shared history, Dhaka should treat Delhi strategically. Can Bangladesh and India put aside temporary solutions and create a cooperative, long-term partnership? This important topic has been brought to light by the current tensions. Dialogue must be the first step in resolving the problem. Bangladesh should initiate high-level talks with partners in both public and private sectors. For managing border and trade challenges, a collaborative fra­mework is essential. Count­ermeasures or retaliation would not work. Dhaka must also increase its diplomatic, energy, and commercial alternatives. One way to reduce an excessive dependence on any one source country is to participate in the forums of ASEAN partners, such as SAFTA and BIMSTEC. At the same time, accepting the new political realities in Dhaka without seeing them as threats is the best course of action for India. There are other ties between the two countries besides trade and treaties. Historical events, waterways, and cultural relations are all comparable. However, both sides now need to be mature enough to sustain this relationship. The current circumstance is a test of vision, strategy, and diplomacy. The choices made in Dhaka and Delhi will have an impact not only on their bilateral relationship but also on the larger South Asian regional order. Instead of writing provocatively, let us write the next chapter cooperatively and practically. Published in Dawn, September 22nd, 2025",

No one claimed responsibility for the incident. Soon after the murder, several ANP leaders and workers also took to the social media to condemn the killing. ANP local chapter president Gul Afzal Khan, deputy general secretary Sadiq Akbar Jan, provincial joint secretary Shah Naseer Khan, Sheikh Jan Zada, and party’s local MPA Mohammad Nisar Khan condemned the killing of Azam Khan, who was additional general secretary of ANP Khar tehsil. The ANP leaders demanded the early arrest of those responsible for the incident. Meanwhile, ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain and general secretary Hussain Shah Yousafzai also condemned the killing and called his murder failure of the government to ensure safety and security of people. In a post shared on ANP’s official Facebook page on Sunday evening, both the leaders expressed concerns and sorrow over the murder of Mr Khan. They noted that the incident occurred near a police post. They mentioned that earlier, Maulana Khan Zeb was also killed by unknown assailants in Bajaur, but the killers still remained at large, showing the government’s failure to maintain peace in the region. “We urge the government to immediately arrest those involved in both the killings.“ Published in Dawn, September 22nd, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Police in the Philippine capital arrested more than 200 people during clashes with masked protesters that erupted on a day of largely peaceful anti-corruption demonstrations, a spokeswoman said on Monday. At least 88 minors were among the initial count of 216 taken into custody on Sunday as police deployed water cannons and deafening sirens against crowds of mostly young, rock-throwing protesters. Manila City Mayor Isko Morena said a 12-year-old boy was the youngest detained. Thousands of Filipinos rallied in Manila on Sunday to vent their anger over a ballooning scandal involving bogus flood-control projects believed to have cost taxpayers billions of dollars. The scandal has seen numerous lawmakers implicated and the leaders of both houses of Congress step down from their positions during an investigation. But Sunday’s street battles, which saw multiple police vehicles set ablaze and the windows of a precinct headquarters shattered, threatened to overshadow demonstrations that had been filled with families, activists, clergy and politicians. “So far, none of them are saying the reasons behind their actions or if somebody paid them to do it,“ regional police spokesperson Major Hazel Asilo told AFP . “As soon as we know their affiliations, we can know if they were part of the protesters or if they were just causing trouble,” she added. According to a statement released on Monday by the Department of Health, about 50 people were brought to a single Manila hospital following the clashes. Another police spokesperson, Major Philipp Ines, said 93 officers had been injured on Sunday, while adding the number of arrested could yet rise as people were still being processed. Rage over the so-called ghost infrastructure projects has been mounting in the Southeast Asian country since President Ferdinand Marcos put them centre stage in a July state of the nation address that followed weeks of deadly flooding . The Department of Finance has estimated that the Philippine economy lost up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2bn) from 2023 to 2025 due to corruption in flood control projects. Greenpeace has suggested the number is actually closer to $18bn. The Philippines on Monday was expecting heavy flooding once more as Super Typhoon Ragasa bore down on the country’s northernmost provinces. The archipelago nation is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, putting millions of people in disaster-prone areas in a state of constant poverty.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister She­hbaz Sharif on Sunday said that as neighbours, the onus is now on India and Pakistan, whether to live in peace or war. Speaking at a gathering of overseas Pakistanis in London, the prime minister said that Pakistan wanted to hold dialogue with India on contentious issues like Kashmir, terrorism, water and trade on the basis of equality. The prime minister said that without the resolution of the Kashmir issue, which was the key to the regional peace, bilateral ties between the two countries could not be established. “Anyone who is thinking otherwise is akin to living in a fool’s paradise,” he said, adding that Kashmiris would get their right to self-determination and freedom. Expresses grief over 64,000 deaths, grave humanitarian situation in Gaza “I have made this offer so many times in the past. We want to discuss Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism issues, not because of any weakness but on the basis of equal terms,” the prime minister said. After visiting Saudi Arabia, PM Shehbaz made a stopover in London for four days and then he will proceed to the US on Monday to attend United Nations General Assembly conference . He said that as the ceasefire between Pakistan and India had been achieved, Pakistan wanted peace, progress and prosperity and an end to unemployment and poverty. Underlining the significance of unity and solidarity which led to triumph in the recent armed conflict with India, PM Shehbaz pledged to guide the country on the path of progress and prosperity. The prime minister said that after India’s baseless allegations over Pah­algam incident, he had offered, during his visit to Kakul, a probe by an international committee into the incident in a fair, impartial and transparent manner, but India did not respond to his offer. On May 6, aggression was unleashed against the innocent civilians and civilian assets were attacked inside Pakistan, leading to causalities, he said, adding that Pakistan in its right of defence, downed six enemy’s fighter jets in one go which made the enemy realise its precarious position. Expressing his grief over 64,000 deaths and grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, he said the world had not witnessed such heart-wrenching scenes The prime minister called upon the Islamic world and the international community to come forward and address the issue urgently. He said that on the basis of hard work of overseas Pakistanis, in the previous year, the country received $38.5 billion in remittances, adding that without this contribution of overseas Pakistanis, the country’s economy could not move forward. He said the country’s economic indicators were showing upward trends and at the diplomatic front, the country was strengthening its ties and position. Speaking on the occasion, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar said that overseas Pakistanis were the country’s diplomats. He said in the year 2022, when the incumbent government came to power, it was a difficult time as the country was at the verge of default, and the global rating agencies and institutions were setting dates in this regard. He said the nation saluted the prime minister for his dynamic leadership that ensured economic turnaround. Enumerating the downward trends in the inflation and interest rates, he resolved that the government was striving for the economic empowerment. Referring to the Indian aggression, he said Pakistan defeated an enemy that boasted of its armed power and regional net security provider, adding that the myth was buried on May 10. Referring to climate change impact, Mr Dar said that Pakistan was vulnerable to climate change and the government was devising projects so that in the coming years, the country could be able to cope with this challenge. He said the government was also raising its voice for the equality and justice, because the climate change was a matter of justice, not only for Pakistan but for any country suffering from the emissions worldwide.

He said the government was also raising its voice for the equality and justice, because the climate change was a matter of justice, not only for Pakistan but for any country suffering from the emissions worldwide.

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister She­hbaz Sharif on Sunday said that as neighbours, the onus is now on India and Pakistan, whether to live in peace or war. Speaking at a gathering of overseas Pakistanis in London, the prime minister said that Pakistan wanted to hold dialogue with India on contentious issues like Kashmir, terrorism, water and trade on the basis of equality. The prime minister said that without the resolution of the Kashmir issue, which was the key to the regional peace, bilateral ties between the two countries could not be established. “Anyone who is thinking otherwise is akin to living in a fool’s paradise,” he said, adding that Kashmiris would get their right to self-determination and freedom. Expresses grief over 64,000 deaths, grave humanitarian situation in Gaza “I have made this offer so many times in the past. We want to discuss Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism issues, not because of any weakness but on the basis of equal terms,” the prime minister said. After visiting Saudi Arabia, PM Shehbaz made a stopover in London for four days and then he will proceed to the US on Monday to attend United Nations General Assembly conference . He said that as the ceasefire between Pakistan and India had been achieved, Pakistan wanted peace, progress and prosperity and an end to unemployment and poverty. Underlining the significance of unity and solidarity which led to triumph in the recent armed conflict with India, PM Shehbaz pledged to guide the country on the path of progress and prosperity. The prime minister said that after India’s baseless allegations over Pah­algam incident, he had offered, during his visit to Kakul, a probe by an international committee into the incident in a fair, impartial and transparent manner, but India did not respond to his offer. On May 6, aggression was unleashed against the innocent civilians and civilian assets were attacked inside Pakistan, leading to causalities, he said, adding that Pakistan in its right of defence, downed six enemy’s fighter jets in one go which made the enemy realise its precarious position. Expressing his grief over 64,000 deaths and grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, he said the world had not witnessed such heart-wrenching scenes The prime minister called upon the Islamic world and the international community to come forward and address the issue urgently. He said that on the basis of hard work of overseas Pakistanis, in the previous year, the country received $38.5 billion in remittances, adding that without this contribution of overseas Pakistanis, the country’s economy could not move forward. He said the country’s economic indicators were showing upward trends and at the diplomatic front, the country was strengthening its ties and position. Speaking on the occasion, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar said that overseas Pakistanis were the country’s diplomats. He said in the year 2022, when the incumbent government came to power, it was a difficult time as the country was at the verge of default, and the global rating agencies and institutions were setting dates in this regard. He said the nation saluted the prime minister for his dynamic leadership that ensured economic turnaround. Enumerating the downward trends in the inflation and interest rates, he resolved that the government was striving for the economic empowerment. Referring to the Indian aggression, he said Pakistan defeated an enemy that boasted of its armed power and regional net security provider, adding that the myth was buried on May 10. Referring to climate change impact, Mr Dar said that Pakistan was vulnerable to climate change and the government was devising projects so that in the coming years, the country could be able to cope with this challenge. He said the government was also raising its voice for the equality and justice, because the climate change was a matter of justice, not only for Pakistan but for any country suffering from the emissions worldwide.

      "summary_orig": "JERUSALEM: Israeli forces blew up more residential buildings in Gaza City , killing at least 37 Palestinians, including a pregnant woman, her two children and a visually impaired man, as tanks pushed further into the densely populated city on Sunday. “The mother, the boy, the girl, and the baby in her womb — we found them all gone,” said Mosallam Al-Hadad, the dead woman’s father-in-law, saying his son had been seriously injured in the strike. “(He) was in a critical condition. We took him to the hospital, and his leg was amputated,” Hadad said. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 65,283 people and wounded 166,575 since October 2023. Thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble. The strikes on besieged Palestinian territory also caused famine and displaced the territory’s population — in many cases multiple times. On Sunday, a number of Pales­tinians were attacked by Israeli settlers in a village south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank, according to Al Jazeera Arabic , quoting local sources. The assault took place in the area of Khirbet Haribat al-Nabi in Masafer Yatta, a collection of Pale­stinian villages that have repeatedly been subjected to settler violence. Senior doctor rejects Israeli military’s claim about Hamas sniper, saying his brother was visually impaired Just a day ago, nearly 90 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes across the territory, most of them in Gaza City. Hamas sniper? The Israeli military claimed on Sunday it had killed a Hamas sniper in a strike the day before, but a senior Gaza doctor who is the man’s brother rejected the claim as “a lie and slander”, saying his sibling was visually impaired. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, director of Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital, had been working in the emergency department on Saturday when his brother and sister-in-law’s bodies were brought in, telling AFP at the time that they were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza City. He rejected the Israeli military’s accusation about Hamas sniper as “a lie, slander and an unacceptable justification for targeting civilians with direct missile strikes”. “My brother is a 57-year-old man who suffers from several illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and he has severe vision impairment — and they claim he was a sniper? This is pure fabrication,” he told AFP , noting his brother’s family had been displaced several times over the past two years. In recent weeks, the Israeli military has launched a heavy air and ground assault on Gaza City, claiming that it was an effort aimed at eliminating Hamas from the territory’s largest urban hub. On Sunday, witnesses said Israeli tanks were advancing towards the west through Tel Al-Hawa, a southeastern suburb. The Israeli military estimates that over 450,000 people have left the city since the start of September. Hamas authorities dispute this, saying under 300,000 left and that nearly a million people remain des­pite ongoing shelling. The offensive has also alarmed many Israelis, as thousands rallied on Saturday night outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem, calling on him to end the war.

Hamas authorities dispute this, saying under 300,000 left and that nearly a million people remain des­pite ongoing shelling. The offensive has also alarmed many Israelis, as thousands rallied on Saturday night outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem, calling on him to end the war.

      "summary_orig": "Britain, Australia and Canada on Sunday recognised a Palestinian state in a seismic shift in decades of Western foreign policy, triggering swift Israeli anger. Portugal was also to recognise Palestinian statehood later on Sunday, as Israel came under huge international pressure over the conflict in Gaza triggered almost two years ago by the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack . “Today, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two-state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognises the State of Palestine,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a message on X. Britain and Canada became the first G7 countries to take the step, with France and other nations expected to follow at the annual UN General Assembly, which opens Monday in New York. “Canada recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote on X. Meanwhile, Australia announced it “formally recognises the independent and sovereign State of Palestine”, according to a post on X by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. “In doing so, Australia recognises the legitimate and long-held aspirations of the people of Palestine to a state of their own,” Albanese said in a statement as his country joined other major Western nations in increasing pressure on Israel to end the conflict in Gaza. “Today’s act of recognition reflects Australia’s longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, which has always been the only path to enduring peace and security for the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples.” It is a watershed moment for Palestinians and their decades-long ambitions for statehood, with the most powerful Western nations having long argued it should only come as part of a negotiated peace deal with Israel. Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said that Britain, Canada and Australia’s recognition of a Palestinian state was a necessary step toward lasting peace in the region. Welcoming the move by the three countries, Abbas said, “It constitutes an important and necessary step toward achieving a just and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy,” according to a statement by his office. Abbas also called for a ceasefire in Gaza. “He emphasised that today’s priorities are achieving a ceasefire, allowing humanitarian aid to enter, securing the release of all hostages and prisoners, ensuring Israel’s complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, enabling the State of Palestine to assume full responsibilities, advancing recovery and reconstruction and halting settlement activity and settler violence, “the statement added. A senior Hamas official hailed the three nations’ recognition of a Palestinian state, describing it as a victory for the rights of Palestinians. “These developments represent a victory for Palestinian rights and the justice of our cause, and send a clear message: no matter how far the occupation goes in its crimes, it will never be able to erase our national rights,” Mahmud Mardawi told AFP . But the move puts those countries at odds with the United States and Israel, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacting angrily and vowing to oppose it at the UN talks. Calls for a Palestinian state “would endanger our existence and serve as [an] absurd reward for terrorism,” Netanyahu said on Sunday. A growing number of longtime allies have shifted positions , as Israel has intensified its Gaza offensive, vowing to eliminate Hamas. The Gaza Strip has suffered vast destruction, a spiralling death toll and a lack of food that has sparked a major humanitarian crisis since the start of the conflict, which has drawn an international outcry. ‘Special burden’ The UK government has come under increasing public pressure to act, with thousands rallying every month on the streets. A poll released by YouGov on Friday showed two-thirds of young Britons aged 18-25 supported Palestinian statehood. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy acknowledged at the UN in July that “Britain bears a special burden of responsibility to support the two-state solution”. Over a century ago, the UK was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the creation of the state of Israel through the 1917 Balfour Declaration. Three-quarters of UN members already recognise Palestinian statehood, with over 140 of the 193 having taken the step. Starmer said in July that his Labour government intended to recognise a Palestinian State unless Israel took “substantive” steps, including reaching a ceasefire in Gaza, getting more aid into the territory and confirming it would not annex the West Bank. Starmer has also repeatedly called on Hamas to release the remaining hostages they captured in the 2023 attack, and is expected to set out new sanctions on the Palestinian group. Lammy told the BBC on Sunday that the Palestinian Authority — the civilian body that governs in areas of the West Bank — had been calling for the move for some time, “and I think a lot of that is wrapped up in hope”. “Will this feed children? No, it won’t, that’s down to humanitarian aid. Will this free hostages? That must be down to a ceasefire.” But he said it was an attempt to “hold out for” a two-state solution. Palestinian foreign minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin told AFP last week: “Recognition is not symbolic. It sends a very clear message to the Israelis on their illusions on continuing their occupation forever,” she said. ‘Worrying evolution’ Hamas’s 2023 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.\nIsrael’s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 65,208 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. Portugal said that it would also formally declare its recognition in New York on Sunday. “By acting now, as the Portuguese government has decided, we’re keeping alive the possibility of having two states,” Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said.",
