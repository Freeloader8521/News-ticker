Choi Won-ho, chair of the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, visited the plant in Gyeongju, 330 kilometers southeast of Seoul, as the historic city is set to host the APEC summit from Oct. 31 to Nov. 1. During the visit, Choi was briefed on the plant's readiness against illegal drones and unidentified vessels. \"As terrorist attacks against nuclear plants can lead to serious radiation accidents, it is important to maintain a strong defense posture,\" Choi said during the visit, urging related organizations, including Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., to maintain a robust security system.

      "summary_orig": "Indian police on Friday detained prominent activist Sonam Wangchuk over violent protests in the Himalayan territory of Ladakh that left at least five people dead, a lawyer said. Demonstrations demanding greater political autonomy for the sparsely populated, high-altitude region bordering China and Pakistan turned deadly on Wednesday when security forces opened fire. New Delhi blamed the unrest on “provocative speeches” by Wangchuk, who had been on a hunger strike demanding either full federal statehood for Ladakh or constitutional protections for its tribal communities, land and fragile environment. Mustafa Haji, a lawyer for the Apex Body Leh — which is spearheading the protests — told AFP that Wangchuk was “picked up” by the police from his village of Uley Tokpo on Friday. “Charges against him are not known yet,” Haji said. An engineer by training, Wangchuk, 59, is best known for pioneering water conservation projects in the Himalayas. He received the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2018 for his environmental work and contributions to reforming local schooling in Ladakh.\nHis life and work are said to have inspired a character played by Bollywood star Aamir Khan in the hugely popular movie Three Idiots . Wangchuk, who is a vocal advocate for Ladakh’s environmental protection and tribal rights, was briefly detained by Delhi Police last year during a protest march. Indian authorities on Thursday cancelled his non-profit organisation’s foreign funding licence. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said today that it is monitoring the situation. “The developments that unfolded in Leh, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, are extremely disturbing,” the FO told Dawn.com . They demonstrate the Indian authorities’ willingness to go to any extent to curb a protest. They are also another manifestation of India’s iron-fisted approach in that occupied territory.“ Modi’s government split Ladakh off from occupied Kashmir in 2019, imposing direct rule on both. New Delhi has yet to fulfil its promise to include Ladakh in the “Sixth Schedule” of India’s constitution, which allows people to make their own laws and policies. India’s army maintains a large presence in Ladakh, which includes disputed border areas with China. Troops from the two countries clashed there in 2020, killing at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers. Additional reporting by Abdullah Momand",

      "summary_orig": "A day after commotion and chaos at the Sindh High Court (SHC) during a hearing of seven petitions challenging the cancellation of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s law degree, a written order of the court was released on Friday, stating that the SHC could “not be held hostage to the whims/ wishes of the advocates as to the manner in which the petitions shall be heard”. The order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , also said that the seven petitions had been dismissed over non-prosecution. It also mentioned that it was for the court to determine how to regulate its proceedings and “it cannot be dictated to by the advocates”. Yesterday, commotion was witnessed at the SHC after a two-judge  constitutional bench, comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, dec­lined to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea\nto become a party in proceedings on the seven petitions. The bench set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions. Lawyers for the petitioners, however, objected to the jurisdiction of the bench and urged the court to decide their objections first. The proceedings drew a large number of lawyers inside and outside the courtroom, with many shouting slogans, clapping and later staging a protest outside the SHC against one of the judges. The petitioners and their lawyers also walked out of the courtroom in protest over their objections not being addressed and the court’s refusal to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea. In its order released today, the SHC bench recalled that when Advocate Ebrahim Saifuddin was called from among the petitioners’ lawyers for arguments on maintainability, he declined to present his arguments. “According to him this court was required to first decide the preliminary objections raised by Salahuddin Ahmed and Faisal Siddiqui.” The order also referred to Advocate Saifuddin with regards to another petition, mentioning that when he was directed to present arguments on the maintainability of the plea, he left the courtroom. Similarly, the bench observed, when Advocate Siddiqui was called to address the court on the question of maintainability, he argued that objections regarding the jurisdiction of the court should be decided first. “When his request was declined by the bench, he left the courtroom stating that he would not proceed any further.” About Advocate Salahuddin Ahmed, the order stated that upon being called for arguments on the issue of maintainability, the lawyer insisted that objections he had raised regarding an earlier order dated September 22 be decided first. Advocate Ahmed, too, refused to address the matter of maintainability and left the court, the order added. Regarding other pleas, the bench noted that the counsels for the petitioners were not present at the time and might have left the court room. On these grounds, the court dismissed the petitions for non-prosecution. The order stated that the counsels were given the opportunity to be heard and address the maintainability of the pleas, which they “deliberately” did not avail. In its order, the court also touched upon the dismissal of Justice Jahangiri’s application to become a party in the proceedings on pleas against the cancellation of his degree. Justice Jahangiri, “with the permission of the court, addressed this court with dignity and patience, however not on the point of any petition or listed application, which, if any, are accordingly dismissed for non-prosecution as he also left the courtroom despite being given an opportunity of being heard on any petition or listed application”. “The petitioners and the intervener (Justice Jahangiri) have wilfully refused to pursue this matter and walked out during the hearing when asked to argue on the maintainability of these petitions. The reasons are obvious, demonstrating a deliberate lack of interest and constituting a gross abuse of the process of the court,” the order read. It further stated that superior courts had the “inherent power” to dismiss constitutional petitions for non-prosecution or default to regulate proceedings under Article 199 of the Constitution — which defines the jurisdiction of a high court — in cases where “a persistent lack of diligence justifies [the] dismissal”. Regarding yesterday’s proceedings, the order further stated that the lawyers “began raising slogans against the judiciary and completely disrupted the decorum of the court. Such conduct is highly unbecoming and not expected from senior members of the legal profession. Prima facie, such conduct amounts to contempt of court”. However, it continued, “by way of indulgence and by showing maximum judicial restraint, we have decided to refrain ourselves from issuing any such notices”. The order also explained that objections raised by Advocates Ahmed and Siddiqui largely pertained to a court order dated September 22. “It was a judicial order that was still in the field,” the court observed, adding that the appropriate course for the lawyers would have been to approach the Supreme Court. Addressing objections regarding the “bias of the bench”, the court stated that “it is well settled now that whether a judge recuses or not is his decision based on his conscience. Neither of us were of the view that any ground for recusal was made out”. Referring back to the “rumpus” during the proceedings, the court directed the registrar to preserve all CCTV recordings and any audio recording of inside and outside the courtroom from September 25. Filing of the petitions The case pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s degree centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations. The seven petitions that have been dismissed were filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the KU syndicate, challenging decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree. In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU’s decision, restraining the university from taking coercive measures. The court had observed that every citizen’s right to fair trial was protected but that no hearing had been provided to Justice Jahangiri before the cancellation of the degree, which appeared obj­ec­­tionable, illegal and without authority. The petitions were fixed for Thursday’s hearing after the Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC) filed an urgent application seeking vacation of the interim stay order.",

      "summary_orig": "An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Friday refused to extend the physical remand of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers, according to the group’s lawyer. Advocate Israr Jatak, a member of BYC’s legal team, told Dawn.com , “Quetta ATC-1 refused to extend the physical remand of five accused, namely Mahrang, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Beberg Baloch and Gulzadi and ordered them to be sent to jail on judicial remand.” In a hearing presided over by Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) produced Mahrang and others in court today after the completion of their 15-day physical remand granted on September 11. Advocate Shoaib Mengal, along with Advocate Jatak, appeared in the court on behalf of the accused. The CTD requested the court for an extension to the physical remand of the accused, but Judge Mubeen refused, asking for the accused to be handed over to jail custody. On September 11, a Quetta ATC judge extended the physical remand of Dr Mahrang and other organisers of the group on the police’s request. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.  Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. She was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order — for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April. After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order , extending their imprisonment by another 15 days. Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.",

      "summary_orig": "• Two-judge bench declines Justice Jahangiri’s plea to join proceedings • Insists court will first hear and decide maintainability of petitions • Petitioners and their lawyers walk out of courtroom, stage protest KARACHI: Heated sce­nes were witnessed at the Sindh High Court on Thursday as a two-judge bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Islamabad High Court Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on seven petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree. The two-judge constitutional bench (CB) comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, however, set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions before it. Justice Jahangiri, accompanied by IHC Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, pleaded for a right of hearing, saying he was the aggrieved party and Karachi University (KU) had not issued him a notice before canceling his degree. Lawyers for the petitioners, however, objected to the jurisdiction of the bench and urged the court to decide their objections first. The proceedings drew a large number of lawyers inside and outside the courtroom, with many chanting slogans, clapping and later staging a protest outside the SHC against one of the judges. The petitioners and their lawyers also walked out of the courtroom in protest over their objections not being addressed and the court’s refusal to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea. Some lawyers later claimed that the bench had dismissed the petitions for non-prosecution, though the written order is expected to be issued today (Friday). The petitions had been filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the KU syndicate, challenging decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that canceled Justice Jahangiri’s degree. In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU decisions, restraining the university from taking coercive measures. The court had observed that every citizen’s right to fair trial was protected but that no hearing had been provided to Justice Jahangiri before the cancellation of the degree, which appeared obj­ec­­tionable, illegal and without authority. The petitions were fixed for Thursday’s hearing after the Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC) filed an urgent application seeking vacation of the interim stay order. Justice Jahangiri also appeared in person, filing an application to intervene in the proceedings. However, Justice Agha remarked that the court would first examine the issue of maintainability. Senior lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, representing a petitioner, questioned how the issue could be decided without hearing the aggrieved person. Justice Jahangiri introduced himself at the rostrum and reiterated that, as the affected party, he had a fundamental right to be heard. Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed pointed out that Justice Memon was also part of a division bench that, in September last year, had suspended KU’s cancellation order. He added that the matter had originally been fixed before another constitutional bench headed by Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed for Sept 30, but was later transferred without explanation to the present bench. He argued that the matter should return to CB-II, as transfers of cases are the domain of a three-judge committee, and questioned how a constitutional bench could override an administrative order. Advocate Siddiqui also argued that the case should be heard by a regular bench rather than a constitutional bench. The petitioners’ lawyers further questioned the SHEC’s urgent application, arguing that the commission itself had admitted it had no role in the matter and should be removed as a respondent. They expressed surprise that the SHEC was now seeking an urgent hearing. Justice Jahangiri told the bench that he had always upheld his oath as a high court judge, testifying that his degree was genuine. “I did not act as a puppet, nor did I make decisions at the behest of any sector commander,” he asserted. The IHC judge, recently barred from exercising judicial powers by an IHC division bench, asked the SHC to grant him the right of hearing. The petitioners and their lawyers, however, left after the bench maintained it would decide maintainability first. Later, speaking to the media, Barrister Ahmed demanded that the bench recuse itself, voicing strong resentment over the transfer of the case, the conduct of the hearing and the court’s refusal to hear the aggrieved judge. In a pointed remark aimed at the ruling PPP, he said: “The Sindh High Court should remain a court of law and not turn into a ‘People’s High Court’.” Published in Dawn, September 26th, 2025",

      "summary_en": "• Two-judge bench declines Justice Jahangiri’s plea to join proceedings • Insists court will first hear and decide maintainability of petitions • Petitioners and their lawyers walk out of courtroom, stage protest KARACHI: Heated sce­nes were witnessed at the Sindh High Court on Thursday as a two-judge bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Islamabad High Court Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on seven petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree. The two-judge constitutional bench (CB) comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, however, set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions before it. Justice Jahangiri, accompanied by IHC Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, pleaded for a right of hearing, saying he was the aggrieved party and Karachi University (KU) had not issued him a notice before canceling his degree. Lawyers for the petitioners, however, objected to the jurisdiction of the bench and urged the court to decide their objections first. The proceedings drew a large number of lawyers inside and outside the courtroom, with many chanting slogans, clapping and later staging a protest outside the SHC against one of the judges. The petitioners and their lawyers also walked out of the courtroom in protest over their objections not being addressed and the court’s refusal to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea. Some lawyers later claimed that the bench had dismissed the petitions for non-prosecution, though the written order is expected to be issued today (Friday). The petitions had been filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the KU syndicate, challenging decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that canceled Justice Jahangiri’s degree. In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU decisions, restraining the university from taking coercive measures. The court had observed that every citizen’s right to fair trial was protected but that no hearing had been provided to Justice Jahangiri before the cancellation of the degree, which appeared obj­ec­­tionable, illegal and without authority. The petitions were fixed for Thursday’s hearing after the Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC) filed an urgent application seeking vacation of the interim stay order. Justice Jahangiri also appeared in person, filing an application to intervene in the proceedings. However, Justice Agha remarked that the court would first examine the issue of maintainability.
