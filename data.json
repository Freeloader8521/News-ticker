      "summary_orig": "THERE is no question about it: with the brutal assassination of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and members of his family in Tehran on Saturday, the US and Israel have chosen the path followed by states gone rogue. They have established a dangerous precedent by killing the head of a sovereign country in cold blood. No consideration of international conventions stopped them and the broader fallout of this egregious crime is a new normal that many other states with similarly reprehensible tendencies may want to adopt. The late Khamenei had led Iran for decades since the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989. Under him, post-Revolution Iran dealt with the aftermath of a devastating war with Iraq; it witnessed intensifying economic sanctions and unrest; and saw no let-up in tensions with the US and Israel. The ayatollah’s killing mirrors earlier ‘decapitation strikes’ carried out by Israel against Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. An interim governing council is already in place, indicating that Iran was ready for the worst. The late Khamenei was the spiritual guide of millions of Muslims worldwide. The protests following his death, including in Pakistan, were only to be expected. Pakistan has deep cultural and religious links with Iran; millions here followed the religious edicts of the ayatollah who was a Shia marja. Sunday’s violence at the US consulate in Karachi was particularly of concern — at least 10 protesters were killed, with two more deaths in Islamabad. Meanwhile, hostilities have continued, with targets hit in Iran, while several Gulf countries have reported retaliatory missile and drone strikes. If the US-Israeli aggression continues, it is difficult to see the situation winding down anytime soon. While Iran’s anger is understandable, there is a need for it to show restraint and refrain from attacking targets in neighbouring countries. The Iranians say they are hitting US interests, but there is always collateral damage in conflict and Iran will find itself further isolated in the region — thus playing right into the hands of the US-Israel combine. There is wisdom, instead, in using diplomatic and political tools and protesting at international forums to put pressure on the guilty. The Global South, including other Muslim states, should stand with Iran, and condemn both this gross violation of its sovereignty and the perpetrators in unambiguous terms. They should remember that they may be next as Israel and the Trump administration will target anyone who dares to disagree with them. Attempts at regime change have always backfired — it is up to the people of a country to decide the kind of government they want. All Washington and Tel Aviv have achieved is more chaos spreading across the Middle East. The two must be held to account for their bloodstained adventurism. Published in Dawn, March 2nd, 2026",

      "summary_en": "THERE is no question about it: with the brutal assassination of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and members of his family in Tehran on Saturday, the US and Israel have chosen the path followed by states gone rogue. They have established a dangerous precedent by killing the head of a sovereign country in cold blood. No consideration of international conventions stopped them and the broader fallout of this egregious crime is a new normal that many other states with similarly reprehensible tendencies may want to adopt. The late Khamenei had led Iran for decades since the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989. Under him, post-Revolution Iran dealt with the aftermath of a devastating war with Iraq; it witnessed intensifying economic sanctions and unrest; and saw no let-up in tensions with the US and Israel. The ayatollah’s killing mirrors earlier ‘decapitation strikes’ carried out by Israel against Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. An interim governing council is already in place, indicating that Iran was ready for the worst. The late Khamenei was the spiritual guide of millions of Muslims worldwide. The protests following his death, including in Pakistan, were only to be expected. Pakistan has deep cultural and religious links with Iran; millions here followed the religious edicts of the ayatollah who was a Shia marja. Sunday’s violence at the US consulate in Karachi was particularly of concern — at least 10 protesters were killed, with two more deaths in Islamabad. Meanwhile, hostilities have continued, with targets hit in Iran, while several Gulf countries have reported retaliatory missile and drone strikes. If the US-Israeli aggression continues, it is difficult to see the situation winding down anytime soon. While Iran’s anger is understandable, there is a need for it to show restraint and refrain from attacking targets in neighbouring countries. The Iranians say they are hitting US interests, but there is always collateral damage in conflict and Iran will find itself further isolated in the region — thus playing right into the hands of the US-Israel combine. There is wisdom, instead, in using diplomatic and political tools and protesting at international forums to put pressure on the guilty. The Global South, including other Muslim states, should stand with Iran, and condemn both this gross violation of its sovereignty and the perpetrators in unambiguous terms. They should remember that they may be next as Israel and the Trump administration will target anyone who dares to disagree with them. Attempts at regime change have always backfired — it is up to the people of a country to decide the kind of government they want. All Washington and Tel Aviv have achieved is more chaos spreading across the Middle East. The two must be held to account for their bloodstained adventurism. Published in Dawn, March 2nd, 2026",

President Asif Ali Zardari expressed “profound sorrow over the martyrdom of Khamenei and other members of Iran’s senior leadership killed alongside him”, and conveyed heartfelt condolences to the government and people of Iran. He said Pakistan “stood with the Iranian nation in this moment of grief and shared in their loss”. He prayed for the departed souls and patience and fortitude for Iranians during this difficult time. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said “the government and people of Pakistan stood with the people of Iran in their hour of grief and extended sincere condolences on the martyrdom of Khamenei”. He expressed concern over violations of international law, stating that it was a long-established convention that heads of state and government should not be targeted. National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also expressed “profound grief and sorrow over the martyrdom of Khamenei, along with his son, Sayyid Mojtaba Khamenei, his daughter-in-law Ms Zahra Haddad-Adel, his son-in-law and his granddaughter”. Meanwhile, the joint session of parliament, originally scheduled for 10:30am on Monday (today), will now be held at 3pm, according to a statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat. President Zardari will address the joint session. Strict security arrangements have been put in place for the session, as entry of any unauthorised person into Parliament House will be prohibited. Guests will not be allowed to attend the session. Only journalists holding new working press gallery cards of the National Assembly and Senate for 2026 will be permitted to cover the proceedings. Only one cameraman from each channel will be allowed. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also expressed sorrow over the assassination, saying in a televised message that “every citizen of Pakistan felt grief over the martyrdom”. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the assassination of Iran’s supreme leader “a shock for the whole world” and said he was praying for patience for those mourning the loss. He warned that rising tensions between Iran, Israel and Gulf countries were dangerous for regional stability and global peace. In separate statements, PTI and the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) expressed profound sorrow and unequivocal condemnation of the assassination. They said the killing undermined international law, destabilised the region and pushed the world further towards chaos and conflict. The TTAP announced three days of mourning for the slain leader and urged the government to declare official mourning. The alliance also expressed deep sorrow over the loss of hundreds of innocent lives due to US and Israeli aggression on Iran, including civilian casualties in an attack on a girls’ school.

      "summary_orig": "• PICSS says first two months of 2026 see almost half of all 2025 suicide attacks • Balochistan records ‘visible decline’ in attacks ISLAMABAD: Combat-related fatalities in Pakistan surged by 30 per cent in February 2026, driven by a sharp increase in suicide attacks across the country, according to monthly statistics released by an Islamabad-based think tank. The report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) documented 470 deaths and 333 injuries during the month. The dead included 96 civilians, 80 security forces personnel and 294 militants. The number of injured comprised 259 civilians, 50 security forces personnel and 24 militants. The figures represent a 74pc surge in the deaths of security forces personnel, a 32pc rise in civilian deaths and a 21pc increase in militant deaths compared to the previous month. Violence escalated significantly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and its merged districts (erstwhile Fata). The region saw 53 security forces personnel and six civilians killed, with an additional 35 security personnel and 48 civilians injured. The province endured three suicide bombings in February, which killed 17 people, including 14 security forces personnel, and injured 20 civilians. According to the report, the surge in attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa led to Pakistan’s cross-border air strikes and subsequent military clashes with Afghanistan. The capital also faced a major attack, with one suicide bombing in the suburbs of the Islamabad Capital Territory killing at least 34 people and injuring 165. Another suicide bombing in the Bhakkar district of Punjab province killed two police personnel and injured four others. The eight suicide attacks recorded in the first two months of the year are nearly half the total for all of 2025, when 17 such incidents occurred, a statistic the report called “a dangerous trend of rising suicide bombings.” Security forces also arrested a would-be suicide bomber during the month. In Balochistan, however, the PICSS data showed a visible decline in militant attacks following the launch of a retaliatory operation, “Raddul Fitna-1,” by security forces early in the month. Security operations in the province killed 176 militants. Overall, PICSS data for the first two months of 2026 shows 831 combat-related deaths, including 536 militants, 169 civilians and 126 security forces personnel. Published in Dawn, March 2nd, 2026",

While Iranian officials claimed the attack on the Shajareh Tayyebeh girls’ elementary school in the Minab city killed more than 100 people, neither the United States nor Israel confirmed that any such attack has taken place. Israel’s military on Sunday said it was “not aware” of any US or Israeli strike on any school in Iran. When asked about the strikes on school, Israel’s military spokesman Lt-Col Nadav Shoshani said, “At this point not aware of an Israeli or an American strike there… We’re operating in an extremely accurate manner.” However, The New York Times later quoted a CENTCOM spokesperson as saying: “We are aware of reports concerning civilian harm resulting from ongoing military operations. We take these reports seriously and are looking into them.” “The protection of civilians is of utmost importance, and we will continue to take all precautions available to minimise the risk of unintended harm.” Video and photographs from the aftermath of the strike, which have been verified as authentic and geo-located to the site, show hundreds of people gathered around the partially collapsed, smoking building, with rubble strewn across the street and men digging through it for victims. Screams can be heard in the background. In some of the images, schoolbags and textbooks are being pulled from the debris. Norway-based rights group Hengaw said the Shajare Tayyebeh school was holding its morning session at the time of the incident, which reportedly had about 170 students present. The Nobel peace prize laureate and girls’ education advocate, Malala Yousafzai, said in a statement, “They were girls who went to school to learn, with hopes and dreams for their future. Today, their lives were brutally cut short. “Justice and accountability must follow.

The Gulf states, which house American assets, came under attack after Iran retaliated to joint US-Israeli strikes, which killed its top leadership, including the supreme leader, and scores of citizens. According to the PM Office, the PM held a telephone conversation with Jordan’s King Abdullah II to discuss the evolving regional situation. The two leaders exchanged views on the serious regional developments following the recent escalation from the Israeli attack on Iran, which was followed by attacks on Jor­dan and other regional countries. The prime minister expre­ssed Pakistan’s deep concern over the situation and emphasised the urgent need for restraint, de-escalation, and dialogue to preserve regional peace and stability. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the Kingdom of Jordan as well as other brotherly countries during this challenging time and reiterated Pakistan’s readiness to support all efforts aimed at restoring stability. Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional developments. In a statement on X, the PM said he also spoke to Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Kha­lifa and conveyed Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the brotherly people of Bahrain during the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. “While praying for the safety and security of our brothers and sisters in Bah­rain, I emphasised restraint, respect for international law, and the urgent need for dialogue and diplomacy to restore peace and stability in the region,” he said. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke to Omani and Iraqi counterparts to discuss the regional situation. In a call with Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, the two sides expre­ssed concerns over the ongoing escalation in the region and underscored the urgent need for restraint, dialogue, and de-escalation to preserve peace and stability. Both agr­eed to remain in close contact over the evolving situation. FM Dar also talked to Iraq’s Fuad Hussein and discussed the rapidly evolving regional situation and stressed the need for sustained efforts to contain tensions, promote de-escalation, and advance peace and stability in the region. Gulf in turmoil As retaliatory strikes widened on Sunday they reverberated across Gulf Arab states, with loud blasts heard in Dubai and the Qatari capital Doha and with Oman being hit for the first time. In the UAE, the defence ministry said three people had died and 58 were wounded since Iran’s strikes began the previous day. UAE also confirmed the death of a Pakistani national in Iranian missile strikes targeting the UAE. The victim was killed after being struck by missile debris in Abu Dhabi. Emirati authorities have extended their deepest condolences and sympathy to the bereaved family and relatives of the deceased. As of now, the identity of the victim has not been made public. In Kuwait, one person was killed and 32 wounded since the start of Iran’s retaliation campaign, the health ministry said. Debris from an intercepted drone damaged an Abu Dhabi complex housing the Israeli embassy and several other international missions, causing minor injuries to a woman and her child, Abu Dhabi’s state media office said on Sunday. In Dubai, two people were injured after shrapnel from drones fell over two houses when they were intercepted, a Dubai state media office statement said. Dubai’s international airport, its landmark Burj Al Arab hotel and man-made Palm Jumeirah Island all suffered damage overnight, as did Abu Dhabi’s international airport. Thick plumes of smoke continued to rise from the Jebel Ali port area, where one of the berths caught fire on Sunday because of debris from an intercepted missile. State-owned logistics firm DP World has temporarily paused operations at Jebel Ali Port, according to a notice seen by Reuters. Large plumes of smoke were also seen rising at Abu Dhabi’s Zayed Port area, according to a Reuters witness. In neighbouring Oman, which was spared retaliation on Saturday, Duqm commercial port was targeted by two drones, wounding one worker, the state news agency said. Qatar’s interior ministry said on Sunday that it was responding to a limited fire in an industrial zone after debris fell from an intercepted missile. Gulf stock markets fell sharply when trading opened on Sunday, with Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index dropping more than 4pc at the open and closing down 2.2pc. Meanwhile, stock exchanges in Dubai and Abu Dhabi will be closed “until further notice” due to the ongoing conflict in the region, the UAE’s financial regulatory authority announced on Sunday. “The Authority confirms that it will continue to closely monitor developments in the region and assess the situation on an ongoing basis, taking any further measures as necessary,” it said. Kuwait also suspended trading until further notice. Saudi intercepts missile attacks Saudi Arabia on Sunday intercepted Iranian missiles targeting Riyadh’s international airport and the Prince Sultan Airbase, which houses US military personnel, a Gulf source briefed on the matter told AFP. An eyewitness near the airport said they “saw and heard the air defence intercept the missile in the sky”. Residents and AFP correspondents earlier reported hearing explosions in eastern Riyadh. Saudi Arabia houses US bases and personnel, though the bigger such facilities are located in Bahrain and Qatar. Meanwhile, the US officials warned citizens in Bahrain to avoid hotels in the capital Manama, while staff at the US embassy to Jordan were told to avoid the embassy compound, citing risks of attacks. AFP also reported blasts in Bahrain’s capital. Published in Dawn, March 2nd, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Iran confirms supreme leader’s death, declares 40-day mourning • Hospital targeted as Israeli missiles pound Tehran, other areas for second day; retaliatory strikes kill 9 in Israel • US claims sinking 9 Iranian warships, B-2 bombers target missile sites; 3 American troops killed • Shipping paralysed as IRGC closes Strait of Hormuz • Trump says war on Iran ‘could last four weeks’; Tehran still open to talks, insists on ‘no limit’ to self-defence JERUSALEM: The war between Iran and the US-Israel alliance escalated sharply on Sunday after Iran confirmed the assassination of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khame­nei in a joint US-Israeli airstrike, a move that has plunged the Middle East into its most perilous crisis in decades. As Iranian government declared 40 days of national mourning and seven public holidays following the death of the man who wielded absolute power since 1989, Iranian missiles killed at least nine people in a central Israeli town, while the US and Israel continued bombardment of Tehran, with Trump claiming that the war on Iran could last four weeks. The tit-for-tat attacks have sent shockwaves through global markets, disrupting vital shipping lanes in the Gulf and threatening to draw regional and global powers deeper into a direct military confrontation. Senior leadership decimated The Israeli military announced that 40 senior Iranian officials were killed in the coordinated strikes, including six names confirmed by Iranian state media. Among the dead were Revolutionary Guards commander Gen. Mohammad Pakpour, armed forces chief of staff Abdolrahim Mousavi, Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh, Supreme Leader military office head Mohammad Shirazi, police intelligence chief Gholamreza Rezaian and top security adviser Ali Shamkhani. Khamenei’s daughter, gran­ddaughter, son-in-law and daughter-in-law were also killed in the strikes, Iranian media reported. State media said Khamenei was working in his office when Saturday’s attack struck. US President Donald Trump said on his Truth Social network that intelligence and tracking systems had monitored Khamenei’s movements, adding that “there was not a thing he, or the other leaders that have been killed along with him, could do.” Escalation and retaliation The escalation has been swift and deadly on multiple fronts. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said Israeli aircraft had conducted strikes to open the “path to Tehran” and that the majority of aerial defence systems in western and central Iran had been dismantled. “Ground forces are not being considered and we have the capabilities and the targets to keep going on for as long as necessary,” Shoshani said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to intensify strikes, saying Israel was not yet at “full strength”. Iran responded with volleys of missiles targeting Israel and at least seven other countries hosting US bases. A missile strike on the Israeli city of Beit Shemesh killed at least nine people and wounded 28, with 11 still missing, according to the Magen David Adom emergency service and Israeli police. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards also claimed to have attacked the US aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln with four ballistic missiles, state media reported, though the Pentagon denied this. The IRGC also said three US and British oil tankers were hit by missiles in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz and were on fire, though there was no independent confirmation. Iran’s leaders promised a fierce counter-response. Acting President Masoud Pezeshkian called Khamenei’s assassination a “declaration of war against Muslims.” Senior security chief Ali Larijani promised to hit the US and Israel with a force “never seen before.” Separately, the US military reported its own naval successes. US Central Command posted on X that an Iranian Jamaran-class corvette was struck by US forces at the start of its operations and was sinking in the Gulf of Oman. US President Donald Trump said he envisages a four-week military operation against Iran. “It’s always been a four-week process. We figured it will be four weeks or so,” he told The Daily Mail . “As strong as it is, it’s a big country, it’ll take four weeks — or less,” Trump said. About the American soldiers dying during war on Iran, he said it was expected in a war that was nevertheless a “great deal”. “We have three, but we expect casualties, but in the end it’s going to be a great deal for the world,” Trump told NBC after the Pentagon announced three US service members had been killed during military strikes on Iran. Earlier, in a series of posts on his Truth Social network, he claimed credit for the widening assault. “I have just been informed that we have destroyed and sunk 9 Iranian Naval Ships, some of them relatively large and important,” Trump wrote. “We are going after the rest.” He added that the US had “largely destroyed” Iran’s naval headquarters. In separate interviews, he said 48 Iranian leaders had been killed. The central command also said B-2 stealth bombers armed with 2,000-pound bombs struck Iran’s “hardened ballistic missile facilities” on Saturday night. Disruption and diplomacy The conflict has caused immediate chaos in the Gulf, a critical artery for global trade. Shipping data showed at least 150 tankers, including crude oil and liquefied natural gas vessels, had dropped anchor in open waters to avoid the Strait of Hormuz, according to a Reuters analysis of MarineTraffic data. Major shipping lines MSC and Maersk suspended navigation in the region. Iranian state television reported that an oil tanker was struck and sinking after attempting to ‘illegally’ pass through the strait, which the Revolutionary Guards declared closed. Even as the war intensified, diplomatic channels remained active. A statement from Oman’s foreign ministry claimed Araghchi told his Omani counterpart, Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, that Tehran was open to “serious efforts at de-escalation”. The foreign minister of Oman, who mediated recent US-Iran talks, also said the “door to diplomacy remains open” “I want to be very clear — the door to diplomacy remains open,” Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said on X. “Talks in Geneva made genuine progress towards an unprecedented agreement between Iran and the United States and although the hope was to avoid war, war should not mean that the hope of peace is extinguished. I still believe in the power of diplomacy to resolve this conflict.” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi rejected any suggestion that Iran’s right to self-defence was limited. “What the United States is doing is an act of aggression. What we are doing is the act of self-defence,” he told ABC News. The United Nations’ nuclear agency announced an extraordinary meeting on Iran for Monday, convened at Russia’s request. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called Khamenei’s death “a defining moment in Iran’s history.” She wrote on X: “What comes next is uncertain. But there is now an open path to a different Iran, one that its people may have greater freedom to shape.” Experts cautioned that while the leadership losses dealt Iran a devastating blow, they would not necessarily spell the end of the country’s entrenched clerical rule or the Revolutionary Guards’ grip on power. War goes on Meanwhile, in western Iran, more than 40 security personnel — mostly border guards — were killed in a strike on a border regiment headquarters in Mehran near Iraq, the Mehr news agency reported. “Tehran’s Gandhi hospital was attacked by Zionist-American air strikes,” ISNA reported, while the Fars and Mizan agencies published a video, presented as being from inside the facility, showing debris on the floor among wheelchairs. The Israeli military has announced plans to mobilise nearly 100,000 reservists in its campaign against its longstanding adversary, Iran. “The [army] is preparing to call up around 100,000 reservists and is raising its level of readiness on the various fronts as part of Operation ‘Roaring Lion’,” it said in a statement, using the name Israel has given to its assault — launched in coordination with the US — against Iran.

As Iranian government declared 40 days of national mourning and seven public holidays following the death of the man who wielded absolute power since 1989, Iranian missiles killed at least nine people in a central Israeli town, while the US and Israel continued bombardment of Tehran, with Trump claiming that the war on Iran could last four weeks. The tit-for-tat attacks have sent shockwaves through global markets, disrupting vital shipping lanes in the Gulf and threatening to draw regional and global powers deeper into a direct military confrontation. Senior leadership decimated The Israeli military announced that 40 senior Iranian officials were killed in the coordinated strikes, including six names confirmed by Iranian state media. Among the dead were Revolutionary Guards commander Gen. Mohammad Pakpour, armed forces chief of staff Abdolrahim Mousavi, Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh, Supreme Leader military office head Mohammad Shirazi, police intelligence chief Gholamreza Rezaian and top security adviser Ali Shamkhani. Khamenei’s daughter, gran­ddaughter, son-in-law and daughter-in-law were also killed in the strikes, Iranian media reported. State media said Khamenei was working in his office when Saturday’s attack struck. US President Donald Trump said on his Truth Social network that intelligence and tracking systems had monitored Khamenei’s movements, adding that “there was not a thing he, or the other leaders that have been killed along with him, could do.” Escalation and retaliation The escalation has been swift and deadly on multiple fronts. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said Israeli aircraft had conducted strikes to open the “path to Tehran” and that the majority of aerial defence systems in western and central Iran had been dismantled. “Ground forces are not being considered and we have the capabilities and the targets to keep going on for as long as necessary,” Shoshani said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to intensify strikes, saying Israel was not yet at “full strength”. Iran responded with volleys of missiles targeting Israel and at least seven other countries hosting US bases. A missile strike on the Israeli city of Beit Shemesh killed at least nine people and wounded 28, with 11 still missing, according to the Magen David Adom emergency service and Israeli police. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards also claimed to have attacked the US aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln with four ballistic missiles, state media reported, though the Pentagon denied this. The IRGC also said three US and British oil tankers were hit by missiles in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz and were on fire, though there was no independent confirmation. Iran’s leaders promised a fierce counter-response. Acting President Masoud Pezeshkian called Khamenei’s assassination a “declaration of war against Muslims.” Senior security chief Ali Larijani promised to hit the US and Israel with a force “never seen before.” Separately, the US military reported its own naval successes. US Central Command posted on X that an Iranian Jamaran-class corvette was struck by US forces at the start of its operations and was sinking in the Gulf of Oman. US President Donald Trump said he envisages a four-week military operation against Iran. “It’s always been a four-week process. We figured it will be four weeks or so,” he told The Daily Mail . “As strong as it is, it’s a big country, it’ll take four weeks — or less,” Trump said. About the American soldiers dying during war on Iran, he said it was expected in a war that was nevertheless a “great deal”. “We have three, but we expect casualties, but in the end it’s going to be a great deal for the world,” Trump told NBC after the Pentagon announced three US service members had been killed during military strikes on Iran. Earlier, in a series of posts on his Truth Social network, he claimed credit for the widening assault. “I have just been informed that we have destroyed and sunk 9 Iranian Naval Ships, some of them relatively large and important,” Trump wrote. “We are going after the rest.” He added that the US had “largely destroyed” Iran’s naval headquarters. In separate interviews, he said 48 Iranian leaders had been killed. The central command also said B-2 stealth bombers armed with 2,000-pound bombs struck Iran’s “hardened ballistic missile facilities” on Saturday night. Disruption and diplomacy The conflict has caused immediate chaos in the Gulf, a critical artery for global trade. Shipping data showed at least 150 tankers, including crude oil and liquefied natural gas vessels, had dropped anchor in open waters to avoid the Strait of Hormuz, according to a Reuters analysis of MarineTraffic data. Major shipping lines MSC and Maersk suspended navigation in the region. Iranian state television reported that an oil tanker was struck and sinking after attempting to ‘illegally’ pass through the strait, which the Revolutionary Guards declared closed. Even as the war intensified, diplomatic channels remained active. A statement from Oman’s foreign ministry claimed Araghchi told his Omani counterpart, Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, that Tehran was open to “serious efforts at de-escalation”. The foreign minister of Oman, who mediated recent US-Iran talks, also said the “door to diplomacy remains open” “I want to be very clear — the door to diplomacy remains open,” Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said on X. “Talks in Geneva made genuine progress towards an unprecedented agreement between Iran and the United States and although the hope was to avoid war, war should not mean that the hope of peace is extinguished. I still believe in the power of diplomacy to resolve this conflict.” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi rejected any suggestion that Iran’s right to self-defence was limited. “What the United States is doing is an act of aggression. What we are doing is the act of self-defence,” he told ABC News. The United Nations’ nuclear agency announced an extraordinary meeting on Iran for Monday, convened at Russia’s request. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called Khamenei’s death “a defining moment in Iran’s history.” She wrote on X: “What comes next is uncertain. But there is now an open path to a different Iran, one that its people may have greater freedom to shape.” Experts cautioned that while the leadership losses dealt Iran a devastating blow, they would not necessarily spell the end of the country’s entrenched clerical rule or the Revolutionary Guards’ grip on power. War goes on Meanwhile, in western Iran, more than 40 security personnel — mostly border guards — were killed in a strike on a border regiment headquarters in Mehran near Iraq, the Mehr news agency reported. “Tehran’s Gandhi hospital was attacked by Zionist-American air strikes,” ISNA reported, while the Fars and Mizan agencies published a video, presented as being from inside the facility, showing debris on the floor among wheelchairs. The Israeli military has announced plans to mobilise nearly 100,000 reservists in its campaign against its longstanding adversary, Iran. “The [army] is preparing to call up around 100,000 reservists and is raising its level of readiness on the various fronts as part of Operation ‘Roaring Lion’,” it said in a statement, using the name Israel has given to its assault — launched in coordination with the US — against Iran.

      "title_orig": "With the Gulf lighting up, oil emerges as Pakistan’s biggest economic risk",
      "summary_orig": "If the war between Iran and the United States escalates, the single biggest economic threat to Pakistan will come from oil. Brent crude settled around $72.5 a barrel on Friday, already up nearly 19 per cent year-to-date, according to CNBC . Rumours are swirling of oil touching $100. For Pakistan, even modest increases carry heavy consequences. For every $10 rise in oil prices, the current account deficit increases by roughly $1.5–$2 billion, explains former chief executive officer of the Pakistan Business Council, Ehsan Malik. “If prices were to climb to $100, the deficit could expand by $5–$7bn on an annualised basis, potentially undoing recent gains that allowed FY25 to post a $2bn current account surplus.” Markets are extremely erratic right now, says energy analyst Syed Rashid Husain. Iran produces roughly 3–3.5 million barrels of oil per day, exporting about 1–1.5m barrels. While this is far lower than the output of the United States (about 13.5m barrels per day) or Saudi Arabia (around 9–10m), even a loss of one million barrels per day can tighten global balances and push prices higher. Compounding the risk is the strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway through which roughly 20pc of global oil consumption passes. For years, Iran has threatened to block this passage during periods of heightened conflict. According to Reuters , oil and gas shipments through the area have already faced disruption, with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards reportedly warning ships that passage is not permitted, although Tehran has not formally confirmed such an order. Analysts say scenarios range from limited disruptions to Iranian exports to a full blockade of Hormuz. The ripple effects are already visible. Late Saturday night, petrol prices at pumps in Canada had risen by roughly 10–15 cents per litre, Husain said, speaking from experience. Russia-Ukraine crisis flashbacks For Pakistan, the situation evokes the economic horror of the Russia–Ukraine war. During 2022-23, Brent crude hovered around $100–125 per barrel, leading Pakistan to float perilously close to sovereign default. The chain reaction was brutal. The war pushed up oil prices, widening Pakistan’s import bill and putting pressure on the exchange rate. The rupee slid from around Rs170 per dollar in early 2022 to a peak of Rs305 on Aug 28, 2023, before stabilising in the Rs270–280 range toward the end of that year. There was, however, an important cushion at the time. Despite sanctions, Russia still exported oil and gas by hook or by crook to many countries; Pakistan also tried to get oil from Russia, and India became a major importer of Russian oil. Since then, however, the US has pressured India to stop importing and tightened the screws on all of Russia’s supplies. If Iranian barrels are disrupted simultaneously, two significant discounted supply streams could disappear, pushing crude firmly into triple-digit territory if tensions do not de-escalate. There are already signs of strain. Saudi Aramco has reportedly not allocated a March cargo to a Pakistani refinery amid volatility in global oil markets. Uncertainty in global crude trade has made it difficult to secure shipments for March, and this was before the news of the assassination of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Marine insurers are also considering repricing or cancelling policies in parts of the Middle East, according to reports. A chain reaction and the IMF Oil prices have a multiplier effect as they impact secondary markets. For example, edible oil prices — of which Pakistan imported roughly $3.7bn in FY25 — are indirectly linked to crude oil markets, Malik explains. Much of the economic breathing space that enabled recent stabilisation came from relatively stable global commodity prices. “For every $10 increase in oil prices, Pakistan’s inflation typically rises by about 0.5–0.6 percentage points,” says Waqas Ghani, Head of Equity Research at JS Global Capital. If oil prices surge, inflation would rise again, making further policy rate cuts unlikely. Industry would face higher input costs, weakening exports. At the same time, fiscal space would shrink, limiting the government’s ability to lower taxes or provide relief, adds Malik. “The veneer of stability has been damaged,” says Ammar H Khan, Professor of Practice at the Institute of Business Administration Karachi. Capital outflows could increase, or new investment could slow, hurting job creation and — at the margins — reducing demand for migrant labour abroad. These repercussions may also extend to remittances, which are vital for keeping the current account afloat. Even if the conflict lasts only a few days and does not turn into a prolonged war, heightened regional risk can weigh on financial flows, he adds. All this is taking place in the background of talks with the visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF) team. Industry sources say there had been positive talks with the Fund regarding possible tax relief in the upcoming budget. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also emphasised the need to reduce direct tax rates. However, given the current global uncertainty, meaningful relief now appears unlikely. Pakistan was already receiving very little foreign direct investment, notes M Abdul Aleem, secretary general of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “What little was in the pipelines, like investments in Reko Diq, will slow down for now,” he says. “Equally concerning is the law-and-order environment, particularly when it involves the safety of foreign nationals.” Referring to the recent incident at the US consulate in Karachi, he said stronger preventive security measures should have been in place. PSX and gold For equity markets, the implications extend beyond macroeconomic concerns. Pakistan’s manufacturing sectors rely heavily on imported raw materials and energy inputs. “Take the cement sector as an example,” says Waqas Ghani, Head of Equity Research. “It relies on coal and petcoke as key inputs. If oil prices rise, the prices of these fuels also increase, raising production costs.” Because many industries depend on imported inputs across the value chain, higher commodity prices quickly squeeze profit margins. “When input costs rise, margins come under pressure, and corporate earnings can deteriorate,” he said. “Apart from oil and exploration companies, most sectors would face headwinds.” Beyond fundamentals, market sentiment itself has turned cautious. “Investors are already becoming more risk-averse,” Ghani noted. “When uncertainty rises, equities are usually the first asset class where investors reduce exposure.” Several technical factors are also amplifying selling pressure. Foreign investors have been net sellers in recent weeks, while mutual funds are facing redemption pressures from retail investors. When investors withdraw money, fund managers are forced to liquidate holdings, increasing supply in the market. “At the same time, settlement dynamics can intensify the pressure,” Ghani added. The Pakistan Stock Exchange currently operates on a T+1 settlement cycle, while the banking system operates on a T+2 cycle, which can create short-term liquidity stress for brokers and investors during periods of volatility. “All these factors combined can create a downward spiral where selling feeds on itself,” he said. For now, the key trigger that could stabilise markets would be a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions. “If the conflict subsides and oil prices stabilise, sentiment could recover fairly quickly,” Ghani said. “But until then, markets are likely to remain under stress.” Much, however, will depend on how global markets react when trading begins. “It all depends on the evolving situation and any ceasefire news,” said Muhammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities. “A lot will hinge on how US futures open, along with the trend in oil prices and Asian markets.” Pakistani stocks are likely to fall initially, he added, though the extent will depend on developments overnight. Some markets that opened on Sunday were already down close to two per cent. Ali Nawaz, CEO of Chase Securities, expects early weakness in trading when it begins. “The market is likely to see a decline in the opening hours, driven by investor concerns over the US-Iran conflict, the broader Middle East situation and rising oil prices,” he said. However, he expects the pressure to ease as the week progresses. “A recovery could follow as the situation moves towards resolution and institutional investors step in for value buying,” Nawaz said. Given the market’s recent corrections, further declines may create attractive valuations for investors, echoing the age-old advice to buy the dip. As the Pakistan Stock Market bleeds, investors may turn to gold, which is expected to surge. On Saturday, local gold prices jumped by Rs10,000 per tola in Pakistan. Qasim Shikarpuri, president of the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association, expects international prices to rise by $200–$300 per ounce once markets reopen. “If that happens, local gold prices could surge by as much as Rs60,000 per tola,” he said. Bazaars and shopping Retailers say geopolitical tensions are already affecting shopping activity during Ramazan, a critical sales period for bazaars and malls. “We have seen this before,” said Asfandyar Farrukh, Chairman of the Chainstore Association of Pakistan. “Even a few days ago, when tensions flared between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and warnings were issued, there was an immediate impact.” The effect is most visible over the weekend, when shopping activity typically peaks. “Weekend footfall is usually the highest, especially on Sundays. But in such situations, visitor numbers can fall by half,” he said. If the tensions subside quickly, retailers expect the slowdown to be temporary. “If things improve within two or three days, the lost sales can be made up,” he said. “But if uncertainty continues through Ramazan, then the impact could become more significant.” According to Farrukh, shoppers tend to adjust their behaviour during prolonged uncertainty rather than abandoning shopping altogether. “People still need to shop for Eid. What they usually do is go out earlier in the day or spread their visits over time,” he said. “But overall, there could still be a 20–25pc decline in footfall during periods of heightened tension.” Retail activity during Ramazan typically peaks in the final ten days before Eid, though momentum had only recently begun building in markets. “The last ten days are usually when Ramazan shopping really accelerates,” he said. “But we are already beginning to see some slowdown.” Farrukh does not expect security concerns to push shoppers significantly toward online retail. “Eid shopping is an experience. People want to see the fabric, the material, the footwear, hence they prefer to visit markets,” he said. “Online shopping has been growing, but it does not replace the Eid shopping experience.” Instead, the larger risk for retail spending comes from rising fuel prices. “If oil prices surge, that will have the biggest impact on consumer spending,” he said. “Fuel prices have already increased, and further hikes are expected. If this situation continues for several days, it would directly affect household spending.” A path for de-escalation? Ultimately, much will depend on whether the conflict escalates or finds an off-ramp. “Domestic politics in the United States may ultimately shape how far this confrontation goes. The US faces congressional midterm elections in November 2026,” notes Husain. With the American economy already grappling with tariff shocks and a cooling job market amid massive AI investments, the cost of living remains a top voter concern. Surveys cited by The Wall Street Journal show that inflation and household costs remain the most persistent economic complaints. If gas prices surge sharply, it could damage Republicans at the ballot box, potentially costing them control of the House or the Senate and undermining the administration’s ability to pass major legislation. That may explain why Donald Trump has suggested there are several “off-ramps” from the military operation, in recent comments to media outlet Axios . Trump is also facing pressure from how own Make America Great Again (MAGA) political base to avoid a prolonged Middle East intervention. Equally important is Iran’s reaction. “Iranians have historically been pragmatic in such circumstances,” Husain said. After the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020 and the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in 2024, Tehran’s responses were calibrated. “There will almost certainly be face-saving measures,” Husain said. “But if past behaviour is any guide, those may eventually be accompanied by efforts to de-escalate as well.” Pakistan has paid a heavy price on its path to stabilisation. Its fragile economic recovery relies heavily on stable oil prices. The difference between escalation and restraint could mean the difference between continued stabilisation and another severe macroeconomic shock.

If this situation continues for several days, it would directly affect household spending.” A path for de-escalation? Ultimately, much will depend on whether the conflict escalates or finds an off-ramp. “Domestic politics in the United States may ultimately shape how far this confrontation goes. The US faces congressional midterm elections in November 2026,” notes Husain. With the American economy already grappling with tariff shocks and a cooling job market amid massive AI investments, the cost of living remains a top voter concern. Surveys cited by The Wall Street Journal show that inflation and household costs remain the most persistent economic complaints. If gas prices surge sharply, it could damage Republicans at the ballot box, potentially costing them control of the House or the Senate and undermining the administration’s ability to pass major legislation. That may explain why Donald Trump has suggested there are several “off-ramps” from the military operation, in recent comments to media outlet Axios . Trump is also facing pressure from how own Make America Great Again (MAGA) political base to avoid a prolonged Middle East intervention. Equally important is Iran’s reaction. “Iranians have historically been pragmatic in such circumstances,” Husain said. After the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020 and the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in 2024, Tehran’s responses were calibrated. “There will almost certainly be face-saving measures,” Husain said. “But if past behaviour is any guide, those may eventually be accompanied by efforts to de-escalate as well.” Pakistan has paid a heavy price on its path to stabilisation. Its fragile economic recovery relies heavily on stable oil prices. The difference between escalation and restraint could mean the difference between continued stabilisation and another severe macroeconomic shock.

      "title": "With the Gulf lighting up, oil emerges as Pakistan’s biggest economic risk",
      "summary": "If the war between Iran and the United States escalates, the single biggest economic threat to Pakistan will come from oil. Brent crude settled around $72.5 a barrel on Friday, already up nearly 19 per cent year-to-date, according to CNBC . Rumours are swirling of oil touching $100. For Pakistan, even modest increases carry heavy consequences. For every $10 rise in oil prices, the current account deficit increases by roughly $1.5–$2 billion, explains former chief executive officer of the Pakistan Business Council, Ehsan Malik. “If prices were to climb to $100, the deficit could expand by $5–$7bn on an annualised basis, potentially undoing recent gains that allowed FY25 to post a $2bn current account surplus.” Markets are extremely erratic right now, says energy analyst Syed Rashid Husain. Iran produces roughly 3–3.5 million barrels of oil per day, exporting about 1–1.5m barrels. While this is far lower than the output of the United States (about 13.5m barrels per day) or Saudi Arabia (around 9–10m), even a loss of one million barrels per day can tighten global balances and push prices higher. Compounding the risk is the strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway through which roughly 20pc of global oil consumption passes. For years, Iran has threatened to block this passage during periods of heightened conflict. According to Reuters , oil and gas shipments through the area have already faced disruption, with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards reportedly warning ships that passage is not permitted, although Tehran has not formally confirmed such an order. Analysts say scenarios range from limited disruptions to Iranian exports to a full blockade of Hormuz. The ripple effects are already visible. Late Saturday night, petrol prices at pumps in Canada had risen by roughly 10–15 cents per litre, Husain said, speaking from experience. Russia-Ukraine crisis flashbacks For Pakistan, the situation evokes the economic horror of the Russia–Ukraine war. During 2022-23, Brent crude hovered around $100–125 per barrel, leading Pakistan to float perilously close to sovereign default. The chain reaction was brutal. The war pushed up oil prices, widening Pakistan’s import bill and putting pressure on the exchange rate. The rupee slid from around Rs170 per dollar in early 2022 to a peak of Rs305 on Aug 28, 2023, before stabilising in the Rs270–280 range toward the end of that year. There was, however, an important cushion at the time. Despite sanctions, Russia still exported oil and gas by hook or by crook to many countries; Pakistan also tried to get oil from Russia, and India became a major importer of Russian oil. Since then, however, the US has pressured India to stop importing and tightened the screws on all of Russia’s supplies. If Iranian barrels are disrupted simultaneously, two significant discounted supply streams could disappear, pushing crude firmly into triple-digit territory if tensions do not de-escalate. There are already signs of strain. Saudi Aramco has reportedly not allocated a March cargo to a Pakistani refinery amid volatility in global oil markets. Uncertainty in global crude trade has made it difficult to secure shipments for March, and this was before the news of the assassination of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Marine insurers are also considering repricing or cancelling policies in parts of the Middle East, according to reports. A chain reaction and the IMF Oil prices have a multiplier effect as they impact secondary markets. For example, edible oil prices — of which Pakistan imported roughly $3.7bn in FY25 — are indirectly linked to crude oil markets, Malik explains. Much of the economic breathing space that enabled recent stabilisation came from relatively stable global commodity prices. “For every $10 increase in oil prices, Pakistan’s inflation typically rises by about 0.5–0.6 percentage points,” says Waqas Ghani, Head of Equity Research at JS Global Capital. If oil prices surge, inflation would rise again, making further policy rate cuts unlikely. Industry would face higher input costs, weakening exports. At the same time, fiscal space would shrink, limiting the government’s ability to lower taxes or provide relief, adds Malik. “The veneer of stability has been damaged,” says Ammar H Khan, Professor of Practice at the Institute of Business Administration Karachi. Capital outflows could increase, or new investment could slow, hurting job creation and — at the margins — reducing demand for migrant labour abroad. These repercussions may also extend to remittances, which are vital for keeping the current account afloat. Even if the conflict lasts only a few days and does not turn into a prolonged war, heightened regional risk can weigh on financial flows, he adds. All this is taking place in the background of talks with the visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF) team. Industry sources say there had been positive talks with the Fund regarding possible tax relief in the upcoming budget. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also emphasised the need to reduce direct tax rates. However, given the current global uncertainty, meaningful relief now appears unlikely. Pakistan was already receiving very little foreign direct investment, notes M Abdul Aleem, secretary general of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “What little was in the pipelines, like investments in Reko Diq, will slow down for now,” he says. “Equally concerning is the law-and-order environment, particularly when it involves the safety of foreign nationals.” Referring to the recent incident at the US consulate in Karachi, he said stronger preventive security measures should have been in place. PSX and gold For equity markets, the implications extend beyond macroeconomic concerns. Pakistan’s manufacturing sectors rely heavily on imported raw materials and energy inputs. “Take the cement sector as an example,” says Waqas Ghani, Head of Equity Research. “It relies on coal and petcoke as key inputs. If oil prices rise, the prices of these fuels also increase, raising production costs.” Because many industries depend on imported inputs across the value chain, higher commodity prices quickly squeeze profit margins. “When input costs rise, margins come under pressure, and corporate earnings can deteriorate,” he said. “Apart from oil and exploration companies, most sectors would face headwinds.” Beyond fundamentals, market sentiment itself has turned cautious. “Investors are already becoming more risk-averse,” Ghani noted. “When uncertainty rises, equities are usually the first asset class where investors reduce exposure.” Several technical factors are also amplifying selling pressure. Foreign investors have been net sellers in recent weeks, while mutual funds are facing redemption pressures from retail investors. When investors withdraw money, fund managers are forced to liquidate holdings, increasing supply in the market. “At the same time, settlement dynamics can intensify the pressure,” Ghani added. The Pakistan Stock Exchange currently operates on a T+1 settlement cycle, while the banking system operates on a T+2 cycle, which can create short-term liquidity stress for brokers and investors during periods of volatility. “All these factors combined can create a downward spiral where selling feeds on itself,” he said. For now, the key trigger that could stabilise markets would be a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions. “If the conflict subsides and oil prices stabilise, sentiment could recover fairly quickly,” Ghani said. “But until then, markets are likely to remain under stress.” Much, however, will depend on how global markets react when trading begins. “It all depends on the evolving situation and any ceasefire news,” said Muhammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities. “A lot will hinge on how US futures open, along with the trend in oil prices and Asian markets.” Pakistani stocks are likely to fall initially, he added, though the extent will depend on developments overnight. Some markets that opened on Sunday were already down close to two per cent. Ali Nawaz, CEO of Chase Securities, expects early weakness in trading when it begins. “The market is likely to see a decline in the opening hours, driven by investor concerns over the US-Iran conflict, the broader Middle East situation and rising oil prices,” he said. However, he expects the pressure to ease as the week progresses. “A recovery could follow as the situation moves towards resolution and institutional investors step in for value buying,” Nawaz said. Given the market’s recent corrections, further declines may create attractive valuations for investors, echoing the age-old advice to buy the dip. As the Pakistan Stock Market bleeds, investors may turn to gold, which is expected to surge. On Saturday, local gold prices jumped by Rs10,000 per tola in Pakistan. Qasim Shikarpuri, president of the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association, expects international prices to rise by $200–$300 per ounce once markets reopen. “If that happens, local gold prices could surge by as much as Rs60,000 per tola,” he said. Bazaars and shopping Retailers say geopolitical tensions are already affecting shopping activity during Ramazan, a critical sales period for bazaars and malls. “We have seen this before,” said Asfandyar Farrukh, Chairman of the Chainstore Association of Pakistan. “Even a few days ago, when tensions flared between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and warnings were issued, there was an immediate impact.” The effect is most visible over the weekend, when shopping activity typically peaks. “Weekend footfall is usually the highest, especially on Sundays. But in such situations, visitor numbers can fall by half,” he said. If the tensions subside quickly, retailers expect the slowdown to be temporary. “If things improve within two or three days, the lost sales can be made up,” he said. “But if uncertainty continues through Ramazan, then the impact could become more significant.” According to Farrukh, shoppers tend to adjust their behaviour during prolonged uncertainty rather than abandoning shopping altogether. “People still need to shop for Eid. What they usually do is go out earlier in the day or spread their visits over time,” he said. “But overall, there could still be a 20–25pc decline in footfall during periods of heightened tension.” Retail activity during Ramazan typically peaks in the final ten days before Eid, though momentum had only recently begun building in markets. “The last ten days are usually when Ramazan shopping really accelerates,” he said. “But we are already beginning to see some slowdown.” Farrukh does not expect security concerns to push shoppers significantly toward online retail. “Eid shopping is an experience.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday expressed concern over the violation of international norms and the targeting of heads of state/government following the assassination of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a post on X, the premier said, “The government and the people of Pakistan join the people of Iran in their hour of grief and sorrow and extend the most sincere condolences on the martyrdom of His Eminence Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei.” He further said, “Pakistan also expresses concern over the violation of the norms of international law. It is an age-old convention that the heads of state/government should not be targeted.” The premier prayed for the Iranian supreme leader and for strength for the people of the country to bear “this irreparable loss”. Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed profound sorrow over the martyrdom of the Iranian supreme leader and other members of Iran’s senior leadership, according to a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat. “The president said that Pakistan stands with the Iranian nation in this moment of grief and shares in their loss. He observed that the passing of a leader of such stature, along with other senior figures, would be deeply felt across the Muslim world,” the statement said. He also offered prayers for the deceased and the people of Iran. PM Shehbaz speaks to Jordan, Bahrain kings Separately, PM Shehbaz spoke to Jordan’s King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein to discuss the “evolving regional situation”, according to the Prime Minister’s Office. “The two leaders exchanged views on the serious regional developments following the recent escalation from the Israeli attack on Iran, which was followed by attacks on Jordan and other regional countries,” the statement said. “The prime minister expressed Pakistan’s deep concern over the situation and emphasised the urgent need for restraint, de-escalation, and dialogue to preserve regional peace and stability,” the statement said. It added that the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the kingdom as well as other brotherly countries in the region during this “challenging time”. “He also reiterated Pakistan’s readiness to support all efforts aimed at restoring calm and promoting stability. Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional developments,” the statement said. The premier also posted about it on X, saying, “We emphasised the urgent need for restraint, dialogue, and de-escalation to preserve peace and stability.” He also spoke to Bahrain King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa to discuss the “ongoing crisis” in the Middle East and Iran’s attacks on several Gulf countries, including Bahrain, after US-Israeli attacks. According to the PMO, the premier said that such unprovoked acts of aggression only escalated the situation and threatened the peace and stability of the entire region. “He assured the leadership of Bahrain that Pakistan stood firmly with Bahrain and other brotherly Gulf countries and underscored the need for maximum restraint in this difficult time,” the statement said. PM Shehbaz also emphasised the need to “preserve the primacy of international law and reiterated that Pakistan would always remain committed to supporting peace efforts and urge all parties to engage in diplomacy and seek a negotiated solution to the crisis”. In a post on X about his conversation with Bahrain’s king, PM Shehbaz said, “While praying for the safety and security of our brothers and sisters in Bahrain, I emphasised restraint, respect for international law, and the urgent need for dialogue and diplomacy to restore peace and stability in the region.”",

      "summary_orig": "Brent crude jumped 10 per cent to about $80 a barrel over the counter on Sunday, oil traders said, while analysts predicted that prices could climb as high as $100 after US and Israeli strikes on Iran plunged the Middle East into a new war. The global oil benchmark has rallied this year and reached $73 a barrel on Friday for its highest since July, buoyed by growing concern over the potential attacks that arrived a day later. Futures trading is closed over the weekend. “While the military attacks are themselves supportive for oil prices, the key factor here is the closing of the Strait of Hormuz ,” said Ajay Parmar, director of energy and refining at ICIS. Most tanker owners, oil majors and trading houses have suspended crude oil, fuel and liquefied natural gas shipments via the Strait of Hormuz, trade sources said, after Tehran warned ships against moving through the waterway. More than 20pc of global oil is moved through the Strait of Hormuz. Middle East leaders have warned Washington that a war on Iran could lead to oil prices jumping to more than $100 a barrel, said RBC analyst Helima Croft. Rabobank analysts are slightly less bullish, seeing prices holding above $90 a barrel in the near term. The OPEC+ group of oil producers agreed on Sunday to raise output by 206,000 barrels per day (bpd) from April, a modest increase representing less than 0.2pc of global demand. While some alternate infrastructure could be used to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, the net impact from its closure would be a loss of 8million to 10m bpd of crude oil supply even after diverting some flows through Saudi Arabia’s East-West pipeline and Abu Dhabi’s pipeline, said Rystad Energy economist Jorge Leon. Rystad expects prices to rise by $20 to about $92 a barrel when trade opens. The Iran crisis also prompted Asian governments and refiners to assess oil stockpiles and alternative shipping routes and supplies. Kpler analysts said in a webinar on Sunday that India might turn to Russian oil to make up for potential Middle East supply loss.",

After Zimbabwe scored 153-7 in New Delhi, South Africa survived an early wobble. Dewald Brevis hit 42 off 18 balls as the 2024 runners-up reached 154-5 in 17.5 overs. Raza earlier hit 73 and then took 3-29 with his off-spin for Zimbabwe, who had stunned Australia and co-hosts Sri Lanka in the group stage to reach the Super Eights. Raza struck on the third ball of the South African chase to send back Quinton de Kock, caught behind for a duck. Raza bowled skipper Aiden Markram for four in the next over. Ryan Rickelton was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Brad Evans and took five minutes to recover. He then lifted Evans for two straight sixes in the next over before the bowler had him caught for 31. Brevis and David Miller, who hit 22, put on 50 before two more quick strikes from Zimbabwe. Blessing Muzarabani dismissed Miller, and Raza removed Brevis. Tristan Stubbs (21) and George Linde (30) then put on an unbeaten 53 to steer their side to the target. After choosing to bat, Zimbabwe lost the in-form opener Brian Bennett, who hit an unbeaten 97 in the defeat by India, for 15. Raza reached his fifty off 29 balls before falling to left-armer Kwena Maphaka, caught by Miller off a leading edge. Clive Madande boosted the total with 26 not out off 20 balls at the end. Maphaka took 2-21 from his four overs and Corbin Bosch 2-40.",

      "summary_orig": "UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan struck a delicate balance at a tense UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, condemning unwarranted attacks on Iran, expressing solidarity with Gulf states, and urging an immediate return to negotiations and diplomacy. The Council’s emergency session examined the repercussions of the US and Israeli air strikes on Iran and laid bare the deep divisions within the 15-member body over the escalating crisis. Speaking at the meeting, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, outlined Islamabad’s growing concern as the situation in the Middle East becomes more complex with each new development. “Pakistan condemns the initiation of unwarranted attacks against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in violation of international law,” the ambassador said. At the same time, he stressed that Pakistan also “condemns the attacks against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and stands in solidarity with all these brotherly countries.” He warned that, at a time when renewed diplomatic efforts were underway, such actions would “undermine the peace and stability of the entire region, with far-reaching consequences.” Ambassador Ahmad made clear that Pakistan’s concern extends beyond any single capital. Instead, it is focused on the security architecture of the entire Gulf region — home to millions of Pakistani expatriates and a region with which Islamabad maintains deep political, economic and security ties. This dual condemnation — of strikes on Iran and of attacks on Gulf states — illustrates the fine line Pakistan is walking. It cannot afford to alienate Tehran, a neighbor with whom it shares a sensitive border and a complex security equation. Nor can it distance itself from Gulf partners that host large Pakistani communities and play a critical role in Pakistan’s economy. The envoy’s emphasis on mediation and dialogue further underscored this balancing act. “We particularly laud Oman’s role in facilitating and mediating dialogue between Iran and the United States,” he said, aligning Pakistan firmly with diplomatic efforts rather than military blocs. In another pointed observation, he lamented that “diplomacy has once again been derailed as these attacks have happened right in the middle of negotiations,” warning that “these military actions undermine dialogue and further erode trust that was already in short supply.” Islamabad’s legal framing was equally deliberate. The ambassador reminded the Council that “the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct,” stressing that the Charter “prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states.” This formulation allows Pakistan to oppose unilateral or pre-emptive military actions without directly isolating any particular power beyond the immediate incidents. At the humanitarian level, Pakistan sought to humanise the crisis. Ambassador Ahmad offered condolences to “civilians caught in the middle of these violent acts,” specifically mentioning “school children in Iran” and the family of a Pakistani national killed in the United Arab Emirates. In doing so, Islamabad reinforced its message that ordinary people — Iranians, Arabs and Pakistanis alike — are the real victims of escalation. The strategic anxiety was also explicit. “We are deeply alarmed at the risk of regional conflagration,” the ambassador said, noting that the “safety and well-being of millions of our compatriots in the countries of the region is also our top priority.” Ultimately, Pakistan’s message was straightforward but urgent: “Pakistan calls on all sides to immediately halt escalation and urgently resume diplomacy with a view to achieving a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis.” Whether the balance Islamabad seeks to maintain can endure will depend not only on its own diplomatic agility, but also on whether the region itself steps back from the brink.",
