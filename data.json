Police recovered weapons and ammunition from the killed militants. According to police officials, the police vehicle was on routine patrol when assailants, who were lying in ambush, suddenly opened indiscriminate fire on the police party. A heavy exchange of fire continued between the police and the terrorists for approximately twenty minutes. Additional contingents, including an armored personnel carrier (APC), Quick Response Force (QRF), and Rapid Response Force (RRF), were immediately dispatched from Police Lines Bannu to the scene. During the subsequent search operation, the bodies of two militants were recovered and taken into police custody. Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and District Police Officer Yasir Afridi confirmed the incident and appreciated the Domel police for their timely and effective response. Police officials stated that operations against anti-state elements will continue unabated to ensure peace and security in the district. A day earlier, a peace committee member in Bannu district was shot dead in a targeted killing near an Afghan refugee camp, while his cousin sustained serious injuries. Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security forces coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.

      "summary_orig": "A powerful winter storm spread a paralyzing mix of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Ohio Valley and mid-South to New England on Sunday, compounded by bitter, Arctic cold gripping much of the US east of the Rockies. Winter storm warnings were posted for most of the eastern third of the United States covering 118 million people, as the deep freeze strained energy supplies in some areas, and the National Weather Service predicted widespread, prolonged travel disruptions. An estimated 157 million Americans were warned to bundle up against cold ranging from sub-zero temperatures along the Canadian border to below-freezing as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The Arctic blast was accompanied by gusty conditions that sent wind-chill conditions a measure of how cold it feels based on the rate of heat loss from the body plunging as low as minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern Plains. Deep snow, thick ice Some of the heaviest snowfall, up to one foot or more since the storm developed on Friday, was measured on Sunday in parts of Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had mobilized National Guard troops in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley to assist with the state’s emergency storm response. A worker clears snow from a White House driveway as a major winter storm spreads across a large swath of the United States, in Washington, D.C., US, January 25, 2026. — Reuters The onslaught of snow, ice and winds hit air travel especially hard, with major carriers forced to cancel more than 11,000 U.S. flights scheduled for Sunday, according to an industry tracking service FlightAware.com . Ronald Reagan National Airport, located in northern Virginia just across the Potomac River from Washington, was effectively closed altogether. Airports serving other major metropolitan areas, including New York, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina, had at least 80% of their Sunday flights canceled, FlightAware data showed. Power outages were widespread across the South, where freezing rain deposited layers of ice up to an inch thick, toppling tree limbs and transmission lines. More than 1 million homes and businesses in eight states from Texas to the Carolinas were without electricity at the height of the storm on Sunday, according to utility data posted online. Tennessee bore the greatest brunt of energy cuts, accounting for about a third of all the outages. More than 800,000 electricity customers remained without power as of 9:29 p.m. EST (0229 GMT), according to PowerOutage.us . Federal, state governments declare emergencies In parts of the mid-Atlantic, heavy snow early in the day gave way to sleet and freezing rain, adding to treacherous driving conditions and making it more difficult for street crews to safely clear road surfaces. People walk amid a major winter storm spreading across a large swath of the United States, in Brooklyn, New York City, US, January 25, 2026. — Reuters Heavy ice was reported by the weather service to be accumulating across the interior sections of the Eastern seaboard as far south as Atlanta, as the low-pressure system driving the storm moved through the Appalachian Mountains. Calling the storm “historic,” President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations for a dozen states, mostly in the mid-South. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia declared weather emergencies on Saturday. The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorizing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state. On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorize grid operator PJM Interconnection to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits. While the storm system was expected to drift away from the East Coast into the Atlantic on Monday, more Arctic air was forecast to rush in behind it, prolonging bitter cold, icy conditions over the next few days, the weather service said. “The situation with this storm is pretty unique, just because it’s going to stay cold for a period of time,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on the “Fox News Sunday Briefing” program. “This ice that has fallen will keep those (power) lines heavy, even if they haven’t gone down immediately.”",

      "summary_orig": "MUZAFFARABAD: Kashmiri activists staged a symbolic sit-in to condemn the unrelenting reign of terror in India-held Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday, a day ahead of India’s so-called Republic Day. The demonstration, staged outside Muzaffarabad Press Club under the aegis of Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu Kashmir (PHJK) — an organisation of post-1989 Kashmiri refugees — was aimed at drawing attention to the Indian occupation machinery’s brutal acts in the held territory and the enforcement of a slew of draconian laws. Posters and banners depicting various forms of repression in occupied Jammu and Kashmir were displayed at the venue of the sit-in where participants raised slogans against India’s sham democracy and the continued subjugation of Kashmiris. Right to self-determination They demanded their internationally recognised right to self-determination, and also called on the United Nations (UN) to intervene. Kashmiri refugees stage sit-in, urge international community to intervene “Down with India’s farcical democracy” and “UNO, wake up and come to our rescue” were among the slogans chanted. Addressing the gathering, PHJK chairman Uzair Ahmed Ghazali said India’s decision of August 5, 2019 had not only stripped Kashmiris of their political status but had also deprived them of their all human, social and democratic rights. He said thousands of Kashmiris demanding the inalienable right to self-determination had been killed in extrajudicial actions, while youths continued to be targeted in staged encounters. “While Muhammad Maqbool Butt and Muhammad Afzal Guru were sent to the gallows despite their innocence, several Hurriyat leaders died in custody due to systematic torture,” he said. ‘Serious war crimes’ “India is a terrorist state and its savage military apparatus is using black laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, Public Safety Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act with impunity to collectively punish Kashmiris,” he added. Mr Ghazali pointed out that sexual violence against women was being used as a weapon of war by Indian forces, resulting in thousands of widows and orphans, and added that mass graves were evidence of ‘serious war crimes’. Other speakers said demographic changes, land seizures, curbs on religious and cultural expression and a prolonged media blackout had turned occupied Kashmir into an open prison, where residents were living under curfews and security restrictions amid a heavy troop presence. The organisers urged the UN and the international community to take notice of the situation in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, seek independent investigations into grave violations and facilitate the implementation of UN resolutions granting Kashmiris the right to self-determination. Prominent among those who participated in the sit-in were Ghulam Mehdi Dar, Usman Ali Hashim, Faisal Farooq Sheikh, Iqbal Yaseen Awan, Muhammad Fayaz Khan, Khawaja Muhammad Sadiq, Muhammad Younis Mir, Muhammad Aslam Inqalabi, Muhammad Ashfaq Kashmiri, Imtiaz Khan and Syed Khalid Shah.

      "summary_en": "MUZAFFARABAD: Kashmiri activists staged a symbolic sit-in to condemn the unrelenting reign of terror in India-held Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday, a day ahead of India’s so-called Republic Day. The demonstration, staged outside Muzaffarabad Press Club under the aegis of Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu Kashmir (PHJK) — an organisation of post-1989 Kashmiri refugees — was aimed at drawing attention to the Indian occupation machinery’s brutal acts in the held territory and the enforcement of a slew of draconian laws. Posters and banners depicting various forms of repression in occupied Jammu and Kashmir were displayed at the venue of the sit-in where participants raised slogans against India’s sham democracy and the continued subjugation of Kashmiris. Right to self-determination They demanded their internationally recognised right to self-determination, and also called on the United Nations (UN) to intervene. Kashmiri refugees stage sit-in, urge international community to intervene “Down with India’s farcical democracy” and “UNO, wake up and come to our rescue” were among the slogans chanted. Addressing the gathering, PHJK chairman Uzair Ahmed Ghazali said India’s decision of August 5, 2019 had not only stripped Kashmiris of their political status but had also deprived them of their all human, social and democratic rights. He said thousands of Kashmiris demanding the inalienable right to self-determination had been killed in extrajudicial actions, while youths continued to be targeted in staged encounters. “While Muhammad Maqbool Butt and Muhammad Afzal Guru were sent to the gallows despite their innocence, several Hurriyat leaders died in custody due to systematic torture,” he said. ‘Serious war crimes’ “India is a terrorist state and its savage military apparatus is using black laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, Public Safety Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act with impunity to collectively punish Kashmiris,” he added. Mr Ghazali pointed out that sexual violence against women was being used as a weapon of war by Indian forces, resulting in thousands of widows and orphans, and added that mass graves were evidence of ‘serious war crimes’. Other speakers said demographic changes, land seizures, curbs on religious and cultural expression and a prolonged media blackout had turned occupied Kashmir into an open prison, where residents were living under curfews and security restrictions amid a heavy troop presence. The organisers urged the UN and the international community to take notice of the situation in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, seek independent investigations into grave violations and facilitate the implementation of UN resolutions granting Kashmiris the right to self-determination. Prominent among those who participated in the sit-in were Ghulam Mehdi Dar, Usman Ali Hashim, Faisal Farooq Sheikh, Iqbal Yaseen Awan, Muhammad Fayaz Khan, Khawaja Muhammad Sadiq, Muhammad Younis Mir, Muhammad Aslam Inqalabi, Muhammad Ashfaq Kashmiri, Imtiaz Khan and Syed Khalid Shah.

      "summary_orig": "MINNEAPOLIS: The fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal immigration agents Saturday has triggered a wave of criticism from local leaders to Hollywood stars, with conflicting accounts raising questions about the incident. Federal agents shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, less than three weeks after an Immigration and Cus­toms Enforcement (ICE) officer killed Renee Good, also 37. While the Department of Homeland Security said Pretti carried a pistol and ammunition, cellphone footage has challenged the government’s description. Minnesota Gov Tim Walz called the shooting “horrific” and demanded state authorities take charge. “The federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period,” Walz told a news conference. Pretti’s parents described him as a “kindhearted soul” and disputed the official narrative. “The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said in a statement. “Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked.” Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, said Pretti was a nurse working “to support critically ill Veterans.” Political fallout spread to Was­hington, with Sen Bill Cassidy, a Republican, writing on X that the credibility of ICE and DHS is at stake. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation,” Cassidy wrote. “We can trust the American people with the truth.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged President Donald Trump to end the immigration operation. “This is a moment to act like a leader,” Frey said. “Put Min­neapolis, put America first in this moment — let’s achieve peace.” The incident also drew condemnation at the Sundance Film Festival. Olivia Wilde said the shooting was “unfathomable.” “I can’t bel­i­eve that we’re watching people get murdered in the street,” she told AFP at “The Invite” premiere. “These brave Americans who have stepped out to protest the injustice of these ICE quote/unquote ‘officers,’ and watching them be murdered — it’s unfathomable. We cannot normalise it.” Natalie Portman became emotional as she described her feelings about a “horrible day”. “What is happening in our country is just obscene,” she told AFP . Gun rights advocates voiced concern over the administration linking Pretti’s legal gun possession to an intent to harm. After a federal prosecutor suggested shooting armed protesters is often justified, the National Rifle Association called the sentiment “dangerous and wrong”. The Gun Owners of America added, “The Second Amendment protects Americans’ right to bear arms while protesting — a right the federal government must not infringe upon.” Barack and Michelle Obama on Sunday forcefully condemned the killing of Pretti, saying in a joint statement it should be a “wake-up call” that core US values “are increasingly under assault.” The former president and first lady blasted Trump and his government as seeming “eager to escalate the situation,” demanding they work with Walz and other local officials.

On Saturday, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians, two of them teenagers, in two drone attacks in Gaza. Medical workers said an Israeli drone exploded on the rooftop of a multi-floor building in Gaza City, wounding four Palestinians in the street nearby. There was no comment by the Israeli military on either incident. Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the indiscriminate Israeli bombing. The Gaza health ministry says more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Israeli fire since then. It says that at least 480 people were killed by Israeli fire since the ceasefire agreement came into effect last October. Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza, and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory’s administration. Meanwhile, in Khan Younis, over a hundred people attended the funeral of a person who was killed by Israeli drone attack on Saturday, after holding special prayers in front of his white-shrouded body at the morgue in Nasser Hospital. “They are liars, there is no ceasefire,” said Fares Erheimat, a relative of the dead man, during the funeral. Ransom case Israeli military said on Sunday it had launched an investigation into a soldier who reportedly fabricated a kidnapping of a Palestinian detainee and demanded ransom from his family. The Palestinian man had been detained at a holding facility when a military police guard photographed him and sent the image to his family, falsely claiming he had been kidnapped, the Times of Israel reported . In a separate report, Israeli Army Radio said the soldier demanded the family transfer money in exchange for his release. Confirming the case, the military said an investigation had been launched but declined to provide details. US envoys, Netanyahu discuss Rafah US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reopen the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt during talks in Jerusalem, Israeli media reported Sunday. The reports came after a newly appointed administrator for Gaza said on Thursday that the crossing would be operational in both directions next week. Israeli news site Ynet reported, citing an unnamed Israeli official, that while the meeting between Netanyahu, Witkoff and Kushner was “positive”, Witkoff pressed Israel to reopen Rafah even before Hamas returns remains of the last Israeli prisoner believed to be held in Gaza. According to the official, Witkoff also raised the possibility of Turkiye playing a role in Gaza’s future. “Witkoff pushed to bring our greatest rival, Turkiye, to our border,” the official was quoted as saying. The official also accused Witkoff of acting on behalf of Doha, saying he had “become a lobbyist for Qatari interests”, according to Ynet. US officials’ discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the second phase of President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza were constructive, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday. “The United States and Israel maintain a strong and longstanding relationship built on close coordination and shared priorities. The discussion was constructive and positive, with both sides aligned on next steps and the importance of continued cooperation on all matters critical to the region,” Witkoff said in an X post. The talks were held on Saturday, he said. Published in Dawn, January 26th, 2026",

      "summary": "• Israeli soldier being investigated for faking Palestinian’s abduction for ransom • US envoy Steve Witkoff calls talks with Netanyahu ‘positive’ CAIRO: In another violation of the US-brokered ceasefire, Israeli troops killed two more Palestinians in the Tuffah neighbourhood in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday, and an Israeli drone wounded four others in a separate incident in Gaza City, local health authorities said. On Saturday, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians, two of them teenagers, in two drone attacks in Gaza. Medical workers said an Israeli drone exploded on the rooftop of a multi-floor building in Gaza City, wounding four Palestinians in the street nearby. There was no comment by the Israeli military on either incident. Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the indiscriminate Israeli bombing. The Gaza health ministry says more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Israeli fire since then. It says that at least 480 people were killed by Israeli fire since the ceasefire agreement came into effect last October. Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza, and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory’s administration. Meanwhile, in Khan Younis, over a hundred people attended the funeral of a person who was killed by Israeli drone attack on Saturday, after holding special prayers in front of his white-shrouded body at the morgue in Nasser Hospital. “They are liars, there is no ceasefire,” said Fares Erheimat, a relative of the dead man, during the funeral. Ransom case Israeli military said on Sunday it had launched an investigation into a soldier who reportedly fabricated a kidnapping of a Palestinian detainee and demanded ransom from his family. The Palestinian man had been detained at a holding facility when a military police guard photographed him and sent the image to his family, falsely claiming he had been kidnapped, the Times of Israel reported . In a separate report, Israeli Army Radio said the soldier demanded the family transfer money in exchange for his release. Confirming the case, the military said an investigation had been launched but declined to provide details. US envoys, Netanyahu discuss Rafah US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reopen the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt during talks in Jerusalem, Israeli media reported Sunday. The reports came after a newly appointed administrator for Gaza said on Thursday that the crossing would be operational in both directions next week. Israeli news site Ynet reported, citing an unnamed Israeli official, that while the meeting between Netanyahu, Witkoff and Kushner was “positive”, Witkoff pressed Israel to reopen Rafah even before Hamas returns remains of the last Israeli prisoner believed to be held in Gaza. According to the official, Witkoff also raised the possibility of Turkiye playing a role in Gaza’s future. “Witkoff pushed to bring our greatest rival, Turkiye, to our border,” the official was quoted as saying. The official also accused Witkoff of acting on behalf of Doha, saying he had “become a lobbyist for Qatari interests”, according to Ynet. US officials’ discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the second phase of President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza were constructive, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday. “The United States and Israel maintain a strong and longstanding relationship built on close coordination and shared priorities. The discussion was constructive and positive, with both sides aligned on next steps and the importance of continued cooperation on all matters critical to the region,” Witkoff said in an X post. The talks were held on Saturday, he said. Published in Dawn, January 26th, 2026",

      "title_orig": "The wheat paradox",
      "summary_orig": "From the harvest of the previous wheat crop in March–April 2025 to the sowing of the current one in November 2025, key office bearers of Pakistan’s major farmers’ associations consistently criticised the government’s wheat policy. Their criticism, through press conferences, television talk shows, and public forums, centred particularly on two major policy shifts in the wheat sector: the withdrawal of the wheat support price, and the abolition of the decades-old practice of direct procurement from farmers. They warned that farmers were likely to reduce the wheat-sown area in the upcoming season in protest, as most had received prices ranging between Rs1,800 and 2,200 per 40kg — far less than their production costs and the import parity price. Several independent experts also predicted a decline in wheat acreage, particularly in Punjab, where the government imposed district-specific wheat ceiling prices of around Rs2,800 per 40kg once prices began to rebound after a period of oversupply during harvest season. This artificial price suppression through administrative measures — quite contrary to the principles of deregulation and free market economy — hurts farmers who managed to hold their stocks for better prices. Surprisingly, in contrast to earlier predictions, the first estimate of the 2025-26 wheat crop prepared by the Crop Reporting Service (Government of the Punjab) indicates that in Punjab — which produces 76 per cent of the country’s wheat — the crop has been sown over 16.41 million acres compared to 16.25m acres in 2024–25. This reflects an increase of 159,000 acres. Historically, farmers have preferred wheat because most alternative crops require higher upfront investments, provide lower or uncertain financial returns, or lack developed marketing channels The Punjab government has taken credit for this expansion, attributing it to the timely announcement of an indicative price (not a support price) of Rs3,500 per 40kg, a reduction in the price of certified wheat seeds, and an effective sowing campaign. If the integrity of this data holds up, this raises a critical question: what is the ground reality? Have farmers once again been drawn in by government assurances — particularly the Rs3,500 indicative price — or do they simply have limited viable alternatives to wheat? There is a possibility that many farmers opted to sow wheat, anticipating that a reduction in total wheat acreage would reduce supply and lead to higher market prices this year. In part, the answer lies in the timely announcement of an indicative price, which helped revive farmers’ confidence. However, the deeper reality is that Pakistan grows a very limited number of Kharif and Rabi crops — excluding vegetables, which have a wide range, but cannot be cultivated on a large scale due to limited domestic consumption and constrained export opportunities. For wheat growers, alternative cropping options vary across various regions of Pakistan. For example, in the Sahiwal division, farmers can shift from wheat to potatoes, garlic, canola, mustard, and spring maize. Likewise, farmers in the Sargodha division may opt for sugarcane (a year-long crop), chickpeas, lentils, maize, and oilseeds. Similarly, in some regions, sunflowers and tobacco can replace wheat. Historically, farmers have preferred wheat because most alternative crops require higher upfront investments due to costly seeds and fertilisers, provide lower or uncertain financial returns compared to wheat, or lack well-developed marketing channels, particularly when grown outside their established production clusters. In contrast, wheat requires relatively few and simple agricultural operations. It can be grown under both irrigated/rain-fed or water-scarce conditions, which makes it suitable across a wide range of agro-ecological zones. Wheat is less susceptible to pest and disease infestations and relatively more resilient to climatic variability than many alternative crops. Moreover, it is traded even in the smallest local grain markets, so farmers face minimal marketing constraints. Additionally, smallholders who rear livestock are compelled to grow wheat, as wheat straw serves as an essential fodder source. These attributes make wheat particularly attractive to risk-averse farmers who seek ease, stability, and predictability. As such, wheat has historically remained the preferred choice for absentee landlords. An analysis of wheat acreage trends over the past 25 years further reinforces this pattern. With the exception of the last year, the maximum year-on-year decline in wheat area was limited to 3.3pc, recorded in 2000–01 compared with 1999–2000. In contrast, during 2024–25, wheat acreage declined sharply by 5.5pc, largely due to the import of 3.6m tonnes of wheat in early 2024, coupled with the Punjab government’s abrupt refusal to procure the 2024 harvest from farmers. In conclusion, given the limited crop alternatives available to Pakistani farmers, wheat is likely to remain the country’s dominant crop, with the risk of no more than a 5.5pc reduction in cultivated area in any given year. However, every farmer has an economic threshold, beyond which sustained losses compel a shift to alternative crops. In light of the past two years, the government must ensure — through appropriate policy interventions and administrative measures — that the new wheat crop trades at the promised rate of Rs3,500 per 40kg, a level that covers production costs and allows at least a bare minimum margin for farmers. Failure to honour this commitment would further erode government credibility — already weakened by unmet assurances over the last two years. On the other hand, for the country, even a 5pc reduction in wheat acreage could necessitate the import of approximately 1.5m tonnes, which requires massive foreign exchange.

A more informed and connected population trapped in economic stagnation creates fertile ground for populism, criminal and terrorist networks.

Almost universal connectivity, rapid digitisation, and access to limitless online information have dismantled the old notion that deprivation is a matter of fate. Greater public exposure to comforts online has sparked aspirations and increased awareness of wealth and income disparity and opportunity gaps. While the desire to improve life and living standards is powerful, the absence of a clear pathway for personal growth and career advancement pushes many towards shortcuts, often blurring ethical boundaries. The latest HIES shows little progress in key social and economic indicators since the FY19 survey. Literacy rose only marginally from 60 per cent to 63pc, while the share of out-of-school children aged 5-16 declined slightly from 30pc to 28pc. Health outcomes improved marginally: better immunisation coverage, pre- and post-natal care, and access to skilled birth attendants helped reduce neonatal and infant mortality, yet rates remain high at 35 and 47 per thousand live births, respectively. Gains in housing quality, access to piped water and sanitation are simply limited and male employment rates have dropped. Pakistan has become one of the region’s most digitally connected societies, yet social progress remains slow and male employment has fallen In contrast, the survey records a dramatic surge in digital connectivity. Household internet access more than doubled from 34pc in FY19 to 70pc in FY25. Mobile phone ownership reached 96pc of households, with 98pc of urban households connected to the internet. Individual internet use rose sharply from 17pc to 57pc over the period. “Better-informed individuals can clearly see the gap between their living standards and those of the wealthy. This sense of ‘relative deprivation’ is a powerful source of discontent. People increasingly recognise that their circumstances are not merely the result of personal failure but stem from broader structural problems, including political patronage, unfair systems, wage stagnation, limited access to affordable education, and discrimination. This awareness fuels frustration with the existing order, replacing passive acceptance with growing resentment,” remarked an analyst anonymously. “Despite private security and state-of-the-art safeguards at my home and factories, I don’t feel safe,” a leading business tycoon said, reflecting on Bangladesh’s 2024 youth uprising. “I fear the anger of a large pool of frustrated young people turning against those seen as successful. I don’t believe that the state could protect the elite if mob fury spills over. I‘ve already moved my family abroad and am exploring options to shift part of my business to the West.” “I believe the risk of public backlash spiralling into an anarchic situation is real. The government must act swiftly to stabilise the economy and pursue a more inclusive growth model. The elite should also curb conspicuous consumption to avoid provoking public resentment. Businesses, meanwhile, need to abandon the practice of suppressing wages, which form only a small share of costs and are already far below global norms, and start respecting employees’ right to dignified living,” a leading businessman said privately. However, an Islamabad-based economist questioned, “Are the HIES findings even credible? Can a sample survey truly reflect on-ground reality?” The survey, conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), covers 2,343 enumeration blocks and 32,785 households nationwide. Defended the HIES methodology, PBS’s chief statistician, Dr Naeem uz Zafar, noted that the high mobile penetration is corroborated by the Pakistan Telecommunication Agency. He acknowledged the puzzling decline in male employment, partly reflected in gig work captured by the Labour Force Survey FY25. He added that while enrolment gains appear modest, improving gender parity and stronger female participation in education indicate greater human capital gains for women. Improvements in family planning and maternal, newborn, and child health indicators, he said, also point to growing awareness and better health outcomes. A formal cabinet response on the HIES did not arrive by the deadline, but Dr Nadeem Javed, Vice Chancellor, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, described the survey as revealing “a striking paradox”: Pakistan has become one of the region’s most digitally connected societies, with near universal mobile ownership and about 70pc internet access, yet social progress remains slow and male employment has fallen. He attributed this to household economic stress in recent years. While household incomes rose by roughly 97pc, household spending climbed faster, about 133pc, driven largely by higher electricity, gas and health costs. This squeezed spending on food, education and small businesses. “Digital access on its own could not offset these pressures. Without digital work and commerce, connectivity remains a convenience rather than a livelihood,” he argued. “As recovery takes hold, policy must pivot from access to opportunity, linking connectivity with skills, online work, digital trade and small business growth to translate reach into productivity, incomes and human development,” Dr Javed added.

      "summary_orig": "Shafi Jan, the special aide to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister for information, on Sunday doubled down on the stance that the federal government had ordered a military operation in Tirah. The PTI-led KP government has repeatedly opposed military operations in the province, an issue that has created friction between the party, the centre and the establishment, with the latter accusing PTI of providing sanctuary to militants. Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan with Shehzad Iqbal, Jan said the 24-member Jirga , which agreed on the displacement from Tirah before the operation, was “forced” to sign. Referring to the federal government’s statement that it had not issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Tirah, Jan said a large-scale military operation was being “imposed” rather than routine intelligence-based operations. When asked about the Khyber deputy commissioner’s (DC) signatures, he said the DC signed the deal just to facilitate the people, because the government “knew that the people would be evacuated”. “KP’s cabinet approved Rs4 billion for the people of Tirah, because we knew that they were going to be displaced.” Jan insisted that the operation was permitted by the Inspector-General Frontier Crops, Core Commander and KP’s Chief Secretary, saying that “Chief Secretary is the representative of the federal government.” “We will never be part of this military operation; neither do we support it, nor have we been taken into confidence,” he said. He criticised that, “They [government] don’t want to curb terrorism, people have doubts about their intentions.” “They wanted to damage KP CM Sohail Afridi’s political esteem.” Jan further alleged that, “It is a war of narrative,” saying, “They are trying to build a new narrative.” He reiterated that KP CM would call a Jirga on Sunday, and people would testify by themselves. He claimed that the federal government had offered Rs17 billion for internally displaced persons, and the provincial government received this amount for three years; however, for the past three years, the KP government has received nothing. “There are 17,000 families in total, and 12,000 of them have been registered.” “The snowfall has made the relocation really difficult,” he said. He further mentioned that the federal government was now running from its own narrative. “We will call the Pashtun jirga and reveal all the facts.” ‘No large-scale military operation in Tirah’ Speaking on the same platform, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal denied any large-scale military operation in Tirah, saying, “people are relocating due to the deteriorating law and order situation, which was a provincial government’s failure.” He recalled the federal government’s statement that was only routine intelligence-based operations in Tirah to target the terrorists’ pockets. “The PTI government is not paying attention to ensure law and order in the province,” he said. “Law and order is a provincial subject.” He recalled that back in 2018, the federal government had terminated terrorism from KP; however, “PTI allowed terrorists to return and get settled there.” Iqbal blamed the PTI government for shielding Fitna Al Khawarij, the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “PTI wants to give a free hand to terrorists in KP,” he said. The planning minister said that PTI had to choose between the terrorists and Pakistan and that the party was “trying to create a rift between the state and the people.”",

He further mentioned that the federal government was now running from its own narrative. “We will call the Pashtun jirga and reveal all the facts.” ‘No large-scale military operation in Tirah’ Speaking on the same platform, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal denied any large-scale military operation in Tirah, saying, “people are relocating due to the deteriorating law and order situation, which was a provincial government’s failure.” He recalled the federal government’s statement that was only routine intelligence-based operations in Tirah to target the terrorists’ pockets. “The PTI government is not paying attention to ensure law and order in the province,” he said. “Law and order is a provincial subject.” He recalled that back in 2018, the federal government had terminated terrorism from KP; however, “PTI allowed terrorists to return and get settled there.” Iqbal blamed the PTI government for shielding Fitna Al Khawarij, the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “PTI wants to give a free hand to terrorists in KP,” he said. The planning minister said that PTI had to choose between the terrorists and Pakistan and that the party was “trying to create a rift between the state and the people.”",

      "summary_orig": "A peace committee member in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district was shot dead in a targeted killing near an Afghan refugee camp, while his cousin sustained serious injuries, the police said on Sunday. “The incident took place at the Afghan Refugees Camp in Domel tehsil, and the victims have been identified as Khwajatullah and Naseemullah,” the police said. “Both belonged to Gangi Khel.” The statement added that the incident occurred when Khwajatullah and Naseemullah were at a shop in Tehsil Colony to purchase groceries. “At that moment, two unidentified armed men arrived and opened indiscriminate fire on them,” it read. “As a result of the firing, Khwajatullah died on the spot, while Naseemullah was injured. The injured person was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where he is currently under medical treatment.” In his statement to Domel Police, Naseemullah stated that the attack was sudden and that they had no personal enmity or dispute with anyone. District Police Officer Yasir Afridi said, “Investigations are underway, and all possible angles are being examined to ascertain the motives behind the incident.” Separately, police neutralised explosive material planted by unknown terrorists on Eidgah Road in Domel. According to a police official, the highly dangerous explosives weighed between three and four kilogrammes and were fitted with a remote-controlled device. “Thanks to the professional expertise and prompt response of the Bomb Disposal Squad, the area was saved from a major tragedy,” he said. The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence. Armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee on January 13, police confirmed. Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed three “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Panjgur district, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On January 25 (Sunday), security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Panjgur District of Balochistan, on [the] reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan .” Fitna al Hindustan is a state-designated name for the Balochistan-based terror groups allegedly supported by India to target military personnel in Pakistan. The statement said that during the conduct of the operation, the security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an “intense fire exchange, three Indian sponsored terrorists were eliminated.” Among the killed was a local terrorist commander, Farooq alias Soro, the ISPR said. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.” It stated that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, adding that the security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue their counter terrorism campaign at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country under the vision of “ Azm e Istehkam ”. In 2025, despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militancy, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies. Earlier this month, four terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district.",
