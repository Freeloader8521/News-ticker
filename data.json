      "summary_orig": "PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters, party workers and supporters are continuing their sit-in past midnight at Factory Naka, near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, to demand their court-mandated meeting with the ex-premier. A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran over the past several weeks. Last Tuesday, after being denied a meeting with the PTI chief, his sisters and party supporters staged a sit-in , which was dispersed early morning with water cannons. Late on Tuesday night, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas arrived at the protest site and began one-on-one consultations with PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja. Afterwards, the MWM senator will consult with Aleema before a decision is made whether to call off the protest or continue. A large number of party workers and supporters are participating in the sit-in, where a heavy contingent of police is also present. Some of the demonstrators also scrawled pro-PTI messaging on the walls of petrol pumps and other structures near the protest site. Some of the messages included the number “804”, which is reportedly Imran’s prisoner number. Pro-PTI messaging is written on walls near Factory Naka in Rawalpindi on December 16. — Screengrab via author. A later update revealed that the lights at the protest site were turned off, prompting the PTI demonstrators to use their phone flashlights as a light source as sloganeering intensified. Earlier today, Imran’s sisters marched toward the prison before being stopped. Speaking to a reporter as she marched, Aleema said, “We will sit wherever we are stopped”. When asked if she had prepared for the deployment of water cannons or a prolonged sit-in, she replied that she had brought warm clothes and a blanket, showing the latter on camera. Speaking to reporters, Aleema stated that this occurs every Tuesday at the same location, maintaining that she and her party supporters are not engaging in any illegal or unconstitutional activities. “We have no other option left besides protesting,” she said. “Our founder’s demand is the restoration of the Constitution, democracy and the rule of law.” She claimed that the judiciary has been stripped of independence, unemployment is rising due to the stoppage of trade with Afghanistan and that the security situation is deteriorating. Referring to her sister Uzma’s brief meeting with Imran on December 2 and the government’s claim of “political conversations” that violated jail rules, Aleema urged the government to tell the family what was discussed. “Tell me what political matters my sister discussed in the last meeting. Political topics should be discussed with the people of the party,” she said. Asked about a recent AI (artificial intelligence)-generated image of Imran in prison, which went viral, Aleema acknowledged she was not aware of artificial intelligence, but maintained that he looked the same as the person in the photograph as recently as October. “Until two months ago, when we used to go visit the jail, the founder used to look exactly like this,” she said. “It may be AI, but it is the right AI. “I don’t know what the prison looks like from the inside, but I can say that Imran Khan looked like this on October 16, the last time we met,” Aleema added. She said that Imran told Uzma during their meeting that “the mental torture is far worse than the physical torture” and that he is being kept in solitary confinement. “They think he will break, but Imran Khan is a man with faith in God. He will not break,” Aleema emphasised. “Imran Khan has said he is ready to accept death, but he will not be subdued by cruelty and injustice.” She added that the government wants Imran to cut a deal with them, but insisted that he is not imprisoned for himself, but for the supremacy of the Constitution and rule of law. Naeem Haider Panjhuta, Imran’s spokesperson on legal affairs, filmed a video from the site of the sit-in, showing crowds of PTI workers staging the demonstration into this evening. “We are waiting for a meeting with Khan sahib . Today is the designated day for family and lawyers to meet him,” he said. “They are not letting us meet him, despite the IHC court order and visits being permitted in the jail manual.” PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who was also present at the sit-in, urged everyone to come and join the demonstration and express solidarity with the sisters of the party founder. “This is not only the job of the assembly members,” he said. “How can these people (the government) tell someone what they can and cannot discuss in a meeting?” However, the party’s secretary general gave a fiery response to a question, asking, “Do you think 20-30,000 people can overthrow a system that has been in place for the past 78 years? “We are calling out to the entire nation. We do not want to carry on this drama for another day, after which people will die,” Raja said. “We will make a conscious effort and will not submit to pressure.” He added that people’s consciences need to be shaken to ensure Imran’s release and said that the moment would come when hundreds of thousands of people would take to the streets. Meanwhile, Noreen Niazi told reporters that the PTI is a peaceful political party and claimed that they had been “injured” by the water cannons deployed last week. She added that they would “do whatever is necessary to free Imran Khan” and maintained that he was unlawfully imprisoned. A livestream posted by the party on X showed crowds of young PTI supporters waving flags and chanting slogans as they made their way towards the prison. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health. In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes. Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards. Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”",

      "title_orig": "Police confirm Bondi gunman was from India’s Hyderabad; family claims no knowledge of his radicalisation",
      "summary_orig": "Indian police said on Tuesday that one of the gunmen in Australia’s Bondi Beach shooting , Sajid Akram, was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad but had limited contact with his family in India. The death toll in one of Australia’s worst mass shootings stands at 16, including 50-year-old Akram, who was shot by police. The man’s 24-year-old son and alleged accomplice, identified by local media as Naveed Akram, was in critical condition in hospital after also being shot. Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana state. Australian police said both men had travelled to the Philippines last month, the father on an Indian passport and the son on an Australian one. “The family members have expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalisation,” Telangana state police said in a statement. The purpose of the trip is under investigation, officials said, adding it was not conclusive whether they were linked to any terrorist group or whether they received training in that country. Telangana police said the factors that led to the radicalisation of the two gunmen “appear to have no connection with India or any local influence in Telangana”. In its statement on Tuesday, Telangana police said Sajid Akram visited India on six occasions, mainly for family-related reasons, since he migrated to Australia in 1998. There was no “adverse record” on him before he left India, the statement added. This screen grab made from UGC handout video footage courtesy of Timothy Brant-Coles shows two gunmen dressed in black firing multiple shots on a bridge at Bondi Beach in Sydney on December 14, 2025. — AFP Police added that Sajid Akram had got a degree in commerce in Hyderabad, the large and bustling tech and pharma hub that is the state capital. Akram then moved to Australia in November 1998 to find work and married a woman described as of European origin, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Sajid and his son Naveed, who allegedly killed 15 people and wounded dozens of others at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, arrived on November 1 with the southern Philippine province of Davao listed as their final destination. The father and son spent nearly the entire month of November in the Philippines, Manila’s immigration department confirmed on Tuesday, with the father entering the country as an Indian national. “Sajid Akram, 50, Indian national, and Naveed Akram, 24, Australian national, arrived in the Philippines together last November 1, 2025 from Sydney, Australia,” immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval told AFP , adding they departed on November 28. Australian police said on Tuesday both men had travelled to the Philippines last month and the purpose of the trip is under investigation. Philippines police have said they are investigating the matter. Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country. They have been reduced to weakened cells operating in the southern Mindanao island in recent years, far from the scale of influence they wielded during the 2017 Marawi siege. “Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State, allegedly committed by a father and son,” Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said at a news conference. “These are the alleged actions of those who have aligned themselves with a terrorist organisation, not a religion.” Police also said the vehicle which is registered to the younger male contained improvised explosive devices and two homemade flags associated with ISIS, or Islamic State, a militant group designated by Australia and many other countries as a terrorist organisation. The father and son allegedly fired upon hundreds of people at the festival during a roughly 10-minute killing spree at one of Australia’s top tourist destinations, forcing people to flee and take shelter before both were shot by police. Some 25 survivors are receiving care in several Sydney hospitals, officials said. Australian PM says ‘Islamic State ideology’ drove Bondi Beach gunmen The father and son were driven by “Islamic State ideology” when they fired on crowds at Bondi Beach, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday. “It would appear that this was motivated by Islamic State ideology,” Albanese told national broadcaster ABC . “With the rise of ISIS more than a decade ago now, the world has been grappling with extremism and this hateful ideology,” he said in a separate interview. Albanese said Naveed, reportedly an unemployed bricklayer, had come to the attention of Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019 but was not considered an imminent threat at the time. “They interviewed him, they interviewed his family members, they interviewed people around him,” Albanese said. “He was not seen at that time to be a person of interest.” Memorial of flowers Israeli Ambassador Amir Maimon visited Bondi on Tuesday and urged the Australian government to take all required steps to secure the lives of Jews in Australia. “Only Australians of Jewish faith are forced to worship their gods behind closed doors, CCTV, guards,” Maimon told reporters in Bondi, after laying flowers at the temporary memorial and paying his respects to the victims. “My heart is torn apart … it is insane.” A string of anti-Semitic incidents in Australia has unfolded in the past 16 months, prompting the head of the nation’s main intelligence agency to declare that anti-Semitism was his top priority in terms of threat to life. At Bondi, the beach was open on Tuesday but was largely empty under overcast skies, as a growing memorial of flowers was established at the Bondi Pavilion, metres from the location of the shootings. Mourners gather at a tribute at the Bondi Pavilion in memory of the victims of a shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on December 16. — AFP Bondi is Sydney’s best-known beach, located about 8.2km (5 miles) from the city centre, and draws hundreds of thousands of international tourists each year. Olivia Robertson, 25, visited the memorial before work. “This is the country that our grandparents have come to for us to feel safe and to have opportunity,” she said. “And now this has happened right here in our backyard. It’s pretty shocking.” Ahmed al Ahmed, the 43-year-old Muslim father-of-two who charged at one of the gunmen and seized his rifle, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds. He has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump. A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.9 million ($1.26 million). Tougher gun laws Australia’s gun laws are now being examined by the federal government, after police said Sajid Akram was a licenced gun owner and had six registered weapons. Akram received his gun licence in 2023, not 2015 as had been earlier stated, police said on Tuesday. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said gun laws introduced by the previous conservative Liberal-National coalition government following the Port Arthur massacre needed to be re-examined. Former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the gun restrictions in 1996, said on Tuesday he didn’t want to see gun law reform become a “diversion” from the need to tackle anti-Semitism. Albanese had let the Jewish community down, Howard told reporters. “He should have done more to fight anti-Semitism, a lot more,” he said. The 15 victims ranged from a rabbi who was a father of five, to a Holocaust survivor, to a 10-year-old girl named Matilda Britvan, according to interviews, officials and media reports. Two police officers remained in critical but stable condition in hospital, New South Wales police said. Matilda’s aunt has spoken publicly of her family’s heartbreak, saying they were devastated by her death. “I am beyond belief that this happened. I look on the phone and I am hoping it’s like a little big joke, not real,” Lina Chernykh told 7NEWS Australia.",

Australian PM says ‘Islamic State ideology’ drove Bondi Beach gunmen The father and son were driven by “Islamic State ideology” when they fired on crowds at Bondi Beach, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday. “It would appear that this was motivated by Islamic State ideology,” Albanese told national broadcaster ABC . “With the rise of ISIS more than a decade ago now, the world has been grappling with extremism and this hateful ideology,” he said in a separate interview. Albanese said Naveed, reportedly an unemployed bricklayer, had come to the attention of Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019 but was not considered an imminent threat at the time. “They interviewed him, they interviewed his family members, they interviewed people around him,” Albanese said. “He was not seen at that time to be a person of interest.” Memorial of flowers Israeli Ambassador Amir Maimon visited Bondi on Tuesday and urged the Australian government to take all required steps to secure the lives of Jews in Australia. “Only Australians of Jewish faith are forced to worship their gods behind closed doors, CCTV, guards,” Maimon told reporters in Bondi, after laying flowers at the temporary memorial and paying his respects to the victims. “My heart is torn apart … it is insane.” A string of anti-Semitic incidents in Australia has unfolded in the past 16 months, prompting the head of the nation’s main intelligence agency to declare that anti-Semitism was his top priority in terms of threat to life. At Bondi, the beach was open on Tuesday but was largely empty under overcast skies, as a growing memorial of flowers was established at the Bondi Pavilion, metres from the location of the shootings. Mourners gather at a tribute at the Bondi Pavilion in memory of the victims of a shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on December 16. — AFP Bondi is Sydney’s best-known beach, located about 8.2km (5 miles) from the city centre, and draws hundreds of thousands of international tourists each year. Olivia Robertson, 25, visited the memorial before work. “This is the country that our grandparents have come to for us to feel safe and to have opportunity,” she said. “And now this has happened right here in our backyard. It’s pretty shocking.” Ahmed al Ahmed, the 43-year-old Muslim father-of-two who charged at one of the gunmen and seized his rifle, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds. He has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump. A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.9 million ($1.26 million). Tougher gun laws Australia’s gun laws are now being examined by the federal government, after police said Sajid Akram was a licenced gun owner and had six registered weapons. Akram received his gun licence in 2023, not 2015 as had been earlier stated, police said on Tuesday. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said gun laws introduced by the previous conservative Liberal-National coalition government following the Port Arthur massacre needed to be re-examined. Former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the gun restrictions in 1996, said on Tuesday he didn’t want to see gun law reform become a “diversion” from the need to tackle anti-Semitism. Albanese had let the Jewish community down, Howard told reporters. “He should have done more to fight anti-Semitism, a lot more,” he said. The 15 victims ranged from a rabbi who was a father of five, to a Holocaust survivor, to a 10-year-old girl named Matilda Britvan, according to interviews, officials and media reports. Two police officers remained in critical but stable condition in hospital, New South Wales police said. Matilda’s aunt has spoken publicly of her family’s heartbreak, saying they were devastated by her death. “I am beyond belief that this happened. I look on the phone and I am hoping it’s like a little big joke, not real,” Lina Chernykh told 7NEWS Australia.",
      "title": "Police confirm Bondi gunman was from India’s Hyderabad; family claims no knowledge of his radicalisation",
      "summary": "Indian police said on Tuesday that one of the gunmen in Australia’s Bondi Beach shooting , Sajid Akram, was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad but had limited contact with his family in India. The death toll in one of Australia’s worst mass shootings stands at 16, including 50-year-old Akram, who was shot by police. The man’s 24-year-old son and alleged accomplice, identified by local media as Naveed Akram, was in critical condition in hospital after also being shot. Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana state. Australian police said both men had travelled to the Philippines last month, the father on an Indian passport and the son on an Australian one. “The family members have expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalisation,” Telangana state police said in a statement. The purpose of the trip is under investigation, officials said, adding it was not conclusive whether they were linked to any terrorist group or whether they received training in that country. Telangana police said the factors that led to the radicalisation of the two gunmen “appear to have no connection with India or any local influence in Telangana”. In its statement on Tuesday, Telangana police said Sajid Akram visited India on six occasions, mainly for family-related reasons, since he migrated to Australia in 1998. There was no “adverse record” on him before he left India, the statement added. This screen grab made from UGC handout video footage courtesy of Timothy Brant-Coles shows two gunmen dressed in black firing multiple shots on a bridge at Bondi Beach in Sydney on December 14, 2025. — AFP Police added that Sajid Akram had got a degree in commerce in Hyderabad, the large and bustling tech and pharma hub that is the state capital. Akram then moved to Australia in November 1998 to find work and married a woman described as of European origin, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Sajid and his son Naveed, who allegedly killed 15 people and wounded dozens of others at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, arrived on November 1 with the southern Philippine province of Davao listed as their final destination. The father and son spent nearly the entire month of November in the Philippines, Manila’s immigration department confirmed on Tuesday, with the father entering the country as an Indian national. “Sajid Akram, 50, Indian national, and Naveed Akram, 24, Australian national, arrived in the Philippines together last November 1, 2025 from Sydney, Australia,” immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval told AFP , adding they departed on November 28. Australian police said on Tuesday both men had travelled to the Philippines last month and the purpose of the trip is under investigation. Philippines police have said they are investigating the matter. Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country. They have been reduced to weakened cells operating in the southern Mindanao island in recent years, far from the scale of influence they wielded during the 2017 Marawi siege. “Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State, allegedly committed by a father and son,” Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said at a news conference. “These are the alleged actions of those who have aligned themselves with a terrorist organisation, not a religion.” Police also said the vehicle which is registered to the younger male contained improvised explosive devices and two homemade flags associated with ISIS, or Islamic State, a militant group designated by Australia and many other countries as a terrorist organisation. The father and son allegedly fired upon hundreds of people at the festival during a roughly 10-minute killing spree at one of Australia’s top tourist destinations, forcing people to flee and take shelter before both were shot by police.

      "title_orig": "Lawmakers grill Trump officials on US alleged drug boat strikes",
      "summary_orig": "Donald Trump’s top national security officials faced a grilling from lawmakers Tuesday on US strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific — operations that have raised alarms about escalating military force near Venezuela. The House and Senate briefings, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, came amid mounting unease in Congress over the president’s widening campaign in waters off Latin America, and as lawmakers weigh measures to curb Trump’s authority to act without their approval. US officials say the operations target narcotics bound for American shores. Critics counter that the campaign — which has destroyed at least 26 boats and killed at least 95 people, according to US military figures — is legally ambiguous and strategically unclear. The classified sessions preceded a possible Senate vote on resolutions aimed at restricting Trump from launching military action against Venezuela without congressional consent. But Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters as he left the room that the officials had offered nothing new. “The administration came to this briefing empty handed… and if they can’t be transparent on this, how can you trust their transparency on all the other issues swirling about in the Caribbean?” Schumer said. The boat strikes have drawn particular scrutiny over a September 2 operation in which US forces carried out a follow-up attack on a disabled boat, killing two survivors of the initial strike. Lawmakers from both parties have demanded answers on the legal basis for that attack and why Congress has been denied full access to video footage, which so far has been shown only to a handful of senior lawmakers. Schumer has warned that secrecy – combined with the presence of US troops and a carrier group in the region — risked dragging the country into another open-ended conflict. He told reporters he reiterated the demand for every senator to be given access to the complete, unedited tape of the September 2 strike but was rebuffed. ‘Highly successful mission’ Rubio and Hegseth defended the “highly successful mission” as they left the briefing, and said the Pentagon would allow the House and Senate Armed Services Committees to view the video alongside the commander who ordered them, Admiral Frank Bradley. “But, in keeping with longstanding… Department of Defense policy, we’re not going to release a top secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public,” Hegseth added. Beyond the boat strikes, the administration has ratcheted up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro — deepening sanctions, deploying warships and aircraft near his coastline and seizing an oil tanker linked to Caracas. Trump has declared that Maduro’s “days are numbered” and pointedly refused to rule out a US ground invasion. Legal experts say the case highlights a central tension in Trump’s approach — that treating drug trafficking as an act of war may violate international law. This week, Trump signed an executive order classifying fentanyl — which is stocked and administered by hospitals — as a “weapon of mass destruction,” an escalation supporters say reflects the gravity of the opioid crisis. Specialists note, however, that most of the intercepted boats were believed to be carrying cocaine, not fentanyl. Despite mounting scrutiny, the campaign shows no sign of slowing. On Monday, the Pentagon said it had carried out fresh strikes against alleged drug boats in the Pacific, killing eight people described as “narco-terrorists.” The Senate briefing also follows last week’s dramatic US seizure of an oil tanker accused of transporting sanctioned Venezuelan fuel in a network linked to Iran. Republican senator and staunch Trump ally Lindsey Graham said as he emerged from his briefing that the video was the least of his concerns, asserting that the September 2 strike was lawful. “Most Americans want to know what’s going to happen next. I want to know what’s going to happen next. Is it the policy to take Maduro down? It should be, if it’s not. And if he goes, what’s going to happen next?”",

      "title_orig": "Afghan health minister reaches New Delhi for official visit",
      "summary_orig": "Afghanistan’s Minister for Public Health Noor Jalal Jalali on Tuesday reached the Indian capital of New Delhi on an official visit, the country’s health ministry said. The visit marks the third by an Afghan official in the last three months, after Afghanistan’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Industry Minister Nooruddin Azizi visited New Delhi. “The multi-day visit aims to strengthen bilateral health cooperation, promote the exchange of experience, and coordinate joint efforts,” said the Afghan health ministry. According to the statement, Jalali is to hold separate meetings with Indian officials, particularly health authorities, and take part in several organised programmes. “Discussions will also focus on capacity-building opportunities for Afghan health workers, the import of quality medicines into Afghanistan, medical equipment, and other related issues,” it said. The visit comes after the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan barred the traders from importing pharmaceutical goods from Pakistan. Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, confirmed the visit and extended a warm welcome to the Afghan delegation. “The visit reflects India’s enduring support for Afghanistan’s healthcare system, and we look forward to productive discussions,” he said. As Kabul’s relations with Islamabad deteriorated, the Taliban regime has sought closer ties with New Delhi. The main issue between Islamabad and Kabul remains cross-border terrorism, with numerous attacks originating from Afghanistan and targeting security forces in Pakistan. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism and stop providing sanctuary to the TTP, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.

      "summary_en": "Afghanistan’s Minister for Public Health Noor Jalal Jalali on Tuesday reached the Indian capital of New Delhi on an official visit, the country’s health ministry said. The visit marks the third by an Afghan official in the last three months, after Afghanistan’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Industry Minister Nooruddin Azizi visited New Delhi. “The multi-day visit aims to strengthen bilateral health cooperation, promote the exchange of experience, and coordinate joint efforts,” said the Afghan health ministry. According to the statement, Jalali is to hold separate meetings with Indian officials, particularly health authorities, and take part in several organised programmes. “Discussions will also focus on capacity-building opportunities for Afghan health workers, the import of quality medicines into Afghanistan, medical equipment, and other related issues,” it said. The visit comes after the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan barred the traders from importing pharmaceutical goods from Pakistan. Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, confirmed the visit and extended a warm welcome to the Afghan delegation. “The visit reflects India’s enduring support for Afghanistan’s healthcare system, and we look forward to productive discussions,” he said. As Kabul’s relations with Islamabad deteriorated, the Taliban regime has sought closer ties with New Delhi. The main issue between Islamabad and Kabul remains cross-border terrorism, with numerous attacks originating from Afghanistan and targeting security forces in Pakistan. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism and stop providing sanctuary to the TTP, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.

      "summary_orig": "All 20 passengers abducted from a bus by Katcha area dacoits near Ubauro in Sindh’s Ghotki district have been recovered unharmed, the Sukkur Range Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) said later on Tuesday. Around 25 dacoits had attacked the bus in Sadiqabad on Monday night and kidnapped several passengers after injuring the driver. DIG Sukkur Range, Captain (retired) Faisal Abdullah Chachar, told Dawn that he reached Ghotki and led a large contingent of police personnel from different stations in Ghotki, Sukkur, Khairpur and Kashmore, along with Rangers officials. DIG Chachar led the joint operation with other senior officers, including Ghotki Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Muhammad Anwar Khetran, Sukkur SSP Azhar Khan Mughal and Khairpur SSP Samiullah Soomro. “We rescued all hostages unharmed from the clutches of the dacoits, with whom we engaged in a gunfight,” the DIG said. All routes leading to the Katcha area were blocked in time by police, preventing the dacoits from taking the hostages deeper into the riverine area. Meanwhile, the rescued hostages informed the police that two dacoits were injured during the operation. When the police engaged the dacoits, a police constable sustained injuries to his hand. Police moved the wounded personnel to Rahim Yar Khan Hospital for treatment. A police spokesperson confirmed to Dawn that a search operation against the dacoits is still ongoing. When contacted by Dawn , the Rahim Yar Khan district police officer, said that the passengers were not kidnapped in his jurisdiction but from a section of the link road going through Guddu in Sindh. “Sindh police have recovered all the hostages from the clutches of the armed dacoits,” he said. Mirpur Mathelo Deputy Superintendent of Police Abdul Qadir Soomro told Dawn that earlier today, 14 passengers were initially recovered by the police; however, one of them died of a heart attack in a sugarcane field. “The body of the deceased hostage was moved to Ubauro Hospital, while and two injured hostages were moved to the hospital for medical treatment,” he said. An earlier statement from DIG Chachar said that 10 of the kidnapped passengers had been rescued in an initial overnight operation under his command. The attack According to some videos shared on social media after 9:30pm on Monday, a passenger said a Sadabahar Company coach departed for Quetta from Sadiqabad at 8pm. When it reached near the Murid Shaikh area near M-5 Motorway, it took a turn towards Guddu at the Punjab-Sindh border. Some 65kms from the area, the dacoits intercepted the coach and started firing. They entered the bus after smashing the windows and asked the passengers to leave the coach, but did not harm the female passengers. Katcha is the area of land running along the Indus River, which is divided between Punjab and Sindh. The region is notorious for banditry. For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets, brutal killings and robberies on major highways occur frequently. PTI leader’s condemnation PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, in a statement, condemned Monday night’s incident and called into question the efficiency of Sindh and Punjab police. “More than twenty citizens were kidnapped; now their bids will be put up,” he said, stressing that the rulers were “failing” to protect their citizens. He noted that Katcha areas had been declared “no-go” areas. Sheikh called for the immediate release of all the hostages.",

      "summary_orig": "The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and the All Pakistan Newspaper Employees Confederation (Apnec) on Tuesday condemned the ban on government advertisements to the Dawn Media Group and its outlets and lamented the attack on freedom of expression. The HRCP expressed grave concern over the “rapidly shrinking space for independent and critical news reporting in the country”, including the ban on government advertisements to the Dawn Media Group and its outlets. The development comes as several media bodies have condemned the government’s unannounced restriction on advertisements to Dawn Media Group’s TV and radio outlets — imposed after curtailing ads to its flagship newspaper — and called on the authorities to immediately rescind the ban. “The HRCP expresses grave concern over the rapidly shrinking space for independent and critical news reporting in the country, including the reported 13-month ban on government advertisements to the Dawn Media Group, which has recently been extended to Dawn News and CityFM89,” the commission said in a post on social media platform X on Tuesday. “This is ironic, given that Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Dawn, championed press freedom,” it said. The commission added that the selective withdrawal of state advertising, which constituted public funds, had increasingly been used as a “coercive instrument to pressure media organisations, influence editorial choices and penalise critical journalism”. “We reiterate that freedom of expression and democratic accountability cannot survive where economic coercion is used to discipline the press,” it said. The HRCP also urged the government to end such “discriminatory practices and restore an enabling environment for free, independent and responsible journalism”. ‘Economic murder’ The All Pakistan Newspaper Employees Confederation (Apnec) has condemned the banning of advertisements in media outlets as the ‘economic murder’ of media employees and urged the government to stop targeting Dawn. While addressing a meeting, Apnec Secretary-General Asghar Khan strongly condemned the closure of Dawn Media Group’s advertisements and demanded that the practice be stopped immediately and that advertisements be distributed according to merit and law “Ban on Dawn newspaper advertisement would be considered an attack on freedom of the press.” “Apnec fully believes in freedom of expression and democracy and has always fought against brutality and undemocratic tactics in media houses in the past,” he added. The chairman of the confederation, Shakeel Yamin Kanga, termed the closure of advertisements as an economic murder of media employees and an attack on freedom of expression and said that the government should not play with the lives of media workers. “All Pakistan Newspaper Employees Confederation stands with its colleagues in this difficult time,” he said. The confederation also pledged that if the government did not take any action, there would be a nationwide protest. Last week, the Council of Newspaper Editors (CPNE) said Dawn was among Pakistan’s most respected media outlets, and stopping the release of government ads to the group amounted to financially crippling the organisation. The All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) also spoke out against the stoppage of government ads to the group’s outlets, saying it was “dismayed”. The Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) slammed the ban on ads for Dawn Media Group outlets as well, saying it had always resisted “using advertising as tools to control media and free expression”. The Joint Action Co­­mmittee (JAC), comprising re­­presentatives of multiple journalist bodies, also criticised the restriction, saying the government was using official advertising as a tool to pressure media organisations. Earlier this year, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) noted in its ‘Islamabad Declaration’ that Dawn has been denied advertisements by the federal and Punjab governments since October 2024 “because of its professional and critical approach in reporting and editorials”. This was not the only way in which authorities have tried to obstruct Dawn ’s reporting — after the so-called ‘ Dawn Leaks ’ saga, the paper’s circulation was blocked in large parts of the country, especially the cantonment areas.",

      "title_orig": "Nation firm, united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism, says PM Shehbaz on 11th anniversary of APS attack",
      "summary_orig": "In a message on the 11th anniversary of the Army Public School (APS) attack, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said the nation stood firm and united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism. In the deadliest terror attack in the country’s history, at least 144 people ─ mostly schoolchildren ─ were killed when heavily armed militants stormed the army-run public school on Dec 16, 2014. Seven soldiers of the Special Services Group and two officers were among the wounded. In a message posted on his X account, PM Shehbaz said, “Today, we commemorate the martyrs of the APS Peshawar tragedy — the innocent children, teachers and staff whose sacrifice is forever etched in our national conscience. “Their sacrifice remains a constant reminder of our collective responsibility to defeat terrorism,” the premier stressed. “The Pakistani nation will always stand united, firm and unwavering in its resolve to eradicate the scourge of terrorism,” he added, praying for the families of the martyrs. In his message, President Asif Ali Zardari remembered the sacrifices of the children and the staff, vowing to stand with the families of the martyrs. “Today, we remember the innocent children and staff of the Army Public School whose lives were taken in the brutal terrorist attack on December 16, 2014,” he said in a message posted by his spokesperson on X. “Their sacrifice remains a solemn reminder of the heavy price our nation has paid in the fight against terrorism,” the president said. He vowed to stand with the families “who continue to bear this pain with courage”. “The nation will always honour the resilience of the APS families who transformed their grief into strength for Pakistan,” he stressed. He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to eliminating terrorism, stating that the country’s resolve remained “absolute”. “There can be no soft corner for terrorists or those who support, finance, shelter or justify them,” he said, emphasising that “there can be no negotiations with those who raise arms against the state or target our children”. “We strongly condemn Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan,” he went on to say. The evidence of its involvement in efforts to destabilise our country is well documented. Pakistan will continue to expose these hostile activities and will defend its people with full resolve,” he said. The president warned terrorists’ “apologists, facilitators, and supporters” that the armed forces will not “spare them and will defeat terrorism, no matter what political, ideological or fake religious garb they try to shroud themselves in”. President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence services “whose efforts have prevented many such tragedies.” “We will continue to pursue every terrorist and every facilitator until justice is done,” he added. “The memory of the APS martyrs strengthens our resolve. Pakistan will never allow the enemies of peace to succeed,” the president concluded. The Foreign Office (FO) also issued statement, saying: “On the anniversary of the heinous terrorist attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan solemnly remembers the innocent children and teachers who were martyred in an act of sheer inhumanity. “Their sacrifice stands as an enduring symbol of the nation’s resolve to confront and defeat terrorism in all its forms.” The statement added that “this tragic anniversary underscores the continuing urgency of eradicating the menace of terrorism”. It highlighted that Pakistan had been among the hardest-hit countries in this fight, having lost more than 90,000 lives and borne immense economic and social costs. “These sacrifices remain an enduring reminder of Pakistan’s frontline role and unwavering commitment to counterterrorism.” The statement further said that Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies had a role in saving “countless precious lives — not only of Pakistanis, but also of people across the region and beyond”. The country’s security forces and law enforcement agencies continued to take decisive and effective action against terrorist groups, the statement said, adding that at the same time, “Pakistan faces a persistent threat from terrorist elements operating from across the border, with sustained support from our adversaries”. “We have consistently drawn attention to this challenge and have taken resolute measures to prevent terrorism from spilling over into our territory. “In doing so, Pakistan has acted as a bulwark against the spread of terrorism beyond its borders, contributing significantly to the security and stability of the wider region and beyond. “This unrefuted reality underscores the urgent need for concrete action to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries and to cut off all forms of support to all terrorist groups, including those targeting Pakistan,” the statement said. It added: “As we honor the martyrs of APS, Pakistan reaffirms its unshakeable resolve to protect its people, defend its sovereignty, and pursue its vision of lasting peace through unity, resilience, and an uncompromising stance against terrorism —irrespective of its origin.”",

      "summary_en": "In a message on the 11th anniversary of the Army Public School (APS) attack, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said the nation stood firm and united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism. In the deadliest terror attack in the country’s history, at least 144 people ─ mostly schoolchildren ─ were killed when heavily armed militants stormed the army-run public school on Dec 16, 2014. Seven soldiers of the Special Services Group and two officers were among the wounded. In a message posted on his X account, PM Shehbaz said, “Today, we commemorate the martyrs of the APS Peshawar tragedy — the innocent children, teachers and staff whose sacrifice is forever etched in our national conscience. “Their sacrifice remains a constant reminder of our collective responsibility to defeat terrorism,” the premier stressed. “The Pakistani nation will always stand united, firm and unwavering in its resolve to eradicate the scourge of terrorism,” he added, praying for the families of the martyrs. In his message, President Asif Ali Zardari remembered the sacrifices of the children and the staff, vowing to stand with the families of the martyrs. “Today, we remember the innocent children and staff of the Army Public School whose lives were taken in the brutal terrorist attack on December 16, 2014,” he said in a message posted by his spokesperson on X. “Their sacrifice remains a solemn reminder of the heavy price our nation has paid in the fight against terrorism,” the president said. He vowed to stand with the families “who continue to bear this pain with courage”. “The nation will always honour the resilience of the APS families who transformed their grief into strength for Pakistan,” he stressed. He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to eliminating terrorism, stating that the country’s resolve remained “absolute”. “There can be no soft corner for terrorists or those who support, finance, shelter or justify them,” he said, emphasising that “there can be no negotiations with those who raise arms against the state or target our children”. “We strongly condemn Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan,” he went on to say. The evidence of its involvement in efforts to destabilise our country is well documented. Pakistan will continue to expose these hostile activities and will defend its people with full resolve,” he said. The president warned terrorists’ “apologists, facilitators, and supporters” that the armed forces will not “spare them and will defeat terrorism, no matter what political, ideological or fake religious garb they try to shroud themselves in”. President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence services “whose efforts have prevented many such tragedies.” “We will continue to pursue every terrorist and every facilitator until justice is done,” he added. “The memory of the APS martyrs strengthens our resolve. Pakistan will never allow the enemies of peace to succeed,” the president concluded. The Foreign Office (FO) also issued statement, saying: “On the anniversary of the heinous terrorist attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan solemnly remembers the innocent children and teachers who were martyred in an act of sheer inhumanity. “Their sacrifice stands as an enduring symbol of the nation’s resolve to confront and defeat terrorism in all its forms.” The statement added that “this tragic anniversary underscores the continuing urgency of eradicating the menace of terrorism”. It highlighted that Pakistan had been among the hardest-hit countries in this fight, having lost more than 90,000 lives and borne immense economic and social costs. “These sacrifices remain an enduring reminder of Pakistan’s frontline role and unwavering commitment to counterterrorism.” The statement further said that Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies had a role in saving “countless precious lives — not only of Pakistanis, but also of people across the region and beyond”. The country’s security forces and law enforcement agencies continued to take decisive and effective action against terrorist groups, the statement said, adding that at the same time, “Pakistan faces a persistent threat from terrorist elements operating from across the border, with sustained support from our adversaries”. “We have consistently drawn attention to this challenge and have taken resolute measures to prevent terrorism from spilling over into our territory. “In doing so, Pakistan has acted as a bulwark against the spread of terrorism beyond its borders, contributing significantly to the security and stability of the wider region and beyond. “This unrefuted reality underscores the urgent need for concrete action to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries and to cut off all forms of support to all terrorist groups, including those targeting Pakistan,” the statement said. It added: “As we honor the martyrs of APS, Pakistan reaffirms its unshakeable resolve to protect its people, defend its sovereignty, and pursue its vision of lasting peace through unity, resilience, and an uncompromising stance against terrorism —irrespective of its origin.”",

      "summary_orig": "At least two people, including a constable, were killed after unidentified assailants attacked a polio team in the Salarzai tehsil of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, the police said, as the nationwide polio campaign entered its second day. The attack comes a day after the government launched the final polio campaign of 2025, which is set to run until December 21. Public Relations Officer (PRO) police, Israr Khan, confirmed to Dawn that two people, including a passerby and a policeman guarding the polio team, were killed in the attack on Tuesday afternoon in the Thangi area of Salarzai. Khan identified the martyred cop as Constable Sajad Ahmed, who passed away after sustaining critical injuries, while another civilian was “shot dead by the armed men when he attempted to chase after the assailants.” “Local residents also confirmed the account, while the assailants managed to escape,” Khan said, adding that the police had launched a search operation. He also confirmed that no polio workers were harmed in the incident. Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed, and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in KP. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack, extending condolences to the families of the deceased, according to a statement posted on X by his digital media spokesperson. “Polio workers and the security personnel assigned to protect them are performing their national responsibility,” KP CM was quoted as saying. He termed the incident “an assault on humanity and national responsibility”. He vowed that the “campaign will not be allowed to be impacted in any way”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack, expressing grief over the death of the police constable, state broadcaster PTV reported. He vowed to “bring the perpetrators to justice,” stressing that the campaign will continue until the virus is eradicated from the country. The premier also prayed for the “speedy recovery of the injured”. In October, a Levies constable deployed for the security of a polio team was killed when unidentified assailants opened fire on him in Swat. According to official data cited in a November 9 report, a total of 96 people had been killed by alleged terrorists in KP since 2012 until then, including 61 policemen, 27 health workers and five civilians. Also, 170 people, including 124 policemen, 28 health workers and 21 civilians, had been injured in attacks on polio teams. During this period, 32 health workers, three civilians and one policeman were kidnapped during vaccination campaigns. Of the people who were subjected to violence in the shape of death, injuries and kidnapping, 283 were men and 18 women. Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases this year, with the highest number of cases in KP at 19. Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts. Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.",

      "summary_orig": "Flowers were laid on Tuesday in front of the shuttered shop of Ahmed al Ahmed, the 43-year-old tobacco shop owner who locals hailed as the Bondi hero after he wrestled a gun from one of the attackers during a mass shooting on Sydney’s Bondi Beach. Ahmed was identified on social media as the bystander who hid behind parked cars before charging at the gunman from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. The act saved several lives, authorities have said. View this post on Instagram “I think he’s a role model for us all and it really encompasses the Aussie spirit and I’m incredibly proud to live in the area and I think everybody is, it blows me away, absolutely blows me away,” said Adam Pogorzelski, a local resident in Ahmed’s neighbourhood, in the suburb of Sutherland, about 26 kilometres from the centre of Sydney. Ahmed, a father of two, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited him earlier on Tuesday and told media that Ahmed will undergo more surgery. Ahmed has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump who said Ahmed was “a very, very brave person” who saved many lives. A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$2 million. A 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son allegedly carried out the attack at a Jewish celebration on Sunday afternoon, killing 15 people in the country’s worst mass shooting in almost 30 years. “I was actually proud when I saw it, I thought to myself, wow is that Ahmed, because I know him, then I looked at it twice and then I realised it was him …,” said a 20-year-old worker at a neighbouring chemist who did not wish to be named.“What he did was unbelievable.”",

      "summary_orig": "The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday ordered the trial court hearing the controversial social media posts case against rights activist Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha to record witnesses’ statements afresh within three days. IHC’s Justice Mohammed Azam Khan passed the directives while hearing a petition filed by Mazari challenging the trial court’s November 19 order, when the court had recorded the testimonies of all prosecution witnesses. Chattha had appeared before the court while Imaan’s lawyers had marked her presence. The court, however, had ordered the prosecution to proceed with the witnesses’ testimonies. On Tuesday, IHC’s Justice Khan observed that witnesses’ statements should be recorded again and said that the case was being referred back to the trial court without touching its merits. During the hearing, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad told the court that senior advocate Faisal Siddiqui had submitted his power of attorney but was busy with cases in Lahore, seeking a hearing after court vacations. He also pointed out that the Supreme Court (SC) had directed an early decision in the matter, though no specific timeframe was fixed. Last week, the apex court had stayed trial proceedings against the two until their pending appeals were decided by the IHC. Meanwhile, the prosecutor, Raja Naveed, maintained that the complete record was available before the court. Azad then argued that the accused were entitled to full protection under Article 10A (right to a fair trial) of the Constitution and raised the objection that the record had not been properly provided. He contended that the issue had been raised at the previous hearing as well. During the hearing, the court also questioned whether the statement of the four witnesses had been recorded in the absence of one of the accused. At this, the prosecutor responded by saying that the conduct of the accused was also a relevant factor. Defence counsel Azad insisted that witness statements must be recorded in the presence of the accused and sought time until Monday. Subsequently, the court issued directives to the trial court. The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca). The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.",

South Australia state Premier Peter Malinauskas said extra measures would be in place for the Ashes clash that starts on Wednesday, although there was no intelligence pointing to an elevated threat level. “Given the events that have occurred in Sydney, there will be additional protocols put in place at Adelaide Oval,” he said late Monday. “This is done only as a precautionary measure, but it is appropriate that we are in an increasing sense of alertness just at the moment.” An attack by a father and son on a Jewish celebration at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on Sunday killed 15 people with dozens injured. One of the assailants was killed, while the other is in a critical condition in hospital. South Australia Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said special security-response police, armed with rifles, would be present in and around the Adelaide Oval during the Test. “There’s a balance between the concern about police officers carrying rifles in and about the community, balanced with the need for us to be able to effectively respond to an event, should an event occur and these officers are specifically trained for that purpose,” he said. “There’s no intelligence at this time to indicate that there are any increased levels of threat or security risks around the cricket or any other community event,” he said. Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board released a joint statement to pay tribute to the Bondi Beach victims, saying they were “horrified”. “All of our thoughts are with the victims, their friends and families, the Jewish community and the people of Australia at this deeply distressing time,” they said. “Our condolences go out to all those affected.” There will be a moment of silence observed before the Test and players from both sides will wear black armbands. “While sport can seem insignificant at times like this, we have the unusual opportunity to bring millions of people together to pay tribute, to console and to contemplate what we want our nation to be,” said Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg. “We will continue to look at ways cricket can support and honour those who have been affected by the Bondi shootings and thank those who provided assistance during and since this tragedy.”",

      "summary_orig": "GWADAR: A large group of armed men looted millions of rupees from three private banks while counter-terrorism department (CTD) personnel along with local police foiled two other bank robberies after heavy gun battle in Panjgur on Monday. A CTD official and a civilian lost their lives and three other police personnel injured in a heavy exchange of fire took place as the armed robbers atte­mpted to loot two other banks, including National Bank of Pakistan, in Chitkan Bazaar. Officials said over 50 heavily armed men arrived in the area in several vehicles and barged into three banks in the main bazaar area and looted millions of rupees after holding the security guards and staff hostage at gun point. After looting three private banks, the armed men then attempted to enter the NBP and another bank. In the meantime, officials said, police and CTD personnel reached the site and challenged them. Police claim to have foiled two more bank heists “Armed men used heavy weapons in the gun battle and lobbed grenades, which continued for at least an hour,” SSP Dost Muhammad Bugti said, adding police and CTD officials returned fire. During the exchange of fire, the CTD official, Dura Baloch, and the civilian, Amanullah, emb­r­aced martyrdom and three other cops suffered injuries, while armed robbers fled, police said. “The armed men belonged to a banned militant organisation,” an official of the local administration said on the condition of anonymity. According to some media reports, armed men looted around Rs190 million from three banks. Security officials said that an operation was launched in the area to trace out the armed gang. However, no arrest was reported till filing of this report on late Monday night. Eyewitness account said the bodies and injured were shifted to Panjgur district hospital. Two CTD and police personnel were shifted to Karachi as they rece­ived serious injuries, they said. While lauding the timely and courageous response of the law enforcement personnel, Baloch­istan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said CTD and police personnel demonstrated exceptional bravery and professionalism in safeguarding the lives and property of citizens. The chief minister paid tribute to martyred CTD constable Dura Baloch, saluting his courage, sense of duty, and supreme sacrifice. He said the sacrifices of brave sons like Dara Khan would never be forgotten and that the nation remains indebted to the blood of its martyrs. Expressing heartfelt condolences to the family of the martyred civilian, the chief minister prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the deceased. He reiterated that there was no place for terrorists and criminal elements in Balochistan and vowed that the state would continue operations against anti-state elements with full force. Mr Bugti emphasised the sacrifices of security forces for the restoration of peace and order would not go in vain and assured that the protection of life and property of the people would be ensured at all costs.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump sued the BBC on Monday for defamation over edited clips of a speech that made it appear he directed supporters to storm the US Capitol , opening an international front in his fight against media coverage he deems untrue or unfair. Trump accused Britain’s publicly owned broadcaster of defaming him by splicing together parts of a January 6, 2021 speech, including one section where he told supporters to march on the Capitol and another where he said “fight like hell”. It omitted a section in which he called for peaceful protest. Trump’s lawsuit alleges the BBC defamed him and violated a Florida law that bars deceptive and unfair trade practices. He is seeking $5 billion in damages for each of the lawsuit’s two counts. The BBC has apologised to Trump, admitted an error of judgment and acknowledged that the edit gave the mistaken impression that he had made a direct call for violent action. But it has said there is no legal basis to sue. Trump, in his lawsuit filed on Monday in Miami federal court, said the BBC despite its apology “has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses”. The BBC is funded through a mandatory license fee on all TV viewers, which UK lawyers say could make any payout to Trump politically fraught. A spokesman for Trump’s legal team said in a statement the BBC “has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda”. A BBC spokesperson told Reuters earlier on Monday that it had “no further contact from President Trump’s lawyers at this point. Our position remains the same.” The broadcaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the lawsuit was filed. Crisis led to resignations Facing one of the biggest crises in its 103-year history, the BBC has said it has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any of its platforms. The dispute over the clip, featured on the BBC’s ‘Panorama’ documentary show shortly before the 2024 presidential election, sparked a public relations crisis for the broadcaster, leading to the resignations of its two most senior officials. Trump’s lawyers say the BBC caused him overwhelming reputational and financial harm. The documentary drew scrutiny after the leak of a BBC memo by an external standards adviser that raised concerns about how it was edited, part of a wider investigation of political bias at the publicly funded broadcaster. The documentary was not broadcast in the United States. Trump may have sued in the US because defamation claims in Britain must be brought within a year of publication, a window that has closed for the ‘Panorama’ episode. To overcome the US constitution’s legal protections for free speech and the press, Trump will need to prove not only that the edit was false and defamatory but also that the BBC knowingly misled viewers or acted recklessly. The broadcaster could argue that the documentary was substantially true and its editing decisions did not create a false impression, legal experts said. It could also claim the program did not damage Trump’s reputation. Other media have settled with Trump, including CBS and ABC when Trump sued them following his comeback win in the November 2024 election. Trump has filed lawsuits against the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal and a newspaper in Iowa, all three of which have denied wrongdoing. The attack on the US Capitol in January 2021 was aimed at blocking Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s presidential win over Trump in the 2020 US election.",
