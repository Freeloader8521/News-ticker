      "summary_orig": "A proposal to introduce a so-called “sugar tax” on products with excessive sugar content is once again gaining traction in South Korea. Advocates argue that such a policy is needed to curb rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases linked to sugar overconsumption. The goal is to reduce the social and economic costs of these health risks and use the tax revenue to fund public health initiatives, particularly for low-income communities. At the forefront of the debate is Yun Young-ho, head of the Health Culture Project at Seoul National University and a professor of family medicine at the university’s College of Medicine. Yun hosted a “Sugar Overuse Tax Forum” at the National Assembly Sept. 24, where he highlighted the urgent need for a sugar tax. “One in three adolescents in Korea consumes more sugar than the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommended daily limit of 50 grams for adults,” Yun said. “Added sugars in soft drinks contribute to cavities, obesity, diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.” Because of these risks, WHO now recommends",

      "summary_orig": "Eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Wednesday. A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that last night, security forces conducted an IBO in Orakzai district on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij . Fitna Al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of operation, 19 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the ISPR said. It added that during the exchange of fire, 39-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq, who was leading his troops from the front, and his second-in-command, 33-year-old Major Tayyab Rahat, embraced martyrdom along with nine of their men. The soldiers were identified as 38-year-old Naib Subedar Azam Gul, 35-year-old Naik Adil Hussain, 34-year-old Naik Gul Ameer, 31-year-old Lance Naik Sher Khan, 32-year-old Lance Naik Talish Faraz, 32-year-old Lance Naik Irshad Hussain, 28-year-old Sepoy Tufail Khan, 23-year-old Sepoy Aqib Ali and 24-year-old Sepoy Muhammad Zahid. The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area. It further stated that security forces were “determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve”. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif paid tributes to the country’s security forces for killing 19 terrorists and also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the soldiers, including Lieutenant Colonel Arif and Major Rahat, according to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office. “The sacrifices of the fearless sons of security forces will never go in vain,” he said. “We will crush the nefarious intentions of Indian-backed terrorists. We will not allow elements that harm Pakistan’s integrity to succeed,” he added. PM Shehbaz said the government was determined to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country. A statement issued by the presidency said President Asif Ali Zardari had paid tributes to the “courageous action of security forces in the Orakzai district”. It added, “[The] president expressed satisfaction over the elimination of 19 terrorists of the Indian-backed khawarij . The President declared Lt. Col. Junaid Tariq shaheed, Major Tayyab Rahat and other martyrs as heroes of the nation,” the statement read. It added that Zardari expressed heartfelt sympathy with the families of the martyrs, praying that they bear their loss with patience and courage. The president said that the brave sons set an eternal example by sacrificing their lives while defending their country. “The sacrifices of the martyrs are a symbol of the nation’s resolve and unity.” He reiterated the “resolve to completely eliminate Indian-backed terrorism from the soil of Pakistan”. “The entire nation stands as a lead wall with its armed forces,” the statement quoted him as saying. A statement issued by the PPP said party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the 11 security personnel and paid them tributes. The statement posted on the PPP’s X account said Bilawal extended condolences to the families of the martyred and expressed solidarity with them. “Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the martyrs,” the statement said, adding that he reaffirmed his “unwavering support for the security forces during the ongoing operation for the elimination of terrorists”. National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, expressing grief over the martyrdom of the security personnel and paying tributes to them, reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate the threat of terrorism, state-run APP reported. “The sacrifices of our armed forces and security personnel in the war against terrorism will never go in vain. Terrorist […] will never succeed in fulfilling their nefarious designs,” the APP quoted him as saying. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Two reports , issued last week by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.",

      "summary_orig": "A local journalist, Tufail Rind, was shot dead by unidentified armed men in the Mirpur Mathelo area of Sindh’s Ghotki district on Wednesday morning, according to the police. The attack took place when he was on his way to drop his children off at school. According to a police press release, the shooting occurred on the Jerwar Road near Maso Wah, where the assailants riding a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire at his car. “Rind died on the spot, while his children miraculously escaped unharmed,” the police said. Witnesses added that the attackers fled the scene after the assault, spreading panic across the area. The police later transported the body to the District Headquarters Hospital of Mirpur Mathelo for medico-legal formalities. The police statement said that upon receiving the information, Ghotki’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anwar Khetran immediately reached the crime scene, inspected the site, and met with the victim’s family, issuing “strict orders to the concerned officers for prompt action”. “The SSP Ghotki assured the victim’s family that all individuals involved in the murder would be arrested soon and brought to justice,” the statement added. The police said that multiple angles are being investigated and evidence is being collected to determine the motive behind the attack. According to a relative of the victim, Rind was associated with Mehran Newspaper and Royal News , and also served as an office-bearer of the Mirpur Mathelo Press Club. He had survived an earlier assassination attempt in which he had requested security from the local administration, but no effective measures were taken. SSP Khetran confirmed in a statement that Rind had complained a few months ago about an incident of gunfire at his home, saying that police had made arrests at that time. “We also arrested one person in connection with that on Oct. 4 (Saturday),” he added. “Rind was in contact with us and appreciated that the arrests were made.” A few hours after the murder, another tragedy struck when Rind’s eight-year-old niece fainted upon hearing the news of the killing. She was rushed to Mirpur Mathelo Hospital and later referred to Sukkur due to her critical condition, but died on the way. Her body was handed over to the family after medico-legal procedures. Suspects arrested Ghotki’s SSP Khetran has said that two suspects have already been arrested in connection with Rind’s murder. “The slain journalist had a dispute with members of his own community for the past four years, during which two people had previously been killed,” said SSP Khetran. He said that individuals from both sides of the rival groups were already in jail, and that this was the third murder linked to the same dispute. “All those involved in the murder of journalist Tufail Rind will be arrested,” the SSP added. Sindh’s Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and sought an urgent report from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon. In his statement, the chief minister said, “Attacks on journalists are attacks on press freedom, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.” Murad directed the police to conduct an impartial investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest. He also expressed condolences to the victim’s family and assured them that justice would be ensured. Locals in Ghotki and Mirpur Mathelo described Rind as a courageous journalist who always stood for the downtrodden. His funeral was attended by a large number of citizens, journalists, and political leaders. Condemnations pour in Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also condemned the killing, calling it a “tragic and deplorable incident”. He said the Sindh government stood with the bereaved family, adding, “Such attacks are equivalent to assaults on freedom of expression.“ Deputy Parliamentary Leader of Sindh Assembly and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) Pakistan’s representative, Taha Ahmed Khan, strongly condemned the “brutal murder”. In a statement, Khan said that MQM Pakistan stood in solidarity with Rind’s family as well as with the journalist community during this difficult time. Sindh Government Spokesperson and Mayor of Sukkur, Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh, expressed sorrow and regret over the incident, calling it highly condemnable. “Attacks on journalists are actually tantamount to attacks on freedom of expression, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Mayor Sukkur said in a statement. Journalist, press associations demand justice Rind’s murder sparked widespread grief and anger across the journalist community in Pakistan. Journalists across Sindh staged protests, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits and the introduction of effective laws to protect journalists. The protests included a sit-in observed in front of the SSP’s office. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Karachi Press Club, Hyderabad Union of Journalists, Umerkot Press Club, Ghotki Press Club, and Mirpur Mathelo Press Club jointly condemned the killing, saying, “Another voice has been silenced — punished for speaking the truth.” They urged the Sindh government to provide financial and legal assistance to Rind’s family and to formulate a clear security policy for journalists to prevent further bloodshed. PFUJ’s Vice President Akbar Jafri said in a statement that the incidents of attacks, threats, kidnappings and brutal killings of journalists across the country were “clear evidence of the complete failure and indifference of the government and administration”. He said that Rind’s murder was “proof that there is no effective policy for the protection of journalists across the country, including Sindh.” Jafri pointed out that Rind had appealed on social media a few days ago regarding the threat to his life, but the government and administration ignored this appeal, which “resulted in the loss of another precious life”. “The journalistic community is united and will continue to struggle for its rights and protection, because remaining silent now will be tantamount to waiting for more sacrifices,” he said. Journalist Mazhar Abbas also posted on X, saying that the killing of journalists was “on rise again in Sindh”. “Following Imtiaz Mir’s murder , another journalist Tufail Rind, has been killed within two weeks,” Abbas said. “Rind’s alleged killer has also shared his confessional statement’s video. This is quite alarming.” Last month, anchorperson Imtiaz Mir was shot and wounded in Karachi’s Malir area, succumbing to his injuries few days later, according to his family and police. Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation . Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists. According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”. In August last year, unknown armed men shot dead another Ghotki journalist, Muhammad Bachal Ghuniyo, who was associated with a private Sindhi TV channel. Another Ghotki journalist, Nasrullah Gadani, who worked for a Sindhi newspaper, was shot at and seriously wounded in an attack in May 2024. He succumbed to fatal injuries at a Karachi hospital three days later.",

      "summary_orig": "The Rawalpindi Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Wednesday issued a bailable arrest warrant for PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, in connection with the party’s November 26 case, dismissing an exemption plea filed by her to appear for a hearing. More than 10,000 PTI supporters surged into the city on Nov 26 last year, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. As the demonstrators inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk, the police and security troops employed intense teargas shelling to disperse them. Aleema was to be indicted in the November 26 protest case registered at Sadiqabad Police Station during today’s hearing, but she did not appear before the court. During the hearing, the prosecutor objected that the person applying on Aleema’s behalf was not her lawyer, and therefore was not authorised to file an application without a power of attorney. On this basis, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah dismissed Aleema’s application for exemption and issued bailable arrest warrants for her. The other 10 suspects in the case appeared in court, while the hearing was adjourned until October 11 (Saturday). Early in September, the Rawalpindi police booked Aleema, party lawyer Naeem Panjutha and 40 other PTI-linked activists for alleged violence against a journalist outside Adiala Jail. In October last year, Aleema, her sister Uzma, and other PTI supporters were arrested from Islamabad’s D-Chowk for clashing with the police and violating Section 144,  a legal provision that restricts gatherings of four or more people in an area to prevent public disorder or unrest. A few days later, they were released from the Jhelum District Jail after a judge granted them bail.",

      "summary_orig": "An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday began its deliberations on the petitioners’ request to form a full court to hear a set of pleas challenging the 26th Amendment . The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy. It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment. The legislation had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The CB is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. It resumed proceedings yesterday after over eight months , and unanimously allowed live-streaming of the case upon some petitioners’ request. The pleas taken up also seek the formation of a full court to hear the matter. Hence, before proceeding further, the court will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB. During today’s hearing, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan requested the formation of a 16-member bench to hear the pleas, as per the number of SC judges at the time of the 26th Amendment. Several judges, including Justice Aminuddin, observed that the 26th Amendment was currently part of the Constitution. Some judges questioned whether the CB had the power to form a full court, while Justice Malik noted there was no restriction on issuing a judicial order for that. The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow. Requests to form a full court bench and to live stream the case dominated yesterday’s hearing, with the state lawyer expressing no objection to live stream the proceedings. The hearing At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Hamid came to the rostrum and said the 26th Amendment was introduced in an “unusual” manner and passed by the parliament at night . Hamid recalled that there were 17 judges present in the SC at the time the legislation was passed, including then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa, who later retired. Therefore, he contended, a 16-judge “full court” bench as of then should hear the pleas and pointed out that all eight judges in the current CB would be part of that bench as they were already serving as SC judges in October last year. As per the SC’s website, there are currently a total of 24 judges in the SC, including CJP Yahya Afridi, after six new judges were appointed in February. “This Amendment is against the very basic features of the Constitution,” he asserted, at which Justice Mandokhail said that the matter will be deliberated upon later and asked him whether the Amendment was currently a part of the Constitution. In response to Hamid’s arguments, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “We depend on the Constitution. Lawyers also depend on the Constitution. Unless the Constitution is [further] amended, we will have to depend on the current Constitution.” Justice Hilali also observed that whether the 26th Amendment was “right or wrong”, the court had not suspended it yet. “You consider the 26th Amendment a part of the Constitution, which is why you have challenged it.” Here, Justice Mazhar noted that the CB was at the moment not considering the main question of the legislation’s legality, but the request for a full court and sought arguments on that. Hamid responded that he was not detailing how the 26th Amendment was unconstitutional, but on the “effects of its powers”. He said it was for the first time after the legislation that the “authority to form benches was taken away from the chief justice”. Noting that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) existed prior to last year’s constitutional tweaks, the LHCBA counsel said the 26th Amendment impacted the JCP’s formation as “judges became a minority” after the number of its members was increased . “After the Amendment, the majority in the Judicial Commission went to the administrative side, which affected judicial independence,” Hamid said. Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Hamid whether he was acknowledging the 26th Amendment or not, the lawyer replied in the negative. At this point during the hearing, Justice Mazhar wondered whether a bench constituted after the 26th Amendment could decide a plea seeking the formation of a full court. Justice Mandokhail, however, remarked that the Amendment was part of the Constitution for now. At Justice Afghan pointing out that Hamid had not specified in his petition that “to whom should the bench send the case”, the lawyer said the matter should be referred to the CJP. Justice Hilali also asked whether the LHCBA counsel had made any request to the authority responsible for constituting the benches. To this, Hamid replied, “We are challenging the bench formation, which was constituted under the influence of the 26th Amendment.” Here, Justice Aminuddin observed, “Right now, [we are] not at such a stage to consider who will hear the case. Possibly, there might be hearings for a month on the matter of who will hear the case,” he added. “On what basis are you saying that we cannot hear the case?” the CB head questioned Hamid, remarking that it was not in the judges’ control to “go back to before the 26th Amendment”. At this point during the hearing, Justice Malik said, “Whether a full court hears or a bench, no one is stopping any judicial order. The process continues after a judicial order. “Where under the 26th Amendment is a full court being barred?” she asked, to which Hamid replied that the legislation did not do so. Justice Malik observed, “When there is a request for forming a bench, we do not question the procedure. We give directions, after which the process is initiated.” Here, Justice Aminuddin wondered under what authority the CB would constitute a full court, following which Justice Malik said there was “no restriction on forming a full court under a judicial order”. “Where in the 26th Amendment is it written that a judicial order cannot be issued? Such is being done in ordinary cases, then why not in this case?” she countered. Justice Afghan again raised the issue of Hamid not mentioning the said request in his petition. Upon Justice Mazhar asking whether the CB could use Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution to issue the order for a full court, Hamid replied in the affirmative. At one point during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the CB was not conceptualised by the SC but by the parliament. When Hamid said the bench should “forget” Article 191A, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the apex court, Justice Aminuddin said if that was forgotten, the SC would not exist anymore. “A full court was always formed whenever questions were raised about the Constitution,” Hamid emphasised. At this, Justice Mandokhail wondered if a “point decided by 17 judges in the past” can be reversed, to which the lawyer replied in the negative. “Will you not be glad if the previous decision is upheld and now a smaller bench hears the case?” the judge asked. However, Justice Afghan noted that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 did not exist in the past. He remarked that CJPs in the past “kept using their powers to constitute full courts ”, but now that authority lied with the SC Practice and Procedure Committee “as per the Constitution and the law”. The petitions The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued. The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",

      "summary_orig": "The article was first published in December 2019 and has been replugged for DawnMedia’s upcoming air pollution conference in Lahore. There is mounting evidence that the air quality in Pakistan is having a strong impact on our quality of life. While research has shown the impact of poor air quality on morbidity and mortality for more serious conditions, its insidious effects are not discussed enough. The numbers paint a frightening picture. According to the World Air Quality report, Pakistan was the second most polluted country in 2018. At the time of writing this article, Karachi and Lahore were among the 10 cities in the world to have the most polluted air, with Lahore’s AQI (Air Quality Index) at 188 and Karachi’s at 182. An AQI of up to 50 is healthy. Beyond that, an AQI 0f 100-150 becomes unhealthy for children, and people with heart and lung disease. An AQI of above 150 is unhealthy for everyone while levels above 300 constitute a health emergency. Data from Lahore and Peshawar showed an AQI of above 300 on multiple days in the month of November. As for Lahore alone, in November, there wasn’t a single day in the country’s cultural capital that could be called healthy. Pakistan’s air pollution levels have transformed into a more dire health emergency than smoking, tuberculosis, and unsafe water and sanitation, reducing our life expectancy more than any of the three listed causes. In this situation, children are especially vulnerable, and air pollution causes 1 in 10 deaths for children under the age of five. Air pollution worsens respiratory problems for children as well as adults, causes childhood cancer, and impacts healthy brain development. For pregnant women, being exposed to air pollution can lead to premature births. In this article, we as a group of public health experts will attempt to comment on the various insidious effects that air pollution has on the public at large. How respiratory health is impacted Air pollutants come in all shapes and sizes (literally, ranging from coarse to ultra-fine) depending on the source of the pollutant. Studies show that air pollutants contain chemical substances that cause direct damage to the lungs’ inner lining and prevent DNA repair of an already damaged inner lining. This imbalance in damage and repair can promote abnormal cell growth, leading to lung cancer. Moreover, research shows that the presence of air pollutants in our airways paralyses the cilia (small hair-like structure on our wind-pipes that clear any bacteria or foreign particles), causing an increase in bacterial growth, thus promoting infections like pneumonia. Unfortunately, the very medium of this pollution has exposed us to it every day, involuntarily allowing them to enter our bodies through every breath we take. The very nature of this exposure primarily affects our lungs, the gateway to air inside our body, leading to asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease and of course lung cancer. Also read: The poisonous cocktail of smog and how we’re paying the price Recent estimations by the World Health Organisation show that air pollution was responsible for almost 10 million deaths in 2018. Overall, up to 35% of total deaths occur due to lung related diseases, caused directly or indirectly by air pollution, making it the world’s largest health risk. In Pakistan, there are many more sources of air pollution other than motorised vehicles and industries. A vast majority of the population in Pakistan depends on solid fuel burning for basic needs like cooking, heating and light which further increases the risk of air pollution exposure within homes, and especially to children. Such exposure can reduce a person’s ability to combat diseases, especially lung-related infections like tuberculosis. Effects on cardiovascular health Population scientists over the years have examined outcomes of people exposed to high levels of air pollutants and have found strong independent association of exposure to ambient air pollutants with development and progression of cardiovascular disease and risk factors. These include diabetes, high blood pressure, increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and aortic dissections. Leading medical journals like the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet and Circulation have published papers linking exposure to particulate matter with higher risk of development of heart disease, premature death and poorer quality of life after a heart attack. In the context of Pakistan, it is critical to realise the magnitude of the difference in air quality between countries where these studies were done and air quality in Pakistan. The air pollutant that is associated with adverse cardiovascular health outcomes is termed Particulate Matter 2.5 or PM2.5 because of its size (< 2.5 µm). Unlike the larger air pollutants, PM2.5 makes its way all the way down to the lungs and gets absorbed in the blood. Hence, it has systemic and long-lasting effects. These effects include inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and activation of thrombotic pathways, all of which increase the plaque burden in the arteries of the heart contributing to the risk of heart attacks and heart failure. By conservative estimates, every 10 µm/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with a 10% higher risk of death in vulnerable populations, including patients after a heart attack and other heart disorders. Let us explain. For example, if someone with heart disease lives in an area where average PM2.5 concentration is 15µm/m3 and then moves to an area where average concentration is 25µm/m3, his/her risk of premature death increases by10%. These estimates are based on population studies done in western countries where the concentration of PM2.5 ranges around 5-30µg/m3. In Pakistan, the average daily concentration approaches to over a 100 µg/m3 in urban areas such as Lahore and Karachi. We do not even know what the dose response curve is like for such high concentrations of PM2.5. In simpler words, the effects of exposure of PM2.5 on cardiovascular outcomes have not been extensively studied at concentrations that Pakistanis living in urban centres like Karachi and Lahore are exposed to. However, it is well-known at concentrations below 50 µm/m3, and the higher the exposure to PM2.5, higher the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. Whether this exposure/risk relationship plateaus at even higher concentrations is not well understood. In the worst case scenario, the risk would go up incrementally and in the best case scenario, the risk may remain the same. Though even in the best case situation, the risk is very high and in any western country, this high level of PM2.5 would have been unacceptable. For Pakistan, we know that high levels of air pollutants have toxic effects for our citizens. We also know that we do not completely understand the scope of the adverse health effects of such high concentrations of air pollutants. But we do not know the unknown population level effects of chronic exposure to these levels of pollution. In the above concept diagram, we attempt to illustrate the incremental risk of death in patients with heart disease, with higher exposures to PM2.5. What this curve looks like at PM2.5 concentrations that are common in Pakistan is not known. This is indeed a crisis. The threat to public health and well-being is real and cannot be under-estimated. But finding a solution to this will be a complex process and will involve thinking along long-term policies to limit emissions as well as short-term guidelines for citizens on methods they can employ to protect themselves. The damage to mental health Air pollution has also been reported to have deleterious impacts on the mental health of those exposed to it. Particulate matter in the atmosphere can get absorbed into the bloodstream and interfere with the functioning of our brain and the nervous system. This can include impairment when it comes to concentration, memory problems, and difficulty in emotional regulation, eventually leading to decreased productivity of the workforce and causing the national exchequer to lose billions of rupees annually. Mental health professionals working in Pakistan have also observed an increased rate of relapse in patients affected by mental illness with the change of weather and air quality. While some may attribute it to the cold, it is highly likely that increased air pollution during winter may be leading to increased risk of relapse in patients affected by mental health problems. While we need more data to support this proposition, there have been sufficient anecdotal accounts by mental health professionals reporting an increased rate of relapse in patients living in more polluted parts of Karachi during the winter season. Air pollution is especially bad for children’s mental health, since not only are children more exposed to its effects (due to a higher rate of breathing and more intake of pollutants) but the developing brain is more susceptible to harmful pollutants. More on this: If you haven’t seen Lahore This can have a long-term adverse impact on children’s ability to excel in education, form healthy relationships, and ultimately become productive members of society. Research has also shown that certain pollutants, such as lead, when inhaled by children can lead to a decrease in their IQ levels, decreased inhibition and increased violence in communities. Hence, air pollution is not just a health problem, but it can very easily turn into a much bigger societal, if not a security problem. Pediatrics & early childhood development In South Asia, it is estimated that approximately 12 million children are at risk because of air pollution. Previously it was thought that pollution only affects children because of respiratory compromise, but it is now clear that the respiratory component directly affects the neuro-development element because children respire more air per unit due to their surface area. When air toxicity is at the level which Pakistan is currently experiencing, it is safe to assume that children will end up breathing in more toxic air. The toxic air that is breathed in directly compromises the neural connections that are made in the most important time of development: the first 1,000 days of life. Neural connections are affected because nano-particles can directly impede the blood-brain barrier and in turn can stimulate the brain to produce free radicals which damage the brain itself. These damages are not limited to just the structural component, but also affect brain functionality by damaging the white matter which is an important neural connection that regulates our body. The blood-brain barrier keeps the blood from flowing into our brain — it’s like a filter mechanism that keeps excessive fluid and other substances potentially toxic for the brain from getting into it. Free radicals are ions that can cause oxidative damage to body parts, in this case the brain. So when the blood brain barrier is weakened, the brain receives more oxidative damage because of the free radicals. Loss of function of the barrier and the radicals all contribute to inflammation. For an organ that is already sensitive and in its development stage, the stress alone can contribute to cognitive dysfunction, resulting in a decrease in IQ points (by approximately 4-6) which is a significant figure. Furthermore, the compounded effect of respiratory compromise due to pollution contributes to absenteeism, further limiting a child’s learning potential. Thus, it can be hypothesised that the insidious effect of pollution further contributes to our morbidity and mortality, not just through physical disease but also with long-term damage that may contribute to early ADHD, Autism and probably Parkinson’s. The way forward Pakistan will have to deal with the issue of air pollution as a crisis and the country’s response will have to be multi-tiered and vary in temporality, since we need short-term, medium-term, and long-term changes. As medical practitioners, we’d leave the medium-term and long-term solutions to experts in that space, such as environmental engineers, energy professionals, and other industry experts. However, what we can urge them to do is to act now and act fast. In the short-term, what we must propose is for citizens to take charge of their own health and well-being to the best of their abilities. Some simple measures that they must take up include purifying the air in places where they spend most of their time, such as homes and offices. Invest in air purifiers, there are many low-cost but effective local options available in the market now and the difference it will make to your feeling of well-being will be immediately noticeable. In addition, if your work involves significant time outside, then there can only be good that would come out of wearing a mask. An n95 mask would be ideal for this purpose. This is what one can do to protect oneself and their loved ones. Now to people who can effect change, those who run industries, are in the energy sector, or work in the policy space, as physicians we urge you to consider the cost at which we are enabling economic growth. Members of our society, especially the ones who hold access to resources, must ponder the future we are building for ourselves and our children. As public health professionals, we can predict that if we continue on in the same direction, an apocalyptic future is not a dramatic hyperbole but a probable reality for the region.

      "title": "Why Pakistan needs to deal with air pollution on an emergency footing",
      "summary": "The article was first published in December 2019 and has been replugged for DawnMedia’s upcoming air pollution conference in Lahore. There is mounting evidence that the air quality in Pakistan is having a strong impact on our quality of life. While research has shown the impact of poor air quality on morbidity and mortality for more serious conditions, its insidious effects are not discussed enough. The numbers paint a frightening picture. According to the World Air Quality report, Pakistan was the second most polluted country in 2018. At the time of writing this article, Karachi and Lahore were among the 10 cities in the world to have the most polluted air, with Lahore’s AQI (Air Quality Index) at 188 and Karachi’s at 182. An AQI of up to 50 is healthy. Beyond that, an AQI 0f 100-150 becomes unhealthy for children, and people with heart and lung disease. An AQI of above 150 is unhealthy for everyone while levels above 300 constitute a health emergency. Data from Lahore and Peshawar showed an AQI of above 300 on multiple days in the month of November. As for Lahore alone, in November, there wasn’t a single day in the country’s cultural capital that could be called healthy. Pakistan’s air pollution levels have transformed into a more dire health emergency than smoking, tuberculosis, and unsafe water and sanitation, reducing our life expectancy more than any of the three listed causes. In this situation, children are especially vulnerable, and air pollution causes 1 in 10 deaths for children under the age of five. Air pollution worsens respiratory problems for children as well as adults, causes childhood cancer, and impacts healthy brain development. For pregnant women, being exposed to air pollution can lead to premature births. In this article, we as a group of public health experts will attempt to comment on the various insidious effects that air pollution has on the public at large. How respiratory health is impacted Air pollutants come in all shapes and sizes (literally, ranging from coarse to ultra-fine) depending on the source of the pollutant. Studies show that air pollutants contain chemical substances that cause direct damage to the lungs’ inner lining and prevent DNA repair of an already damaged inner lining. This imbalance in damage and repair can promote abnormal cell growth, leading to lung cancer. Moreover, research shows that the presence of air pollutants in our airways paralyses the cilia (small hair-like structure on our wind-pipes that clear any bacteria or foreign particles), causing an increase in bacterial growth, thus promoting infections like pneumonia. Unfortunately, the very medium of this pollution has exposed us to it every day, involuntarily allowing them to enter our bodies through every breath we take. The very nature of this exposure primarily affects our lungs, the gateway to air inside our body, leading to asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease and of course lung cancer. Also read: The poisonous cocktail of smog and how we’re paying the price Recent estimations by the World Health Organisation show that air pollution was responsible for almost 10 million deaths in 2018. Overall, up to 35% of total deaths occur due to lung related diseases, caused directly or indirectly by air pollution, making it the world’s largest health risk. In Pakistan, there are many more sources of air pollution other than motorised vehicles and industries. A vast majority of the population in Pakistan depends on solid fuel burning for basic needs like cooking, heating and light which further increases the risk of air pollution exposure within homes, and especially to children. Such exposure can reduce a person’s ability to combat diseases, especially lung-related infections like tuberculosis. Effects on cardiovascular health Population scientists over the years have examined outcomes of people exposed to high levels of air pollutants and have found strong independent association of exposure to ambient air pollutants with development and progression of cardiovascular disease and risk factors. These include diabetes, high blood pressure, increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and aortic dissections. Leading medical journals like the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet and Circulation have published papers linking exposure to particulate matter with higher risk of development of heart disease, premature death and poorer quality of life after a heart attack. In the context of Pakistan, it is critical to realise the magnitude of the difference in air quality between countries where these studies were done and air quality in Pakistan. The air pollutant that is associated with adverse cardiovascular health outcomes is termed Particulate Matter 2.5 or PM2.5 because of its size (< 2.5 µm). Unlike the larger air pollutants, PM2.5 makes its way all the way down to the lungs and gets absorbed in the blood. Hence, it has systemic and long-lasting effects. These effects include inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and activation of thrombotic pathways, all of which increase the plaque burden in the arteries of the heart contributing to the risk of heart attacks and heart failure. By conservative estimates, every 10 µm/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with a 10% higher risk of death in vulnerable populations, including patients after a heart attack and other heart disorders. Let us explain. For example, if someone with heart disease lives in an area where average PM2.5 concentration is 15µm/m3 and then moves to an area where average concentration is 25µm/m3, his/her risk of premature death increases by10%. These estimates are based on population studies done in western countries where the concentration of PM2.5 ranges around 5-30µg/m3. In Pakistan, the average daily concentration approaches to over a 100 µg/m3 in urban areas such as Lahore and Karachi. We do not even know what the dose response curve is like for such high concentrations of PM2.5. In simpler words, the effects of exposure of PM2.5 on cardiovascular outcomes have not been extensively studied at concentrations that Pakistanis living in urban centres like Karachi and Lahore are exposed to. However, it is well-known at concentrations below 50 µm/m3, and the higher the exposure to PM2.5, higher the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. Whether this exposure/risk relationship plateaus at even higher concentrations is not well understood. In the worst case scenario, the risk would go up incrementally and in the best case scenario, the risk may remain the same. Though even in the best case situation, the risk is very high and in any western country, this high level of PM2.5 would have been unacceptable. For Pakistan, we know that high levels of air pollutants have toxic effects for our citizens. We also know that we do not completely understand the scope of the adverse health effects of such high concentrations of air pollutants. But we do not know the unknown population level effects of chronic exposure to these levels of pollution. In the above concept diagram, we attempt to illustrate the incremental risk of death in patients with heart disease, with higher exposures to PM2.5. What this curve looks like at PM2.5 concentrations that are common in Pakistan is not known. This is indeed a crisis. The threat to public health and well-being is real and cannot be under-estimated. But finding a solution to this will be a complex process and will involve thinking along long-term policies to limit emissions as well as short-term guidelines for citizens on methods they can employ to protect themselves. The damage to mental health Air pollution has also been reported to have deleterious impacts on the mental health of those exposed to it. Particulate matter in the atmosphere can get absorbed into the bloodstream and interfere with the functioning of our brain and the nervous system. This can include impairment when it comes to concentration, memory problems, and difficulty in emotional regulation, eventually leading to decreased productivity of the workforce and causing the national exchequer to lose billions of rupees annually. Mental health professionals working in Pakistan have also observed an increased rate of relapse in patients affected by mental illness with the change of weather and air quality. While some may attribute it to the cold, it is highly likely that increased air pollution during winter may be leading to increased risk of relapse in patients affected by mental health problems. While we need more data to support this proposition, there have been sufficient anecdotal accounts by mental health professionals reporting an increased rate of relapse in patients living in more polluted parts of Karachi during the winter season. Air pollution is especially bad for children’s mental health, since not only are children more exposed to its effects (due to a higher rate of breathing and more intake of pollutants) but the developing brain is more susceptible to harmful pollutants. More on this: If you haven’t seen Lahore This can have a long-term adverse impact on children’s ability to excel in education, form healthy relationships, and ultimately become productive members of society. Research has also shown that certain pollutants, such as lead, when inhaled by children can lead to a decrease in their IQ levels, decreased inhibition and increased violence in communities. Hence, air pollution is not just a health problem, but it can very easily turn into a much bigger societal, if not a security problem. Pediatrics & early childhood development In South Asia, it is estimated that approximately 12 million children are at risk because of air pollution. Previously it was thought that pollution only affects children because of respiratory compromise, but it is now clear that the respiratory component directly affects the neuro-development element because children respire more air per unit due to their surface area. When air toxicity is at the level which Pakistan is currently experiencing, it is safe to assume that children will end up breathing in more toxic air. The toxic air that is breathed in directly compromises the neural connections that are made in the most important time of development: the first 1,000 days of life. Neural connections are affected because nano-particles can directly impede the blood-brain barrier and in turn can stimulate the brain to produce free radicals which damage the brain itself. These damages are not limited to just the structural component, but also affect brain functionality by damaging the white matter which is an important neural connection that regulates our body. The blood-brain barrier keeps the blood from flowing into our brain — it’s like a filter mechanism that keeps excessive fluid and other substances potentially toxic for the brain from getting into it. Free radicals are ions that can cause oxidative damage to body parts, in this case the brain. So when the blood brain barrier is weakened, the brain receives more oxidative damage because of the free radicals. Loss of function of the barrier and the radicals all contribute to inflammation. For an organ that is already sensitive and in its development stage, the stress alone can contribute to cognitive dysfunction, resulting in a decrease in IQ points (by approximately 4-6) which is a significant figure. Furthermore, the compounded effect of respiratory compromise due to pollution contributes to absenteeism, further limiting a child’s learning potential. Thus, it can be hypothesised that the insidious effect of pollution further contributes to our morbidity and mortality, not just through physical disease but also with long-term damage that may contribute to early ADHD, Autism and probably Parkinson’s. The way forward Pakistan will have to deal with the issue of air pollution as a crisis and the country’s response will have to be multi-tiered and vary in temporality, since we need short-term, medium-term, and long-term changes. As medical practitioners, we’d leave the medium-term and long-term solutions to experts in that space, such as environmental engineers, energy professionals, and other industry experts. However, what we can urge them to do is to act now and act fast. In the short-term, what we must propose is for citizens to take charge of their own health and well-being to the best of their abilities. Some simple measures that they must take up include purifying the air in places where they spend most of their time, such as homes and offices. Invest in air purifiers, there are many low-cost but effective local options available in the market now and the difference it will make to your feeling of well-being will be immediately noticeable. In addition, if your work involves significant time outside, then there can only be good that would come out of wearing a mask. An n95 mask would be ideal for this purpose. This is what one can do to protect oneself and their loved ones. Now to people who can effect change, those who run industries, are in the energy sector, or work in the policy space, as physicians we urge you to consider the cost at which we are enabling economic growth. Members of our society, especially the ones who hold access to resources, must ponder the future we are building for ourselves and our children. As public health professionals, we can predict that if we continue on in the same direction, an apocalyptic future is not a dramatic hyperbole but a probable reality for the region.

      "title_orig": "Pakistan look to revive Women’s World Cup campaign against Australia",
      "summary_orig": "Still searching for a sense of direction in the ICC Women’s World Cup, Pakistan will take on a rampant Australian side at the R. Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday, hoping to spark a turnaround against the tournament’s most complete outfit. Fatima Sana’s charges have endured a tough start to their campaign, slumping to heavy defeats against Bangladesh and India . Their batting has wavered, their bowling has lacked consistency, and their fielding has been short of international standard — a combination that has left them bottom of the eight-team table with little margin for error. But ahead of their clash with the defending champions, Pakistan’s senior batter Sidra Amin struck a note of quiet defiance. “I think tomorrow is a big game for us as a team,” she said at the pre-match press conference on Tuesday. “We are a good batting side, but as batters, we have to spend more time on the wicket so that we can execute our plans and assess the conditions really well.” Sidra, one of the few bright spots in Pakistan’s otherwise bleak campaign, scored a fighting half-century against India and has been a steadying presence at the top of the order. She admitted that the team’s batting collapses have often been self-inflicted. “If we look at the bigger picture, we’ve been leaving around five to seven overs — that’s about 42 balls,” she pointed out. “If we tackle things this way, the number of dot balls and the pressure will reduce. As batters, we need to take more responsibility, stay longer on the wicket, and play the maximum number of overs.” Pakistan’s inability to post a competitive total has been their undoing in both matches so far. They mustered only 160 against Bangladesh and folded for 180 against India, failing to bat their full quota of overs on both occasions. With middle-order batters struggling for fluency and the lower order offering little resistance, the team’s overreliance on Sidra, Fatima, and Muneeba Ali has become glaring. Even their bowling, traditionally Pakistan’s strength, has been inconsistent. The new-ball pairing of Fatima and Diana Baig has lacked rhythm, and the spinners have struggled for control in conditions that should ideally suit them. Pakistan conceded 18 extras against Bangladesh — a reflection of their discipline woes — though Diana’s four-wicket haul against India hinted at some improvement. “The discussions are ongoing,” Sidra said when asked about the team’s approach. “Our coach has guided us individually. He can tell us what to do, but as players, how we tackle things is what matters. Everyone knows our team is strong in bowling, and our spinners and attacking bowlers could cause problems for two or three of their batters — that might help us in this game.” However, even familiarity with the conditions — with Pakistan playing all their matches in Colombo — may not suffice against an Australian side that has looked a cut above. “Yes, we have an edge in that sense,” Sidra admitted. “But how the team uses that edge is very important. They’re a very well-prepared side. I heard that when they’re training for Asian conditions, they even set up indoor facilities at 35–40 degrees to simulate the heat. That’s the kind of preparation they do.” Australia, led by Alyssa Healy, enter the contest as firm favourites. Their campaign so far has been near-flawless, marked by powerful batting displays and disciplined bowling. They remain the only team to have posted a 300-plus total in the tournament — a feat they achieved in their commanding 89-run win over New Zealand in Indore, where Ashleigh Gardner’s century proved decisive. While some of their big names, including Healy and Beth Mooney, have yet to hit full stride, Australia’s depth has made them nearly invincible. The pace of Annabel Sutherland and the guile of Sophie Molineux have been particularly effective on subcontinental surfaces, while the side’s balance allows them to dominate in all phases of the game. Their only setback came off the field when their previous match against Sri Lanka was washed out, denying them the chance to go top of the standings. Yet, if anything, the break has left them fresher and more focused. All-rounder Ellyse Perry, speaking to reporters on the eve of the match, acknowledged both the challenge and respect her side have for their opponents. “Oh, yeah, [Fatima Sana] is an amazing player,” Perry said. “A real talisman, I think, for the Pakistan team. She plays with so much passion and energy — she’s incredibly talented, too. It’s always nice when we get a chance to play against her.” On the conditions, Perry added: “We obviously got to have a bit of a look at the conditions the other night with the India-Pakistan match. Probably hasn’t changed too much to how we were thinking the other day when we were hoping to play. But we’ve had a chance to prepare pretty well.”",

He can tell us what to do, but as players, how we tackle things is what matters. Everyone knows our team is strong in bowling, and our spinners and attacking bowlers could cause problems for two or three of their batters — that might help us in this game.” However, even familiarity with the conditions — with Pakistan playing all their matches in Colombo — may not suffice against an Australian side that has looked a cut above. “Yes, we have an edge in that sense,” Sidra admitted. “But how the team uses that edge is very important. They’re a very well-prepared side. I heard that when they’re training for Asian conditions, they even set up indoor facilities at 35–40 degrees to simulate the heat. That’s the kind of preparation they do.” Australia, led by Alyssa Healy, enter the contest as firm favourites. Their campaign so far has been near-flawless, marked by powerful batting displays and disciplined bowling. They remain the only team to have posted a 300-plus total in the tournament — a feat they achieved in their commanding 89-run win over New Zealand in Indore, where Ashleigh Gardner’s century proved decisive. While some of their big names, including Healy and Beth Mooney, have yet to hit full stride, Australia’s depth has made them nearly invincible. The pace of Annabel Sutherland and the guile of Sophie Molineux have been particularly effective on subcontinental surfaces, while the side’s balance allows them to dominate in all phases of the game. Their only setback came off the field when their previous match against Sri Lanka was washed out, denying them the chance to go top of the standings. Yet, if anything, the break has left them fresher and more focused. All-rounder Ellyse Perry, speaking to reporters on the eve of the match, acknowledged both the challenge and respect her side have for their opponents. “Oh, yeah, [Fatima Sana] is an amazing player,” Perry said. “A real talisman, I think, for the Pakistan team. She plays with so much passion and energy — she’s incredibly talented, too. It’s always nice when we get a chance to play against her.” On the conditions, Perry added: “We obviously got to have a bit of a look at the conditions the other night with the India-Pakistan match. Probably hasn’t changed too much to how we were thinking the other day when we were hoping to play. But we’ve had a chance to prepare pretty well.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka on Tuesday extended the pre-arrest bail of former prime minister Imran Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and six other party leaders till October 28, while issuing a show-cause notice to Adiala Jail authorities for not producing the former prime minister before the court. During the hearing, the judge expressed displeasure over the jail administration’s failure to ensure the PTI founder’s attendance and directed that he be produced either in person or via video link at the next hearing of the case. The court also sought a written explanation from the Adiala Jail superintendent and adjourned proceedings till Oct 28. The court restrained the authorities from arresting the couple in the relevant cases until the next hearing. Adiala officials get show-cause notice for not producing ex-PM before court; notices issued on plea regarding Imran’s Twitter activity Meanwhile, Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas of the Islamabad High Court adjourned the hearing of acquittal pleas filed by Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi in the Toshakhana case related to a jewellery set. During the proceedings, Mr Khan’s counsel Salman Safdar argued that the current case was based on similar charges and witnesses as the earlier Toshakhana case, in which his client’s conviction had already been suspended by a division bench. He contended that multiple investigations by different agencies — the Election Commission, NAB, FIA, and the Kohsar police — on the same allegations amounted to double jeopardy under Section 403 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Mr Safdar maintained that when an individual voluntarily discloses having received gifts, a corruption case cannot be sustained. Justice Minhas said any violation of rules or procedures must be determined through proper adjudication and directed the counsel to submit relevant verdicts. The defence counsel urged the court to restrain the trial court from announcing its verdict in the Toshakhana case, arguing that otherwise the acquittal plea would become meaningless. The judge said the matter would be examined and adjourned further hearing. Speaking to reporters outside the Islamabad High Court, Aleema Khan, the sister of the PTI founder, alleged that justice was not being served and that those who had “fabricated” the cases were now themselves in trouble. She said the PTI founder was under pressure to strike a deal but he had refused, adding that the courts and judges were also facing extraordinary pressures. She said the “truth” behind the cases had become evident. Imran’s Twitter activity In another development, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday issued notices to former prime minister Imran Khan and other respondents on a petition seeking the removal of allegedly controversial posts from the PTI founder’s official X (formerly Twitter) account. The court adjourned hearing till a fortnight. The petition, filed by citizen Ghulam Murtaza Khan through Barrister Zafarullah Khan, contended that the dissemination of “provocative and malicious” content from the account of a convicted prisoner was unlawful and in violation of prison regulations.

The statement signals that indirect talks with Israel in Egypt could be difficult and lengthy. Trump, however, expressed optimism on Tuesday about progress toward a  Gaza deal and said a U.S. team had just left to take part in the  negotiations. “I think there’s a possibility that we could have peace in the  Middle East” beyond just Gaza, he told reporters in the Oval Office. Earlier, senior Hamas official Fawzi Barhoum set out Hamas’s position a day after indirect negotiations began in Sharm el-Sheikh. Hamas sets out conditions “The (Hamas) movements delegation participating in the current negotiations in Egypt is working to overcome all obstacles to reaching an agreement that meets the aspirations of our people in Gaza,” Barhoum said in a televised statement. He said a deal must ensure an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip — conditions that Israel has never accepted. Israel, for its part wants Hamas to disarm, something the group rejects. Hamas wants a permanent, comprehensive ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the immediate start of a comprehensive reconstruction process under the supervision of a Palestinian “national technocratic body”, he said. Palestinian factions vowed to maintain armed resistance, while Netanyahu stayed silent on the talks. The US is seeking a ceasefire and prisoner deal, but Qatar says key gaps persist as Israel’s Gaza offensive and global protests continue. In a related development, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty  said that a US delegation led by presidential envoy Steve Witkoff would  join talks aimed at a truce in Gaza and prisoner exchange on Wednesday In a joint press conference with his German counterpart, Abdelatty said he and Johann Wadephul “had a long conversation with Steve  Witkoff, who is expected in Egypt in the coming hours”. Gaza strikes In the latest spate of violence, residents of Khan Younis in southern Gaza and Gaza City in the north reported new attacks by Israeli tanks, planes and boats in the early hours on Tuesday. Israel and Hamas have endorsed the overall principles behind Trump’s plan, under which fighting would cease, prisoners go free and aid pour into Gaza. It also has backing from Arab and Western states. Meanwhile, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman said that Israel should have ceased operations in Gaza already in line with US President Trump’s peace plan. “Regarding the ceasefire, this question should be directed first to the Israeli occupation government. It was supposed to actually cease fire if the statements made by the prime minister there regarding adherence to the Trump plan were true,” Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha. After Hamas agreed on Friday to discuss freeing prisoners under Trump’s plan, the US president had called on Israel to cease fire in Gaza, posting on his Truth Social platform: “Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the prisoners out safely and quickly!”.

Israel and Hamas have endorsed the overall principles behind Trump’s plan, under which fighting would cease, prisoners go free and aid pour into Gaza. It also has backing from Arab and Western states. Meanwhile, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman said that Israel should have ceased operations in Gaza already in line with US President Trump’s peace plan. “Regarding the ceasefire, this question should be directed first to the Israeli occupation government. It was supposed to actually cease fire if the statements made by the prime minister there regarding adherence to the Trump plan were true,” Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha. After Hamas agreed on Friday to discuss freeing prisoners under Trump’s plan, the US president had called on Israel to cease fire in Gaza, posting on his Truth Social platform: “Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the prisoners out safely and quickly!”.

      "summary_orig": "SHIKARPUR: Four bog­ies of the Jaffar Expr­ess derailed following an explosion on the track near the town of Huma­yoon, in the Shikarpur district, injuring seven passengers on Tuesday morning. Railways Minister Ha­nif Abbasi alleged foreign involvement, stating that India was behind the repeated attacks on the Jaffar Express. He affir­med that railway operations would continue desp­ite the incident. The train was en route from Peshawar to Quetta when the blast occurred at around 8:15am, said Shik­a­rpur Deputy Commis­sioner Shakeel Ahmed Abro while speaking to the media on the scene soon after the incident. He said there were no fatalities, and the seven injured passengers were promptly transported to Shikarpur Civil Hospital. The injured included Muh­ammad Shafique, son of Abdul Azziz, a railway official, Muhammad You­nis, Hawaldar Javed, constable Abdul Rahman, con­­­s­table Azhar Jameel, besides two unidentified passengers. Four of the more seriously injured were later shifted to the military hospital for further treatment. Later, the deputy commissioner made it clear that all seven injured were in stable condition and that arrangements were being made to safely transport all remaining passengers to their destinations. He also confirmed that repair work on the damaged track was currently underway. Tuesday’s blast is reportedly the seventh attack on Jaffar Express so far this year, starting with the deadliest episode in March, when terrorists killed 21 passengers after hijacking the train. Since then, the train has been attacked at least six times. Talking to Dawn , Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi blamed India for the repeated attacks on Jaffar Express. However, he declared that the train’s operation to and from Balochistan would continue despite such cowardly attacks “The terrorists targeting Jaffar Express again and again are, in fact, proxies of India that is not ready to digest and bear its defeat it faced during operation Bunyan Al Marsoos ,” he said. “These incidents are cowardly act of India that is still feeling the pain of wounds it received during the May war,” he added. In response to a question, Mr Abbasi said this time the terrorists selected the railway track near Shikarpur (Sindh). He said such cowardly attacks could not stop Pakistan Railways to cease the operations of Jaffar Express. “The train will continue operating as per routine, as we will never afraid of such attacks,” he said, adding that the security of the track and train would be tightened further. He praised “brave drivers, guards and other crew members who continue to perform duties in this train despite such horrible incidents. I also salute our brave passengers who continue to travel by this train, giving a message to the coward terrorists that Pakistani people are a brave and great nation that would never surrender before such proxies. I also salute our armed forces that are endeavoring to eliminate such terrorists for the protection of citizens of Pakistan”. Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah condemned the incident and sought an inquiry report from the police chief. He directed the Larkana commissioner to provide best medical assistance to the injured passengers. Later, Sindh lawmaker Imtiaz Sheikh, along with DC Abro, visited Civil Hospital to inquire after the condition of the injured passengers, including Muhammad Younis and Muhammad Shafique. Khalid Hasnain in Lahore also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, October 8th, 2025",
