      "title_orig": "PTI demands meeting between Imran and his family amid reports of ex-premier being taken to hospital",
      "summary_orig": "Amid reports about PTI founder Imran Khan suffering from an ailment that could permanently damage his eyesight and being taken to a hospital for treatment, the opposition on Wednesday demanded that a meeting be arranged between the ex-premier and his family. A day prior, the party said it had learned through credible reports that the ex-premier was suffering from an ailment that could cause permanent damage to his eyesight if not treated promptly. According to a senior doctor at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on Saturday night for the procedure, which took quite some time. Another doctor, however, had denied this and said it was better not to discuss it as the PTI would make an issue out of such a development. During a joint press conference, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said that Imran was allegedly taken to the hospital over the weekend before being taken back to jail. He called the situation “distressing for the nation, the party and the family”. “The family should have been taken on board for moving him for medical treatment. To this day, we have still not been informed about the disease for which he was taken to the hospital, which doctor examined him, why he was taken back [to jail] and why the need arose for doing so,” he said. In an apparent reference to the government, Gohar said they “are trying to consolidate your power” by making changes in the law but the people’s trust in them was failing. He added that denying meetings with the PTI chief was causing great concern. “The government is not understanding, but we will try to make them understand through this press conference; try to understand these problems. Let the meetings happen … do not deny meetings until February 8 under any circumstances,” he requested. “A meeting with the family is very important. We demand that today, if not tomorrow, a meeting be arranged between Khan sahib and his family, and we are informed about his health. This is our demand,” he said. Gohar urged the government to consider the demand so that the “anxiety within the nation, the party and his (Imran) family be immediately put at ease”. Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said that Imran was the most popular leader in Pakistan. “He (Imran) is a former prime minister of Pakistan … whom Pakistan loves,” he said. He termed the current situation, where Imran had been taken to the hospital without his family being informed, an “injustice”. He said that as a result of this, the government was losing its credibility in the eyes of the nation. “This is condemnable and they will have to answer for it at some point one day,” he said. Abbas said that the government had faced a resounding defeat in the Feb 8, 2024 general election. “If the [results] of the Feb 8 polls were accepted, then the political crisis would have ended,” he asserted. He called on the nation to join the opposition’s nationwide protest call for Feb 8. Meanwhile, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that Imran and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, being kept in isolation in jail was “unacceptable”. He said that the latter was last allowed to meet her daughter on November 4. Raja said that Imran’s personal physician, who was not related to politics in any way, was not allowed to see him. He said that petitions had also been filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) by the party’s senators and MNAs for meeting Imran. “I learnt today that the IHC has refused to hear these petitions as regular petitions. An objection had been placed on both pleas, saying that the petitioners had no right to approach the court,” he said. “We mentioned in our petition very clearly that we have grave concerns about the reports regarding Imran Khan sahib’s health and that his personal doctors should be allowed to examine him immediately. But we were told that this petition does not qualify for a hearing,” Raja asserted. “We went to the chambers of the chief justice … and we urged him to use his administrative powers and tell the advocate general that a meeting be arranged,” he added, saying that the situation “bordered on barbarism”. He again questioned why the party was not informed about Imran being taken to the hospital. “We demand that a meeting with Imran be arranged,” he said, also calling for the end of the couple’s solitary confinement. Senior PTI leaders request proper medical treatment for Imran Separately, senior PTI leaders incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail demanded that the government provide Imran proper medical treatment. PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Omar Safraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Reasheed also appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment was being administered as soon as possible. “Imran Khan’s eye infection has resulted in central retinal vein occlusion and may produce permanent damage to the eye and loss of vision, if not treated properly,” the five leaders expressed in an open letter shared by their counsel Rana Mudassar on Wednesday. The open letter — written by Rashid on behalf of all five incarcerated leaders — said learning about Imran Khan’s eye infection, which had resulted in central retinal vein occlusion, was extremely distressing. “This condition is extremely serious and if not treated properly, may produce permanent damage to the eye resulting in loss of vision,” the PTI leaders said. They urged the government to stop its “petty behaviour and ensure that he (Imran) is admitted to a hospital of his choice and given proper treatment” and called the denial of proper treatment “shameful”. “We appeal to the chief justice of Pakistan to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment is given as soon as possible,” they said. “The action taken in this case should be visible to the people of Pakistan,” they added.",

      "title_orig": "Governor Kundi blames ‘barrage of statements’ by KP govt for Tirah exodus",
      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Wednesday blamed statements by the PTI-led provincial government for the recent evacuation of residents from Tirah Valley in Khyber district. The federal and provincial governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists. Speaking to reporters in Khyber’s Bara tehsil — where families displaced from Tirah have arrived — Kundi noted that while there was typically around 20 per cent “migration” during winters, it was between 50 to 60pc this year. “It is 50 to 60pc this time because statements were repeatedly made that perhaps an operation will be conducted in Tirah, so people vacated [their homes].” “In my opinion, people are suffering today due to the failure and weakness of our province’s government,” he said. The governor noted that the KP government had issued a “barrage of statements and compelled these people to leave the area,” adding that the residents realised the situation was different when they reached Bara. He noted that, usually, people do not live in “tent villages” after evacuating during the winter, but stay in the homes of host families. Kundi stressed that whenever a military operation was planned, official statements were issued and necessary preparations were made. Speaking to reporters alongside Kundi, KP Opposition Leader Ibadullah Khan, who had accompanied the governor to Bara, said their visit aimed to meet the people who had come from Tirah and “see the ground situation” and the issues faced by the area residents. “This is our duty, these are our people,” he said. “Unfortunately, the person who has government in this province is playing politics on everything,” the PML-N MPA said, referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. He stressed that “certain topics” should not be politicised. ‘Come, let’s sit with Centre’ Kundi also extended an offer to CM Afridi for dialogue with the federal government to resolve various issues. Noting that the PPP was an ally of the PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre, Kundi said: “Therefore, we have always suggested to them that if they have any issue with the Centre, they should make a committee or a jirga and we are ready to accompany you.” The governor lamented that the PTI was willing to “hold jirgas with militants but was not ready to convene a jirga or sit with Punjab or the Centre”. “They are ready to work with the country’s enemies but not those who work for the country’s stability. “[…] If there is anything under the Centre’s responsibility, we are ready to play our role, but the provincial government should bring forth its case.” The governor noted that the law and order situation in Dera Ismail Khan, as well as the southern and merged districts of KP, was “not that good,” adding that security personnel and residents were making sacrifices. “Come, let’s sit with Centre, with security agencies to bring peace in the province, as well as development and prosperity,” the governor reiterated. Noting that the KP CM hailed from the merged districts, the governor said he should “provide a solution for the injustices that he says people there have faced in the past”. “I will again ask my province’s government to come to its senses. Leave aside Qaidi No.804 — he will come out of jail after facing punishment for his acts,” he said, an apparent reference to former prime minister Imran Khan. Kundi went on to quip that the PTI had the option to “form two parties”, one for its “ Tehreek-i-Intishaar ” (incitement movement) and the other to run KP. He also noted CM Afridi’s frequent visits outside the province, including to Rawalpindi , Lahore and Karachi . “If you have a mandate — however you got it — you should work for your province’s development,” the governor said, adding that people often requested facilitation for their medical treatment in Sindh and other places. He noted that Ibadullah and other opposition lawmakers informed CM Afridi of various issues “daily, but he remains unmoved”. Kundi asked the chief minister to fix KP’s governance and take steps for peace in the province. PTI concocting narrative to hide its corruption in Tirah funds: Tallal Chaudhry Separately, in a televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry claimed that the PTI-led KP government was concocting a false narrative to “hide its corruption” in the reported Rs4 billion approved for the Tirah residents’ temporary relocation. “The army’s name is being taken to hide their performance, incompetence, lack of capibility and their corruption in the Rs4bn dedicated for Tirah Valley,” Chaudhry said. Echoing the Centre’s clarifications issued in the past few days, the state minister asserted that no document or notification issued in the matter mentioned the federal government or the armed forces. “As soon as people were relocated to other places from Tirah, and they (KP govt) were paid Rs4bn, due to which there was noise, and it was found out that their own people had retained more than half of the money for some other purpose, so a baseless narrative was created after that to hide it.” Chaudhry asserted: “Whenever an operation is planned, we will issue a notification and conduct it after informing everyone. We will take everyone onboard. “Any kind of new operation or any operation is not taking place in Tirah Valley currently.” However, the interior official added, “If any action is underway in the entire country, from Quetta to Gilgit and Gilgit to Karachi, it is under the National Action Plan (NAP) . Highlighting that the current NAP was revised in 2021 under the PTI government, Chaudhry said the KP government was “fully a part of it”. “Each action, each IB (intelligence-based) operation or other action — the KP government is a full participant and onboard with each action taken in KP or any process carried out under the National Action Plan,” he asserted. The PML-N leader remarked that the “issue is they want to do it but they are scared”. “You want to do it and even attempt to, are fully onboard the National Action Plan, but are also scared and hide.” The state minister contended that the KP government was “concocting a narrative based on lies” to create a political narrative, collect votes, hide its corruption and divert attention from its performance. Noting that Rs14bn were recovered from a “truck driver’s account” in the Kohistan graft case , Chaudhry alleged there was a “similar scandal in Tirah” involving the Rs4bn allocated. The interior ministry official declared that the “routine” intelligence-based operations (IBOs) will continue under the NAP, and they were taking place with the “cooperation” of the KP government and its chief minister. “But to make themselves appear good in the public’s eyes and make the army bad, lies are told,” he remarked, noting that military operations had previously been carried out after proper announcements. “Whenever there is such a need, we do not need to hide. We will do it openly,” Chaudhry said. “But repeatedly making false accusations against the army cannot hide your lack of capability, incompetence, or corruption, or the Rs4bn that went in your pockets in Tirah Valley,” he added. The minister highlighted that the KP government was responsible for distributing the allocated funds, adding that the deputy commissioner who was involved in the December agreement with the tribal elders was also under the provincial administration. “The action for which you are fully responsible, not just a participant, you pin the blame for it on someone else,” Chaudhry quipped.",

Noting that Rs14bn were recovered from a “truck driver’s account” in the Kohistan graft case , Chaudhry alleged there was a “similar scandal in Tirah” involving the Rs4bn allocated. The interior ministry official declared that the “routine” intelligence-based operations (IBOs) will continue under the NAP, and they were taking place with the “cooperation” of the KP government and its chief minister. “But to make themselves appear good in the public’s eyes and make the army bad, lies are told,” he remarked, noting that military operations had previously been carried out after proper announcements. “Whenever there is such a need, we do not need to hide. We will do it openly,” Chaudhry said. “But repeatedly making false accusations against the army cannot hide your lack of capability, incompetence, or corruption, or the Rs4bn that went in your pockets in Tirah Valley,” he added. The minister highlighted that the KP government was responsible for distributing the allocated funds, adding that the deputy commissioner who was involved in the December agreement with the tribal elders was also under the provincial administration. “The action for which you are fully responsible, not just a participant, you pin the blame for it on someone else,” Chaudhry quipped.",
      "title": "Governor Kundi blames ‘barrage of statements’ by KP govt for Tirah exodus",
      "summary": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Wednesday blamed statements by the PTI-led provincial government for the recent evacuation of residents from Tirah Valley in Khyber district. The federal and provincial governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists. Speaking to reporters in Khyber’s Bara tehsil — where families displaced from Tirah have arrived — Kundi noted that while there was typically around 20 per cent “migration” during winters, it was between 50 to 60pc this year. “It is 50 to 60pc this time because statements were repeatedly made that perhaps an operation will be conducted in Tirah, so people vacated [their homes].” “In my opinion, people are suffering today due to the failure and weakness of our province’s government,” he said. The governor noted that the KP government had issued a “barrage of statements and compelled these people to leave the area,” adding that the residents realised the situation was different when they reached Bara. He noted that, usually, people do not live in “tent villages” after evacuating during the winter, but stay in the homes of host families. Kundi stressed that whenever a military operation was planned, official statements were issued and necessary preparations were made. Speaking to reporters alongside Kundi, KP Opposition Leader Ibadullah Khan, who had accompanied the governor to Bara, said their visit aimed to meet the people who had come from Tirah and “see the ground situation” and the issues faced by the area residents. “This is our duty, these are our people,” he said. “Unfortunately, the person who has government in this province is playing politics on everything,” the PML-N MPA said, referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. He stressed that “certain topics” should not be politicised. ‘Come, let’s sit with Centre’ Kundi also extended an offer to CM Afridi for dialogue with the federal government to resolve various issues. Noting that the PPP was an ally of the PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre, Kundi said: “Therefore, we have always suggested to them that if they have any issue with the Centre, they should make a committee or a jirga and we are ready to accompany you.” The governor lamented that the PTI was willing to “hold jirgas with militants but was not ready to convene a jirga or sit with Punjab or the Centre”. “They are ready to work with the country’s enemies but not those who work for the country’s stability. “[…] If there is anything under the Centre’s responsibility, we are ready to play our role, but the provincial government should bring forth its case.” The governor noted that the law and order situation in Dera Ismail Khan, as well as the southern and merged districts of KP, was “not that good,” adding that security personnel and residents were making sacrifices. “Come, let’s sit with Centre, with security agencies to bring peace in the province, as well as development and prosperity,” the governor reiterated. Noting that the KP CM hailed from the merged districts, the governor said he should “provide a solution for the injustices that he says people there have faced in the past”. “I will again ask my province’s government to come to its senses. Leave aside Qaidi No.804 — he will come out of jail after facing punishment for his acts,” he said, an apparent reference to former prime minister Imran Khan. Kundi went on to quip that the PTI had the option to “form two parties”, one for its “ Tehreek-i-Intishaar ” (incitement movement) and the other to run KP. He also noted CM Afridi’s frequent visits outside the province, including to Rawalpindi , Lahore and Karachi . “If you have a mandate — however you got it — you should work for your province’s development,” the governor said, adding that people often requested facilitation for their medical treatment in Sindh and other places. He noted that Ibadullah and other opposition lawmakers informed CM Afridi of various issues “daily, but he remains unmoved”. Kundi asked the chief minister to fix KP’s governance and take steps for peace in the province. PTI concocting narrative to hide its corruption in Tirah funds: Tallal Chaudhry Separately, in a televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry claimed that the PTI-led KP government was concocting a false narrative to “hide its corruption” in the reported Rs4 billion approved for the Tirah residents’ temporary relocation. “The army’s name is being taken to hide their performance, incompetence, lack of capibility and their corruption in the Rs4bn dedicated for Tirah Valley,” Chaudhry said. Echoing the Centre’s clarifications issued in the past few days, the state minister asserted that no document or notification issued in the matter mentioned the federal government or the armed forces. “As soon as people were relocated to other places from Tirah, and they (KP govt) were paid Rs4bn, due to which there was noise, and it was found out that their own people had retained more than half of the money for some other purpose, so a baseless narrative was created after that to hide it.” Chaudhry asserted: “Whenever an operation is planned, we will issue a notification and conduct it after informing everyone. We will take everyone onboard. “Any kind of new operation or any operation is not taking place in Tirah Valley currently.” However, the interior official added, “If any action is underway in the entire country, from Quetta to Gilgit and Gilgit to Karachi, it is under the National Action Plan (NAP) . Highlighting that the current NAP was revised in 2021 under the PTI government, Chaudhry said the KP government was “fully a part of it”. “Each action, each IB (intelligence-based) operation or other action — the KP government is a full participant and onboard with each action taken in KP or any process carried out under the National Action Plan,” he asserted. The PML-N leader remarked that the “issue is they want to do it but they are scared”. “You want to do it and even attempt to, are fully onboard the National Action Plan, but are also scared and hide.” The state minister contended that the KP government was “concocting a narrative based on lies” to create a political narrative, collect votes, hide its corruption and divert attention from its performance.

      "summary_orig": "Turkiye’s top diplomat urged Washington to start nuclear talks with Iran in an interview broadcast on Wednesday, as US warships arrived in the region ahead of a possible strike over Tehran’s protest crackdown. “It’s wrong to attack Iran. It’s wrong to start the war again. Iran is ready to negotiate on the nuclear file again,” Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Qatar-based Al-Jazeera television in English. “My advice has always been to our American friends: close the files one by one with the Iranians. Start with the nuclear issue and close it. Then move on to the others.” Fidan’s comments after a US naval strike force led by an aircraft carrier took up position in Middle Eastern waters, US Central Command said on Monday, without revealing its precise location. Washington has not ruled out new military intervention against Tehran over its  response to the protests. Since Iran began its crackdown earlier this month accompanied by a nationwide internet blackout, US President Donald Trump has given mixed signals on intervention. Nato member Turkiye, which shares a 530 kilometre border with Iran, has often expressed opposition to military operations targeting the Islamic Republic. Last week, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the unrest in Iran as a “new test” for Tehran, pledging Turkey would “stand against any initiative” that would drag the region into chaos. He said he hoped diplomacy and dialogue would help Iran get through this “trap-filled period”. Speaking to Al-Jazeera , Fidan said the problems with Iran should be tackled individually. “Do not treat them as a package. If you put everything together as one package, it will be very difficult for our Iranian friends to digest and truly process it,” he said. “In some cases, it may even seem humiliating for them. It would be hard to explain not only to themselves but also to their leadership.” The minister made similar comments on Friday, telling Turkiye’s NTV he had visited Tehran late last year, urging them to “take steps”, saying he believed an agreement with the US on the nuclear issue was “possible”. “A friend tells the bitter truth and I said what needed to be said,” he said. Fidan also urged Iran to build trust in the region. “When I was in Iran two months ago, I was very frank with my Iranian friends. They need to build trust in the region,” he told Al-Jazeera . “They need to pay attention to how they are perceived by regional countries”.",

Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Niaz Muhammad told Dawn that the victim, identified as 47-year-old Najibullah, died while being transported to the Khar District Headquarters Hospital for treatment. He said the IED was planted by unidentified miscreants. The DSP added that a team of police personnel from the War Mamund police station, led by Station House Officer (SHO) Aslam Khan, had rushed to the spot and launched a search operation for the terrorists involved in the incident. He further said an investigation was underway to determine the cause of the blast and identify those were responsible for it. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.",

      "summary_orig": "Seconds after an attacker sprayed US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar with an unidentified liquid at a Minnesota meeting, she confronted the man and then defiantly went on to finish her comments, AFP journalists saw. The Somali-born US lawmaker, a constant target of US President Donald Trump’s attacks, had just called for the president’s homeland security chief to resign in the wake of immigration agents killing two US citizens in a matter of weeks. The attacker, identified by police as 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak, managed to spray Omar before he was tackled and removed from the Tuesday meeting in Minneapolis. She was unharmed, police said. Yet before he was even grabbed, Omar stepped rapidly toward the attacker with her fist raised. The lawmaker then went on to urge the crowd to settle down and listen to herremarks. “Here is the reality that people like this ugly man don’t understand — we are Minnesota strong and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us,” Omar said to the meeting of constituents. Authorities have not reported what may have motivated the attacker, but the incident comes as Minneapolis is in a running confrontation with Trump’s aggressive deportation campaign . Ahead of the incident, Omar’s constituents raised issues with her as eclectic as trash collections and the plight of North Minneapolis, alongside fears over the sweeping immigration operations that have sparked large protests . Just as she called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the attacker jumped to his feet from the front row of seats in the meeting room. He then appeared to spray the contents of his syringe, prompting complaints about a foul smell, AFP correspondents witnessed. Two men quickly tackled the assailant, sparking calls of “Nazis out” as he was led from the room. Stunned onlookers gasped and recoiled as the drama unfolded against an already tense backdrop in Minnesota as its targeted by Trump’s immigration operation. Omar has accused Trump of turning Minneapolis into a “war zone”, while he has accused her of corruption without evidence. ‘Not about him’ “It’s not about him, Ilhan,” said one bystander, seeking to encourage Omar, an outspoken Trump critic, to continue. Undeterred, Omar proclaimed, “Please don’t let them have the show.” The suspect was arrested on suspicion of third-degree assault, according to police. An investigation was underway. One witness said they asked themselves, “Is this really happening?” “He could have done something else,” he told AFP . Questions will be asked about security arrangements at the event with members of the public checked by staff, but members of the press allowed in without scrutiny. After the event, Omar, the first Somali-American representative, posted on X, “I’m OK.” “I’m a survivor so this small agitator isn’t going to intimidate me from doing my work,” she wrote.",

In a phone call with Pezeshkian, the crown prince affirmed his country’s support for any “efforts that would resolve differences through dialogue” to bolster security and stability in the region.

Uncertainty over the possibility of military action in Iran has lingered after US President Donald Trump said last week that an “armada” was heading toward the country but that he hoped he would not have to use it. Trump said on Tuesday another US “armada” was floating towards Iran and he hoped that Tehran would make a deal with Washington. “There is another beautiful armada floating beautifully towards Iran right now,” Trump said in a speech. “I hope they make a deal.” Trump’s warnings to Tehran were against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear programme, but the countrywide demonstrations have since abated. A US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East, two US officials told Reuters on Monday, expanding Trump’s capabilities to defend US forces, or potentially take military action against Iran.

      "summary_orig": "KHYBER: Even though the federal and provincial governments are locked in a blame game over displacement from the restive Tirah valley, officials estimate that around 80-85pc of all residents have been evacuated so far. Inclement weather continues to hold up the evacuation process, which has been temporarily halted. Those who had already left their homes and became stranded due to snow storms have also finally reached Bara after two days of hectic rescue operations. Heavy snowfall and the slow pace of registration at multiple locations along the 110-kilometre road from Tirah to Bara has multiplied the miseries of displaced families, with most spending sleepless nights on the road in severe cold. District administration officials told Dawn that though the exact number of families who arrived in Bara was not yet known, but by Tuesday, they estimated that only around 15pc were yet to be evacuated. Evacuation process still on hold amid inclement weather; authorities increase number of registration centres at Bara to facilitate the displaced They said the final date for evacuation had been extended after heavy snowfall and the remaining families were told to stay back till weather improves, though no exact completion date was given. Officials explained that the relaxation was given in light of weather-related hurdles, as it was imperative to give the Tirah people some ‘space’ prior to the restart of their final evacuation after an improvement in weather condition. Dawn has also learnt that families still stranded in their homes due to the suspension of the evacuation process are facing an acute shortage of edibles, as authorities were not allowing anyone into the valley. In Bara, local tribal elders, former parliamentarians and political party representatives blamed both governments for forcing families to vacate their houses to pave the way for yet another military operation. Demanding an immediate halt to the ongoing ‘inhuman’ treatment’ of displaced families, Hamidullah Jan Afridi, a former MNA, sought transparency in the registration process, and called for honouring all commitments made with the 24-member jirga of Tirah elders prior to the start of displacement. He also demanded stopping of political interference in the registration process and due compensation against all losses the people of Tirah had incurred during their displacement. Hashim Khan Afridi, president of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, insisted the decision about the military operation and ‘forced displacement’ was jointly taken by federal and KP governments after holding a series of consultations with local tribal elders. He also demanded an open audit of all funds released in the name of Tirah IDPs and sharing required data with people of both Tirah and Bara. Registration process The district administration has also increased the number of registration centers in Bara to expedite the process and make it more transparent. Officials said that alongside the Paindi Cheena centre, four new centres had been made operational in Alamgudar, Bar Qambarkhel, Malakdin Khel and Qambarabad localities of Bara. They said that separate desks for female registration were established at all centres, as many displaced families had complained that the women had to be herded into the same centres as men, which they considered against their culture and traditions. Officials said that along with district administration officials, local tribal elders, bank staff and staff of a mobile phone company were deputed at all centres for instant verification and issuance of SIM cards to Tirah families. They said previous polio vaccination records would also be used for verification of genuine IDPs with timely provision of basic necessities. Sources in Bara informed that a majority of newly arrived families from Tirah were staying with relatives in different parts of Bara, with some having second homes while a limited number went to Peshawar suburbs where they own houses. Authorities also started registration of hundreds of Zakhakhel families at Paindi Cheena after reaching understanding with Nadra staff. The Zakhakhel families were earlier denied registration on the pretext they had acquired CNICs from Landi Kotal tehsil and are not actual residents of Tirah. Published in Dawn, January 28th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Achakzai keeps mum, Gohar says parliamentary party to make decision • Dogar ties all decisions to meeting with Imran • Analysts believe PTI founder may decide the matter after Feb 8 protest ISLAMABAD: Days after the appointment of leader of the opposition in both the Senate and the National Assembly , the main opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), is seriously considering rejoining the standing committees of parliament, a move that remains contingent on the consent of its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan. A majority of PTI leaders are said to be keen to regain the chairmanship of standing committees, particularly the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), in order to “resist” what they describe as controversial decisions and policies of the government. As the final decision to rejoin the committees rests with Mr Khan, political analysts believe he is likely to decide on the matter after the PTI’s countrywide protest scheduled for Feb 8. PTI previously held the chairmanship of more than a dozen standing committees in the National Assembly and five in the Senate, besides participating in several others. However, on the directives of its founder, the party withdrew from all standing committees in both houses of parliament in August last year. It has been learnt that a majority of PTI legislators now believe the party should not have exited the standing committees, as doing so allowed the government to function without effective parliamentary scrutiny. They believe Mr Khan’s decision ceded crucial ground to the ruling coalition. Talking to Dawn , a senior PTI leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many key party decisions were pending and linked to a meeting between the jailed PTI founder, party legislators and his sisters. “The government should arrange a meeting between Imran Khan and party legislators so that he can be convinced that we must rejoin the standing committees,” he said. He added that relinquishing the chairmanship of the PAC was not a sagacious decision, as the party had used the forum effectively to expose alleged wrongdoing by the government. The PTI leader said that, besides the PAC, the party should not have vacated three other important committees — finance, law and justice, and human rights. He recalled that when PTI workers and members of the Punjab Assembly were recently maltreated by the police, the matter was taken up by a privilege committee. “On the other hand, PTI parliamentarians are often humiliated and manhandled by the police, but they cannot take such matters to the privilege committees of the Senate and the National Assembly,” he said. All decisions linked to jail meeting PTI Chief Whip Aamir Dogar, while talking to Dawn , agreed that all pending party decisions were linked to a meeting between Imran Khan and party leaders in jail. The newly-appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Mehmood Achakzai, shortly after his maiden speech in the house, declined to comment on the possibility of PTI’s return to the standing committees. However, PTI acting chairman Barrister Gohar Ali said the decision regarding rejoining the standing committees would be taken by the party’s parliamentary committee. According to observers, Mr Khan’s decision to exit the standing committees mirrored his move in 2022, when he opted to quit parliament following the no-confidence vote instead of positioning PTI as a “heavyweight opposition” after his ouster from power. They believe the decision to withdraw from the committees did not create any vacuum in parliament. The absence of three or four PTI lawmakers from a committee did not affect the quorum, which requires the presence of one-fourth of the total members. Moreover, the departure made little practical difference, as members from the treasury benches replaced PTI representatives. In effect, PTI remained the sole loser in the entire episode. Courage to disagree Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, who heads the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), said PTI leaders were effectively helpless, even if they favoured a return to the committees, as the authority to decide rested solely with Mr Khan. He noted that most PTI leaders lacked the courage to even disagree with Mr Khan’s position as they wished to remain in his good books. Mr Mehboob was of the opinion that Mr Khan would first assess the outcome of PTI’s Feb 8 countrywide protest and then decide on the issue of standing committees. He said democracy required PTI to return to the committees and play an effective role. However, he added, Mr Khan remained the final authority. “A lack of opposition representation in these important committees negatively impacts the quality of parliamentary proceedings,” he said. Calling the situation ironic, the Pildat chief said PTI’s decision to leave all standing committees, including the PAC, echoed its earlier move to quit the National Assembly and relinquish governments in provinces. Meanwhile, a source in the National Assembly Secretariat said NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had advised PTI on several occasions to return to the committees and that any such move by the party would be welcomed by the secretariat.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Australia on Tuesday discussed the possibility of an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) for structured, long-term cooperation in Pakistan’s mining and mineral sector. The IGA between the two sides was proposed by Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik here during his meeting with the new Australian High Commissioner (AHC) to Pakistan, Timothy Kane. It builds on a July 2025 Australian proposal made through former AHC Neil Hawkins for collaboration between Australian universities, mining firms, and Pakistani institutions to provide specialised training programmes in modern mining techniques and services and enhance local expertise and support Pakistan’s mining sector development. An official statement said the new AHC Kane and the petroleum minister discussed avenues for enhanced bilateral cooperation in the mining and gemstone sectors. The minister welcomed the strong interest of Australian companies in Pakistan’s mining sector and highlighted the country’s immense untapped mineral potential, particularly in the Tethyan Belt. “He proposed the possibility of an IGA between Pakistan and Australia to promote structured and long-term cooperation in the mining sector,” the statement said. Discuss possibility of long-term cooperation agreement to tap country’s vast mineral potential Australia had been operating in Pakistan’s mineral and natural resources sector, almost in all resource-rich regions, including Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, mostly in research and exploration and identified critical reserves in copper, gold, coal, zinc and other precious resources, including oil and gas. Australian BHP Billiton’s joint venture with the Geological Survey of Pakistan had led to the discovery of the multi-billion dollar Reko Diq copper-gold deposits, now being developed for commercial production by Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada. BHP had left Pakistan under its global restructuring almost two decades ago. Mr Malik briefed the new envoy about the government’s efforts to develop and formalise the gemstones sector to unleash its true potential for value addition, exports, and employment generation. The AHC reiterated that Australian companies were already actively involved in the Reko Diq project, and additional Australian firms had shown keen interest in joining the project. He said the Australian companies would be encouraged to participate in the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum (PMIF), expressing hope for a strong Australian presence at the event. The diplomat highlighted the growing global importance of copper and gold for the energy transition, adding that Pakistan’s mining sector had attracted significant international attention. He also expressed “optimism for collaboration in the gemstones sector through knowledge exchange, training, and technical assistance”, the statement said. The two sides also discussed the recent visit of the petroleum minister to Australia for the International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC) and the fruitful discussions with leading and junior Australian mining companies on investment and cooperation opportunities in Pakistan’s minerals sector. The two sides agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the mining and gemstone sectors for mutual benefit. The presence of mineral deposits in the Reko Diq area was identified by the Geological Survey of Pakistan in the early 1990s in collaboration with BHP Billiton of Australia. Later in 2000, Tethyan Corporation (TCC) of Australia took over the project from BHP and invested $30 million by raising funds through an international listing and drilled over 75,000 meters to prove the reserves. The TCC was subsequently taken over by two of the world’s largest copper and gold mining firms — Antofagasta of Chile and Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada for A$158 million ($130m) at the time. The agreement between Pakistan and the two mining firms signed in the Musharraf era ran into trouble, leading to international arbitration followed by an out-of-court settlement for penalties and project revival. In the process, the Reko Diq project production, due in 2010, was delayed by at least 15 years. It was announced at the time of discovery by GSP and BHP that the Reko Diq mining area had proven estimated reserves of two billion tonnes of copper and 20 million ounces of gold, valued at $65bn at the time. The recent feasibility studies completed by Barrick have also established that the project would have a 45 million tonnes of throughput per annum (Mpta) for the first five years and then 90 Mpta for the following 32 years of the second phase. Based on existing reserves, the Reko Diq project is expected to yield production of 13.1m tonnes of copper and 17.9m ounces of gold over the life of the mine (100pc basis), according to state-run Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL), one of the shareholders. The feasibility study has also confirmed a lucrative 25pc rate of return on investment on one of the biggest copper-gold projects. Under the updated feasibility study, Phase 1 is planned to process 45m tonnes of mill-feed annually (Mtpa) from 2028. Previously, it was estimated to be close to 40m tonnes. By 2034, Phase 2 is planned to double the processing capacity to 90Mtpa. Published in Dawn, January 28th, 2026",
