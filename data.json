      "summary_orig": "Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP) President Abdullah Jadoon and Secretary General Awais Jadoon have been dismissed from service, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) spokesperson Abdullah Hafiz told Dawn on Thursday. The dismissals have come amid an ongoing tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP, with the protesting engineers refusing to issue clearance certificates to aircraft — a move that has disrupted flight operations in recent days. The engineers have been protesting for two-and-a-half mont­­hs, seeking pay hikes among other demands. While the PIA has claimed that the engineers are on “strike”, the SAEP maintains that its engineers on duty but not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks. Earlier, the PIA spokesperson had highlighted that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he had warned. Subsequently, the now-dismissed two office-bearers had been summoned by the PIA management for the final hearing as an investigation against them was underway, a PIA spokesperson had earlier said, adding that the PIA would initiate legal action against them in line with the law. The PIA management had called the SAEP president and general secretary for an inquiry on Tuesday, but they didn’t even show up on Wednesday. Eventually, they were dismissed from service today. For his part, Awais Jadoon had earlier said that the two officers were on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances.” He had also clarified that the engineers were not on strike and said that they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying. In response to a question about a meeting with the PIA management, he had said that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them. Meanwhile, the PIA has alleged that the engineer’s protest is aimed at sabotaging the national flag carrier’s privatisation. Flight disruptions The matter came into the spotlight when hund­reds of air travellers were reported to have been stranded at three major airports on Monday night due to the aircraft engineers’ protest, which delayed at least six flights of the national flag carrier. Similar delays have been reported at nearly all major airports in the country during the last two months. On Tuesday, the PIA claimed to have restored flight operations through alternative arrangements. A PIA spokesperson said that the management had used alternative means and worked overnight to restore operations, mitigating the impact of already delayed flights on subsequent operations. Yesterday, too, the PIA said it had managed to “partially restore its flight operations”.",

      "summary_orig": "Shafiullah Jan, the special assistant to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information and public relations, said on Thursday that only the provincial chief executive could make decisions for ensuring lasting peace in the province. “We have the mandate. Any decision for lasting peace in the province will be made by the chief minister, and the provincial government will implement it,” Jan said while addressing a news conference in Peshawar. He said law and order was the biggest challenge for the provincial government, adding that the KP government was making efforts to address the issue. Jan further said that a multiparty conference was scheduled to be held next week and that the finalised terms of reference (ToRs) would be presented to the chief minister for further discussion with the stakeholders, to decide a future course of action for lasting peace in the province. Meanwhile, PTI Provincial Secretary General Ali Asghar requested all the political parties to share their suggestions, adding that PTI founder Imran Khan and his party were against any military operation in the province. “The consequences of military operations are faced by the locals who vacate their homes,” he said. The PTI has been opposing plans to conduct anti-terrorism operations across the province, with its incarcerated founder Imran Khan in August telling then-KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur not to allow the Centre to conduct any military operations. Imran had made a similar demand in September as well. However, Gandapur had deviated from the party line while he was the CM and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military. It was against this backdrop that Imran decided to remove Gandapur as the provincial chief executive and nominated Afridi for the post, who was elected as the chief minister on October 13. Imran’s this decision is also being linked to his opposition to military operations in the KP. Three days before Afridi’s election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership. In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations? ‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’ For his part, Afridi announced following his election that a jirga would be held in his hometown of Bara in the Khyber district on Oct 25 to establish enduring peace in the restive province and resist decisions made without the input of residents. He also asserted that the provincial government stood by the ideology of Imran and the interests of the KP residents. In his first official high-level meeting as the CM on Oct 20, he had maintained that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government. More recently on Oct 29, he used stronger words to criticise military operations in KP while speaking to the media in Peshawar, saying that civilian deaths during security operations constituted a “war crime” and not collateral damage.",

In his first official high-level meeting as the CM on Oct 20, he had maintained that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government. More recently on Oct 29, he used stronger words to criticise military operations in KP while speaking to the media in Peshawar, saying that civilian deaths during security operations constituted a “war crime” and not collateral damage.",

      "summary": "Shafiullah Jan, the special assistant to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information and public relations, said on Thursday that only the provincial chief executive could make decisions for ensuring lasting peace in the province. “We have the mandate. Any decision for lasting peace in the province will be made by the chief minister, and the provincial government will implement it,” Jan said while addressing a news conference in Peshawar. He said law and order was the biggest challenge for the provincial government, adding that the KP government was making efforts to address the issue. Jan further said that a multiparty conference was scheduled to be held next week and that the finalised terms of reference (ToRs) would be presented to the chief minister for further discussion with the stakeholders, to decide a future course of action for lasting peace in the province. Meanwhile, PTI Provincial Secretary General Ali Asghar requested all the political parties to share their suggestions, adding that PTI founder Imran Khan and his party were against any military operation in the province. “The consequences of military operations are faced by the locals who vacate their homes,” he said. The PTI has been opposing plans to conduct anti-terrorism operations across the province, with its incarcerated founder Imran Khan in August telling then-KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur not to allow the Centre to conduct any military operations. Imran had made a similar demand in September as well. However, Gandapur had deviated from the party line while he was the CM and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military. It was against this backdrop that Imran decided to remove Gandapur as the provincial chief executive and nominated Afridi for the post, who was elected as the chief minister on October 13. Imran’s this decision is also being linked to his opposition to military operations in the KP. Three days before Afridi’s election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership. In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations? ‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’ For his part, Afridi announced following his election that a jirga would be held in his hometown of Bara in the Khyber district on Oct 25 to establish enduring peace in the restive province and resist decisions made without the input of residents. He also asserted that the provincial government stood by the ideology of Imran and the interests of the KP residents.

      "summary_orig": "On November 5, the curtain fell on a remarkably well-executed political campaign as New York witnessed the historic election of its first-ever Muslim South Asian mayor. Watch parties surfaced across all five boroughs, pulsing with celebratory music, jubilation, and a sense of endless possibilities. The city itself seemed to hum with electric energy. The air, undeniably different, charged with the promise of something new. At a time when voter turnout and overall faith in politics have been at record lows, 34-year-old democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, a Queens native and the son of Ugandan-Indian immigrants, has emerged as a ray of hope, not only for New Yorkers but progressives all over the world. His win signifies a new era for reformists, younger voters, and immigrant communities who poured their hearts out into his campaign, canvassing neighbourhoods, phone-banking, and donating generously. Nearly 70 per cent of his voter base was under the age of 30. “Seeing someone who shares similar values, background, and culture in a position of power feels very grounding and affirming. It shows that we belong here and that our voices matter,” said Dr Sayali Karke, 27, a medical professional and an immigrant from India. The mayoral election drew more than two million voters — a turnout last seen in 1969, according to the city’s Board of Elections, when 2.46 million people came out to vote for incumbent Mayor John Lindsay, who, after losing the Republican primary, was reelected on the Liberal line. Mamdani’s meteoric rise over the past year — from a lesser-known assemblyman to now the 111th mayor of New York, defeating well-established rivals such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa in both the Democratic primary and the general election — is nothing short of monumental. He’s coming for Trump and we’re here for it Running on a platform of progressive politics, Mamdani has pledged to prioritise five key policies: universal free childcare, a rent freeze on the city’s one million rent-stabilised apartments, rebuilding ties with his critics, reimagining the police department, and standing up to President Donald Trump’s attacks on the city. In his first speech as mayor, Mamdani addressed the president directly . “This is not how we stop Trump; this is how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up,” declared Mamdani, eliciting thunderous applause. A historic day indeed, to see a Muslim politician challenge the president of the United States on the world’s stage. And Trump was, in fact, watching. “AND SO IT BEGINS!”, he responded on his Truth Social platform. Mamdani now faces significant challenges as mayor in reconciling his ambitious agenda with the realities of governance amid deep political hostility and division. Trump has already launched a slew of scornful attacks on social media and threatened to halt federal funds to New York City. “If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Aside from the fact that Mamdani has clarified on multiple occasions that he is not a communist but a democratic socialist, the president does not have the authority to withhold federal funds from states. Under the US Constitution, that power lies with Congress. When Islamophobia met its match The scourge of Islamophobia presents yet another battle Mamdani and his Muslim supporters will continue to encounter. His campaign team, which included many Muslim staffers, endured harassment and discrimination but continued to press forward with unwavering resolve. “I was canvassing outside a mosque in Brooklyn, handing out fliers, when a group of young white men walked past, hurling Islamophobic insults because I was wearing a keffiyeh,” recalled a resident of Brooklyn, Zarah Shujjah, who is also an immigrant. “That incident gave me more conviction that we need a Muslim mayor. So, I showed up again the next day, and the next, and the next.” Throughout the campaign, Mamdani’s candidacy endured waves of racially charged attacks, from criticisms about his lack of experience to outright anti-Muslim slurs. Ellie Cohanim, a former deputy envoy in the first Trump Administration, posted a picture of the burning Twin Towers from September 11, 2001, captioned: “Never forget …. Vote Andrew Cuomo & save our city”. The New York Post ran headlines that conflated Mamdani with terrorism, and Cuomo himself engaged in Islamophobic remarks in an interview with the conservative radio host Sid Rosenberg. As Islamophobia persists across the United States, Muslim Americans finally feel a sense of solace and pride knowing that when Mamdani is sworn in on January 1, he will be the most powerful Muslim elected official in the country. “It’s shocking that I have seen a Muslim mayor in my 20s. It feels like a response to the polarising state of the country. We’re going to see more Trumps and Kirks pop up, but we’ll also see more Mamdanis. That’s both exciting and concerning. It’s a reality that represents the current state of US politics,” said Maria Mir, who moved to Brooklyn from Pakistan. The line between hope and hype While it’s tempting, and often politically useful, to glorify a newly elected leader in an age of virality, such adulation should be seen with caution. The internet has a way of turning people into symbols, often faster than they can grow into the roles those symbols demand. Elevating a figure as esteemed as Mamdani creates expectations: promises made on the campaign trail become moral contracts with voters, and supporters rightly expect those contracts to be honoured. It will be important to hold him accountable to his commitments and to the faith of those who propelled him to victory. That said, accountability and optimism for change are not mutually exclusive. Transitioning from campaigner to the daily grind of city leadership is a radical shift — from setting agendas to balancing budgets and operating within institutional constraints. In a city long dominated by wealth and entrenched interests, the odds are stacked against him. He must be afforded the leeway to falter as he transitions to his new role. Yet, for now, New Yorkers, and many others around the world can revel in this renewed sense of faith and watch as new beginnings start to unfold.

      "summary": "PESHAWAR: A key commander of the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) militant group was killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak in a late-evening police operation, sources told Dawn. Sources said that acting on an intelligence tip-off, police raided a hideout in Ambari village in Karak district. An exchange of fire ensued, resulting in the death of Nisar Hakim, a key IS-K commander. Four policemen were also wounded in the shootout, that lasted around four hours. According to sources, Hakim was believed to be the mastermind of a failed suicide bombing targeting the JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. Karak has long been under the radar of the security and intelligence apparatus for ISKP network and recruitment. It is one of the most underdeveloped districts in the province with one of the lowest socio-economic indicators, but it is known for its wild berry honey, much of which is exported to the Gulf and the Middle East. Incidentally, the ISKP network, was also associated with the honey trade. Published in Dawn, November 6th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "In a victory speech capping his meteoric rise, New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani quoted at length from the famous “ Tryst with Destiny ” address by independent India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. As he left the stage to a cheering cross-section of the metropolis, the song on the speaker was not one of the many well-worn tunes about New York but the beats from a Bollywood blockbuster, Dhoom . Mamdani, winning a mandate with a left-wing agenda focused on making New York more affordable, has made history in many ways — as the first Muslim and first South Asian to lead America’s largest city, and, at 34, its youngest mayor in a century. But Mamdani’s victory is a watershed not just for his identity but how he embraces it — fully. “I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older, I am Muslim, I am a democratic socialist and — most damning of all — I refuse to apologise for any of this,” Mamdani told supporters inside a Brooklyn music venue. South Asians constitute one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States, totalling more than five million people, and have made major inroads into politics — notably former vice president Kamala Harris , whose mother was from India. But candidates have handled their identity in sharply different ways. Two once-prominent Indian Americans, Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal , both Republican governors of conservative Southern states, took pains to describe how they had become Christians. “The comfort level expressing and embracing outwardly your identity has varied from candidate to candidate over the years,” said Kishan Putta, an elected commissioner in Washington DC who serves on a Democratic Party advisory committee on Asian Americans. Putta, who has followed South Asian candidates for years, also pointed to the victory in Virginia of Ghazala Hashmi as lieutenant governor, noting that the very first line on her website’s online biography is how she was the first Muslim and first South Asian American to serve in the Virginia Senate. “So it’s not just candidates in cities or places with huge South Asian and immigrant communities,” Putta added. “Candidates are getting much more comfortable in talking about their identity.” New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani waves next to his mother Mira Nair onstage after winning the 2025 New York City Mayoral race, at an election night rally in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, New York, US on Nov 4, 2025. — Reuters ‘Symbolic moment of acceptance’ For Mamdani, like many South Asians, that identity is not always concise to explain. He was born in Uganda to two prominent Indian-born parents — the academic Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair , who is Hindu. Mamdani has spoken passionately about Islamophobia following the Sept 11, 2001 attacks , counts a kebab counter in diverse Jackson Heights as his favourite restaurant and days before the election campaigned car to car at LaGuardia Airport among taxi drivers, who are often South Asian. View this post on Instagram Mamdani’s openness on his background “certainly is a break from what we have seen in the past”, said Sara Sadhwani, a political scientist at Pomona College who has studied South Asian Americans. “But that very much goes along with Mamdani’s brand of authenticity and embracing difference — fully accepting the nuance of those differences,” she said. “Even if all Indian Americans don’t completely embrace his politics, it is nonetheless a symbolic moment of acceptance of Indian Americans.” Trump base attacks US President Donald Trump has furiously attacked Mamdani but has earlier courted Indian Americans , making gains in last year’s election in a community that has historically voted Democratic and by some measures has the highest household income in the United States. Trump’s stance is not shared by all his base, with online far-right campaigners in recent months writing hateful comments against Indian Americans. Trump in September yanked up the fee for a visa used by Indian tech workers as part of a broader crackdown on immigration. US Vice President JD Vance is married to an Indian American, Usha Vance , but recently raised eyebrows by saying he would be happy if she converts from Hinduism to Christianity. Vance accused critics of anti-Christian bias.

      "summary_orig": "Continuing to comment on the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year, US President Donald Trump has now stated that eight planes were “essentially” shot down. “In eight months I ended eight wars, including Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda … Pakistan and India,” he said during a speech at the American Business Forum in Miami late on Wednesday. “I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them. And then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper — I won’t mention the newspaper because it’s usually fake news — but I heard they are going to war. Eight planes, seven planes were shot down — an eighth was really badly wounded [sic]. But eight planes were shot down essentially,” he said. He reiterated his previous claims that he threatened not to make trade deals unless the two countries agreed to peace. “I’m not trading with you; we are not making any deals with you if you are at war with each other,” he said. “A day later, I get a call, ‘We made peace’. They stopped. I said, ‘Thank you, let’s trade’. Isn’t that great? Tariffs did that. Without tariffs that would have never happened.” The US president has previously stated on several occasions that five to seven planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September. Just last month, he had said that seven “brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down” during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India. India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks. The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.",

      "summary_orig": "• Afridi warns proposed 27th Amendment will undermine provincial autonomy; vows to take all steps to resist legislation • Says any cut in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s 9.4pc share in NFC award unacceptable ISLAMABAD: The PTI parliamentary party on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution calling for the arrangement of a meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, after the chief minister was reportedly denied access on four occasions despite directions issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The resolution, which was later submitted to the National Assembly Secretariat, claimed that Mr Khan is the head of Pakistan’s largest political party and that it is the constitutional and democratic right of the KP chief minister to meet him in Adiala jail. Members of the parliamentary party deman­ded that the IHC’s orders be implemented, terming the continued denial a violation of democratic norms and parliamentary mandate. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was present during the meeting. Speaking to media persons, Mr Afridi warned that the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment would amount to an attack on provincial autonomy. He said that the KP government would take all possible steps to resist what he described as an attempt to roll back powers guaranteed to provinces under the Constitution. He stated that the proposed amendment was “nothing but an encroachment on provincial rights” and that it would not be tolerated at any cost. He added that PTI considered itself the guardian of the Constitution and would continue to protect it. KP CM to visit jail again today Responding to questions about his repeated attempts to meet the PTI founder in jail, Mr Afridi expressed disappointment that the IHC’s facilitation orders had not been implemented and said his democratic right had been violated. He announced that he would visit Adiala jail on Thursday (today), noting that meetings with Mr Khan were officially allowed on Tuesdays and Thursdays. About the NFC Award, Mr Afridi said that KP’s share of 19.4 per cent must not be reduced. He argued that KP had rendered the greatest sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, with many of its residents martyred, and that decreasing the province’s financial share would amount to ignoring those sacrifices. Post on Imran’s X account Meanwhile, a post issued from Imran Khan’s account on the social media platform X, reportedly based on comments shared by his sister, claimed that the rule of law no longer prevailed in the country. It remains unclear who currently operates Mr Khan’s account; however, he has never publicly disassociated himself from posts made in his name. The post described the current leadership as presiding over a period of “oppression” and alleged that incidents such as those of May 9, 2023, and the recent events in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Muridke represented abuses of state authority. In a message directed at supporters, the PTI founder stated that a nation which embraces the principle of “freedom or death” cannot be stopped from attaining true independence. He said that legal counsel Salman Akram Raja would transmit all party-related instructions and ensure their implementation. PTI to oppose 27th Amendment Separately, PTI Central Infor­mation Secre­tary Sheikh Waqas Akram reaffirmed that the party would go to any extent to block the proposed 27th Constitution Amendment. He alleged that a non-representative government was pushing the amendment to weaken provincial autonomy, politicise state institutions, curtail media freedom, restrict judicial independence, and concentrate power. He said the PTI would not allow the government to undo provincial rights, undermine parliamentary authority, or compromise on judicial oversight, stating that such measures would be unacceptable.

      "summary_orig": "• Airline says it will take legal action against protesting employees, claims partial restoration of flights • SAEP maintains it is not on strike, can’t issue clearance certificates at passengers’ expense RAWALPINDI: The PIA on Wednesday managed to “partially restore its flight operations” amid a protest by aircraft engineers under the umbrella of the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP). The tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP has been going on for three days over the safety of aircraft, causing delays in the departure of domestic and international flights at multiple major airports. On Wednesday, the PIA cancelled six flights to adjust the schedule of already delayed flights. On Monday night, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, and hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia. The PIA claimed that the engineers were on “strike” while the SAEP said that they were on duty but not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks. Against this backdrop, the PIA management called the SAEP president and general secretary for an inquiry on Tuesday, but they didn’t even show up on Wednesday. A PIA spokesman confirmed that the two office-bearers were summoned by the PIA management for the final hearing as an investigation against them had been underway. The PIA will initiate legal action against them in line with the law, he explained. He said that PIA flight operations had been partially restored through alternative means, hoping that the situation would become normal very soon. SAEP Secretary General Awais Jadoon said that they are on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances,” he explained. He said that the engineers were not on strike, adding that they could not make compromises on the safety of travellers, as they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying. When asked about their meeting with the PIA management, he explained that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them.

      "summary_orig": "PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday termed the proposed 27th amendment an “attack on the House” and said that he and his party would continue to raise their voices against it. According to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, proposals for this new amendment include setting up constitutional courts , restoring executive magistrates, ending protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces. Addressing the National Assembly today, the PTI chairman spoke about the proposed amendment, remarking that when the 26th Amendment was being passed, the PTI “made great efforts” with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. “Maybe this time we won’t need to visit his (Fazl) home, or sit with you in committee,” Gohar said, directly addressing the deputy speaker, who was chairing today’s session. “We will raise our voice against it as it is an attack on the House.” Gohar added: “Whenever there is a constitutional amendment anywhere in the world, it happens with a consensus and amends things according to the country’s needs.” The PTI chairman said the 27th Amendment is “against the spirit of this House and the Constitution”, asserting that the country cannot have further division and urging that no amendments be presented that put more pressure on the courts. “Amending the Constitution is this House’s right, and in this House, it is the right of those exact people who have the people’s mandate,” Gohar said. “Our democracy is very fragile; the people have no faith in the courts.” He told the deputy speaker that when the 18th Amendment was passed in 2010, it was “passed with consensus and unity with the people”. “The world acknowledged and celebrated it,” Gohar said. “However, when you presented the 26th Amendment, you brought 56 amendments, which were reduced to 25, then 18. We strongly opposed four of those amendments, including the constitutional bench, the tenure of judges and the preservation of the Election Commission. “This is a time when the nation is very divided; tensions are high, terrorism is on the rise, the deficit is rising and people cannot bear further problems. Please, be concerned about Pakistan’s security.” 27th amendment not meant to rollback 18th amendment: Tariq Fazal Chaudhry Responding to some points raised by opposition members, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry called for bringing “negative and false propaganda” to a halt. He assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th amendment. He denounced the attempts to make the 27th amendment controversial even before the official draft saw the light of day on the basis of assumptions and guesswork. He said there was no plan to take over the control of educational institutions and education boards in the provinces. “We are just talking about a uniform syllabus,” he remarked. Chaudhry said no step that weakened the federation, provinces and the relationship between them would be taken. “The purpose is to improve governance and bolster defence and strengthen the relationship between the federation and the provinces,” he remarked. He said allies and all stakeholders would be taken on board and matters regarding the National Finance Commission award would also be decided through consultation. He regretted that the 26th Amendment had also been dubbed as an attack on the independence of the judiciary. He noted that a separate constitutional court would help reduce the backlog. The minister pointed out that the establishment of the constitutional court had been agreed upon in the Charter of Democracy signed between the PML-N and PPP in 2006. He said amendments to the Constitution required a two-thirds majority and not consensus. He said the spirit of the Constitution would be followed. About the demand for the KP chief minister’s meeting with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, he said there was a procedure under the jail manual. He said Imran’s family members and counsels kept meeting him. PTI submits resolution in NA A resolution was submitted by PTI members in the National Assembly to arrange a meeting between KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Imran Khan, with PTI members signing the resolution. “This House affirms that consultation between elected representatives and their political leadership is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy,” stated the resolution. Recognising that lmran remains the head of the largest political party in the KP Assembly, the resolution said that the CM, as the constitutional head of the provincial government, “must be able to consult his leader on matters of governance and public mandate”. “This House considers the denial of such access a violation of democratic\nnorms and an affront to the constitutional spirit that upholds dialogue and accountability,” it said. Through the resolution, the PTI members urged both the federal and the Punjab governments to implement the orders of the Islamabad High Court pertaining to the CM’s meeting with Imran in letter and spirit. “This House further declares that such a meeting shall constitute an official\nand legitimate consultation between the Chief Executive of the Province and the Leader of the largest parliamentary party, consistent with the principles of representative democracy and federal comity,” the resolution stated. Last Thursday, CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the fourth time since assuming office. Afridi has termed consultation with Imran as crucial in order to announce his new provincial cabinet after he was elected as the chief minister in October.",
