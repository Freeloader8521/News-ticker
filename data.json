      "summary_orig": "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty met Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where the two discussed “defence and security cooperation, military exchanges, training collaborations and regional peace and stability”, a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO) said on Sunday. Abdelatty arrived in Islamabad last night for a two-day official visit and also met President Asif Ali Zardari and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar earlier today. The FO statement said during his meeting with Field Marshal Munir, “both sides reaffirmed the importance of continued high-level engagement between the armed forces of the two countries”. Egyptian FM meets Zardari Abdelatty also called on President Zardari at Aiwan-i-Sadr today. A statement by the President’s Secretariat said Zardari told the Egyptian FM that “Pakistan values its longstanding ties with Egypt, which are rooted in shared faith and mutual respect, and looks forward to advancing the relationship in a more structured and forward-looking direction”. He also conveyed warm greetings for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi. According to the statement, the president noted that “this year marks 77 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries and expressed the hope that both sides will reinvigorate cooperation in trade, investment and people-to-people exchanges”. He encouraged greater Egyptian investment in sectors where opportunities are expanding, including energy, logistics, construction, agriculture, mining and IT, the statement said. For his part, Abdelatty delivered a message from the Egyptian president and expressed “Egypt’s keen interest in expanding its partnership with Pakistan in various fields”, it added. The two sides also exchanged views on key regional and international issues, reaffirming their resolve to work together for peace, stability, and prosperity. The statement said earlier, the two leaders also held a one-on-one meeting and exchanged views on key issues of mutual interest. Pakistan to share list of 250 business houses Before meeting with Zardari, Abdelatty also met Dar separately, and the two addressed a joint press conference. Dar said during the press conference that he and Abdelatty had a “very, very focused discussion” today on how their nations could contribute to elevating the business-to-business upscaling of the bilateral activities, which the deputy PM termed as “surely not commensurate”, with around $300 million. “With the depth and the affection the two countries have, […] Pakistan will share with Egypt a comprehensive list of 250 Pakistani business houses representing key sectors of the economy,” Dar announced. “These businesses will be facilitated and supported to enhance bilateral commercial engagement,” the deputy premier highlighted. The deputy PM detailed that the business houses will be chosen from “across the board” and through due consultation. The list of businesses “representing each sector of the economy” will be initially prepared by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) in collaboration with the other chambers of commerce. Dar asserted there would be a “very transparent selection of those who really deserve and are willing to work and cooperate, and enhance the business”. The businesses, after “due diligence in Egypt”, would be declared as the “white list”, Dar said. Noting that the foreign ministry was receiving complaints of waiting too long to obtain a business visa “very frequently”, the minister said those concerns will “cease at least to the extent of these top 250” businesses. Dar further said that in the three-month period after three months have passed since the first list, Islamabad would select another 250 businesses to take the original list to 500. He added that the Egyptian FM had also agreed to “process the list and that would again be added to the existing white list at that time from 250 to 500”. The deputy PM went on to announce that a Pakistan-Egypt Business Council will be established after that to institutionalise private sector cooperation and to promote mutually beneficial commercial partnership and B2B business promotion between Pakistan and Egypt. “Once these two steps are done, Pakistan and Egyptian Business Forum will also be established,” Dar stated, adding that it would be co-chaired by the two foreign ministers. Its first meeting would be convened in Cairo in the second quarter of 2026, to advance trade, investment and economic collaboration. Dar also acknowledged with “little embarrassment” that the Pakistan-Egypt Joint Ministerial Commission had not met since 2010, and neither had the two countries held bilateral political consultations. Therefore, it was decided that the political consultations would be held in the first quarter of 2026, with Egypt nominating an assistant minister to head its delegation, while the Pakistani team would be led by the foreign secretary. “They will do the entire preparatory work and agenda for the Joint Ministerial Commission meeting, which has not taken place in 15 years, to be held in the second quarter of 2026,” Dar explained. “Discussions today reaffirm the strength of Pakistan-Egypt relations, and our shared commitment to further enhance bilateral cooperation across political, economic, defence, cultural and people-to-people domains,” Dar said. “We agreed to work towards a more structured framework of cooperation and to explore new avenues of partnership,” the deputy premier noted, adding he was confident that the visit would “open new avenues of practical cooperation” between the two countries. Dar noted that the two leaders also assessed the regional developments, with “particular focus on the grave situation in Gaza”. “Pakistan appreciates Egypt’s vital role in humanitarian support, mediation efforts and diplomatic engagement to uphold the ceasefire and safeguard the rights of the Palestinian people.” “Pakistan values Egypt as a key partner in the Muslim world and looks forward to continued engagement at all levels,” Dar affirmed. The two ministers also discussed India-occupied Kashmir , Afghanistan and cooperation at multilateral fora. Dar noted Abdelatty’s visit reflected the “longstanding friendship” between the brotherly countries of Pakistan and Egypt. The foreign minister said his Egyptian counterpart also announced the doubling of scholarships this year for Pakistani scholars who wish to study in Al Azhar University. “While staying in the religious domain, Al Azhar University [offers] courses on how to eliminate terrorism,” Dar pointed out, adding that scholars would learn how to tackle the menace as per religious teachings. The deputy premier went on to mention that he and Abdelatty met frequently on the sidelines of various global moots this year: “This year, we have met at least half a dozen times if I’m not wrong.” Islamabad, Cairo agree to intensify coordination to counter cross-border terrorism At the outset of his remarks, Abdelatty conveyed Egypt’s condolences over the “tragic loss of lives and injuries” in the recent terrorist attacks in Islamabad and Peshawar . “We stand in full solidarity with Pakistan in the fight against violent extremism and terrorism,” the Egyptian top diplomat affirmed. “The issue of fighting terrorism is extremely important and we stand ready to share with our brothers and sisters here in Pakistan our very successful experience in fighting terrorism through a holistic approach focusing not only on the security dimension, but also socio-economic dimensions, as well as fighting extremist ideology through the very moderate religious institutions in Egypt, notably the Al-Azhar al-Sharif, Dar Al Ifta and the Ministry of Waqf.” The Egyptian FM said, “In the security domain, we have agreed to intensify our coordination to counter cross-border terrorism and extremism. “Furthermore, we are eager to leverage this spiritual and intellectual leadership of Al-Azhar al-Sharif to strengthen our joint efforts in promoting moderate discourse and combatting extremist ideology,” he added. Terming the discussions “extensive and constructive”, Abdelatty said they focused on how to “enhance the partnership that exists between Egypt and Pakistan, and reaffirm our commitment to further strengthen and deepen bilateral cooperation across all areas, including political dialogue, economic partnership, trade, investment, security and defence cooperation, and cultural and educational exchanges”. ‘Agreed to intensify coordination on the Palestinian cause’ The two ministers also exchanged views on regional and international developments, stressing the “importance of peaceful resolution of conflicts, respect for sovereignty, and adherence to the principles of international law and the UN charter”. “This visit comes at a pivotal moment of our region,” Abdelatty said, recalling that Egypt, alongside Pakistan and other countries, “mediated and voted” on the Gaza ceasefire agreement that was signed in Sharm El-Sheikh. “Egypt will continue uncompromising efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and we are working very hard with Pakistan on that.“ The Egyptian FM asserted that the two-state solution was the “only viable path towards genuine and lasting regional stability, which could only be achieved through the creation of a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state based on the UN pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital”. “It is within this context we agreed to intensify our coordination and consultations on the Palestinian cause, particularly the situation in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,” he added, appreciating Pakistan’s “unwavering solidarity and support for Egypt’s efforts to achieve a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause”. Abdelatty went on to invite Pakistan to an upcoming conference on the reconstruction of Gaza. “I reiterated Egypt’s willingness to work closely with Pakistan to address global challenges, from countering terrorism to climate change to food security,” the diplomat said. Abdelatty appreciated Pakistan’s “steadfast support in various multilateral forums”, affirming that Cairo remained committed to close coordination on issues of mutual concern. Sky’s the limit for our cooperation: Egypt FM Addressing the media prior to his meeting with Dar, FM Abdelatty termed Pakistan his “second home country”. “I would also like to convey our deep appreciation of our very cordial relation with Pakistan,” he said, acknowledging “common challenges” on the economic, political and security levels. “That, of course, encourages us to work together and to cooperate in terms of exchange of best practices and expertise to help each other, and to confirm that stability and peace and development are the main pillars of our strategic partnership,” Abdelatty said. “We would like to elevate our relationship to the strategic level,” the minister added. View this post on Instagram Noting that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi had instructed him to further enhance bilateral cooperation with Islamabad, Abdelatty said, “Sky’s the limit for our cooperation.” He expressed Egypt’s willingness to “reinvigorate the existing institutional mechanism of dialogue and cooperation” between Pakistan and Egypt, especially the JMC. “So it’s timely now to convene the upcoming joint committee meeting. We would also like to agree on a roadmap for our cooperation, which will cover all areas of cooperation — political, economic, investment, trade, security, religious and cultural dimensions.” “Pakistan holds its relations with Egypt in very high regard and we view this visit as an important opportunity to advance our common objective,” the deputy premier highlighted. “I appreciate the positive momentum in our recent engagements at different levels, including our interactions on the margins of regional and multilateral fora around the globe,” he added. View this post on Instagram “Egyptian and Pakistani brotherhood is broadly known all over the world,” he said, adding that both he and Abdelatty had a great responsibility to take their countries’ diplomatic, economic, trade, business, security, and defence relations to a “much higher level”. Earlier today, Dar received FM Abdelatty upon his arrival at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Foreign Office said on social media platform X. More to follow",

      "summary_en": "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty met Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where the two discussed “defence and security cooperation, military exchanges, training collaborations and regional peace and stability”, a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO) said on Sunday. Abdelatty arrived in Islamabad last night for a two-day official visit and also met President Asif Ali Zardari and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar earlier today. The FO statement said during his meeting with Field Marshal Munir, “both sides reaffirmed the importance of continued high-level engagement between the armed forces of the two countries”. Egyptian FM meets Zardari Abdelatty also called on President Zardari at Aiwan-i-Sadr today. A statement by the President’s Secretariat said Zardari told the Egyptian FM that “Pakistan values its longstanding ties with Egypt, which are rooted in shared faith and mutual respect, and looks forward to advancing the relationship in a more structured and forward-looking direction”. He also conveyed warm greetings for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi. According to the statement, the president noted that “this year marks 77 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries and expressed the hope that both sides will reinvigorate cooperation in trade, investment and people-to-people exchanges”. He encouraged greater Egyptian investment in sectors where opportunities are expanding, including energy, logistics, construction, agriculture, mining and IT, the statement said. For his part, Abdelatty delivered a message from the Egyptian president and expressed “Egypt’s keen interest in expanding its partnership with Pakistan in various fields”, it added. The two sides also exchanged views on key regional and international issues, reaffirming their resolve to work together for peace, stability, and prosperity. The statement said earlier, the two leaders also held a one-on-one meeting and exchanged views on key issues of mutual interest. Pakistan to share list of 250 business houses Before meeting with Zardari, Abdelatty also met Dar separately, and the two addressed a joint press conference. Dar said during the press conference that he and Abdelatty had a “very, very focused discussion” today on how their nations could contribute to elevating the business-to-business upscaling of the bilateral activities, which the deputy PM termed as “surely not commensurate”, with around $300 million. “With the depth and the affection the two countries have, […] Pakistan will share with Egypt a comprehensive list of 250 Pakistani business houses representing key sectors of the economy,” Dar announced. “These businesses will be facilitated and supported to enhance bilateral commercial engagement,” the deputy premier highlighted. The deputy PM detailed that the business houses will be chosen from “across the board” and through due consultation. The list of businesses “representing each sector of the economy” will be initially prepared by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) in collaboration with the other chambers of commerce. Dar asserted there would be a “very transparent selection of those who really deserve and are willing to work and cooperate, and enhance the business”. The businesses, after “due diligence in Egypt”, would be declared as the “white list”, Dar said. Noting that the foreign ministry was receiving complaints of waiting too long to obtain a business visa “very frequently”, the minister said those concerns will “cease at least to the extent of these top 250” businesses. Dar further said that in the three-month period after three months have passed since the first list, Islamabad would select another 250 businesses to take the original list to 500. He added that the Egyptian FM had also agreed to “process the list and that would again be added to the existing white list at that time from 250 to 500”. The deputy PM went on to announce that a Pakistan-Egypt Business Council will be established after that to institutionalise private sector cooperation and to promote mutually beneficial commercial partnership and B2B business promotion between Pakistan and Egypt. “Once these two steps are done, Pakistan and Egyptian Business Forum will also be established,” Dar stated, adding that it would be co-chaired by the two foreign ministers. Its first meeting would be convened in Cairo in the second quarter of 2026, to advance trade, investment and economic collaboration. Dar also acknowledged with “little embarrassment” that the Pakistan-Egypt Joint Ministerial Commission had not met since 2010, and neither had the two countries held bilateral political consultations. Therefore, it was decided that the political consultations would be held in the first quarter of 2026, with Egypt nominating an assistant minister to head its delegation, while the Pakistani team would be led by the foreign secretary. “They will do the entire preparatory work and agenda for the Joint Ministerial Commission meeting, which has not taken place in 15 years, to be held in the second quarter of 2026,” Dar explained. “Discussions today reaffirm the strength of Pakistan-Egypt relations, and our shared commitment to further enhance bilateral cooperation across political, economic, defence, cultural and people-to-people domains,” Dar said. “We agreed to work towards a more structured framework of cooperation and to explore new avenues of partnership,” the deputy premier noted, adding he was confident that the visit would “open new avenues of practical cooperation” between the two countries. Dar noted that the two leaders also assessed the regional developments, with “particular focus on the grave situation in Gaza”. “Pakistan appreciates Egypt’s vital role in humanitarian support, mediation efforts and diplomatic engagement to uphold the ceasefire and safeguard the rights of the Palestinian people.” “Pakistan values Egypt as a key partner in the Muslim world and looks forward to continued engagement at all levels,” Dar affirmed. The two ministers also discussed India-occupied Kashmir , Afghanistan and cooperation at multilateral fora. Dar noted Abdelatty’s visit reflected the “longstanding friendship” between the brotherly countries of Pakistan and Egypt. The foreign minister said his Egyptian counterpart also announced the doubling of scholarships this year for Pakistani scholars who wish to study in Al Azhar University. “While staying in the religious domain, Al Azhar University [offers] courses on how to eliminate terrorism,” Dar pointed out, adding that scholars would learn how to tackle the menace as per religious teachings. The deputy premier went on to mention that he and Abdelatty met frequently on the sidelines of various global moots this year: “This year, we have met at least half a dozen times if I’m not wrong.” Islamabad, Cairo agree to intensify coordination to counter cross-border terrorism At the outset of his remarks, Abdelatty conveyed Egypt’s condolences over the “tragic loss of lives and injuries” in the recent terrorist attacks in Islamabad and Peshawar . “We stand in full solidarity with Pakistan in the fight against violent extremism and terrorism,” the Egyptian top diplomat affirmed. “The issue of fighting terrorism is extremely important and we stand ready to share with our brothers and sisters here in Pakistan our very successful experience in fighting terrorism through a holistic approach focusing not only on the security dimension, but also socio-economic dimensions, as well as fighting extremist ideology through the very moderate religious institutions in Egypt, notably the Al-Azhar al-Sharif, Dar Al Ifta and the Ministry of Waqf.” The Egyptian FM said, “In the security domain, we have agreed to intensify our coordination to counter cross-border terrorism and extremism. “Furthermore, we are eager to leverage this spiritual and intellectual leadership of Al-Azhar al-Sharif to strengthen our joint efforts in promoting moderate discourse and combatting extremist ideology,” he added. Terming the discussions “extensive and constructive”, Abdelatty said they focused on how to “enhance the partnership that exists between Egypt and Pakistan, and reaffirm our commitment to further strengthen and deepen bilateral cooperation across all areas, including political dialogue, economic partnership, trade, investment, security and defence cooperation, and cultural and educational exchanges”. ‘Agreed to intensify coordination on the Palestinian cause’ The two ministers also exchanged views on regional and international developments, stressing the “importance of peaceful resolution of conflicts, respect for sovereignty, and adherence to the principles of international law and the UN charter”. “This visit comes at a pivotal moment of our region,” Abdelatty said, recalling that Egypt, alongside Pakistan and other countries, “mediated and voted” on the Gaza ceasefire agreement that was signed in Sharm El-Sheikh. “Egypt will continue uncompromising efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and we are working very hard with Pakistan on that.“ The Egyptian FM asserted that the two-state solution was the “only viable path towards genuine and lasting regional stability, which could only be achieved through the creation of a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state based on the UN pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital”. “It is within this context we agreed to intensify our coordination and consultations on the Palestinian cause, particularly the situation in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,” he added, appreciating Pakistan’s “unwavering solidarity and support for Egypt’s efforts to achieve a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause”. Abdelatty went on to invite Pakistan to an upcoming conference on the reconstruction of Gaza. “I reiterated Egypt’s willingness to work closely with Pakistan to address global challenges, from countering terrorism to climate change to food security,” the diplomat said. Abdelatty appreciated Pakistan’s “steadfast support in various multilateral forums”, affirming that Cairo remained committed to close coordination on issues of mutual concern. Sky’s the limit for our cooperation: Egypt FM Addressing the media prior to his meeting with Dar, FM Abdelatty termed Pakistan his “second home country”. “I would also like to convey our deep appreciation of our very cordial relation with Pakistan,” he said, acknowledging “common challenges” on the economic, political and security levels. “That, of course, encourages us to work together and to cooperate in terms of exchange of best practices and expertise to help each other, and to confirm that stability and peace and development are the main pillars of our strategic partnership,” Abdelatty said. “We would like to elevate our relationship to the strategic level,” the minister added. View this post on Instagram Noting that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi had instructed him to further enhance bilateral cooperation with Islamabad, Abdelatty said, “Sky’s the limit for our cooperation.” He expressed Egypt’s willingness to “reinvigorate the existing institutional mechanism of dialogue and cooperation” between Pakistan and Egypt, especially the JMC. “So it’s timely now to convene the upcoming joint committee meeting. We would also like to agree on a roadmap for our cooperation, which will cover all areas of cooperation — political, economic, investment, trade, security, religious and cultural dimensions.” “Pakistan holds its relations with Egypt in very high regard and we view this visit as an important opportunity to advance our common objective,” the deputy premier highlighted. “I appreciate the positive momentum in our recent engagements at different levels, including our interactions on the margins of regional and multilateral fora around the globe,” he added. View this post on Instagram “Egyptian and Pakistani brotherhood is broadly known all over the world,” he said, adding that both he and Abdelatty had a great responsibility to take their countries’ diplomatic, economic, trade, business, security, and defence relations to a “much higher level”.

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Sunday expressed concerns about Israel’s commitment to peace in Gaza, saying that Muslim countries that had supported the peace treaty may need to “reassess their stance” in the face of continued violations of the fragile ceasefire in the region. Despite the declaration of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on October 9, Israel has continued to bombard the territory while a long-term plan for peace is discussed. The defence minister posted today on social media platform X that the ceasefire agreement had been criticised for being one-sided and that Israeli forces “continue to violate the truce, killing Palestinians including children”. “The agreement, signed in Sharm el-Sheikh, was meant to bring stability to the region, but Israel’s actions have raised concerns about its commitment to the deal,” Asif said. The defence minister added, “Muslim countries that supported the treaty, including Turkiye, Egypt, and Qatar, may need to reassess their stance given the ongoing violence. “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already expressed concerns, stating that the ceasefire agreement shouldn’t be mistaken for a final settlement to the Palestinian issue,” he said. Asif pointed out that since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, at least 352 Palestinians had been killed, while over 70,000 people had lost their lives in Gaza since the start of the conflict. He added that Amnesty International had warned that “Israel’s genocide is not over, and the international community especially western governments must keep pressuring Israel to abide by international law”. A cornerstone of the United States-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. However, countries that had previously supported the plan have since expressed reservations. Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said that Pakistan was willing to commit troops to the Gaza peace force, but “not ready” to participate in the disarming of Hamas. “We are not ready for that. This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement,” he said.",

The defence minister posted today on social media platform X that the ceasefire agreement had been criticised for being one-sided and that Israeli forces “continue to violate the truce, killing Palestinians including children”. “The agreement, signed in Sharm el-Sheikh, was meant to bring stability to the region, but Israel’s actions have raised concerns about its commitment to the deal,” Asif said. The defence minister added, “Muslim countries that supported the treaty, including Turkiye, Egypt, and Qatar, may need to reassess their stance given the ongoing violence. “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already expressed concerns, stating that the ceasefire agreement shouldn’t be mistaken for a final settlement to the Palestinian issue,” he said. Asif pointed out that since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, at least 352 Palestinians had been killed, while over 70,000 people had lost their lives in Gaza since the start of the conflict. He added that Amnesty International had warned that “Israel’s genocide is not over, and the international community especially western governments must keep pressuring Israel to abide by international law”. A cornerstone of the United States-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. However, countries that had previously supported the plan have since expressed reservations. Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said that Pakistan was willing to commit troops to the Gaza peace force, but “not ready” to participate in the disarming of Hamas. “We are not ready for that. This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The Pakis­tan Population Summit 2025 , a dialogue on the country’s high population rate, will be held in Islamabad from Dec 1 to 2. Data compiled by research organisation Population Council, UK Aid and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) shows the average annual growth rate in Pakistan — based on data from 2017 to 2023 — is 2.55 per cent , resulting in a population of 241.5 million, making it the fifth most populous country in the world. The country is on course to cross 300 million within the next five years and edge towards 400 million by 2050. According to a DawnMedia press release, the two-day event will take place at the Serena Hotel. The event will take stock of the situation in Pakistan, as it faces the challenges of rising population growth outpacing available resources. “Urgent and serious action is required to bridge the growing gap between demographic increase and sustainable resource management. Recognising the crucial implications of a high population growth rate on Pakistan’s economy, social infrastructure, education, health, food and water security, and employment is critical,” it said. The summit is aimed at bringing together politicians, economists, development specialists, and private-sector leaders to establish a practical pathway to long-term growth. Notable speakers exp­ected to address the event include Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb, among others. The summit is being organised by DawnMedia in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning, De­­v­­elopment and Special Ini­tiatives; the Ministry of Na­­tional Health Services, Regulations and Coordi­nation; the Sindh government, the KP government, UK International Deve­lopment and the World Bank Group as principal partners. It is supported by the Karachi Water and Sewe­rage Corporation, while the Population Council and FCDO serve as strategic partners, while Pathfinder International, Population Services International, QZ Catalyst, and UNFPA contribute as knowledge partners. Ipsos and Repu Media-Acumen Media Intel­ligence also support the initiative as research partners. Published in Dawn, November 30th, 2025",

Jhang Satellite Town police said the attackers managed to flee after the shooting. Munir Sadhana was on the way to Jhang District Courts Complex when his car was attacked near Bilqees Hospital. As a result of firing, his driver Mumtaz Ahmad died instantly while Sadhana himself, shopkeeper and passer-by Mushtaq were shifted to Jhang District Headquarters Hospital where Sadhana and passer-by also succumbed to their injuries. The lawyer was a close aide of former federal interior minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat , who was present at the hospital to receive the body of his friend along with relatives of the deceased. Deputy Commissioner Ali Akbar Bhinder and DPO Bilal Kiani were also present. As soon as news of attack reached the courts, the lawyers started their strike. In a press release, DBA President Mehr Muhammad Fareed Nawaz Naul has announced three working days of mourning over the assassination of Sadhana. He demanded the immediate arrest of the killers. Till the filing of this report, no FIR was registered and the police said they had not received a complaint for registration of the case yet. A large number of people, including lawyers, judges and government officers, attended the funeral prayers for Sadhana at Church Ground. ACCIDENT: A motorcycle rider died and his two pillions were injured critically after a speeding car hit their two-wheeler near the FDA City gate on the Sargodha Road. Nishatabad police identified the deceased as Ahmad Ali (19) of Chak 46-JB and injured as Naveed (18) and Nawaz (21). Both the injured were shifted to Allied Hospital. The car driver fled after the accident. Meanwhile, a 22-year-old unidentified man died at Allied Hospital after being hit by a train near the graveyard of Chak Bhaiwala in Millat Town police area. He was crossing the track when he was hit by the train. APPROVAL: The Provincial Development Working Party (PWDP) has approved the establishment of a landfill site for waste management in Faisalabad. The landfill site, which will be established on 150 acres, at the locality of Lakwana located on the Makkuana-Khurianwala Road will have a capacity to dump 1,100 tonnes of waste every day while a plan for recycling waste/garbage is also included in it. Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar said there was a dire need for a landfill site in Faisalabad and the approval of funds for it by the PWDP was a significant step.

      "summary_orig": "Between 2004 and 2006, a rogue elephant in a district of the Indian state of Assam was responsible for the deaths of 27 people. The terrified local community nicknamed the animal ‘Osama bin Laden’, after the then-leader of the global terrorist organisation Al-Qaeda. The Indian government eventually issued shoot-to-kill orders, and a professional hunter was contracted for the task. Aided by the people of the small Assamese town of Behali, the hunter successfully cornered the destructive elephant and shot it dead. While most of the affected population celebrated the elephant’s demise, a significant number of sceptics arose. They argued that an innocent animal had been slain and that ‘Osama’ remained alive and active. This belief persisted even though the elephant was never seen again. The doubters continued to present ‘evidence’ suggesting it was alive and had likely gone into hiding. In 2011, when the terrorist Osama bin Laden was shot dead by American Navy Seals, sceptics flooded social media sites to claim that a ‘body double’ of the terrorist had been killed and the real Osama was still alive. They argued that the decision by the Americans not to release graphic photos and DNA evidence was a reason for doubt. The US government stated the decision was made to avoid inciting further violence and to prevent the creation of a shrine, and that DNA evidence from family members confirmed the identity beyond a doubt. While it is wise to question everything in the information age, questioning the obvious is not an exercise in critical thinking Despite the abundance of evidence confirming that he was shot and his body disposed of in the open sea, and that he was never seen or heard from again, a small but persistent group of sceptics remains unconvinced. In 2019, an acquaintance with a PhD in economics insisted that bin Laden’s killing was a hoax and that he was still alive. When I challenged the convoluted theories he offered to support his claims, he accused me of undermining ‘critical thinking.’ Critical thinking requires one to think clearly and rationally, basing conclusions on facts and evidence rather than emotion or personal opinion. The economist in question did the exact opposite. He presented his opinion as fact and relied on his emotional desire to see a violent “challenger” to “American imperialism” succeed as his sole “evidence”. More than evidence, this was wishful thinking. For years, academics and scholars have been bemoaning the gradual decline in people’s ability to apply critical thinking. According to the American online learning specialist Holly Burns, and many like her, this loss is driven by several factors. Modern information consumption favours speed and superficiality over depth and reflection; our current social and political environment rewards fast, emotional responses and conformity; and many educational systems prioritise standardised testing and recall at the expense of developing complex reasoning skills. Then there are growing incidents of formulating conspiracy theories and presenting them as outcomes of critical thinking. This is what my economist friend was doing. In an article for the British Psychology Society , the journalist and author Emily Reynolds posited that the confusion between conspiracy theories and critical thinking stems from their shared starting point: both involve scepticism and rejection of official narratives. Both their starting point is a sceptical question. But their routes to investigate or answer the question quickly bifurcate. Critical thinking is about looking for the most convincing answer backed by solid evidence, even if the evidence produces an answer that is not to the liking of the questioner. A conspiracy theorist’s quest is more about ‘unmasking’ a perceived conspiracy and discarding any evidence that fails to back the claim of a diabolical plot. Critical thinking does not reject official claims outright — rather, it rigorously tests these claims against evidence before reaching a conclusion. In contrast, conspiracy theorists immediately reject official narratives and declare them as lies used to conceal a ‘truth’, often without any convincing counter-evidence. Their subsequent effort is almost entirely focused on ‘proving’ this predetermined conclusion. In the 2025 issue of the Journal of Intelligence , Professor Oscar Eugenio Tamayo Alzate wrote that critical thinking is “epistemic”. It involves thinking about the nature of knowledge and how we justify beliefs. It is a process of inquiry focused on acquiring true beliefs, evaluating claims and understanding the limits of what we know. It requires an understanding of how we construct, evaluate and use knowledge. According to a 2017 essay in Current Directions in Psychological Science , whereas critical thinking’s motivation is epistemic, conspiracy theories have “existential motives.” Studies have shown that people are likely to turn to conspiracy theories when they are anxious and feel powerless. Conspiracy belief is strongly related to lack of social or political control. This dynamic is compounded by the now widely accepted consensus within the scientific community that individuals with low analytical and critical thinking skills often overestimate their own competence. And these are the people more likely to shape or believe in conspiracy theories. They genuinely believe that their ability to question the mainstream narrative is a sign of high intelligence and insight. This ‘delusion’ feels reassuring to a person confused or disturbed by certain events. The individual actively looks for information that supports his belief in a conspiracy, refusing to accommodate and even suspect any evidence to the contrary. The sense of power in them comes from the belief that, apparently, they have decoded something secretive, hidden and only known to a few. The final boundary lies in what is being questioned. Last year, a well-known TV journalist shared a meme-like image of a turkey crossing the road while carrying a kitchen knife. The journalist asked, “Is this real?” Apart from the image being clearly amateurish and having the AI tool watermark visible, questioning it was not an exercise in critical thinking. Nor did it warrant a deep dive. While it is wise to question everything in the information age, questioning the obvious is not critical thinking. There is more than enough evidence that Osama the terrorist and Osama the elephant are both permanently gone, confirmed by both official evidence and robust critical assessment. Questioning these assessments is like questioning the obvious. Turkeys don’t walk around carrying knives. Questioning this is not a sign of critical thinking, but sloppy pretence. And maybe, even delusions about oneself, which often lead to conspiratorial beliefs. Published in Dawn, EOS, November 30th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday rejected what it called the “baseless” statement by United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk expressing concerns about the 27th Constitutional Amendment. In a statement issued in Geneva on Friday, the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society. He added that the “hastily adopted” amendments undermined judicial independence and raised concerns about military accountability. A press release issued by the FO said that Pakistan rejected the “baseless” statement. “Pakistan notes with deep concern the ungrounded and misplaced apprehensions aired on behalf of the UN high commissioner for human rights regarding the 27th Constitutional Amendment adopted by the two-third majority of the parliament of Pakistan,” the press release by the FO said. “Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the Constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan,” it added. The FO said that democracy and democratic methods “form the bedrock of civil and political rights, and therefore must be respected”. “The constitutional amendments adopted by the parliament of Pakistan followed due procedures as enshrined in Pakistan’s Constitution,” it said. It added that Pakistan remained “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law” as enshrined in the Constitution. “While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan’s views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the FO said. “We urge the high commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan’s parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation.” The recent 27th Amendment was pushed through Parliament at top speed earlier this month amid widespread outcry. Among the top concerns are its overhaul of the judicial system via the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court, and changes to Article 243 positioning the army chief as the new Chief of Defence Forces at the top of Pakistan’s armed services.",

What do you think about this idea of some sort of values test for people who are coming on temporary visas? There is already the citizenship test for those who want to become citizens, but if you are coming temporary visa, on any of these visas you are talking about, do think there should be some sort of values test? Is that a problem the moment? I don’t think it hurts … When you’ve seen the discord on streets, particularly of Sydney and Melbourne over the last two years since October 2023, I think there is a risk that we as Australians can’t import the hate that permeates in some other parts of the world. I think it’s important we make sure that when we do bring people from those challenged parts of the world, that they understand they are coming here with a responsibility to live up to the values and principles that our great country has been built on, with is migration, but how we have come together to be able to achieve a harmonious society for most of it and not allow that hate that permeates in some parts of the world to be imported in.

Is that a problem the moment? I don’t think it hurts … When you’ve seen the discord on streets, particularly of Sydney and Melbourne over the last two years since October 2023, I think there is a risk that we as Australians can’t import the hate that permeates in some other parts of the world. I think it’s important we make sure that when we do bring people from those challenged parts of the world, that they understand they are coming here with a responsibility to live up to the values and principles that our great country has been built on, with is migration, but how we have come together to be able to achieve a harmonious society for most of it and not allow that hate that permeates in some parts of the world to be imported in. Different individuals and groups have been misrepresenting key cost estimates from the [ Net Zero ] Australia Project as ‘the cost of Australia reaching net zero’. These misrepresented costs have typically ranged from $1.5 trillion to $9 trillion.” Continue reading...",

The first blast took place near a police checkpost on Qambrani Road, where unidentified atta­ckers hurled a grenade. The device exploded but caused no loss of life. Police said the second blast occurred shortly afterwards on the same road, when armed men detonated a motorcycle carrying an improvised explosive device (IED) as a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) vehicle passed by, carrying bomb disposal squad personnel to the site of the first explosion. “Miscreants planted an IED on the motorbike and detonated it with a remote control when the CTD vehicle was passing through the area,” SSP Operations Capt (retd) Asif Khan told Dawn , adding that the CTD vehicle escaped the blast and no casualties were reported in either attack. SSP Khan said two more explosions were reported in the evening. “One blast took place on the railway track near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, which blew up the main line connecting Quetta with other parts of the country,” he said. No casualties reported; seven explosions occur in Quetta, Dera Murad Jamali Police said an IED had been planted on the track and was detonated shortly before a train was exp­e­c­ted to arrive in Quetta. “Around one and a half feet of the track was blown up in the blast,” an official added. Rail traffic was suspended while repair work was initiated. In another incident, unknown motorcyclists hurled a grenade at Manzoor Shaheed Police Station, but the device failed to explode. A bomb disposal squad later defused it. Later in the evening, unidentified attackers hurled another grenade in the Kechi Beg area at a police patrol. The grenade exploded, but no casualties were reported. Meanwhile, armed men also targeted a police vehicle at DC Chowk in Dera Murad Jamali by throwing a grenade. The device did not explode and was defused by the bomb disposal squad. Police said the vehicle was on routine patrol when it came under attack. In yet another incident late on Saturday night, unidentified armed men attacked the camp of a construction company in Quetta’s Sariab area. Police said motorcyclist hurled a grenade at the site, damaging mac­h­inery and injuring a security guard, who was shif­ted to the Civil Hospital. The company is currently engaged in the construction of Sariab Road. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the incidents.

      "summary_orig": "• Kyiv plunges into darkness as grid hit in Russian strikes; three killed • Moscow’s oil terminal halts operations after Black Sea drone attack KYIV/MOSCOW: Ukrainian Presi­d­ent Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation headed by security council secretary Rustem Umerov was on its way to the United States to continue talks on an agreement to end Russia’s war. Umerov has been put in charge of the Ukrainian delegation after the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky’s powerful chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned on Friday hours after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment. Zelensky said he expected that the res­ults of previous meetings with the US in Geneva, which took place last weekend, would now be “hammered out” on Sunday. Those meetings allowed Ukraine to present a counter-offer to proposals laid out by US Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll to leaders in Kyiv almost two weeks ago. “Rustem delivered a report today, and the task is clear: to swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war,” Zelensky wrote on X. Yermak told the New York Post hours after his resignation that he was “going to the front”. “I am an honest and decent person,” he said. Russian oil terminal One of Russia’s largest oil terminals halted operations on Saturday following an attack by sea drones. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), a group that includes US oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil and which owns the terminal, called the strike a “terrorist attack”. Ukraine, which did not comment on the incident, has sought to punch back against its neighbour as the war grinds through its fourth year. “As a result of a targeted terrorist attack by unmanned boats at 4:06am Moscow time (6:06 PKT) single Mooring Point 2 (SMP-2) sustained significant damage,” the CPC said in a statement on Telegram. “Further operation of SMP-2 is not possible. Loadings at the terminal will be carried out in accordance with established rules once the drone threats are lifted,” it added. The CPC pipeline, which begins in Kazakhstan and ends at the terminal, is a major conduit for Kazakh oil and one of the world’s largest by volume, handling around one percent of global supplies. A Ukrainian source, meanwhile, clai­m­ed responsibility for attacks on two oil tankers in the Black Sea allegedly cover­tly transporting sanctioned Russian oil. The two ships, the Virat and the Kairos, were rocked by explosions off Turkey’s coast late Friday, according to the Turkish transport ministry. One of the two was struck again early Saturday, the ministry said. “Modernised Sea Baby naval drones successfully targeted the vessels,” a source in Ukraine’s SBU security service told AFP . The source shared a video that purported to show sea drones gliding towards the two ships, before sparking explosions. Kazakhstan’s energy ministry said on Saturday it had activated a plan to redirect oil exports to alternative routes after the CPC halted operations following the Ukrainian naval drone attack. Kazakhstan’s energy ministry called the attack unacceptable. Strikes on Ukraine The attack came as vast Russian overnight attack on Ukraine killed three people and wounded nearly 30, officials said on Saturday, with more than 600,000 households left without power after strikes on the grid. President Zelensky said Russia had launched around 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones in the attack. AFP journalists in Kyiv reported a night of intense explosions that kept many in the capital awake. In the morning, reporters saw burned out cars and apartment buildings charred from fire. Russia, which denies targeting civilians, says it struck energy infrastructure powering the Ukraine’s military-industrial complex. Published in Dawn, November 30th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "A fine show by bowlers, backed well by batters Saim Ayub and Babar Azam, steered Pakistan to a comfortable six-wicket victory against Sri Lanka in the tri-nation series final at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Saturday. Chasing a modest 115 for victory, the hosts came home in 18.4 overs thanks to Saim (36 off 33 balls). Babar (37 not out off 34) played an exquisite cut shot through point off pacer Dushmantha Chameera for a boundary to complete a well-deserved victory. Mohammad Nawaz won the Player of the Match, as well as Player of the Series. “To deliver when the team requires you is very important,” he said in the post-match presentation. “I plan with the coaches and try to keep it simple because as a fingerspinner, you don’t have many options. So I try to read the game and bowl accordingly. Speaking on his batting, he said: “I try to see what the situations demands: to build a partnership or attack. So I try to play accordingly.“ Skipper Salman Agha was pleased with his side’s performance ahead of the World Cup. “It was a great performance from us. This has been very good two months for us, against South Africa and Sri Lanka. We have been doing well in both ODIs and T20Is,” he said after the match. “Before going to the World Cup, you want your 15 ready. If anything happens to your main players, you want to have the back-up ready. So we are giving chances to everyone. “I think we are pretty much ready for the World Cup. We still have six games before the World Cup to try out things if we want but think we are pretty much clear on our 15 players.” Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka said his side needed to fine-tune their game ahead of the next series. “We expected the wicket to play better than this but they also bowled well in the middle overs. We couldn’t have taken some chances: right-handers getting out to the left-arm spinner and left-hander to offspinner,” he said after the match. “We need to fine-tune our game ahead of the next series. Mishara, Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Chameera, Maheesh, Hasaranga were the positives. And we showed good intent int he field.“ Earlier, Pakistan bowlers made a spectacular comeback to dismiss Sri Lanka for a paltry 114. After being sent in to bat, Shanaka’s side dominated the proceedings in the first half of their innings, reaching a solid 81-1 in 10 overs before they faced a dramatic collapse. Spinners Mohammad Nawaz (3-17), Abrar Ahmed (2-18) and Saim Ayub Ayub (1-17) checked the Sri Lankan progress while fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi (3-18 off three overs) mopped up the tail. The Sri Lankans were eventually dismissed in 19.1 overs when pacer Salman Mirza cleaned up Dushmantha Chameera. TEAMS Pakistan: Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Salman Agha (C), Fakhar Zaman, Usman Khan (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza, Abrar Ahmed Sri Lanka: Pathum Nissanka, Kamil Mishara, Kusal Mendis (wk), Kusal Perera, Janith Liyanage, Dasun Shanaka (C), Pavan Rathnayake, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dushmantha Chameera, Maheesh Theekshana, Eshan Malinga",

We still have six games before the World Cup to try out things if we want but think we are pretty much clear on our 15 players.” Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka said his side needed to fine-tune their game ahead of the next series. “We expected the wicket to play better than this but they also bowled well in the middle overs. We couldn’t have taken some chances: right-handers getting out to the left-arm spinner and left-hander to offspinner,” he said after the match. “We need to fine-tune our game ahead of the next series. Mishara, Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Chameera, Maheesh, Hasaranga were the positives. And we showed good intent int he field.“ Earlier, Pakistan bowlers made a spectacular comeback to dismiss Sri Lanka for a paltry 114. After being sent in to bat, Shanaka’s side dominated the proceedings in the first half of their innings, reaching a solid 81-1 in 10 overs before they faced a dramatic collapse. Spinners Mohammad Nawaz (3-17), Abrar Ahmed (2-18) and Saim Ayub Ayub (1-17) checked the Sri Lankan progress while fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi (3-18 off three overs) mopped up the tail. The Sri Lankans were eventually dismissed in 19.1 overs when pacer Salman Mirza cleaned up Dushmantha Chameera. TEAMS Pakistan: Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Salman Agha (C), Fakhar Zaman, Usman Khan (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza, Abrar Ahmed Sri Lanka: Pathum Nissanka, Kamil Mishara, Kusal Mendis (wk), Kusal Perera, Janith Liyanage, Dasun Shanaka (C), Pavan Rathnayake, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dushmantha Chameera, Maheesh Theekshana, Eshan Malinga",

      "summary": "A fine show by bowlers, backed well by batters Saim Ayub and Babar Azam, steered Pakistan to a comfortable six-wicket victory against Sri Lanka in the tri-nation series final at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Saturday. Chasing a modest 115 for victory, the hosts came home in 18.4 overs thanks to Saim (36 off 33 balls). Babar (37 not out off 34) played an exquisite cut shot through point off pacer Dushmantha Chameera for a boundary to complete a well-deserved victory. Mohammad Nawaz won the Player of the Match, as well as Player of the Series. “To deliver when the team requires you is very important,” he said in the post-match presentation. “I plan with the coaches and try to keep it simple because as a fingerspinner, you don’t have many options. So I try to read the game and bowl accordingly. Speaking on his batting, he said: “I try to see what the situations demands: to build a partnership or attack. So I try to play accordingly.“ Skipper Salman Agha was pleased with his side’s performance ahead of the World Cup. “It was a great performance from us. This has been very good two months for us, against South Africa and Sri Lanka. We have been doing well in both ODIs and T20Is,” he said after the match. “Before going to the World Cup, you want your 15 ready.

      "title_orig": "PIA ‘not affected’ by Airbus recall as airlines race to fix A320 jets",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan International Airlines remained unaffected even as global airlines scrambled on Saturday to fix a software glitch on their Airbus A320 jets after a recall by the European planemaker temporarily grounded aircraft in Asia and Europe and threatened travel in the United States during the busiest weekend of the year. The recall of 6,000 planes, covering more than half of Airbus’ global A320-family fleet, is among the broadest in its 55-year history and is a blow for the planemaker weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model. “PIA has confirmed that its entire A320 fleet is not affected by this Airbus alert. PIA’s Engineering and Maintenance department is closely monitoring their fleet’s airworthiness, ensuring safe operations,” said a statement by the airlines spokesperson issued today. Meanwhile, airlines worked through the night to make fixes after Airbus issued the emergency recall to 350 operators around the world, and global regulators directed carriers to remedy the software problem before resuming flights. That appeared to help head off the worst-case scenario and capped the number of flight delays in Asia and Europe early on Saturday. The US will face high travel demand later in the day after the Thanksgiving holiday period. “It’s not as chaotic as some people might think,” said Asia-based independent aviation analyst Brendan Sobie, adding that airlines were always prepared for various potential disruptions. “But it does create some short-term headaches for operations.” Airbus is also now telling airlines that emergency repairs to some of the A320 jets affected may be less burdensome than first thought, industry sources said, with fewer than feared likely to need hardware changes rather than the software fix. Even so, industry executives said the abrupt action was a rare and potentially costly headache at a time when maintenance is under pressure worldwide from labour and parts shortages. Fix is simple but necessary Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320 model. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again. European low-budget airline Wizz Air said early on Saturday that software updates had been implemented overnight on all its affected A320-family jets with no further disruption expected. Flight tracker data from Cirium and FlightAware showed most global airports operating with good-to-moderate levels of delays. AirAsia, one of the world’s largest A320 customers, said that it aimed to complete fixes in 48 hours, with engineering teams “working around the clock”. India’s aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected, but the software reset would be completed by Sunday. The country’s largest airline, IndiGo, said it had completed the reset on 160 out of 200 aircraft, while Air India said it had done 42 of its 113 impacted planes. Both airlines warned of delays. Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island’s carriers are affected. The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimise any disruption to passengers. ANA Holdings, Japan’s biggest airline, cancelled 95 flights on Saturday, affecting 13,500 travellers. ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320. October incident triggered recall, sources say Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight on October 30 from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall. Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia’s flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected. South Korea’s Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service. South Korea’s Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning. Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half of its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal. The world’s largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 209 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, revised down from an earlier estimate, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday. Other US carriers, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and United Airlines, are also among the world’s 10 biggest A320-family operators. Germany’s Lufthansa and Britain’s easyJet were among other airlines that said they would do the repairs. Middle East low-cost carrier Air Arabia said it would implement “required measures” across impacted aircraft. Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70 per cent of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.",

The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again. European low-budget airline Wizz Air said early on Saturday that software updates had been implemented overnight on all its affected A320-family jets with no further disruption expected. Flight tracker data from Cirium and FlightAware showed most global airports operating with good-to-moderate levels of delays. AirAsia, one of the world’s largest A320 customers, said that it aimed to complete fixes in 48 hours, with engineering teams “working around the clock”. India’s aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected, but the software reset would be completed by Sunday. The country’s largest airline, IndiGo, said it had completed the reset on 160 out of 200 aircraft, while Air India said it had done 42 of its 113 impacted planes. Both airlines warned of delays. Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island’s carriers are affected. The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimise any disruption to passengers. ANA Holdings, Japan’s biggest airline, cancelled 95 flights on Saturday, affecting 13,500 travellers. ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320. October incident triggered recall, sources say Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight on October 30 from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall. Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia’s flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected. South Korea’s Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service. South Korea’s Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning. Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half of its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal. The world’s largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 209 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, revised down from an earlier estimate, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday. Other US carriers, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and United Airlines, are also among the world’s 10 biggest A320-family operators. Germany’s Lufthansa and Britain’s easyJet were among other airlines that said they would do the repairs. Middle East low-cost carrier Air Arabia said it would implement “required measures” across impacted aircraft. Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70 per cent of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.",
