      "summary_orig": "Police detained a female rights activist outside the Karachi Press Club (KPC) on Thursday, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) member Qazi Khizar said. The Karachi police also heightened security, with a considerable number of women personnel present at the site, a Dawn correspondent reported. Roads leading to the KPC had been closed off briefly but were reopened by about 5pm. Dawn has reached out to the police for a comment. Women rights group Aurat March was scheduled to hold a press conference at KPC at 3pm over the alleged “abduction” of two Baloch girls. Senior journalist Dodal Chandio said in a post on Facebook that “police stopped the Aurat March women who were to hold a press conference” outside the KPC. The police “misbehaved” with activist Sheema Kirmani, he added. In the video he shared, Kirmani could be heard saying, “You have no right to touch me. How dare you touch me?” The video also showed policewomen grabbing another woman’s hand to detain her, as Kirmani told the cops that the woman was a reporter. As the tussle between them and the police continued, the woman said, “Let go of my hand. This is not a legal process.” In other videos that surfaced on social media, the woman identified herself as Shakeela and a member of “JMDC, Joint Minority Development”. She showed a “slip” issued to her for the press conference, which was being attended by “10 people” from her group. In a press release issued yesterday, Aurat March had said their press conference would “address the escalating pattern of enforced disappearances in Balochistan — particularly the alarming rise in the abduction of Baloch women and girls”. On November 27, police had detained 24 PTI leaders and workers following a protest at KPC to voice their concerns over former prime minister Imran Khan’s well-being. A week before that, the police had detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the venue of a scheduled protest by the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) against the 27th Constitutional Amendment. In March, Karachi police had arrested six people at Fawara Chowk as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) attempted to reach the KPC for a protest against the arrests of its leadership. Civil society seeks recovery of Mahjabeen Baloch, teenage Nasreen Baloch The press conference, which was held to demand the recovery of two Baloch girls — 15-year-old Nasreen Baloch and 24-year-old Mahjabeen Baloch — was held amid a heavy police presence outside KPC, with roads leading to the press club blocked at various points. Activist Mahjabeen, who is disabled by polio, was “abducted” from the premises of Civil Hospital, four days after her brother, who had gone “missing” a few months back, was released by authorities, said one organiser. Scheduled to start at 3pm, the press conference began approximately 20 minutes later as the organisers said they were “stopped by the police” at the gate of the KPC. At the outset, Kirmani said she was “grabbed and pushed around” by police outside and questioned why the state was stopping them from holding a press conference. “What right did the state have to stop them from demanding the recovery of young Baloch girls?” she asked. “Are you a fascist government or a democratic government? What are you scared of?” Kirmani said furiously, adding that by meting out such treatment, the state was creating an atmosphere of hatred. Aurat March organiser Moneeza Ahmed asked, “Why are the families of Nasreena and Mahjabeen not even being allowed to ask the state about the whereabouts of their daughters?” She alleged that the state was attempting to intimidate activists and families of the missing young girls. “To what extent is the state willing to go?” Ahmed wondered. Kirmani claimed that police had also attempted to arrest BYC activist Sammi Deen Baloch as she made her way to the press conference. “The Baloch women have repeatedly stated that they have no relation to BLA, yet the state continues to harass them,” she lamented, referring to the banned so-called Baloch Liberation Army. Khizer, the vice chairman of the HRCP’s Sindh chapter, addressing the press conference, noted that “at the moment, KPC is surrounded by police from every corner”. “This is fear,” he added. He stressed that the “young Baloch girls fighting for their rights and those [militants] in remote mountains were not the same”. “The state has now resorted to picking up young girls,” he alleged, expressing his disappointment. Kirmani called on the government to “negotiate”, asking, “Why should they not know where their daughters are?”",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was prevented for the ninth time by prison authorities from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Thursday. Imran’s sister Uzma Khan met the party founder in prison on Tuesday after weeks of effort, with CM Afridi and other party leaders scheduled to meet him today. The meeting took place as rumours regarding Imran’s health began circulating in local and foreign media, despite claims by the government and PTI leaders that the former prime minister was in good health. These speculations, however, gained traction due to the government’s reluctance to let visitors, including his family members and legal team, meet Imran over the past few weeks. According to a post on X by the PTI, CM Afridi went to Adiala jail to visit Imran, but access was not granted. Afridi addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access. He said he would update the media on the immediate course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not. The PTI also shared a video of the KP CM and his delegation in a waiting room, saying that today was the ninth instance of Afridi not being allowed to meet Imran. In a talk with the media after exiting the room, CM Afridi said: “I think the meeting is not being allowed. Today is the ninth time I have come; a chief minister of a province is repeatedly coming, but even a five-minute meeting is not being allowed. The whole world is witnessing this discriminatory treatment, and their actions are being noted and will be remembered.” “This government won’t remain forever and then no one will get a chance to complain.” When asked if he planned to spend another night outside the prison in protest, he said that Imran’s good physical health had been confirmed in the meeting with Uzma. He added that the party would now devise its next course of action regarding concerns about the party founder’s mental duress. “I have been told to play on the front foot, and there are instructions that the umpires are colluding, so be careful. So we will play on the front foot and also keep a watch on the umpires.” The provincial chief executive said the continued denial of a meeting showed that “our coming here pains them, so we will mete out that pain again and again.” CM Afridi said street protests were certainly an option for the party, as per the law and Constitution. On a question about the possible imposition of governor’s rule in KP, Afridi responded: “What are they waiting for … impose it today. We are not afraid of any governor’s rule.” “They will not be able to control and handle the conditions that I am foreseeing,” warned KP CM. He also lashed out at the government for not being able to tolerate and bear a chief minister from the tribal areas for the first time. Afridi said removing him would cause anger and frustration among the people from the tribal belt. “The people of KP and Pakistan see their future in me,” Afridi claimed, adding that the governor’s rule would be a “win-win” situation for him since he would be able to operate freely. The KP CM said he would visit Punjab soon. Visuals shared by the party showed a large group of supporters gathered outside the prison as well.",

      "summary_orig": "Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said on Thursday that a man arrested by the US police last week in Delaware after he was found in possession of a handgun, ammunition and written plans for an attack was not of Pakistani origin and was an Afghan. “He is not [a] Pakistani national or [of] Pakistan origin. He is an Afghan, spent a few years as a refugee [in Pakistan] and then went to the US, where he spent most of his life,” Andrabi said in a statement shared with journalists. His clarification came after several media reports, including those from Indian and American news outlets, identified the suspect as a man of Pakistani origin. A USA Today report said the arrested man, Luqman Khan, was a Pakistan-born US citizen, who was arrested on November 24. Similarly, reports by the New York Post and India’s Hindustan Times and Times of India , among others, also identified him as a Pakistani immigrant. According to a report by The Associated Press from earlier today, which also does not identify Khan as a man of Pakistani origin, the suspect was a student of the University of Delaware. Meanwhile, a press release issued by the US Department of Justice on Dec 1 detailing charges against Khan identified him as a resident of Delaware’s Wilmington city and did not make any mention of his nationality. It said that Khan was stopped by police at a traffic stop on November 24, and when he refused to comply, was arrested. “During their investigation, officers discovered in Khan’s vehicle a .357 caliber Glock handgun loaded with 27 rounds,” it said. It added that officials also discovered a handwritten notebook, in which Khan discussed “additional weapons and firearms, how they could be used in an attack, and how law enforcement detection could be avoided once an attack was carried out”. “The notebook referenced a member of the University of Delaware’s Police Department by name, and included a layout of a building with entry and exit points under which the words ‘UD Police Station’ were printed,” it said. It added that later, law enforcement searched his residence and recovered “a Glock 19 9mm handgun equipped with an illegal machinegun conversion device, commonly called a ‘switch’”. “Law enforcement also recovered a .556 rifle with a scope and a red dot sight, eleven more extended magazines, hollow point rounds of ammunition, and a two-plate tactical vest equipped with a single ballistic plate,” the department said. According to the Department of Justice press release, Khan was charged with illegally possessing a machine gun on November 26. “If convicted of the charge, Khan faces a maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment. If Khan is ultimately convicted, a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors,” it said.",

      "summary_orig": "KHYBER: The militancy-hit residents of Tirah Valley and Upper Bara have blasted the elected representatives for failing to address their grievances since their return to their homes in 2015 and 2022, respectively. MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani, who is also chairman of the District Development Advisory Committee, are yet to visit upper Bara, residents complained, saying they were now pinning their hopes on new Chief Minister Suhail Afridi, who also belongs to Bara. The Khyber district administration and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority also have failed to complete the assessment survey of the damaged houses while residents are compelled to either live in dilapidated houses or have taken shelter in temporary abodes to get through harsh winter. Most of the displaced families returned to Tirah back in 2015 and 2016, while families from Upper Bara localities were allowed to go back in 2022 after the region was de-notified. Complain survey of damaged houses not completed, forcing them to live in dilapidated structures Ironically, more than 2,500 families from the region with mostly hailing from Upper Bara were not given the status of internally displaced persons at the time of their forced displacement and were thus deprived of most of the facilities and assistance pledged by the disaster management authorities to IDPs of other regions. Residents Dawn spoke to presented a long list of their problems, which they had been facing since their return, with immediate reconstruction of their fully and partially damaged homes as their urgent requirement. They said they were still awaiting provision of drinking water, electricity, rehabilitation of health and educational facilities, repair of damaged irrigation channels, provision of quality seeds along with modern agricultural machinery and tools, construction of bridges over Bara River and creation of jobs for local unemployed youth. Khalil Khan, a social activist, told Dawn that literacy rate in most parts of Tirah was rapidly declining due to absence of formal schooling, while people faced extreme difficulties in acquiring better health facilities due to nonexistence of a well-equipped hospital in the entire valley. The Type-D Hospital, announced in 2015 by then Governor Sardar Mehtab Ahmad Khan was yet to be constructed, he lamented and added most people either relied on private clinics or took patients to Bara, Jamrud and Peshawar hospitals. He warned Tirah youth could easily fall prey to insinuations of terrorist groups as they were mostly uneducated and thus unemployed. “It’s time Tirah youth were engaged in productive activities by imparting them skills development training and recruiting them to police and other departments,” he suggested. Suhbat Shah Afridi, a resident of Upper Bara, said they had so far received limited assistance from some NGOs while the security forces stationed in the region also helped execute certain development schemes. He, however, regretted that parliamentarians were yet to announce any development project. “The provincial government shall encourage NOGs to initiate mega projects for our region to alleviate the sufferings of the returned families,” he demanded. “At present, it seems our region is not included in the domain of the government departments and thus we have no or little access to the basic facilities of life,” he stated.

He, however, regretted that parliamentarians were yet to announce any development project. “The provincial government shall encourage NOGs to initiate mega projects for our region to alleviate the sufferings of the returned families,” he demanded. “At present, it seems our region is not included in the domain of the government departments and thus we have no or little access to the basic facilities of life,” he stated. Dawn approached MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani for their response to complaints from Tirah residents but none responded till filing of this story. Published in Dawn, December 4th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Wednes­day petitioned the Isla­mabad High Cou­rt (IHC) to allow doctors from Shaukat Khanum Me­­morial Cancer Hospital (SKMCH) to examine ‘ailing’ PTI fou­n­d­­er and ex-premier Imran Khan for accurate diagnosis and better treatment. The petitioner argued that Mr Khan was facing “multiple health complications” and “required assessment from specialist doctors”. He claimed that the PTI founder had been jailed as a political victim under alleged pressure from the government and, therefore, was entitled to quality medical facilities in the interest of justice. The Punjab government has been made a respondent in the petition through its prison department. The IHC has fixed the petition for hearing and sought records from relevant authorities. Plea moved by KP CM says ex-premier facing multiple health complications The plea comes a day after Mr Khan’s sister, Uzma Khanum, dispelled rumours regarding her brother’s health following a supervised meeting with him in Adiala jail. Speaking to the media, she said the former premier was “perfectly fine”, though “extremely angry” and alleging that he and his wife Bushra Bibi were being subjected to “mental torture” by confining them to a small room and denied communication for weeks. She said her brother complained that he had not been allowed to meet anyone for four weeks and was confined to his cell most of the day with minimal time outdoors. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes and was held under strict monitoring without mobile devices. Weekly protests Separately, Aleema Khanum announ­ced that she and Uzma would stage a sit-in outside Adiala jail on Tuesdays until six family members and six lawyers were allowed visitation, while PTI workers would hold their own sit-in on Thursdays. PTI supporters had staged demonstrations outside the jail and the IHC a day earlier to protest restrictions on the former prime minister’s visitation rights, claiming that no one had been allowed to meet him or Bushra Bibi since Oct 27. Islam­abad and Rawalpindi administrations had imposed Section 144 ahead of the protests. Four protesters remanded to jail Meanwhile, Judicial Magistrate Shahzad Khan on Wednesday sent four PTI workers to Adiala jail on judicial remand after they were arrested for violating the ban imposed on gatherings in twin cities by staging protests. According to the police, the accused were detained from Sector G-14 and were found in possession of PTI flags, badges and photographs of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi. An FIR was registered at Sumbal police station, and the police told the magistrate that further investigation was underway. Published in Dawn, December 4th, 2025",
