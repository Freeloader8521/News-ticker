      "summary_orig": "Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah voiced support on Friday for meetings between incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his family members, subject to certain conditions. Imran has been in jail since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence on corruption charges. His family and party members have protested outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding a meeting but have been repeatedly denied despite orders from the courts. Imran’s sister Aleema Khan filed a contempt of court petition against the Adiala jail superintendent and others over their failure to comply with an earlier Islamabad High Court (IHC) order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for the incarcerated former premier. Speaking on the matter in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’, Sanaullah said: “There should be permission for meetings and they should definitely take place, but a 90-minute press conference cannot take place after an hour’s meeting; no law allows this.” He further said that political discussions could also not take place in the meetings, saying that no law allowed a prisoner to lead, plan and guide movements on the outside from jail. The senator maintained that it was not permitted for family members to hold press conferences outside the prison premises and for a barrage of messages to appear on social media against the state and officials. Sanaullah argued that the IHC’s order to facilitate meetings was also contingent on similar conditions as he laid out. “They (Imran’s family and legal team) should sit down with jail authorities and settle matters,” he said, saying that the process of meetings should be better conducted without violations from either side.",

      "title_orig": "3 Pakistani prisoners repatriated through Wagah border, says high commission",
      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi said on Friday that three Pakistani prisoners in India were repatriated via the Wagah border. The border, which connects Lahore with the Indian city of Amritsar, is the only active land crossing between the two neighbours. It was closed to general traffic following a brief but intense military conflict earlier this year. The high commission identified the prisoners repatriated today as Asghar Ali, Ramzan and Muhammad Idrees, saying that it would continue working towards the “release and repatriation of all Pakistani prisoners in India”. The Foreign Office (FO) told Dawn the identities of the arrested fishermen and when they were taken into custody. Ramzan, 43, from Lahore, was arrested in 2010 by India on charges of illegally crossing the border and possessing narcotics. After receiving consular access, his status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in February 2011. Meanwhile, Muhammad Idrees from Narowal was arrested in 1995 for allegedly crossing the border illegally and was awarded 16 years of imprisonment. He was verified as a Pakistani national in 2005, 10 years after his arrest. Asghar Ali, 39, from Sadiqabad, was arrested for allegedly crossing the border illegally in 2002. His status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in 2006. Earlier this month , the fisherfolk community in Pakistan called for the immediate release of fishermen imprisoned in India during a conference at a festival in the coastal belt of Badin, while in September , a Pakistani national imprisoned in India, Raqib Bilal, was repatriated via the Wagah border. In July, the foreign ministries of Islamabad and New Delhi exchanged lists detailing the number of prisoners held in each other’s countries. According to a statement from the FO in September , “The government of Pakistan handed over a list of 246 Indian or believed-to-be-Indian prisoners (53 civilian prisoners and 193 fishermen) to a representative of the Indian High Commission, Islamabad. “Simultaneously, the government of India shared a list of 463 Pakistani or believed-to-be-Pakistani prisoners (382 civilian prisoners and 81 fishermen) to a diplomat from the High Commission for Pakistan, New Delhi,” FO added. Fishermen are frequently arrested and jailed by the authorities in both Pakistan and India. On November 1, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that a fisherman from Pakistan was arrested by the Indian Coast Guard and coerced into carrying out tasks for New Delhi’s intelligence agency. The minister said that law enforcement agencies had apprehended a fisherman named Ijaz Mallah while he was out fishing in the sea. “In September this year, when he was out fishing, he was arrested by the Indian Coast Guard and after the arrest, he was taken to an undisclosed location and was coerced and forced to do some tasks for the Indian intelligence agency,” he said. Also, this month, the fisherfolk community called for the immediate release of Pakistani fishermen imprisoned in India, as dozens of families continue to suffer while their loved ones remain behind bars in the neighbouring country, despite constitutional protections and bilateral obligations regarding unintentional crossings of the maritime boundary. Pakistani fishermen released and repatriated earlier this year reported being tortured by Indian authorities, including hard labour, beatings and being burned with metal plates.",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday that the current ceasefire with Afghanistan was not a “traditional” one but contingent on whether any terrorist activity took place against Pakistan from the neighbouring country’s soil. Relations between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban are at their lowest point in the four years since the group came to power. Border crossings bet­ween the two countries have remained closed since October 11 and trade has been at a standstill following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600-kilometre frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul . Following those clashes, Turkiye and Qatar stepped in to mediate. The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire , while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks. The third round concluded without any concrete agreement. The situation deteriorated again following Afghan accusations of Pakistani airstrikes earlier this week, which the military and government ministers denied. The Afghan side also threatened retaliation. Questioned about the threat and the shaky ceasefire during his weekly press briefing, FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said: “The ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan does not imply a traditional ceasefire implemented after two belligerent states in a war or a conflict situation. Pakistan-Afghanistan ceasefire implied that there would be no terrorist attack by Afghan-sponsored terrorist proxies into Pakistan. There have been major terrorist attacks after this ceasefire.” “So, interpreting in that sense, the ceasefire is not holding because the ceasefire was about ceasing terrorist attacks inside Pakistan by TTP, FAK, and Afghan nationals using Afghan soil.” He continued that “if Afghan nationals are attacking, as they did so in Islamabad and elsewhere, so we cannot be very optimistic about the ceasefire, which, in any case, I mentioned, is not the traditional ceasefire between the two states, but to be understood in the context of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan.” The spokesperson said that security forces remained fully alert and the military’s preparedness was robust in response to any alleged threat from Afghanistan. “The security challenges we face would be addressed with the seriousness that they merit.” The spokesperson was also questioned about allegations from the Afghan Taliban about Pakistan harbouring the banned militant Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group to which he responded that it was an “outrageous” claim. “It is a figment of the imagination of the Afghan Taliban regime. Afghan side wants to externalise this menace of terrorism, which inherently is on their own soil and of their own making. They want to externalise it to Pakistan, naming various organisations. Any extremist terrorist element in Pakistan is treated, is dealt, as per our laws. This statement, of presence of any ISIS in Pakistan is totally baseless.” Even before this week’s current flare-up in tensions, the information ministry earlier this month said that all terrorists involved in an attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan were Afghan citizens. The attackers had targeted the main gate of the college and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy. Government ministers had linked the attack to Afghanistan and said it was orchestrated from there. Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had also said that a suicide bomber who carried out an attack outside the Islamabad district and sessions court building was “ not a Pakistani national ”. Twelve people were killed and 36 were injured in the suicide blast outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accused Afghanistan and India of involvement in terrorism, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies following the two incidents. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had also subsequently said that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",

Reports about Imran’s ill health had swirled on social and foreign media a day ago, prompting both government and PTI leaders to dismiss the rumours and state that the former prime minister — currently held incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adial jail — was doing well. Several PTI workers, including women, carried banners bearing slogans in favour of the former premier as they moved towards KPC today. The party workers and leaders chanted slogans and delivered speeches. Authorities had sealed all routes leading to the KPC by placing barricades and parking vehicles. A sizeable police presence was noted at the KPC and in the surrounding areas, supported by women personnel. PTI Sindh spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar said 20 PTI workers and leaders were detained; however, South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza later told Dawn the number was 24. Among the detainees was the party’s provincial president, Haleem Adil Shaikh. Bozdar said the party’s Insaf lawyers’ forum representatives arrived at Preedy Police Station and held talks with officials. Subsequently, all detainees were released. South Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mahzoor Ali also confirmed that all protesters were released. He said police took action as the crowd was ‘charged’ and the force feared they might indulge in vandalism and create a law and order situation. “Therefore, the police just removed them, but they were not arrested,” the SSP said.",

      "summary_orig": "National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq again ostensibly made an offer of talks to the opposition, telling a group of parliamentarians visiting him on Friday that dialogue was the way to resolve issues. He made similar offers to facilitate dialogue between the government and the opposition, the PTI, in the past as well. But, no substantial headway has been made so far, and differences between the two sides largely remain unresolved. A handout issued by the NA Secretariat today said Sadiq met with opposition members of both houses of Parliament in his chamber in Parliament House soon after the adjournment of the NA session due to lack of quorum. The visiting opposition members included Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Senator Faisal Javed, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser and PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan. MNAs Iqbal Afridi, Atif Khan, Sardar Latif Khosa and Jamal Ahsan Khan. “Our bond of brotherhood and mutual respect is greater than politics. I have been in contact with you brothers since 2014. Politics does not last a lifetime — it ends eventually,” said the speaker according to the handout. Sadiq said the members of Parliament “should have a relationship that lasts throughout life”. The speaker further stated that he had always advocated for dialogue, stressing that dialogue was the means to resolve issues. PTI’s Barrister Gohar, during the meeting, raised the issue of PTI founder Imran Khan’s family members not being allowed to meet the incarcerated leader, said the statement. It added that the opposition members “appreciated” the speaker’s efforts to facilitate dialogue between the two sides. The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year. After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides had commenced dialogue in the last week of December last year to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations , the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024 , and the release of PTI prisoners. The Shehbaz government had once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February as NA Speaker Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped. However,  a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the PTI. Qaiser alleged the government had started raids to round up the PTI workers, and dozens of them had reportedly been arrested across the country. In early August, the dialogue offer was again extended by government ministers and Speaker Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue in the NA.

      "summary_en": "National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq again ostensibly made an offer of talks to the opposition, telling a group of parliamentarians visiting him on Friday that dialogue was the way to resolve issues. He made similar offers to facilitate dialogue between the government and the opposition, the PTI, in the past as well. But, no substantial headway has been made so far, and differences between the two sides largely remain unresolved. A handout issued by the NA Secretariat today said Sadiq met with opposition members of both houses of Parliament in his chamber in Parliament House soon after the adjournment of the NA session due to lack of quorum. The visiting opposition members included Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Senator Faisal Javed, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser and PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan. MNAs Iqbal Afridi, Atif Khan, Sardar Latif Khosa and Jamal Ahsan Khan. “Our bond of brotherhood and mutual respect is greater than politics. I have been in contact with you brothers since 2014. Politics does not last a lifetime — it ends eventually,” said the speaker according to the handout. Sadiq said the members of Parliament “should have a relationship that lasts throughout life”. The speaker further stated that he had always advocated for dialogue, stressing that dialogue was the means to resolve issues. PTI’s Barrister Gohar, during the meeting, raised the issue of PTI founder Imran Khan’s family members not being allowed to meet the incarcerated leader, said the statement. It added that the opposition members “appreciated” the speaker’s efforts to facilitate dialogue between the two sides. The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year. After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides had commenced dialogue in the last week of December last year to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations , the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024 , and the release of PTI prisoners. The Shehbaz government had once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February as NA Speaker Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped. However,  a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the PTI. Qaiser alleged the government had started raids to round up the PTI workers, and dozens of them had reportedly been arrested across the country. In early August, the dialogue offer was again extended by government ministers and Speaker Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue in the NA. The PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue.

      "summary_orig": "Organisers are confident they can avoid the calamities of last time when India hosts the Commonwealth Games but there are many challenges for a country that also has Olympic ambitions. Ahmedabad, in Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat, was confirmed on Wednesday as the venue for the 2030 Commonwealth Games. It is seen in India as a stepping stone towards the goal of hosting the 2036 Olympics and authorities hope it will establish the world’s most populous nation as a sporting destination. A successful Commonwealth Games will also help erase the memories of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, which were marred by accusations of corruption and construction delays. Ahmedabad already boasts the world’s largest cricket stadium, a 130,000-seat arena named after Modi, which most likely will stage the opening and closing ceremonies. But beyond that, massive investment in roads, subway lines and sporting facilities are needed to reshape the city of more than seven million people. Barely five years until the competition is a comparatively short timeframe to get it all done. Ashwani Kumar, a senior Gujarat official who looks after sports, said Ahmedabad’s existing venues were capable of hosting the Games “withh some modifications”. New arenas will also be built by “late 2028 or early 2029”. “We are very confident and we have done good homework as a team,” Kumar told reporters, adding that a budget had been worked out already, without giving figures. Manpower issue Aside from competition venues, India will need to boost infrastructure for the thousands of athletes, spectators and officials flooding into the city. Hotels are expected to add thousands of new rooms while the local airport will start construction on a new terminal next year. “Five years is enough for building our capacity,” said Narendra Somani, president of the Hotels and Restaurants’ Association of Gujarat. “Also, we expect the government to come up with some industry-friendly policies that would boost the outlook further.” Somani admitted personnel challenges. “We have a shortage of skilled workers in the hotel industry in Gujarat. We will have to hire workers from other states like Assam and Punjab,” he told AFP on Friday. Bad memories The spectre of the 2010 Commonwealth Games looms large. At the time the Games were meant to showcase India’s status as an emerging global power but headlines were instead about delays, shoddy construction and budget overruns. English and Australian swimmers blamed Delhi’s swimming pool for contracting a stomach virus while some athletes complained of finding a cobra in the Games village accommodation. India’s national auditor accused the Delhi government of wasteful spending to the tune of at least $29 million during its “ill-conceived and ill-planned” programme to beautify the city in the run-up to the Games. A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General also listed several examples of alleged rigged bidding for lucrative contracts to supply timekeeping equipment, lighting fixtures for the glitzy opening ceremony and catering services. The auditors blamed the organising committee for hyping up projected revenues from the Games to an astronomical 17.8 billion rupees. “In reality the total committed revenues amounted to just 6.8 billion rupees,” the report said. ‘Well prepared’ The Gujarat government official Kumar admitted that there were “some challenges” in 2010, but said this time was different. “We all are well prepared. We are very confident that we will deliver the Games which would be remembered in years to come,” said Kumar. But he also added a note of caution: “We don’t want to overcommit on anything, and would rather learn from the past editions of the Games elsewhere in the world.”",

      "summary_orig": "Aleema Khan, the sister of PTI founder Imran Khan, has filed a contempt of court petition against the Adiala jail superintendent and others over their failure to comply with an earlier Islamabad High Court (IHC) order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for the incarcerated former premier. The petition was filed after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, along with several other PTI members, staged an overnight sit-in outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where Imran has been imprisoned since 2023. The sit-in was staged as CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the eighth time on Thursday. Previously, Imran’s sisters, including Aleema, had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier. The PTI ended its latest sit-in on Friday morning, with the KP CM announcing that they would be approaching the IHC, where Aleema has now filed a contempt plea. View this post on Instagram Apart from Adiala Jail Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum, Saddar Beroni Station House Office Raja Aizaz Azeem, Federal Interior Secretary Capt (retd) Muhammad Khurram Agha and Punjab Home Department Secretary Noorul Amin have been named as respondents in the plea. The plea, a copy of which is available with Dawn , stated that Aleema had “remained deeply concerned about the well-being, legal rights, and humane treatment of her brother during his ongoing incarceration”. The petition referred to the IHC’s March 24 order, in which the court had reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for Imran. It said Aleema sought the initiation of contempt of court proceedings “on account of the wilful non-implementation of the orders passed by this honourable court, particularly with respect to the authorities’ failure to allow” her meetings with Imran, in line with the court’s directives in March. It further stated that “due to the persistent non-cooperation” of the Adiala jail superintendent and “ongoing political victimisation”, Imran and others were “constrained” to file writ petitions before the IHC, seeking the enforcement of visitation rights. “However, despite the clear and unequivocal directions of this honourable court, the respondents have failed to comply and have repeatedly denied access to the legal counsel, family members, and associates” of Imran on multiple occasions, it added. The plea further recalled that in line with previous court orders, the respondents had devised on March 28, 2024 standard operating procedures (SOPs) for meeting Imran. According to those SOPs, Tuesdays and Thursdays were “designated for interviews with Imran by his family/ lawyers and friends, respectively”. Despite directions for allowing visits to Imran on Tuesdays and Thursdays, “the respondents did not comply with or implement the same”, the plea said. It recalled that the Adiala Jail superintendent had also submitted an undertaking to the IHC on November 8, 2024 that Imran’s friends would be allowed to meet him on Tuesday the following week and his family and lawyers would be permitted to meet him on Thursday, according to the list provided by the ex-premier. But when several PTI leaders went to Adiala Jail to meet Imran on November 11, 2024, the superintendent “caused them to wait for several hours and thereafter unlawfully detained them in police custody”. The plea alleged that the respondents were “wilfully flouting” the court orders and the undertaking submitted to it, and “conducted themselves to ridicule the authority” of the IHC. It said their actions were an “apparent activity of serious contempt of this honourable court, for which they are liable to be dealt with under criminal proceedings”. The plea sought the initiation of contempt proceedings against the respondents for not complying with the IHC’s March 24 order and urged the court to punish them in accordance with the law “to meet the ends of justice”. It also sought the court’s directives for the respondents to comply with its March 24 order. ‘Was told CJ did not want to meet us’ Aleema, along with KP CM Afridi, had reached the IHC in the morning, where the two intended to meet the IHC chief justice. However, while speaking to the media at the IHC, CM Afridi said that they were informed that the high court chief justice “did not want to meet them”. The provincial chief executive lamented that no one had been allowed to meet Imran or his wife, Bushra Bibi, since October 27. “We know nothing about his condition,” he said. “Neither his sisters are allowed to meet him, nor his [party’s] leadership, nor lawyers, nor doctors.” He also recalled a sit-in staged by Imran’s sisters outside Adiala Jail on November 19. The PTI has alleged that police had manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion. “The whole nation saw what happened. Imran Khan sahib ’s sisters were dragged along the road by their hair, pushed down and disrespected. Even though they have no connection with politics; they just go to see their brother.” The KP CM said he, along with six other people, had asked jail authorities yesterday to allow them to speak to Imran for “just two or three minutes”. “We also assured them that we will not talk about politics or administrative matters. We said we just wanted to find out about his health. “But we were still not allowed to meet.” CM Afridi alleged that the KP and its government were facing discrimination, saying that “in other provinces, Pakistan Air Force planes were used for the chief minister’s travel”. “By such actions, you are creating division. You are causing resentment and distances to grow,” he said. He alleged that efforts were being made to “put Pakistan’s strongest political party against the wall” with its leader being discriminated against and his family, party and government in KP being targeted. “You are worsening the situation yourselves,” CM Afridi said, warning that if it worsened further, “neither side would be able to bring it under control”. He announced that the PTI had also decided not to let National Assembly and Senate sessions scheduled for today proceed “because we want our leadership and Imran Khan sahib ’s sisters to be allowed to meet him”. The legislatures were not of any use if they could not deliver justice to their representatives, he decried. “Business as usual will not go on after this” until the PTI founder was allowed to meet his sisters and party leadership, he added. The KP chief minister said that they had called on “all parliamentarians, from all over Pakistan”, to gather and protest peacefully outside the high court on Tuesday before proceeding to Adiala Jail. “The Constitution and the law give us the right to protest,” he said. “We will definitely use this option,” he said, adding that if their constitutional right to meet Imran was granted, the PTI would not turn to protest. ‘Entire focus on one illegal demand’ Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused the PTI, including KP CM Afridi, of adopting an approach in which governance for the people was pushed to the back burner. “And the entire focus is on one illegal demand that political guidance is to be taken only from the [party] founder serving a sentence in Adiala jail in a corruption case,” he added. “This is against jail rules,” he claimed. Highlighting the importance of KP in the context of the fight against terrorism, he said: “Instead of the provincial government prioritising peace, progress and relief for the public, the party leadership kept itself busy in Islamabad by centering its politics on this illegal narrative”. Continuing his accusations, he added: “Allegedly, a woman politician from the PTI […] ran a vile campaign regarding Khan sahib through anti-Pakistan accounts operating from Afghanistan and on the Indian media. This was an attempt to defame Pakistan worldwide. “This approach is open enmity against Pakistan […] The PTI should abandon the anti-Pakistan narrative and [its] wrong priorities and now give preference to the interests of the people and the state.” Failed efforts Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “ sabotaging ” meetings with him. Among them, KP CM Afridi has been seeking a meeting with the former prime minister since his election on October 13. He had taken his oath as the provincial chief executive on October 15 and gone to Adiala jail to meet Imran the very next day after getting protective bail from the Peshawar High Court. However, he was turned away after a wait of two hours. On Oct 17, he moved the IHC , seeking a meeting with Imran, and wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi with the same request. The plea was taken up on October 23 along with several other similar ones by an IHC bench, which directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement the high court’s March 24 order . However, Afridi’s attempts to meet the PTI founder have failed so far. Yesterday was the eighth time that he was denied a meeting with Imran since becoming the provincial chief executive. Visuals reposted by the PTI on X showed CM Afridi, along with other party workers, offering Fajr prayers outside the jail on Friday morning before they ended the sit-in. Other images showed Afridi and others huddled around a fire. Earlier, on November 19, the PTI had held a protest outside the jail as the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. The party alleged that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion. An hours-long sit-in was also held more recently on November 25 and was wrapped up at the request of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir. Concerns about Imran’s health Meanwhile, the PTI had expressed concern over Imran’s health while incarcerated, as he has been barred from seeing his family and lawyers for over three weeks. Former PM’s aide Zulfi Bukhari said no one has seen Imran since November 4 and no reason has been given for denying meetings. “His health is our concern. We are worried about his illegal isolation,” Bukhari told Reuters , demanding the government give Imran’s family immediate access to him. A jail official told Reuters that the former premier was in good health and that he was not aware of any plans to move him to any other facility. He spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. The Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. Amid media reports that the 73-year-old former international cricketer might be moved to a high-security prison to make meeting him more challenging, international media outlets such as Japan’s Nikkei and the BBC also covered the concern over his status. His well-being became a talking point on social media with the trend ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ also trending on X in the morning. The interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment. But yesterday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior PTI leaders dismissed reports of former premier Imran Khan’s ill health, with both sides stating that the PTI founder is ‘fine and nothing is wrong with him’.",

The provincial chief executive lamented that no one had been allowed to meet Imran or his wife, Bushra Bibi, since October 27. “We know nothing about his condition,” he said. “Neither his sisters are allowed to meet him, nor his [party’s] leadership, nor lawyers, nor doctors.” He also recalled a sit-in staged by Imran’s sisters outside Adiala Jail on November 19. The PTI has alleged that police had manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion. “The whole nation saw what happened. Imran Khan sahib ’s sisters were dragged along the road by their hair, pushed down and disrespected. Even though they have no connection with politics; they just go to see their brother.” The KP CM said he, along with six other people, had asked jail authorities yesterday to allow them to speak to Imran for “just two or three minutes”. “We also assured them that we will not talk about politics or administrative matters. We said we just wanted to find out about his health. “But we were still not allowed to meet.” CM Afridi alleged that the KP and its government were facing discrimination, saying that “in other provinces, Pakistan Air Force planes were used for the chief minister’s travel”. “By such actions, you are creating division. You are causing resentment and distances to grow,” he said. He alleged that efforts were being made to “put Pakistan’s strongest political party against the wall” with its leader being discriminated against and his family, party and government in KP being targeted. “You are worsening the situation yourselves,” CM Afridi said, warning that if it worsened further, “neither side would be able to bring it under control”. He announced that the PTI had also decided not to let National Assembly and Senate sessions scheduled for today proceed “because we want our leadership and Imran Khan sahib ’s sisters to be allowed to meet him”. The legislatures were not of any use if they could not deliver justice to their representatives, he decried. “Business as usual will not go on after this” until the PTI founder was allowed to meet his sisters and party leadership, he added. The KP chief minister said that they had called on “all parliamentarians, from all over Pakistan”, to gather and protest peacefully outside the high court on Tuesday before proceeding to Adiala Jail. “The Constitution and the law give us the right to protest,” he said. “We will definitely use this option,” he said, adding that if their constitutional right to meet Imran was granted, the PTI would not turn to protest. ‘Entire focus on one illegal demand’ Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused the PTI, including KP CM Afridi, of adopting an approach in which governance for the people was pushed to the back burner. “And the entire focus is on one illegal demand that political guidance is to be taken only from the [party] founder serving a sentence in Adiala jail in a corruption case,” he added. “This is against jail rules,” he claimed. Highlighting the importance of KP in the context of the fight against terrorism, he said: “Instead of the provincial government prioritising peace, progress and relief for the public, the party leadership kept itself busy in Islamabad by centering its politics on this illegal narrative”. Continuing his accusations, he added: “Allegedly, a woman politician from the PTI […] ran a vile campaign regarding Khan sahib through anti-Pakistan accounts operating from Afghanistan and on the Indian media. This was an attempt to defame Pakistan worldwide. “This approach is open enmity against Pakistan […] The PTI should abandon the anti-Pakistan narrative and [its] wrong priorities and now give preference to the interests of the people and the state.” Failed efforts Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “ sabotaging ” meetings with him. Among them, KP CM Afridi has been seeking a meeting with the former prime minister since his election on October 13. He had taken his oath as the provincial chief executive on October 15 and gone to Adiala jail to meet Imran the very next day after getting protective bail from the Peshawar High Court. However, he was turned away after a wait of two hours. On Oct 17, he moved the IHC , seeking a meeting with Imran, and wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi with the same request. The plea was taken up on October 23 along with several other similar ones by an IHC bench, which directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement the high court’s March 24 order . However, Afridi’s attempts to meet the PTI founder have failed so far. Yesterday was the eighth time that he was denied a meeting with Imran since becoming the provincial chief executive. Visuals reposted by the PTI on X showed CM Afridi, along with other party workers, offering Fajr prayers outside the jail on Friday morning before they ended the sit-in. Other images showed Afridi and others huddled around a fire. Earlier, on November 19, the PTI had held a protest outside the jail as the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. The party alleged that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion. An hours-long sit-in was also held more recently on November 25 and was wrapped up at the request of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir. Concerns about Imran’s health Meanwhile, the PTI had expressed concern over Imran’s health while incarcerated, as he has been barred from seeing his family and lawyers for over three weeks. Former PM’s aide Zulfi Bukhari said no one has seen Imran since November 4 and no reason has been given for denying meetings. “His health is our concern. We are worried about his illegal isolation,” Bukhari told Reuters , demanding the government give Imran’s family immediate access to him. A jail official told Reuters that the former premier was in good health and that he was not aware of any plans to move him to any other facility. He spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. The Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. Amid media reports that the 73-year-old former international cricketer might be moved to a high-security prison to make meeting him more challenging, international media outlets such as Japan’s Nikkei and the BBC also covered the concern over his status. His well-being became a talking point on social media with the trend ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ also trending on X in the morning. The interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment. But yesterday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior PTI leaders dismissed reports of former premier Imran Khan’s ill health, with both sides stating that the PTI founder is ‘fine and nothing is wrong with him’.",

In a video statement posted on his social media account on Thursday, the provincial lawmaker said, “My house in Raghagan, Khar tehsil, was targeted by a drone (quadcopter) attack by unknown individuals tonight, injuring one of my security guards.” Khan, who said he was in Peshawar at the time of the incident, strongly condemned the incident. He also identified the injured as Zair Muhammad, saying he was rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar. Following the incident, police personnel arrived at the scene and initiated an investigation. However, local police have not yet released any official statement regarding the nature of the incident and those responsible. Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement, condemned the incident, terming it an act by “anti-peace elements”. As per the statement, CM Afridi directed police and the relevant authorities to provide an immediate report on the incident. “The provincial government stands with the people and its elected representatives during this challenging time and will not tolerate such terrorist incidents,” the statement quoted the chief minister as saying.

      "title_orig": "Shooting of National Guard soldiers in Washington heralds ‘troubling’ resurgence of terrorism globally: FO",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday strongly condemned the shooting of two soldiers of the United States’ National Guard in Washington, DC, saying that the incident “heralds a troubling resurgence of terrorism on a global scale”. Two National Guard soldiers were critically wounded on Wednesday after being shot a few blocks from the White House, with US President Donald Trump terming the incident an “act of terror”. Trump has since announced that one of the soldiers had died. In a press release, the FO said, “Pakistan strongly condemns the shooting incident in Washington DC, reportedly involving an Afghan national. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the departed soldier, and (we) wish the injured a swift and complete recovery,” it said. It also extended sympathies to the families affected, as well as to the government and people of the US. The FO said the attack was “undoubtedly an act of terrorism and a heinous assault on US soil”. “For the past two decades, Pakistan has endured countless similar terrorist incidents, with clear linkages to Afghanistan,” it said. “This incident signifies the challenges posed by transnational terrorism and underscores the need for enhanced global cooperation to confront this menace,” it said. “The incident heralds a troubling resurgence of terrorism on a global scale. The international community must take note and reinvigorate collective efforts in counter-terrorism,” it said. “Pakistan remains committed to working with the US and the wider international community to address the shared challenge of terrorism,” it said. National Guard member dies Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds and her fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life,” Trump said on Thursday, as investigators conducted what officials said was a terrorism probe. The FBI searched multiple properties in a widening investigation, including a home in Washington state linked to the suspect, who officials said was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the US in 2021 under a resettlement programme. Agents seized numerous electronic devices from the residence of the suspect, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, including cellphones, laptops, and iPads, and interviewed his relatives, FBI Director Kash Patel told a news conference. US Attorney for Washington, DC Jeanine Pirro said the suspect drove cross-country and then ambushed the Guard members while they were patrolling near the White House on Wednesday afternoon. “I want to express the anguish and the horror of our entire nation that the terrorist attack yesterday in our nation’s capital, in which a savage monster gunned down two service members in the West Virginia National Guard, who were deployed as part of the DC Task Force,” Trump said in a Thanksgiving call with US military service members. Casting blame on the administration of his White House predecessor, Joe Biden, Trump said the alleged gunman, who he described as having gone “cuckoo,” was among thousands of Afghans who came in unvetted as the US carried out a chaotic withdrawal in 2021. He provided no evidence to support his assertion. Trump said the suspect’s “atrocity reminds us that we have no greater national security priority than ensuring that we have full control over the people that enter and remain in our country”. Armed with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, the gunman shot the two National Guard members before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops. He was in hospital in serious condition, Trump said.",

      "summary_orig": "A high-profile debate at the Oxford Union that was scheduled to feature senior figures from Pakistan and India was cancelled after the Indian delegation withdrew at the last minute, prompting strong reactions from Pakistan’s High Commission in London and triggering speculations about why India pulled out last minute. According to statements issued by the High Commission, the debate centred on the motion “This House Believes India’s Policy Towards Pakistan is a Populist Strategy Sold as Security Policy” had been confirmed weeks in advance. It is scheduled for 12:30am PKT. Pakistan’s delegation, comprising former Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee chairman Lt Gen (R) Zubair Mahmood Hayat, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and former diplomat Dr Mohammad Faisal, was already in London for the event. The High Commission claimed that India’s originally announced speakers, General M.M. Naravane, Dr Subramanian Swamy and politician Sachin Pilot, “withdrew at the eleventh hour”, leaving the event without its opposing panel. It further alleged that India later proposed “obscure and low-profile replacements” that did not match the level of the Pakistani delegation and “undermined the credibility and balance of the debate.” “The collective retreat of the Indian delegation amounted to an unchallenged victory for Pakistan,” the High Commission stated, adding that India’s withdrawal “exposed the weakness of its narrative on a neutral academic platform”. Sources familiar with the matter told Dawn that the last-minute shift was “very bizarre”, noting that such debates were typically finalised far in advance and that delegations typically agreed knowing who they were debating. While the High Commission criticised what it described as India’s reluctance to face open questioning, many on social media questioned the reason behind India’s withdrawal, speculating that it may have been pressure from the Indian government on the panellists.",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) has condemned the attack which claimed the lives of three Chinese workers in Tajikistan, saying that the use of armed drones in the incident underlined the “gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it”. Tajik authorities said on Thursday that three Chinese workers in Tajikistan were killed in an attack launched from Afghanistan near the border. The foreign ministry said a drone and firearm attack hit workers of a Chinese company in the country’s south. “The attack, carried out with firearms and a drone loaded with grenades, claimed the lives of three employees of Chinese nationality,” it said in a statement. Dushanbe rarely comments officially on such incidents, and it did not say who it suspects carried out the attack. Subsequently, the FO, in a statement issued early on Friday, expressed Pakistan’s condolences and solidarity with China and Tajikistan over the lives lost in a “heinous terrorist attack in Tajikistan near its border with Afghanistan”. “Pakistan unequivocally condemns this cowardly attack on Chinese nationals. The use of armed drones in the incident underlines the gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it,” the FO said. “As a neighbour that has repeatedly suffered terrorist attacks orchestrated from Afghan soil, the people of Pakistan fully understand and share the grief and anguish of our Chinese friends and Tajik partners,” it said. “Pakistan has consistently stressed that Afghan territory must not be used for terrorism against its neighbours or any other country. The repeated use of Afghan soil by terrorist elements and their continued presence under the patronage of the Afghan Taliban regime, is a matter of serious concern for the entire region and the wider international community,” it said. It added that concrete and verifiable action against the perpetrators, abettors, facilitators and financiers of terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil was the only way to address “this growing menace”. “Pakistan will continue to work closely with China, Tajikistan and other regional partners to promote peace, stability and security in our shared neighbourhood,” the FO said. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. Last week, Denmark, in the capacity of the chair of the UN Security Council ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee, pointed to the “serious threat” posed by the TTP in Central and South Asia and said that the terror outfit was receiving “logistical and substantial support” from the de facto Afghan authorities. Meanwhile, Muslim-majority Tajikistan, one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union, has been concerned about possible flare-ups in extremism since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Militants are active in the mountainous border region, which spans around 1,350 kilometres between the two countries. Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, in power since 1992, is openly critical of the Taliban and urged the group to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks, estimated to make up around a quarter of Afghanistan’s 40-million population. At the same time, Tajikistan has cautiously engaged in some areas, including through diplomatic meetings, the opening of markets in border towns and supplying electricity. Tajikistan’s foreign ministry said on Thursday, “Criminal groups located in the neighbouring country (Afghanistan) continue to commit acts aimed at destabilising the situation in the border regions.”",

Khawaja challenged the 27th Amendment before the Supreme Court, seeking a direction that the court retains exclusive jurisdiction to determine the vires and constitutionality of the proposed amendment. At the time, the FCC did not exist as the amendment in question had not yet been approved by parliament. Similar pleas have been filed before high courts and the Federal Shariat Court, but this is the first time the FCC has been approached to strike down the law that created it in the first place. ‘One-man rule’ Filed under Article 175E of the Constitution, the fresh petition argued that the 27th Amendment was allegedly passed by a “puppet regime” with a “malicious design to establish one-man rule” in Pakistan by undermining the Constitution. “When the country was passing through a constitutional crisis with the law and order situation deteriorating day by day, the government tabled the 27th Amendment in parliament with the objective of undermining the independence of the judiciary in a mala fide manner,” the petitioner claimed. The petition said that the establishment of the FCC, by allegedly curtailing the powers of the SC under the garb of the 27th Amendment, was against the fundamental principles enshrined in the original provisions of the 1973 Constitution. It further claimed that the federal government was being exploited by certain individuals for the purpose of their vested interests, whereas parliament had been used as rubber-stamp just to implement the whims of powerful. It contended that the country was going through a “power-sharing crisis”, where one institution was overwhelming the powers of the others. It added that the country was being governed through an indirect martial law, which had camouflaged the entire system and thus “disgracing the green book”. ‘Constitutional crisis’ The petition pleaded that the amendment would create institutional incoherence amounting to a constitutional crisis, as all powers would be concentrated in the hands of a single individual. “This flagrant violation of the constitution by the government amounted to mockery of the parliament and the judicial system of the country,” the petition argued. It added that granting immunity to the highest officials of the country from all criminal liability was a clear violation of Article 227 of the Constitution, which ordains that no law will be enacted in contravention of the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sunnah. Likewise, the introduction of Articles 175E and 185 of the Constitution would create a clash, as a parallel appellate system has been introduced, with one set of appeals to be filed before the SC and another before the FCCP, the plea read. The petition argued that this amounted to a violation of natural justice, adding that the judiciary was the custodian of the rights of the people. “Therefore, the FCCP should play its role by striking down the 27th Amendment in the interest of justice,” it added.

      "summary_orig": "• LHCBA petition wants ICAs ‘restored to their original forum’ • Says 27th Amendment ‘unlawful, undermining judiciary’ • Fears parliament can ‘abolish or replace forum for constitutional adjudication at will’ if permitted ISLAMABAD: The Lah­ore High Court Bar Asso­ciation (LHCBA) on Thur­sday filed an application before the Federal Consti­tution Court (FCC), requ­esting that the pending intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the May 7, 2025 judgement on military trials of civilians be returned to the Supreme Court. The application has been moved under Order 35, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, which the FCC has adopted for the time being until it frames its own rules. On June 13, the LHCBA and the Lahore Bar Asso­ciation filed ICAs before the SC, seeking to revisit and set aside the May 7, 2025 judgement on the military trials of civilians. These appeals were filed through senior counsel Hamid Khan. In addition, former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Jawwad S. Khawaja and senior lawyer Barr­ister Aitzaz Ahsan also filed similar ICAs, highlighting that if the May 7 verdict was not overturned, it would serve as a constant reminder of the judiciary ceding its space to the executive by accepting that the latter could act as judges to try civilians in criminal cases. On May 7, a five-judge Constitutional Bench of the SC restored key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) that allow for the trial of civilians in military courts. The court ruled by a five-two majority in favour of overturning its earlier decision on Oct 23, 2023, in which a previous five-judge bench had held that the military trials of civilians involved in the May 9 , 2023 acts of arson and attacks on military installations was illegal and unconstitutional. Except for Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afg­han, who dissented from the majority verdict, the detailed reasoning of the majority judgement has yet to be issued. ‘Without lawful authority’ The fresh application pleaded that the pending appeals should be retu­r­ned to their original forum — the SC — as both the purported transfer and the 27th Consti­tutional Amen­dment itself were without lawful authority, unconstitutional, and non-est. The application contended that the 27th Ame­ndment was in violation of the salient and essential features of the Constitution, stating that the 1973 Constitution defined the powers of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. “While parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it does not function as a constituent assembly and is subject to both express and implied limitations,” it added. The application pointed out that the jurisprudence of the SC — most recently the authoritative 17-member judgement in the Rawalpindi District Bar Association case — had affirmed that parliament could not, through any amendment, alter or abrogate the salient or essential features of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary. The application pleaded that both the 26th and 27th amendments impermissibly encroached upon judicial independence and restructured the constitutional architecture in a manner inconsistent with these unamendable features. Therefore, they constituted an invalid exercise of amendatory power. It argued that a constitutional amendment, which undermined judicial independence while simultaneously divesting pre-existing constitutional courts of jurisdiction to examine its validity, violated fundamental constitutional principles. “If permitted, parliament can abolish or replace the forum for constitutional adjudication at will, thereby insulating unconstitutional amendments from judicial scrutiny,” the plea feared. The application further noted that the SC had consistently distinguished betw­een “jurisdiction” and “judicial power”. “Even where parliament modifies jurisdiction, judicial power — i.e. the authority to determine whether jurisdiction exists — remains inherent in the superior judiciary,” it read. “Accordingly, notwithstanding the 27th Amendment, it lies within the judicial power of the SC to determine whether it has been validly divested of jurisdiction. The subject appeal must therefore be restored to the SC for that purpose.” The application maintained that the FCC could not adjudicate upon its own validity, since it was a creation solely of the 27th Amendment. “It is therefore legally precluded from pronouncing upon the validity of the amendment, as such adjudication would determine the legality of its own existence,” it added. “This principle is affirmed in the Sabir Shah case and earlier jurisprudence, which hold that a forum cannot declare unconstitutional the very instrument that constitutes it.” The application also highlighted that the pending appeals did not fall within Articles 175E or 175F, as they were filed under Section 5 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023. “The 27th Amendment neither amends that statute nor addresses statutory appeals filed thereunder,” it added. “Article 175F(2) applies only to proceedings ‘falling under this Article’. Since the present appeal was not instituted under Articles 175E or 175F, its transfer to the FCC is without legal effect.” Published in Dawn, November 28th, 2025",
