      "summary_orig": "The US and Iran are due to hold talks in Oman on Friday after Tehran requested a change of venue to limit negotiations to its nuclear programme, a regional official said, with a build-up of US forces in the Middle East raising fears of a confrontation. Iran wanted the meeting to take place in Oman as a continuation of previous rounds of talks held in the Gulf Arab country on its nuclear programme, asking for a change of location from Turkiye to avoid any expansion of the discussions to issues such as Tehran’s ballistic missiles, the regional official said. Iran has said it will not make concessions on its formidable ballistic missile programme — one of the biggest in the Middle East — calling that a red line in negotiations. Tehran, which said it replenished its stockpile of ballistic missiles since coming under attack from Israel last year, had warned that it will unleash its missiles to defend the Islamic Republic if its security is under threat. The regional official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran had since the beginning stressed that it would only discuss its nuclear programme, while Washington wanted other issues on the agenda. Oil prices extended gains on Wednesday after the US shot down an Iranian drone and armed Iranian boats approached a US-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, rekindling fears of an escalation between Washington and Tehran. Iran sought bilateral talks Trump has warned that “ bad things ” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes and stirred fears of a wider war. On Tuesday, the US military shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said. Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: “We are negotiating with them right now.” He did not elaborate and declined to say where he expected talks to take place. A source familiar with the situation said Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. Ministers from several other countries in the region, including Pakistan , Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, had also been expected to attend, but the regional source told Reuters that Tehran wanted only bilateral talks with the US. In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign . More recently, the US navy built up forces in the region following Iran’s violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest since Iran’s 1979 revolution. Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran, sending a flotilla to its coast. The priority of the diplomatic effort is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a regional official told Reuters earlier. Tanker incident Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for the resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and an end to its support for regional proxies. Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle. Since the US strikes in June, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work — which it says is for peaceful, not military purposes — has stopped. In another incident on Tuesday, this one in the Strait of Hormuz, the US Central Command said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces had approached a US-flagged tanker at speed and threatened to board and seize it. Maritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its voyage.",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Mobile internet remains suspended in parts of Balochistan for the fifth consecutive day, with provincial authorities also halting train services in the province in the wake of last week’s coordinated terrorist attacks across the province. “Keeping in mind the worsening law and order situation in the province, mobile internet has been shut down,” said Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat while speaking to Dawn about the situation in Quetta. However, he added, “Now that the situation is returning to normal, it has been decided to restore mobile internet service from tomorrow at 12am midnight.” Meanwhile, mobile data services reportedly remained suspended in Nushki and Sibi, as well as in Mastung where services were briefly restored. Mobile data has been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns. Separately, a spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, Muhammad Kashif, told Dawn that train services from Quetta to other parts of the country remain suspended.

      "title_orig": "Musk’s mega-merger of SpaceX and xAI bets on sci-fi future of data centres in space",
      "summary_orig": "Seventy-five years ago, the idea of harnessing the power of the skies was little more than a fantasy spun by futurists like Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov . Elon Musk’s mega-merger of his companies xAI and SpaceX this week brings this sci-fi dream a step closer. Nasa engineers and technologists have speculated for nearly two decades about moving energy-hungry computing off the planet. More recently, the idea has captured the attention of Big Tech, including Alphabet and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin . The physics made sense; the solar energy was abundant. Still, the challenges seemed insurmountable. Musk, though, known for betting on seemingly far-out theories and getting them to work, may finally be laying the groundwork to make data centres in space a reality. He is armed with the world’s busiest satellite launch fleet, an AI startup, and an appetite for infrastructure that stretches from Earth to vacuum. “In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,” Musk said on Monday. “To harness even a millionth of our Sun’s energy would require over a million times more energy than our civilisation currently uses! The only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space.” The merger sharpens investor focus on how he might overcome big hurdles through a tightly woven ecosystem of rockets, satellites and AI systems, to take AI infrastructure beyond Earth. It comes just as SpaceX is preparing for a potential $1.5 trillion initial public offering (IPO). SpaceX has sought permission to launch up to 1 million solar-powered satellites engineered as orbital data centres, far beyond anything currently deployed or proposed. In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, SpaceX describes a solar-powered, optical-link-driven orbital data-centre system, though it did not say how many Starship launches would be required to scale the space data-centre network to an operational degree. “Compute in space isn’t sci-fi anymore,” said David Ariosto, author and founder of space intelligence firm The Space Agency. “And Elon Musk has already proven himself capable across multiple domains.” Old idea meets new economics Advocates argue that space-based data centres would be a cheaper alternative to data centres on Earth, thanks to constant solar energy and the ability to dump heat directly into space. But some experts have warned that big commercial gains are years from reality as the concept faces daunting challenges and is fraught with technical risks: radiation, debris, heat management, latency, and formidable economics that include high maintenance costs. “There’s some real challenges here, and how do you then make that cost-effective?” said Armand Musey, founder of Summit Ridge Group, who said the financial details of a project such as this was hard to model because the “technical unknowns haven’t been clarified.” “But never say never,” said Musey, who called Musk’s track record “unbelievable”. “I think a large part of it is, it’s a bet on Elon. His success is really hard for people to ignore.” Even with Musk’s ambitions, data centres in space may not be achievable for another decade, some experts have said. The underlying physics behind space-based infrastructure is not new. Harnessing solar power in orbit dates back to Cold War-era research, when the US Department of Energy and Nasa studied space-based solar power concepts in the 1970s, ultimately concluding that launch and materials costs made them impractical. What makes Musk’s efforts different is that his companies have more direct control over key elements of the system — from the rockets that will carry the hardware, to the links to beam data back to Earth, to a Musk-owned social network to generate demand for cheap AI computing. “SpaceX has structural advantages that few others can match. It controls the world’s most active launch fleet, has demonstrated mass production of spacecraft through Starlink, and has access to substantial private capital,” said Kathleen Curlee, a research analyst at Georgetown University. Bombarding chips with radiation Among the biggest challenges facing space data centres are radiation and cooling. Data-centre hardware will be bombarded by cosmic rays from the sun. In the past, chips designed for space were specially “hardened” for such radiation but were rarely as fast as today’s flagship AI chips. Cooling AI chips, which generate immense heat during computations, is the other hurdle. While space is cold, it is also a near vacuum, so heat cannot be carried away the way it is on Earth. Powerful chips must instead move heat into large radiators that shed it as infrared energy, adding significant size, weight, and therefore cost. SpaceX’s filing with the FCC describes cooling via “passive heat dissipation into the vacuum of space” and outlines how satellites that suffer operational failures rapidly de-orbit. More recently, Alphabet’s Google bombarded one of its AI chips with radiation at a university lab in California to see how it would endure a five- or six-year mission in space for a research effort to network solar-powered satellites into an orbital AI cloud called Project Suncatcher. “They held up quite well against that,” said Travis Beals, a senior executive at Google and lead of the project, which is set for a prototype launch to space in 2027.

      "summary_orig": "In the latest violence to undermine the ceasefire in Gaza, health officials said Israeli tank shelling and airstrikes killed 20 Palestinians, including four children, on Wednesday. Among the dead was a medic who rushed to help victims of a strike in the southern city of Khan Younis and was then killed by a second attack on the same location, health officials said. Other strikes hit Gaza City in the north, where health officials said a five-month-old boy was killed. The attacks come three days after Israel reopened Gaza’s main border crossing with Egypt, a major step in the US-backed truce. The Israeli military claimed it had launched the strikes in response to gunmen opening fire against Israeli troops operating near its armistice line with Hamas. It said an Israeli soldier was severely injured by the fire. Wednesday’s attacks bring the number of Palestinians killed since the border reopened to 28, according to a tally from Gazan health officials. On Saturday, before its reopening, Israeli strikes killed more than 30 Palestinians in Gaza. The military said it launched those strikes after gunmen emerged from a tunnel in a Gaza area under Israeli control. Patient crossings at Rafah halted Palestinian patients preparing to cross through the newly opened Rafah border crossing to Egypt were told that Israel had postponed the passage of patients through the border. A few hours later, the patients were told to prepare again to cross the border. A spokesperson for the Red Crescent said patients had arrived at a hospital in Khan Younis in preparation for crossing Rafah for treatment, only to be informed that Israel had postponed the evacuations. “They called the patients and said today there is no travel at all, the crossing is closed,” Raja’a Abu Teir, a Palestinian patient who was set to be evacuated, told Reuters at the hospital, where several patients were waiting in ambulances. An Egyptian security source told Reuters that efforts were being made to reopen the crossing, and that Israel had cited security issues in the Rafah area as the reason for the closure. The Israeli agency that controls access to Gaza, COGAT, claimed in a statement on Wednesday that Rafah crossing remained open, adding that it had not received the necessary coordination details from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to facilitate the crossing. The WHO did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reopening the crossing was one of the requirements under the October ceasefire that set out the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas. Sixteen patients from Gaza and 40 of their escorts crossed into Egypt on Tuesday, Gazan medics told Reuters . A Hamas police source told Reuters that at least 40 people crossed from Egypt to Gaza late on Tuesday. In January, Trump declared the start of the second phase of the ceasefire, where the sides would negotiate the shattered enclave’s future governance and reconstruction. Key issues like the withdrawal of Israeli forces from over 50 per cent of Gaza, which they currently occupy, and the disarmament of Hamas remain unresolved, while the fragile ceasefire has been marked by near-daily violence. Since the start of the ceasefire, Israeli fire has killed at least 530 people, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials. Palestinian fighters have killed four Israeli soldiers in the same period, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health authorities, displaced most of its population, and left much of the strip in ruins. Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects. The Oct 7, 2023 Hamas attack that triggered the offensive killed around 1,200 in Israel, according to Israeli tallies.",

      "summary_orig": "Terrorists martyred a police recruit constable in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, the local police said on Wednesday. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. KP and Balochistan are particularly frequent targets. The constable was killed in the Darga forest in Nasrkhel, near the Sarai Naurang area of ​​Lakki Marwat. District Police Spokesperson Qudratullah confirmed the incident, saying that the martyred constable had been undergoing training at Hangu Training School. “On Tuesday night, terrorists abducted him from his house in Nasrkhel and took him to a forest called Darga and shot and killed him there,” he said. The funeral prayers of the constable were offered with official honours at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines. Lakki Marwat’s District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan, Superintendent of Police (SP) Investigation Murad Khan, police officers, district administration officers and police personnel attended the prayers in large numbers. The DPO also paid tribute to the martyr’s sacrifice, saying that the constable had set “a shining example of bravery and sacrifice” by giving his life in the line of duty. “The entire nation is proud of this brave soldier. These cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken our resolve,” he said. “The morale of Lakki Marwat police is high and actions against Fitna-al-Khawarij will be further intensified. No sacrifice will be spared to protect the lives and property of the people, and the involved elements will be brought to their logical end soon.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Despite record militant deaths , the country saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. Last month, the KP Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan. Only days before that, at least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts, officials said. The previous week, the military’s media wing had said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. That same day, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu.",

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the UNSC said the attacks, which occurred on January 31, 2026, were carried out across the province and described them as “heinous and cowardly acts of terrorism”. The UNSC expressed its “deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the governor and people of Pakistan”. The council also wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured in the attacks. The statement reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”. It added that it was crucial to “hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice,” urging all states to cooperate with the government of Pakistan in accordance with international law and relevant UNSC resolutions. The UNSC reiterated that “any act of terrorism is criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of motivation, timing, or perpetrator”. It further stressed that all states must combat terrorism “by all means, in accordance with the UN Charter and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, and international humanitarian law,” in order to address threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. Earlier on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combating terrorism. “We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said. The number of terrorists killed in clearance operations across Balochistan has risen to 197, as security forces continued ‘ mop-up’ actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province.

      "title_orig": "The eternal ascent: Basant returns to the skies of Lahore",
      "summary_orig": "In the ancient city of Lahore, where the Ravi river whispers secrets to the minarets of the Badshahi Mosque, spring arrives not with a gentle sigh, but with a sudden, jubilant roar. When the winter’s fog finally yields to the sun’s warm gaze, the skies above the walled city awaken. Kites (‘patangs’) burst upward from rooftops, their paper bodies trembling, their tails slicing the blue sky like calligraphy in motion. This is Basant: a centuries-old festival marked by marigold blooms and kites, carried by colour and the steady pull of the wind. Bo Kata! — a festival of freedom and flight Basant traces its roots to Vasant Panchami, the ancient herald of spring observed on the fifth day of Magh, when the land stirs from winter’s slumber. In the mustard fields of Punjab, ochre blooms unfurl like carpets laid for spring’s arrival. Goddess Saraswati, (the goddess of learning and the arts), clad in saffron-gold, is invoked with music and learning, her veena (an Indian stringed instrument) resonating with the promise of renewal. In Lahore, however, Basant long outgrew its ritual origins. It became deeply Punjabi, exuberantly urban, and radically inclusive. Hindu, Muslim and Sikh households alike climbed their roofs, dressed in amber and marigold hues, turning the city into a living mosaic where faith receded, and celebration took flight. Historical chronicles recall Basant at its most magnificent during the Mughal era. Emperors revelled in the spectacle: kites wheeling above the ramparts of Lahore Fort, their strings guided by hands adorned with henna. Amir Khusrau, the Sufi poet whose verses still seem to linger in the city’s breath, sang of Basant as a season of love, colour, and divine intoxication. A man holds kites ahead of the three-day kite-flying festival (Basant) at a market in Lahore on Feb 2, 2026. — APP/ File Later, in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the festival assumed an even grander, almost theatrical form. For 10 days, Lahore became a city lost in celebration. Marigold garlands draped streets and courtyards; soldiers appeared in turmeric-hued turbans; women swayed on jhulas (swings), the steady beat of the dhol travelled through every lane. Above it all, kite battles drew cheers of “Bo kata!” from rooftop to rooftop. Yet the true poetry of Basant lies not in its pomp, but in the humble kite itself. A fragile diamond-framed paper and bamboo, it is tethered to earth by a single string, yet it yearns for the heavens. In the hands of a Lahori child or elder, the patang becomes more than play: it is an act of transcendence. As the wind takes hold, the kite escapes the dust and clamour of crowded streets, briefly escaping the confines of class and circumstance, carrying the hopes of those who hold the string below. For many in Lahore, Basant has always been this quiet rebellion against gravity. In narrow streets where life presses close, the rooftop becomes a stage for liberation. A young man, burdened by tomorrow’s worries, sends his kite aloft and watches it soar, higher, freer, until it seems to touch the very edge of possibility. A woman, her heart full of unspoken longings, lets the wind carry her kite as if it could bear her dreams to distant horizons. The kite is an escape made visible: fragile yet defiant, tethered yet boundless. It reminds us that even the smallest soul can touch the infinite if given the right wind. The ghost of Basant lingering in memory for two decades For nearly two decades, however, the skies remained silent. The ban descended after tragic losses, lives claimed by sharp, glass-coated or metallic strings that sliced through the air, severing throats and injuring bystanders on rooftops and streets below. The silence was born of necessary grief and reckoning, a painful but essential pause to protect what mattered most. Families who once gathered with spools of thread in their hands now looked up at an empty blue sky, feeling the absence like a missing heartbeat. Old men sat on charpoys in the evenings, eyes distant, murmuring about days when the sky was alive with colour. Mothers recalled their children’s laughter as they ran across terraces, cheeks flushed with sun and excitement. Young people, who had known Basant only through stories and grainy videos, carried a quiet nostalgia for something they had never truly touched. A tournament at Guddi Ground in Lahore’s Iqbal Park in January 2001. — Dawn/ File The city missed it deeply: the shared joy, the playful rivalries, the way the wind seemed to carry away every worry for a single radiant day. Basant had become a beloved ghost, lingering over rooftops and in memory. But the longing never died. It lived in whispered conversations, in turmeric-hued kurtas worn on spring days as quiet tribute, in the careful way kite-makers kept their craft alive in the city’s hidden corners. It lived in the hope that one day the skies would fill again — not recklessly, but with wisdom earned from sorrow. Lahore’s patangs are set to rise once more, responsibly And now, as February has ascended, the wind is stirring once more. Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025, with its strict mandates for cotton strings only (no metallic or glass coatings), QR-coded registration, maximum nine threads, drone monitoring, and zero tolerance for violations, the patangs will rise again, thoughtfully and safely, over the rooftops of Lahore on February 6, 7, and 8, 2026. The old songs are being rehearsed, the dhol awaits its beat, and the air will soon carry the sweet scent of marigold sweets and the gentle tug of ordinary thread. What was lost is being remembered with care; what was mourned is being welcomed back, wiser and more precious for the wait. As one lifelong resident of Anarkali, Anwar Bajwa, shared with quiet emotion: “Basant was never just a day for me; it was part of who I was, part of every spring morning when the air turned warm and full of promise. As a boy, I would wake before dawn and run to the rooftop with my siblings, thread in hand, my heart racing for the wind to lift our kites. Those patangs were my companions, my secrets, my way of whispering dreams to the sky when words fell short. Every tug on the string felt like my own heartbeat reaching higher.” He added that when the rooftops went silent, “it was like losing a piece of my childhood. The empty sky in spring felt wrong, heavy, and incomplete. Now, hearing that the kites will fly again, safely and responsibly, I feel that old excitement stirring inside me, like time has turned back and I’m that boy once again, waiting for the wind to carry my dreams up where nothing can touch them.” The skies of old Basant were tapestries of scarlet, emerald, indigo, and amber, woven by thousands of patangs locked in gentle combat. Rooftops brimmed with laughter, the air thick with the scent of marigold-hued sweets. Families gathered, strangers became friends, and for radiant days, Lahore was united in pure, unbridled joy. The kite, too, carries its own quiet symbolism. A close look reveals intricate designs — stars, eyes, flowers — each patang a small work of art, born in the hands of artisans who know the wind’s secrets. And beneath it all, the earth itself celebrates: vast fields of mustard-gold sway in the breeze, a living mirror to the crowds above. The return of flight and soaring spirits As the season approaches, the memory of those quiet years only deepens the anticipation. The skies have been empty for too long, yet the longing has made every coming flight more sacred. In every Lahori heart, the kite still waits, patient, hopeful, and soon it will rise once more. When it does, Lahore will not merely remember joy; it will reclaim it, wiser for the silence, stronger for the lessons etched in loss. Basant returns not as a fleeting spectacle, but as proof that even after the darkest pause, the human spirit, fragile as paper and defiant as wind, can ascend again, tethered only by the thinnest thread of care, soaring toward a boundless sky that belongs, once more, to all of us.

A man holds kites ahead of the three-day kite-flying festival (Basant) at a market in Lahore on Feb 2, 2026. — APP/ File Later, in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the festival assumed an even grander, almost theatrical form. For 10 days, Lahore became a city lost in celebration. Marigold garlands draped streets and courtyards; soldiers appeared in turmeric-hued turbans; women swayed on jhulas (swings), the steady beat of the dhol travelled through every lane. Above it all, kite battles drew cheers of “Bo kata!” from rooftop to rooftop. Yet the true poetry of Basant lies not in its pomp, but in the humble kite itself. A fragile diamond-framed paper and bamboo, it is tethered to earth by a single string, yet it yearns for the heavens. In the hands of a Lahori child or elder, the patang becomes more than play: it is an act of transcendence. As the wind takes hold, the kite escapes the dust and clamour of crowded streets, briefly escaping the confines of class and circumstance, carrying the hopes of those who hold the string below. For many in Lahore, Basant has always been this quiet rebellion against gravity. In narrow streets where life presses close, the rooftop becomes a stage for liberation. A young man, burdened by tomorrow’s worries, sends his kite aloft and watches it soar, higher, freer, until it seems to touch the very edge of possibility. A woman, her heart full of unspoken longings, lets the wind carry her kite as if it could bear her dreams to distant horizons. The kite is an escape made visible: fragile yet defiant, tethered yet boundless. It reminds us that even the smallest soul can touch the infinite if given the right wind. The ghost of Basant lingering in memory for two decades For nearly two decades, however, the skies remained silent. The ban descended after tragic losses, lives claimed by sharp, glass-coated or metallic strings that sliced through the air, severing throats and injuring bystanders on rooftops and streets below. The silence was born of necessary grief and reckoning, a painful but essential pause to protect what mattered most. Families who once gathered with spools of thread in their hands now looked up at an empty blue sky, feeling the absence like a missing heartbeat. Old men sat on charpoys in the evenings, eyes distant, murmuring about days when the sky was alive with colour. Mothers recalled their children’s laughter as they ran across terraces, cheeks flushed with sun and excitement. Young people, who had known Basant only through stories and grainy videos, carried a quiet nostalgia for something they had never truly touched. A tournament at Guddi Ground in Lahore’s Iqbal Park in January 2001. — Dawn/ File The city missed it deeply: the shared joy, the playful rivalries, the way the wind seemed to carry away every worry for a single radiant day. Basant had become a beloved ghost, lingering over rooftops and in memory. But the longing never died. It lived in whispered conversations, in turmeric-hued kurtas worn on spring days as quiet tribute, in the careful way kite-makers kept their craft alive in the city’s hidden corners. It lived in the hope that one day the skies would fill again — not recklessly, but with wisdom earned from sorrow. Lahore’s patangs are set to rise once more, responsibly And now, as February has ascended, the wind is stirring once more. Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025, with its strict mandates for cotton strings only (no metallic or glass coatings), QR-coded registration, maximum nine threads, drone monitoring, and zero tolerance for violations, the patangs will rise again, thoughtfully and safely, over the rooftops of Lahore on February 6, 7, and 8, 2026. The old songs are being rehearsed, the dhol awaits its beat, and the air will soon carry the sweet scent of marigold sweets and the gentle tug of ordinary thread. What was lost is being remembered with care; what was mourned is being welcomed back, wiser and more precious for the wait. As one lifelong resident of Anarkali, Anwar Bajwa, shared with quiet emotion: “Basant was never just a day for me; it was part of who I was, part of every spring morning when the air turned warm and full of promise. As a boy, I would wake before dawn and run to the rooftop with my siblings, thread in hand, my heart racing for the wind to lift our kites. Those patangs were my companions, my secrets, my way of whispering dreams to the sky when words fell short. Every tug on the string felt like my own heartbeat reaching higher.” He added that when the rooftops went silent, “it was like losing a piece of my childhood. The empty sky in spring felt wrong, heavy, and incomplete. Now, hearing that the kites will fly again, safely and responsibly, I feel that old excitement stirring inside me, like time has turned back and I’m that boy once again, waiting for the wind to carry my dreams up where nothing can touch them.” The skies of old Basant were tapestries of scarlet, emerald, indigo, and amber, woven by thousands of patangs locked in gentle combat. Rooftops brimmed with laughter, the air thick with the scent of marigold-hued sweets. Families gathered, strangers became friends, and for radiant days, Lahore was united in pure, unbridled joy. The kite, too, carries its own quiet symbolism. A close look reveals intricate designs — stars, eyes, flowers — each patang a small work of art, born in the hands of artisans who know the wind’s secrets. And beneath it all, the earth itself celebrates: vast fields of mustard-gold sway in the breeze, a living mirror to the crowds above. The return of flight and soaring spirits As the season approaches, the memory of those quiet years only deepens the anticipation. The skies have been empty for too long, yet the longing has made every coming flight more sacred. In every Lahori heart, the kite still waits, patient, hopeful, and soon it will rise once more. When it does, Lahore will not merely remember joy; it will reclaim it, wiser for the silence, stronger for the lessons etched in loss. Basant returns not as a fleeting spectacle, but as proof that even after the darkest pause, the human spirit, fragile as paper and defiant as wind, can ascend again, tethered only by the thinnest thread of care, soaring toward a boundless sky that belongs, once more, to all of us.

      "summary": "In the ancient city of Lahore, where the Ravi river whispers secrets to the minarets of the Badshahi Mosque, spring arrives not with a gentle sigh, but with a sudden, jubilant roar. When the winter’s fog finally yields to the sun’s warm gaze, the skies above the walled city awaken. Kites (‘patangs’) burst upward from rooftops, their paper bodies trembling, their tails slicing the blue sky like calligraphy in motion. This is Basant: a centuries-old festival marked by marigold blooms and kites, carried by colour and the steady pull of the wind. Bo Kata! — a festival of freedom and flight Basant traces its roots to Vasant Panchami, the ancient herald of spring observed on the fifth day of Magh, when the land stirs from winter’s slumber. In the mustard fields of Punjab, ochre blooms unfurl like carpets laid for spring’s arrival. Goddess Saraswati, (the goddess of learning and the arts), clad in saffron-gold, is invoked with music and learning, her veena (an Indian stringed instrument) resonating with the promise of renewal. In Lahore, however, Basant long outgrew its ritual origins. It became deeply Punjabi, exuberantly urban, and radically inclusive. Hindu, Muslim and Sikh households alike climbed their roofs, dressed in amber and marigold hues, turning the city into a living mosaic where faith receded, and celebration took flight. Historical chronicles recall Basant at its most magnificent during the Mughal era. Emperors revelled in the spectacle: kites wheeling above the ramparts of Lahore Fort, their strings guided by hands adorned with henna.

      "summary_orig": "Gold prices extended gains on Wednesday on safe-haven appeal, as renewed geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran added to the yellow metal’s recent upswing that saw it mark its best day since 2008 in the previous session. Spot gold gained 2.7 per cent to$5,071.79 per ounce as of 03:53 GMT, after surging 5.9pc on Tuesday, its biggest daily gain since November 2008. Bullion scaled a record high of $5,594.82 last Thursday. US gold futures for April delivery climbed 3.2pc to $5,092.0 per ounce. “Gold has climbed back about the key $5,000 level, … (as) geopolitical tensions have lifted the metal’s safe-haven appeal after US forces downed an Iranian drone,” said Jigar Trivedi, a senior research analyst at IndusInd Securities. The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters. Nuclear talks between the US and Iran are expected to take place in Oman on Friday, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on Tuesday, citing an Arab source. Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a spending deal into law that ends a partial US government shutdown, which had delayed key labour data reports that were due for release this week. Investors expect at least two Fed interest rate cuts in 2026 and await ADP private payroll data later in the day for more cues on the Fed’s policy path. Non-yielding bullion tends to perform better in low-interest-rate environments. “Going ahead (gold) prices may touch $5,100 in the very near-term … and we are expecting the same $5,600 levels by the end of the first half or April-end while prices will continue to rise thereafter and our year-end target is $6,000/oz,” Trivedi added. The current wave is expected to be sharp, probably to surge into the $4,950 to $5,198 range, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said on Tuesday. Spot silver rose 3.2pc to $87.84 an ounce. It touched a record high of $121.64 on Thursday. Spot platinum added 2.9pc to $2,273.70 per ounce after hitting an all-time high of $2,918.80 on January 26, while palladium gained 3pc to $1,784.67.",

      "title_orig": "Spin-heavy Pakistan hit form, but India boycott risks early T20 exit",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s spin-heavy squad are in winning form ahead of the T20 World Cup, but a controversial decision to forfeit their marquee clash against India could still trigger another early exit. Pakistan came close to withdrawing from the tournament in solidarity with Bangladesh , who pulled out after refusing to play in India, citing security concerns. The Pakistan government eventually cleared the team’s participation but it barred them from facing India in Colombo in a blockbuster clash on February 15. With two points for a win, a forfeit of the match will leave Pakistan with no margin for error if they are to progress as one of the top two from a five-team Group A. It means they must win their opening game against the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday and beat the United States three days later to stay in contention. Their final group game will be against Namibia on February 18. Captain Salman Agha said the move to boycott the India game was out of the team’s hands. “That is not our decision. We have to follow what our government decides,” he said. The Pakistan government has not said what their stance might be if the team were to end up facing India again in the semi-finals or final. Agha was not thinking about that. “Our job is to win, and we are capable of doing that,” he said. Pakistan will be keen to avoid a repeat of the last T20 World Cup in 2024, where a shock super over defeat to co-hosts the United States led to them failing to get out of the group. The side has since faced criticism for failing to adapt to the modern demands of T20 cricket, with the batting, particularly Babar Azam’s low strike rate , under scrutiny. The criticism was fuelled by Pakistan’s record last year, where 21 of their 34 T20 international wins came against lower-ranked opponents. Confidence restored Against elite teams, the results were sobering: three losses to India in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series defeat to New Zealand. However, Agha believes recent performances have restored confidence. Pakistan beat South Africa 2-1, won a home tri-series, and then completed a 3-0 sweep of an under-strength Australia. “We’ve had good preparation by beating Australia. We have the luxury of quality spinning all-rounders like Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan and Saim Ayub. “We’re ticking most boxes and believe we can win the World Cup,” Agha said. The spin department has been strengthened by Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, the latter known for his unusual, slingy action and exaggerated pause at the crease. The pace attack is led by the experienced Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah. Faheem Ashraf provides seam-bowling all-round support and newcomer Salman Mirza has been impressive. Batting remains Pakistan’s most volatile component. When openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan provide strong starts, the side can post competitive totals, but collapses remain a constant threat. Head coach Mike Hesson has added another layer of risk by leaving out experienced wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan because of poor form, opting instead for makeshift options in Usman Khan, Khawaja Nafay and Farhan. For Pakistan, the ingredients for a deep run are present, but with points potentially forfeited, there is little room left for error.",

      "summary_orig": "TRIPOLI: Saif al Islam, the most prominent son of the late Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi, was shot dead at his home on Tuesday. Abdullah Othman Abdul Rahim, a relative, told a TV channel that Saif al Islam was killed in his house by a group of four unidentified men. “Four armed men stormed the residence of Saif al Islam Qadhafi after disabling surveillance cameras, then executed him,” Abdul Rahim said. While Saif al Islam was well known in the north African country, especially for his role in shaping policy during his father’s rule, his public profile receded in recent years. In 2015, a Libyan court passed a death sentence in absentia on Saif al Islam for suppressing peaceful protests during the country’s 2011 revolution that ended his father’s rule. He was also provisionally charged by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity. In 2021, Saif al Islam registered as a presidential candidate for a December vote that eventually collapsed amid a political deadlock. Saif went from being his father’s heir apparent to a decade of captivity and obscurity in a remote hill town before launching a presidential bid that helped derail the attempted election in 2021. Despite holding no official position, he was once seen as the most powerful figure after his father, who ruled for more than four decades. He led talks on Libya abandoning its weapons of mass destruction and negotiated compensation for the families of those killed in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland in 1988.

In the hours before the attack, someone - and we have no way of knowing who - placed a series of bets that Donald Trump would oust Maduro on a prediction market platform, netting them nearly $500,000 when it happened. These platforms allow their users not just to bet on whoever’s going to win the Super Bowl, but also on world events. Heavily regulated under the Biden administration, these apps have enjoyed a huge boom in popularity since Trump came to power. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "• Drone ‘approaching’ aircraft carrier shot down; gunboats approach US-flagged vessel • White House says talks still on despite skirmishes • Tehran officials ‘seek change of venue’ after Pezeshkian’s go-ahead for negotiations • FO says Pakistan also invited to attend dialogue ISLAMABAD / DUBAI: Tehran has asked for a change of venue ahead of planned talks between US and Iranian officials this week, after President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed ordering the initiation of dialogue with Washington. On Tuesday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office also confirmed that it had been invited to participate in the Iran-US talks aimed at de-escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington. According to earlier reports, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi were supposed to meet in Istanbul on Friday in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran’s nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war. The Reuters news agency, however, reported on Tuesday night that instead of Istanbul, Iranian officials are asking that the talks be held in Oman instead, and that the scope be narrowed to two-way talks on nuclear issues only. This latest uncertainty followed reports of escalatory moves in the Persian Gulf, where a US warplane shot down an alleged Iranian drone that was said to be approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. Earlier, a US-flagged tanker was approached and challenged by Iranian gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz, before continuing on its way, the British maritime security firm Vanguard Tech said. However, the White House reiterated that the proposed talks were still on, despite these hiccups. “I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks as of right now are still scheduled,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that they were due to happen “later this week.” Hectic diplomacy Iran’s president confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of talks with the US, provided they were free of threats, after his counterpart Donald Trump suggested “bad things” would happen without a deal. “I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X. He added that the talks followed requests “from friendly governments”. On Tuesday, Qatar’s foreign ministry said diplomacy with Iran was “continuing very intensively”, in “tandem with all our neighbours”. Earlier, a senior official from the UAE said Iran needed to reach a deal and “rebuild their relationship with the United States”. “I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don’t have these issues every other day,” said presidential adviser Anwar Gargash. Iran has repeatedly stressed that any talks should remain focused solely on the nuclear issue, rejecting the possibility of negotiations over its missile programme or defence capabilities. When asked about the upcoming talks, an Iranian diplomatic source told Reuters they were “neither optimistic nor pessimistic”, adding that Tehran would not negotiate over its defensive capabilities. Pakistan’s role “Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query on Tuesday. “Pakistan’s participation is seen as crucial to defusing tensions, as Islamabad has been quietly working to facilitate the talks,” a diplomatic source told Dawn. The diplomatic source added that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected to participate in the meeting. The priority of the talks is to avoid any conflict and de-escalate tensions between the two sides, a regional official told Reuters , adding that some regional powers were also invited. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the countries invited to the talks at the foreign ministers’ level included Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The person said the format of the meetings remained unclear, but that the “main meeting” would be on Friday. Last-minute change? According to Reuters , a regional diplomat said that Tehran wants to change the format of the talks. “They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans while the U.S. wants to include the ballistic missiles and the activities of Iran’s proxies in the region.” A source said that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.
