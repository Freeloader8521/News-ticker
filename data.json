      "title_orig": "Aleema files contempt plea against Adiala jail superintendent after repeatedly being denied meeting with Imran",
      "summary_orig": "Aleema Khan, the sister of PTI founder Imran Khan, has filed a contempt of court petition against the Adiala jail superintendent and others over their failure to comply with an earlier Islamabad High Court (IHC) order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for the incarcerated former premier. The petition was filed after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, along with several other PTI members, staged an overnight sit-in outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where Imran has been imprisoned since 2023. The sit-in was staged as CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the eighth time on Thursday. Previously, Imran’s sisters, including Aleema, had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier. The PTI ended its latest sit-in on Friday morning, with the KP CM announcing that they would be approaching the IHC, where Aleema has now filed a contempt plea. Apart from Adiala Jail Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum, Saddar Beroni Station House Office Raja Aizaz Azeem, Federal Interior Secretary Capt (retd) Muhammad Khurram Agha and Punjab Home Department Secretary Noorul Amin have been named as respondents in the plea. The plea, a copy of which is available with Dawn , stated that Aleema had “remained deeply concerned about the well-being, legal rights, and humane treatment of her brother during his ongoing incarceration”. The petition referred to the IHC’s March 24 order, in which the court had reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for Imran. It said Aleema sought the initiation of contempt of court proceedings “on account of the wilful non-implementation of the orders passed by this honourable court, particularly with respect to the authorities’ failure to allow” her meetings with Imran, in line with the court’s directives in March. It further stated that “due to the persistent non-cooperation” of the Adiala jail superintendent and “ongoing political victimisation”, Imran and others were “constrained” to file writ petitions before the IHC, seeking the enforcement of visitation rights. “However, despite the clear and unequivocal directions of this honourable court, the respondents have failed to comply and have repeatedly denied access to the legal counsel, family members, and associates” of Imran on multiple occasions, it added. The plea further recalled that in line with previous court orders, the respondents had devised on March 28, 2024 standard operating procedures (SOPs) for meeting Imran. According to those SOPs, Tuesdays and Thursdays were “designated for interviews with Imran by his family/ lawyers and friends, respectively”. Despite directions for allowing visits to Imran on Tuesdays and Thursdays, “the respondents did not comply with or implement the same”, the plea said. It recalled that the Adiala Jail superintendent had also submitted an undertaking to the IHC on November 8, 2024 that Imran’s friends would be allowed to meet him on Tuesday the following week and his family and lawyers would be permitted to meet him on Thursday, according to the list provided by the ex-premier. But when several PTI leaders went to Adiala Jail to meet Imran on November 11, 2024, the superintendent “caused them to wait for several hours and thereafter unlawfully detained them in police custody”. The plea alleged that the respondents were “wilfully flouting” the court orders and the undertaking submitted to it, and “conducted themselves to ridicule the authority” of the IHC. It said their actions were an “apparent activity of serious contempt of this honourable court, for which they are liable to be dealt with under criminal proceedings”. The plea sought the initiation of contempt proceedings against the respondents for not complying with the IHC’s March 24 order and urged the court to punish them in accordance with the law “to meet the ends of justice”. It also sought the court’s directives for the respondents to comply with its March 24 order. ‘Was told CJ did not want to meet us’ Aleema, along with KP CM Afridi, had reached the IHC in the morning, where the two intended to meet the IHC chief justice. However, while speaking to the media at the IHC, CM Afridi said that they were informed that the high court chief justice “did not want to meet them”. The provincial chief executive lamented that no one had been allowed to meet Imran or his wife, Bushra Bibi, since October 27. “We know nothing about his condition,” he said. “Neither his sisters are allowed to meet him, nor his [party’s] leadership, nor lawyers, nor doctors.” He also recalled a sit-in staged by Imran’s sisters outside Adiala Jail on November 19. The PTI has alleged that police had manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion. “The whole nation saw what happened. Imran Khan sahib ’s sisters were dragged along the road by their hair, pushed down and disrespected. Even though they have no connection with politics; they just go to see their brother.” The KP CM said he, along with six other people, had asked jail authorities yesterday to allow them to speak to Imran for “just two or three minutes”. “We also assured them that we will not talk about politics or administrative matters. We said we just wanted to find out about his health. “But we were still not allowed to meet.” CM Afridi alleged that the KP and its government were facing discrimination, saying that “in other provinces, Pakistan Air Force planes were used for the chief minister’s travel”. “By such actions, you are creating division. You are causing resentment and distances to grow,” he said. He alleged that efforts were being made to “put Pakistan’s strongest political party against the wall” with its leader being discriminated against and his family, party and government in KP being targeted. “You are worsening the situation yourselves,” CM Afridi said, warning that if it worsened further, “neither side would be able to bring it under control”. He announced that the PTI had also decided not to let National Assembly and Senate sessions scheduled for today proceed “because we want our leadership and Imran Khan sahib ’s sisters to be allowed to meet him”. The legislatures were not of any use if they could not deliver justice to their representatives, he decried. “Business as usual will not go on after this” until the PTI founder was allowed to meet his sisters and party leadership, he added. The KP chief minister said that they had called on “all parliamentarians, from all over Pakistan”, to gather and protest peacefully outside the high court on Tuesday before proceeding to Adiala Jail. “The Constitution and the law give us the right to protest,” he said. “We will definitely use this option,” he said, adding that if their constitutional right to meet Imran was granted, the PTI would not turn to protest. ‘Entire focus on one illegal demand’ Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused the PTI, including KP CM Afridi, of adopting an approach in which governance for the people was pushed to the back burner. “And the entire focus is on one illegal demand that political guidance is to be taken only from the [party] founder serving a sentence in Adiala jail in a corruption case,” he added. “This is against jail rules,” he claimed. Highlighting the importance of KP in the context of the fight against terrorism, he said: “Instead of the provincial government prioritising peace, progress and relief for the public, the party leadership kept itself busy in Islamabad by centering its politics on this illegal narrative”. Continuing his accusations, he added: “Allegedly, a woman politician from the PTI […] ran a vile campaign regarding Khan sahib through anti-Pakistan accounts operating from Afghanistan and on the Indian media. This was an attempt to defame Pakistan worldwide. “This approach is open enmity against Pakistan […] The PTI should abandon the anti-Pakistan narrative and [its] wrong priorities and now give preference to the interests of the people and the state.” Failed efforts Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “ sabotaging ” meetings with him. Among them, KP CM Afridi has been seeking a meeting with the former prime minister since his election on October 13. He had taken his oath as the provincial chief executive on October 15 and gone to Adiala jail to meet Imran the very next day after getting protective bail from the Peshawar High Court. However, he was turned away after a wait of two hours. On Oct 17, he moved the IHC , seeking a meeting with Imran, and wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi with the same request. The plea was taken up on October 23 along with several other similar ones by an IHC bench, which directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement the high court’s March 24 order . However, Afridi’s attempts to meet the PTI founder have failed so far. Yesterday was the eighth time that he was denied a meeting with Imran since becoming the provincial chief executive. Visuals reposted by the PTI on X showed CM Afridi, along with other party workers, offering Fajr prayers outside the jail on Friday morning before they ended the sit-in. Other images showed Afridi and others huddled around a fire. Earlier, on November 19, the PTI had held a protest outside the jail as the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. The party alleged that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion. An hours-long sit-in was also held more recently on November 25 and was wrapped up at the request of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir. Concerns about Imran’s health Meanwhile, the PTI had expressed concern over Imran’s health while incarcerated, as he has been barred from seeing his family and lawyers for over three weeks. Former PM’s aide Zulfi Bukhari said no one has seen Imran since November 4 and no reason has been given for denying meetings. “His health is our concern. We are worried about his illegal isolation,” Bukhari told Reuters , demanding the government give Imran’s family immediate access to him. A jail official told Reuters that the former premier was in good health and that he was not aware of any plans to move him to any other facility. He spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. The Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. Amid media reports that the 73-year-old former international cricketer might be moved to a high-security prison to make meeting him more challenging, international media outlets such as Japan’s Nikkei and the BBC also covered the concern over his status. His well-being became a talking point on social media with the trend ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ also trending on X in the morning. The interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment. But yesterday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior PTI leaders dismissed reports of former premier Imran Khan’s ill health, with both sides stating that the PTI founder is ‘fine and nothing is wrong with him’.

The party alleged that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion. An hours-long sit-in was also held more recently on November 25 and was wrapped up at the request of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir. Concerns about Imran’s health Meanwhile, the PTI had expressed concern over Imran’s health while incarcerated, as he has been barred from seeing his family and lawyers for over three weeks. Former PM’s aide Zulfi Bukhari said no one has seen Imran since November 4 and no reason has been given for denying meetings. “His health is our concern. We are worried about his illegal isolation,” Bukhari told Reuters , demanding the government give Imran’s family immediate access to him. A jail official told Reuters that the former premier was in good health and that he was not aware of any plans to move him to any other facility. He spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. The Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. Amid media reports that the 73-year-old former international cricketer might be moved to a high-security prison to make meeting him more challenging, international media outlets such as Japan’s Nikkei and the BBC also covered the concern over his status. His well-being became a talking point on social media with the trend ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ also trending on X in the morning. The interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment. But yesterday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior PTI leaders dismissed reports of former premier Imran Khan’s ill health, with both sides stating that the PTI founder is ‘fine and nothing is wrong with him’.

      "title_orig": "Rising UAE visa rejections leave Pakistani travellers in limbo",
      "summary_orig": "When 28-year-old Nadeem, a marketing professional from Lahore, planned his first leisure trip to Dubai this year, he never imagined it would turn into a months-long ordeal. He applied for a visit visa through a travel agency, confident it would be a “routine process”. Instead, his application was rejected twice: first in January, then again at the beginning of November. The agency handling his case told him the reason was simple: he was “under 40”, and younger applicants were facing higher scrutiny. For Nadeem, who chose to be identified by his first name only, the explanation only added to the confusion already circulating among frustrated travellers. “I don’t understand it. What does my age have to do with anything? I’m employed full-time, and I submitted my bank statement. My friend, a freelancer, got it on the first attempt. I have applied for a third time, so I’m keeping my fingers crossed, but it’s exhausting,” he told Dawn . Visa rejections have recently become a recurring issue for Pakistanis travelling to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), despite the Gulf country’s close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties with Pakistan. Abu Dhabi is Islamabad’s major trading partner in the Middle East and a key source of remittances, hosting a large Pakistani expatriate population. On Thursday, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry told the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that the UAE had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis , though he clarified there was no formal ban on Pakistani passports. Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who heads the committee, told Dawn that the restrictions were imposed due to concerns about travellers “getting involved in criminal activities,” and said very few visas had been granted lately, “after much difficulty.” The issue has persisted for months. In January 2025, the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis was informed that some visas to the UAE had been “ unofficially closed ”. Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig said the UAE had reservations about Pakistanis on visit visas potentially “resorting to begging”. The following month, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the UAE, Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, described the Gulf country’s refusal of visas to Pakistani nationals as a “serious and significant” issue. In comments to Arab News , he said Emirati authorities had raised concerns about the authenticity of documents, including educational credentials, as well as cases involving applicants with criminal records. “If they find a dichotomy somewhere, even if the document is genuine but the attestation either in Pakistan or in the UAE is not genuine, it could cause major rejections,” Tirmizi said, adding that AI-based verification systems were now being used. In April, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi announced that visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could now avail a five-year visa. Despite these assurances, early July saw renewed problems. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi raised the issue with his UAE counterpart, and during a July 11 meeting, UAE Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured full support in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens. Yet, travellers continued to face obstacles. Fatima Attarwala, a journalist, recalled her attempts to cover Gulfood, a major event in Dubai: “My visa got rejected twice. First, we went through one agency, then to the official agency coordinating the event, but every visa application for those under 45 was rejected. Even company directors’ visas weren’t approved in the first round. The second round only granted visas to applicants over 45 years of age. It’s not a Pakistan-only problem — people from Africa and other countries also faced the same.” Syed Abbas Raza Naqvi, 25, who works for an American company, said he received repeated rejections despite corporate sponsorship. “I started trying in September last year for a conference in January. My company provided the invitation and all the supporting documents, but it still didn’t work. I tried three times. Eventually, a ‘guaranteed visa’ was issued at a higher fee, but the process remains opaque and stressful.” Abbas applied for a five-year, multiple-entry visit visa in September this year, only to be rejected again. “The visa cost $1,200 (Rs 339,000). I was refunded $650, but it was still a significant loss. Luckily, my company covered the expense, but overall, it was a disheartening experience,” he lamented. A tech entrepreneur from Karachi, 36, who also had their visa rejected, told Dawn on the condition of anonymity that they had tried in September this year. “I then applied for a fresh visa rather than through my first application. Surprisingly, it was then granted in the same month.” Muzamil Asif, a sports journalist assigned to cover the Asia Cup in Dubai, was unable to travel after his visa was rejected, despite having the necessary accreditation and documentation. “Our travel agent said ‘100 per cent rejection’ for Dubai visas. Every agency refused to apply. The Pakistan Cricket Board advised applying via Abu Dhabi, but even then, the process was uncertain. In the end, my visa was rejected because I’m a single man under 35. The ticket and hotel bookings were already done, and my news outlet lost nearly Rs100,000.” Travel agencies corroborated the trend. Saher Nazeer, the customer services representative at Visa Express Karachi, told Dawn that “first-time and single-entry visa applications for Dubai face 70 to 80pc rejections, while family ties improve chances”. A manager at Trips Travel & Tours, speaking anonymously, added that single visas had an approval rate of just 20pc, whereas family visas see around 80pc acceptance. Ubaid Sajjad, a travel agent at AEG-Visa, cited strict financial requirements to get a visa. “You have better chances if you provide a six-month bank statement with around Rs3 million,” he said. “Insufficient funds are the major reason for single visa rejections.” Meanwhile, Quratulain, an agent at Premio Travel & Tours, said “previous overstaying and unclear financial documentation” were the causes for rejection. Discussions on Pakistani social media reveal wider frustration. Reddit users described blocked transit visas and contradictory messages from agencies like VFS Global, with one user noting that professional status or age often determined whether a visa would be approved. Some users said there was effectively a “ban on visit visas for Pakistanis in Dubai” due to concerns over alleged illegal migration. However, a senior diplomat at the UAE embassy, who wished not to be named, dismissed the speculation, telling Dawn that “there is no ban on UAE visas for Pakistani citizens”. “The UAE government issues visas daily to various categories of applicants. However, some Pakistani travel agents had tampered with applicants’ data in the past, leading to issues, after which a centralised visa system was introduced,” he said. He added the UAE had set up three biometric desks at the embassy to ensure transparency in the application process. “There are 2.27 million Pakistanis residing in the UAE, who can sponsor their families under the new law. However, those with criminal records — those who have tampered with their data — are being asked to correct their records,” the diplomat said. On the other hand, UAE Ambassador Zaabi shared major visa facilitation reforms with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday, including online processing, e-visas without passport stamping, and faster system-to-system linkages. According to a post on the Ministry of Finance’s X account, nearly 500 visas are processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan. Despite the diplomatic assurances and recently announced reforms, the experiences of Nadeem and other Pakistani visa seekers show how uncertainty still hovers over the process. “It feels like you’re playing a lottery with your plans, your work commitments, and your money,” a dejected Nadeem told Dawn over the phone. “I just want to know if I can go or not and be done with it.” Additional reporting by Abdullah Momand.

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday strongly condemned the shooting of two soldiers of the United States’ National Guard in Washington, DC, saying that the incident “heralds a troubling resurgence of terrorism on a global scale”. Two National Guard soldiers were critically wounded on Wednesday after being shot a few blocks from the White House, with US President Donald Trump terming the incident an “act of terror”. Trump has since announced that one of the soldiers had died. In a press release, the FO said, “Pakistan strongly condemns the shooting incident in Washington DC, reportedly involving an Afghan national. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the departed soldier, and (we) wish the injured a swift and complete recovery,” it said.

      "summary_orig": "In today’s newsletter: After nearly four years of war, Ukraine is confronting deep fatigue, dwindling strategic options and fresh US pressure to accept terms that many see as a surrender in all but name A week ago Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainians that they faced “a very tough choice – either the loss of our dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner”. The warning came as the Trump administration increased pressure on Zelenskyy to accept a peace deal that appears to secure all of Vladimir Putin’s war aims – a proposal European leaders have described as capitulation. With the war about to enter its fourth winter, there seems no sign that either side has the capability to make a significant military breakthrough. Neither the incessant infantry grind on the eastern front, Moscow’s aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities, nor Kyiv’s long-range strikes on infrastructure inside Russia look likely to shift the equilibrium any time soon. Politics | Keir Starmer says Labour “kept to our manifesto” over budget tax rises. The prime minister sought to rebuff claims Labour had broken its tax promises.

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi arrives at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi.—Reuters • Clarification follows concerns expressed by Imran’s son Kasim; Rana Sanaullah also dismisses reports of ex-PM’s transfer to another prison • KP CM Afridi stages sit-in outside jail after eighth snub at Adiala ISLAMABAD: As reports about PTI chief Imran Khan’s ill health swirled on social and foreign media, both government and PTI figures dismissed such speculation on Thursday, saying the former prime minister — currently held in isolation — was doing well. The clarification came when PTI activists staged a sit-in outside Adiala jail after authorities did not allow Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to meet the incarcerated party leader for the eighth time since he assumed office. His sisters and legal team were not allowed to meet Imran, either. The lack of access to Mr Khan also gave rise to unconfirmed reports about his ill health and transfer to a high-security prison — which were picked up by a Japanese newspaper and the BBC. ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ also trended on X on Thursday morning. In a statement shared by the PTI, Imran’s son Kasim Khan also called on the international community and global human rights organisations to intervene and “demand proof of life, enforce court-ordered access, end this inhumane isolation” faced by his father. Against this backdrop, Rana Sanaullah, who advises the PM on political affairs, told ARY News that Mr Khan was fine and his health was being taken care of. “There is a team of doctors that checks him on a weekly and daily basis [and looks after his] medicine, diet, facilities [and] exercises.” He said Mr Khan was getting everything befitting his position and status, adding that the PTI chief was still present in Adiala jail. PTI leader Ali Zafar also dismissed reports about Imran Khan’s health in a DawnNewsTV show. “Thank God, the news is baseless, but it is even more important after this report that the government immediately allow us the opportunity of a meeting so we can go and see ourselves,” said the PTI leader, adding that once a meeting was held, they could come out and tell everyone that everything was fine. “We think it is very necessary that a meeting is facilitated with Imran; it’s been a month,” he added. “There were news reports about Imran Khan, news from India and Afghanistan, attempts were made to spread discord; these reports have been denied. The government cannot harm Imran Khan,” said PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram while talking to Dawn. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, in an appearance on Geo News , stated that jail officials had already provided information on Imran’s health. Senate protest On the other hand, the PTI staged a noisy protest against the alleged mistreatment meted out to the former prime minister. The issue was raised in the House by PTI lawmaker Faisal Javed soon after the question hour. He claimed that Mr Khan had been kept in solitary confinement and regretted that nobody, including his family members, lawyers and doctors, was allowed to see him. “This is against basic human rights, court orders, the jail manual and prison rules,” he remarked. Minister of State for Interior Talal Cha­udhry, in his response, described Imran Khan as a VIP prisoner enjoying the facilities of exercise machines and a personal cook. He said meetings with a prisoner are regulated under the jail manual. CM stages sit-in Meanwhile, a sit-in led by KP CM Afridi continued outside Adiala jail. Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Mehmood Khan Achakzai also joined the protest on Thursday night to show solidarity with the CM. Mr Achakzai said more sit-ins would be held across the country and “after that people will govern the country”. “It is unfortunate that the CM of a province is sitting outside the jail. MNAs and senators were not being allowed to meet Imran Khan,” he said. The KP chief minister, who replaced Ali Amin Gandapur last month, had arrived in Rawalpindi in the morning to meet Imran Khan, but the jail administration did not allow him to proceed. The CM and party supporters originally intended to march to the prison, where Imran Khan is incarcerated, but were stopped by a heavy contingent of police officials at the ‘factory naaka’. The CM asked the officials to inform him in writing regarding the decision to bar him from meeting the incarcerated former premier despite the court orders, but his request was declined. Amid uncertainty surrounding the health of Mr Khan, CM Afridi later told reporters that he wanted to meet Mr Khan to get “actual information” from him and share it with the nation. He said he had exhausted all legal and political avenues in his attempts to gain access to the PTI leader. Published in Dawn, November 28th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "A high-profile debate at the Oxford Union that was scheduled to feature senior figures from Pakistan and India was cancelled after the Indian delegation withdrew at the last minute, prompting strong reactions from Pakistan’s High Commission in London and triggering speculations about why India pulled out last minute. According to statements issued by the High Commission, the debate centred on the motion “This House Believes India’s Policy Towards Pakistan is a Populist Strategy Sold as Security Policy” had been confirmed weeks in advance. It is scheduled for 12:30am PKT. Pakistan’s delegation, comprising former Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee chairman Lt Gen (R) Zubair Mahmood Hayat, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and former diplomat Dr Mohammad Faisal, was already in London for the event. The High Commission claimed that India’s originally announced speakers, General M.M. Naravane, Dr Subramanian Swamy and politician Sachin Pilot, “withdrew at the eleventh hour”, leaving the event without its opposing panel. It further alleged that India later proposed “obscure and low-profile replacements” that did not match the level of the Pakistani delegation and “undermined the credibility and balance of the debate.” “The collective retreat of the Indian delegation amounted to an unchallenged victory for Pakistan,” the High Commission stated, adding that India’s withdrawal “exposed the weakness of its narrative on a neutral academic platform”. Sources familiar with the matter told Dawn that the last-minute shift was “very bizarre”, noting that such debates were typically finalised far in advance and that delegations typically agreed knowing who they were debating. While the High Commission criticised what it described as India’s reluctance to face open questioning, many on social media questioned the reason behind India’s withdrawal, speculating that it may have been pressure from the Indian government on the panellists.",

Sources familiar with the matter told Dawn that the last-minute shift was “very bizarre”, noting that such debates were typically finalised far in advance and that delegations typically agreed knowing who they were debating. While the High Commission criticised what it described as India’s reluctance to face open questioning, many on social media questioned the reason behind India’s withdrawal, speculating that it may have been pressure from the Indian government on the panellists.",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) has condemned the attack which claimed the lives of three Chinese workers in Tajikistan, saying that the use of armed drones in the incident underlined the “gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it”. Tajik authorities said on Thursday that three Chinese workers in Tajikistan were killed in an attack launched from Afghanistan near the border. The foreign ministry said a drone and firearm attack hit workers of a Chinese company in the country’s south. “The attack, carried out with firearms and a drone loaded with grenades, claimed the lives of three employees of Chinese nationality,” it said in a statement. Dushanbe rarely comments officially on such incidents, and it did not say who it suspects carried out the attack. Subsequently, the FO, in a statement issued early on Friday, expressed Pakistan’s condolences and solidarity with China and Tajikistan over the lives lost in a “heinous terrorist attack in Tajikistan near its border with Afghanistan”. “Pakistan unequivocally condemns this cowardly attack on Chinese nationals. The use of armed drones in the incident underlines the gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it,” the FO said. “As a neighbour that has repeatedly suffered terrorist attacks orchestrated from Afghan soil, the people of Pakistan fully understand and share the grief and anguish of our Chinese friends and Tajik partners,” it said. “Pakistan has consistently stressed that Afghan territory must not be used for terrorism against its neighbours or any other country. The repeated use of Afghan soil by terrorist elements and their continued presence under the patronage of the Afghan Taliban regime, is a matter of serious concern for the entire region and the wider international community,” it said. It added that concrete and verifiable action against the perpetrators, abettors, facilitators and financiers of terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil was the only way to address “this growing menace”. “Pakistan will continue to work closely with China, Tajikistan and other regional partners to promote peace, stability and security in our shared neighbourhood,” the FO said. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. Last week, Denmark, in the capacity of the chair of the UN Security Council ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee, pointed to the “serious threat” posed by the TTP in Central and South Asia and said that the terror outfit was receiving “logistical and substantial support” from the de facto Afghan authorities. Meanwhile, Muslim-majority Tajikistan, one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union, has been concerned about possible flare-ups in extremism since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Militants are active in the mountainous border region, which spans around 1,350 kilometres between the two countries. Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, in power since 1992, is openly critical of the Taliban and urged the group to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks, estimated to make up around a quarter of Afghanistan’s 40-million population. At the same time, Tajikistan has cautiously engaged in some areas, including through diplomatic meetings, the opening of markets in border towns and supplying electricity. Tajikistan’s foreign ministry said on Thursday, “Criminal groups located in the neighbouring country (Afghanistan) continue to commit acts aimed at destabilising the situation in the border regions.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A plea asking the Federal Cons­titutional Court (FCC) to strike down the very law that brought it into being, i.e. the 27th Constitutional Amen­dment , was filed before the newly established court on Thursday. “It is most respectively prayed that this petition may kindly be accepted and the 27th Amendment passed with ‘malicious design’ may kindly be struck down in the larger interest of justice,” read the petition, which was moved by Advocate Muhammad Shoaib in person. Earlier on Nov 11, former chief justice Jawwad S. Khawaja challenged the 27th Amendment before the Supreme Court, seeking a direction that the court retains exclusive jurisdiction to determine the vires and constitutionality of the proposed amendment. At the time, the FCC did not exist as the amendment in question had not yet been approved by parliament. Similar pleas have been filed before high courts and the Federal Shariat Court, but this is the first time the FCC has been approached to strike down the law that created it in the first place. ‘One-man rule’ Filed under Article 175E of the Constitution, the fresh petition argued that the 27th Amendment was allegedly passed by a “puppet regime” with a “malicious design to establish one-man rule” in Pakistan by undermining the Constitution. “When the country was passing through a constitutional crisis with the law and order situation deteriorating day by day, the government tabled the 27th Amendment in parliament with the objective of undermining the independence of the judiciary in a mala fide manner,” the petitioner claimed. The petition said that the establishment of the FCC, by allegedly curtailing the powers of the SC under the garb of the 27th Amendment, was against the fundamental principles enshrined in the original provisions of the 1973 Constitution. It further claimed that the federal government was being exploited by certain individuals for the purpose of their vested interests, whereas parliament had been used as rubber-stamp just to implement the whims of powerful. It contended that the country was going through a “power-sharing crisis”, where one institution was overwhelming the powers of the others. It added that the country was being governed through an indirect martial law, which had camouflaged the entire system and thus “disgracing the green book”. ‘Constitutional crisis’ The petition pleaded that the amendment would create institutional incoherence amounting to a constitutional crisis, as all powers would be concentrated in the hands of a single individual. “This flagrant violation of the constitution by the government amounted to mockery of the parliament and the judicial system of the country,” the petition argued. It added that granting immunity to the highest officials of the country from all criminal liability was a clear violation of Article 227 of the Constitution, which ordains that no law will be enacted in contravention of the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sunnah. Likewise, the introduction of Articles 175E and 185 of the Constitution would create a clash, as a parallel appellate system has been introduced, with one set of appeals to be filed before the SC and another before the FCCP, the plea read. The petition argued that this amounted to a violation of natural justice, adding that the judiciary was the custodian of the rights of the people. “Therefore, the FCCP should play its role by striking down the 27th Amendment in the interest of justice,” it added.

      "summary_orig": "• LHCBA petition wants ICAs ‘restored to their original forum’ • Says 27th Amendment ‘unlawful, undermining judiciary’ • Fears parliament can ‘abolish or replace forum for constitutional adjudication at will’ if permitted ISLAMABAD: The Lah­ore High Court Bar Asso­ciation (LHCBA) on Thur­sday filed an application before the Federal Consti­tution Court (FCC), requ­esting that the pending intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the May 7, 2025 judgement on military trials of civilians be returned to the Supreme Court. The application has been moved under Order 35, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, which the FCC has adopted for the time being until it frames its own rules. On June 13, the LHCBA and the Lahore Bar Asso­ciation filed ICAs before the SC, seeking to revisit and set aside the May 7, 2025 judgement on the military trials of civilians. These appeals were filed through senior counsel Hamid Khan. In addition, former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Jawwad S. Khawaja and senior lawyer Barr­ister Aitzaz Ahsan also filed similar ICAs, highlighting that if the May 7 verdict was not overturned, it would serve as a constant reminder of the judiciary ceding its space to the executive by accepting that the latter could act as judges to try civilians in criminal cases. On May 7, a five-judge Constitutional Bench of the SC restored key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) that allow for the trial of civilians in military courts. The court ruled by a five-two majority in favour of overturning its earlier decision on Oct 23, 2023, in which a previous five-judge bench had held that the military trials of civilians involved in the May 9 , 2023 acts of arson and attacks on military installations was illegal and unconstitutional. Except for Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afg­han, who dissented from the majority verdict, the detailed reasoning of the majority judgement has yet to be issued. ‘Without lawful authority’ The fresh application pleaded that the pending appeals should be retu­r­ned to their original forum — the SC — as both the purported transfer and the 27th Consti­tutional Amen­dment itself were without lawful authority, unconstitutional, and non-est. The application contended that the 27th Ame­ndment was in violation of the salient and essential features of the Constitution, stating that the 1973 Constitution defined the powers of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. “While parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it does not function as a constituent assembly and is subject to both express and implied limitations,” it added. The application pointed out that the jurisprudence of the SC — most recently the authoritative 17-member judgement in the Rawalpindi District Bar Association case — had affirmed that parliament could not, through any amendment, alter or abrogate the salient or essential features of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary. The application pleaded that both the 26th and 27th amendments impermissibly encroached upon judicial independence and restructured the constitutional architecture in a manner inconsistent with these unamendable features. Therefore, they constituted an invalid exercise of amendatory power. It argued that a constitutional amendment, which undermined judicial independence while simultaneously divesting pre-existing constitutional courts of jurisdiction to examine its validity, violated fundamental constitutional principles. “If permitted, parliament can abolish or replace the forum for constitutional adjudication at will, thereby insulating unconstitutional amendments from judicial scrutiny,” the plea feared. The application further noted that the SC had consistently distinguished betw­een “jurisdiction” and “judicial power”. “Even where parliament modifies jurisdiction, judicial power — i.e. the authority to determine whether jurisdiction exists — remains inherent in the superior judiciary,” it read. “Accordingly, notwithstanding the 27th Amendment, it lies within the judicial power of the SC to determine whether it has been validly divested of jurisdiction. The subject appeal must therefore be restored to the SC for that purpose.” The application maintained that the FCC could not adjudicate upon its own validity, since it was a creation solely of the 27th Amendment. “It is therefore legally precluded from pronouncing upon the validity of the amendment, as such adjudication would determine the legality of its own existence,” it added. “This principle is affirmed in the Sabir Shah case and earlier jurisprudence, which hold that a forum cannot declare unconstitutional the very instrument that constitutes it.” The application also highlighted that the pending appeals did not fall within Articles 175E or 175F, as they were filed under Section 5 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023. “The 27th Amendment neither amends that statute nor addresses statutory appeals filed thereunder,” it added. “Article 175F(2) applies only to proceedings ‘falling under this Article’. Since the present appeal was not instituted under Articles 175E or 175F, its transfer to the FCC is without legal effect.” Published in Dawn, November 28th, 2025",

The subject appeal must therefore be restored to the SC for that purpose.” The application maintained that the FCC could not adjudicate upon its own validity, since it was a creation solely of the 27th Amendment. “It is therefore legally precluded from pronouncing upon the validity of the amendment, as such adjudication would determine the legality of its own existence,” it added. “This principle is affirmed in the Sabir Shah case and earlier jurisprudence, which hold that a forum cannot declare unconstitutional the very instrument that constitutes it.” The application also highlighted that the pending appeals did not fall within Articles 175E or 175F, as they were filed under Section 5 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023. “The 27th Amendment neither amends that statute nor addresses statutory appeals filed thereunder,” it added. “Article 175F(2) applies only to proceedings ‘falling under this Article’. Since the present appeal was not instituted under Articles 175E or 175F, its transfer to the FCC is without legal effect.” Published in Dawn, November 28th, 2025",

      "summary": "• LHCBA petition wants ICAs ‘restored to their original forum’ • Says 27th Amendment ‘unlawful, undermining judiciary’ • Fears parliament can ‘abolish or replace forum for constitutional adjudication at will’ if permitted ISLAMABAD: The Lah­ore High Court Bar Asso­ciation (LHCBA) on Thur­sday filed an application before the Federal Consti­tution Court (FCC), requ­esting that the pending intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the May 7, 2025 judgement on military trials of civilians be returned to the Supreme Court. The application has been moved under Order 35, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, which the FCC has adopted for the time being until it frames its own rules. On June 13, the LHCBA and the Lahore Bar Asso­ciation filed ICAs before the SC, seeking to revisit and set aside the May 7, 2025 judgement on the military trials of civilians. These appeals were filed through senior counsel Hamid Khan. In addition, former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Jawwad S. Khawaja and senior lawyer Barr­ister Aitzaz Ahsan also filed similar ICAs, highlighting that if the May 7 verdict was not overturned, it would serve as a constant reminder of the judiciary ceding its space to the executive by accepting that the latter could act as judges to try civilians in criminal cases. On May 7, a five-judge Constitutional Bench of the SC restored key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) that allow for the trial of civilians in military courts. The court ruled by a five-two majority in favour of overturning its earlier decision on Oct 23, 2023, in which a previous five-judge bench had held that the military trials of civilians involved in the May 9 , 2023 acts of arson and attacks on military installations was illegal and unconstitutional. Except for Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afg­han, who dissented from the majority verdict, the detailed reasoning of the majority judgement has yet to be issued. ‘Without lawful authority’ The fresh application pleaded that the pending appeals should be retu­r­ned to their original forum — the SC — as both the purported transfer and the 27th Consti­tutional Amen­dment itself were without lawful authority, unconstitutional, and non-est. The application contended that the 27th Ame­ndment was in violation of the salient and essential features of the Constitution, stating that the 1973 Constitution defined the powers of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. “While parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it does not function as a constituent assembly and is subject to both express and implied limitations,” it added. The application pointed out that the jurisprudence of the SC — most recently the authoritative 17-member judgement in the Rawalpindi District Bar Association case — had affirmed that parliament could not, through any amendment, alter or abrogate the salient or essential features of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary. The application pleaded that both the 26th and 27th amendments impermissibly encroached upon judicial independence and restructured the constitutional architecture in a manner inconsistent with these unamendable features. Therefore, they constituted an invalid exercise of amendatory power. It argued that a constitutional amendment, which undermined judicial independence while simultaneously divesting pre-existing constitutional courts of jurisdiction to examine its validity, violated fundamental constitutional principles. “If permitted, parliament can abolish or replace the forum for constitutional adjudication at will, thereby insulating unconstitutional amendments from judicial scrutiny,” the plea feared. The application further noted that the SC had consistently distinguished betw­een “jurisdiction” and “judicial power”. “Even where parliament modifies jurisdiction, judicial power — i.e. the authority to determine whether jurisdiction exists — remains inherent in the superior judiciary,” it read. “Accordingly, notwithstanding the 27th Amendment, it lies within the judicial power of the SC to determine whether it has been validly divested of jurisdiction.

      "summary_orig": "The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has initiated legal action, through the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), against those involved in spreading fabricated information on social media regarding the offloading of passengers. Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway. According to sources, more than 15 such social media accounts have initially been found to be involved in spreading baseless propaganda and hatred against provinces. It has been learned that the FIA has initiated action by identifying social media accounts spreading fabricated information. Legal action is being taken through the NCCIA under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, against those involved in the baseless propaganda. According to FIA officials, some elements were sharing fake and misleading posts regarding the offloading of passengers, aimed at damaging the institution’s reputation and creating concern among the public. They added that the FIA Immigration Wing does not offload passengers who have complete documents and a legitimate reason for travel at any airport in the country. Passengers with incomplete or fake travel documents are offloaded. Those who provide suspicious or unclear information, as well as those suspected of being influenced by human traffickers or illegal agents, are also offloaded. In the past, strict action was taken against individuals with a history of illegal activities or problematic travel records, added the officials. The FIA officials made it clear that the public should not be overly concerned about the matter. Rather, they should stay away from illegal agents and always travel with complete and verified documents. They advised that in case of a complaint, the public should contact the deputy director of the FIA Immigration Wing or its helpline at 1991. Earlier today, the agency clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers. In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”. “All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”.",

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the operation was conducted based on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna al Khwarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the ISPR stated. “Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement read. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operation. On Tuesday, 22 terrorists were killed during an IBO in Bannu, the ISPR said in a statement. “During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement said. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.",
