      "summary_orig": "A high-level European Union delegation on Friday visited the Sialkot International Airport to monitor the immigration processes and measures to prevent irregular migration, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) spokesperson said in a statement. The move comes after around 66,154 passengers were offloaded last year despite holding valid documents, particularly at Lahore and Karachi airports, amid a post-2024 Greece boat tragedy crackdown on migrant smuggling, which claimed several Pakistani lives. According to the spokesperson, the delegation was given a comprehensive briefing on the “working, performance, and achievements of the FIA Immigration at the Sialkot airport, with particular emphasis on the progress made over the last five months.” The delegation comprised the Frontex officer to Pakistan, an official from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, a representative from the Embassy of Hungary in Pakistan, and the International Centre for Migration Policy Development’s official. “The briefing was focused on measures taken to prevent irregular migration, including the effective implementation of risk indicators, enhanced profiling mechanisms, and optimal utilisation of the Second Line Border Control Office,” the spokesperson added in the statement. The spokesperson stated that the EU delegation was further apprised of the pre-departure facilitation mechanisms established at both the zonal level and the airport, aimed at strengthening border management, improving operational efficiency, and creating a passenger-friendly environment. Last week, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi announced that the FIA had set up pre-departure facilitation desks at all its zonal offices nationwide to assist international travellers. “The delegation appreciated and acknowledged the professionalism and commitment in ensuring effective, secure, and robust border control operations at Sialkot International Airport,” he said. In December, the immigration authorities of FIA offloaded four passengers , belonging to Sialkot and Gujranwala, from flights to Indonesia and Turkiye. An FIA official told Dawn that the passengers had been in contact with the human smugglers, who had to send them to Italy through illegal means. The authorities also offloaded two passengers at the Sialkot International Airport for allegedly attempting to illegally migrate to Europe in the guise of Umrah pilgrims. Over the past year, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The immigration border management system (IBMS) data analysis of the July-December 2024 period revealed the trend of passengers travelling to at least 15 countries. The data analysis showed that most of the passengers travelling to these transit destinations are mainly from nine districts of Punjab, including Sialkot.",

      "title_orig": "Who is Mehmood Khan Achakzai, the new NA opposition leader",
      "summary_orig": "It was the afternoon of October 7, 1983, and former dictator General Ziaul Haq’s martial law was in effect, when a young man decided to lead a procession in Quetta to demand the restoration of democracy. Despite grave life threats, his stance remained firm, even when four of his supporters were shot dead, and dozens were injured by the authorities. Today, the man, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, has been appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly. His name for the slot was recommended by incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan last year. In the past few years, Mehmood Khan’s name has appeared in the mainstream media one time too many. But who is this man, and what is his story? Entry into politics Mehmood Khan, whose name and face have been a mainstay of the opposition benches for decades, was born in the village of Inayatullah Karez, Gulistan, in Balochistan’s Killa Abdullah Khan, which at the time was part of the Quetta-Pishin district. He received his early education in Gulistan and completed his F.Sc. from Science College, Quetta, before graduating with a degree in Civil Engineering from the Peshawar University of Engineering. A major but tragic turning point in his life came on December 2, 1973, when his father, Khan Abdul Samad Khan, was martyred in Quetta because of his political stance. Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai had parted ways with the National Awami Party (NAP) after the abolition of One Unit, when instead of forming a united Pashtun province by merging the Southwestern Pashtun belt with the Northwestern Pashtun belt — or restoring British Balochistan (the Pashtun-majority province) — the party accepted the merger of British Balochistan with the Brahui confederacy or states union to constitute what is today Balochistan. This decision was taken after General Ayub’s resignation, when NAP leaders had already been released, but Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai was still in prison. In protest, Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai formed a new party called the Pashtunkhwa National Awami Party — a decision that ultimately led to his assassination. Ironically, the strongest opposition did not come from the NAP leadership or the Pakistani establishment but also from Afghan President Daoud Khan, who disliked Abdul Samad Khan’s argument of forming a separate “Pashtunistan province” by uniting all Pashtun areas. It was during this period, after completing his education, that young Mehmood Khan was thrust directly into a political storm. Following his father’s assassination, he was nominated in the subsequent by-election, which was not just a political contest. It was painted as a clash between Afghan President Daoud and then-prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The rise of the maverick In January 1974, just a few days before the election, Mehmood Khan received a message that a senior Afghan official wanted to meet him. Along with two companions — one of whom had been his slain father’s deputy — he went to a border village near Chaman, where the governor of Kandahar arrived in a Mercedes. The conversation began politely, but when Mehmood Khan refused to change his stance, he was bluntly warned that this election was actually a contest between Daoud and Bhutto, and that he should withdraw and rejoin the NAP. While his colleague could not withstand the pressure, the young and fiery Mehmood Khan displayed what has been described as remarkable courage. “This is the political legacy of my leader and father. It is the principled stance for which he was martyred. If President Daoud considers this a contest with Bhutto, then tell Daoud he has already lost,” he had said. At a time when fear prevented anyone else from taking up the party’s leadership, this heavy responsibility fell on the young shoulders of Mehmood Khan . From the very beginning, he swam against the tides, one reason why he remains the only politician in the country who, without the support or patronage of any domestic or foreign establishment, has sustained his political existence solely through his own resilience and the sacrifices of his workers. One purpose In fact, Mahmood Khan Achakzai has played a central role in shaping and leading various opposition political movements in Pakistan, consistently standing for democratic rights, constitutionalism and federalism. During General Ziaul Haq’s dictatorship, he was an active participant in the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD), where he allied with progressive and democratic forces to resist military rule. In the late 1990s, he co-founded the Pakistan Oppressed Nations Movement (PONAM), uniting nationalist parties from smaller provinces to struggle for provincial autonomy and equal rights within the federation. Later, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement (APDM), he joined mainstream political forces in opposing General Pervez Musharraf’s military regime and demanding free and fair elections. More recently, Mehmood Khan was seen as a prominent figure in the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a broad alliance of opposition parties formed to challenge authoritarianism, uphold parliamentary supremacy, and ensure the sanctity of the Constitution. In 2025, he launched the Tehreek Tahafuz-e-Aain-e-Pakistan, a new political platform aimed at uniting diverse political and social forces to safeguard the 1973 Constitution, strengthen democratic institutions, and promote civilian supremacy. His continuous involvement in these movements reflects his lifelong commitment to democracy, provincial rights, constitutionalism and rule of law in Pakistan’s political landscape.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad district and sessions court on Friday issued directions to law enforcement authorities to arrest lawyer and activist Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, “within 24 hours”, warning them of contempt in case of non-compliance. Mazari and Chattha have been facing legal proceedings in a case on accusations of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. During today’s hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka issued strict orders to the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Islamabad, Jawad Tariq, to arrest Mazari and her husband within 24 hours. “Take them from Pakistan, India or Afghanistan. You have 24 hours. I don’t know whether they are at sea or in the sky. Wherever they are, arrest Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha within 24 hours, otherwise contempt of court proceedings will be initiated,” the judge remarked during the hearing. A day earlier, the court cancelled the interim bail granted to the accused after they failed to appear before the court despite repeated directions. Judge Majoka directed the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCIA) to arrest both accused and keep them in lockup upon arrest. Additionally, the court ordered that the statements of Mazari and Chattha be recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) via video link, should their physical presence not be immediately possible. On January 7, Mazari and her husband submitted an application seeking to summon the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general (DG ISPR) as a witness in the case. The duo claimed that during a recent presser by the military spokesperson, an attempt was made to influence the ongoing criminal trial, as the press briefing was broadcast “on all national media, and the content is readily available online”. The case The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the NCCIA, Islamabad. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.",

Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas signed off in October on Trump’s plan, which says the Palestinian technocratic body will be overseen by an international so-called “Board of Peace” that is meant to supervise Gaza’s governance for a transitional period. In another post, Trump said the “Board of Peace,” of which Trump himself is the chair, was formed, and its members would be announced shortly. Israel and Hamas have accused each other of ceasefire violations in Gaza, where, since the start of the truce in October, over 440 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed. The ceasefire has also been tested by the failure to retrieve the remains of one last Israeli hostage, Israeli delays in reopening Gaza’s border crossing with Egypt, and Hamas’ refusal so far to disarm. By pressing on with the second phase of the ceasefire, Washington and its mediator partners will need to tackle the vexing challenges of disarming Hamas, further Israeli withdrawal tied to the disarmament and deploying an international peacekeeping force. The Palestinian technocratic body will have 15 members and will be led by Ali Shaath , a former deputy minister in the Western-backed Palestinian Authority who had been in charge of developing industrial zones, according to a statement by mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. “These Palestinian leaders are unwaveringly committed to a PEACEFUL future,” Trump said. Many experts say that Trump being the chair of the board meant to supervise Gaza’s governance resembled a colonial structure. He also said Egypt, Qatar and Turkey will help to secure what he called a “comprehensive demilitarisation agreement” with Hamas. Israel’s assault on Gaza since late 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis, and internally displaced Gaza’s entire population. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel has said it took action in self-defence after Hamas killed 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages in their 2023 attack.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has told the UN Security Council that it hopes for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, warning that the UN Charter and international law prohibit external interference in the internal affairs of states. “The UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against other states’ territorial integrity or political independence, or interference in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of states,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told an emergency meeting of the 15-member Council on Thursday evening. The United States convened the Security Council meeting to discuss the situation in Iran, with the country’s Ambassador Mike Waltz criticising the actions taken against Iranian protesters and assuring them of President Donald Trump’s support. In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy said, “We have been carefully observing developments in Iran and the region in recent days,” pointing out that new threats to regional peace and stability remain a serious cause of concern. Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds. A stable and peaceful Iran is in the interests of Pakistan, the region and beyond, he said, adding that his country has full confidence in the wisdom of the Iranian people and leadership, rooted in the country’s culture, history and resilience. Ambassador Asim Ahmad highlighted that the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct, noting that the Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states. Any external interference in the internal affairs of states, he added, is inconsistent with international law and the principles of the UN Charter. “We strongly believe that all disputes must be resolved through peaceful means and in accordance with international law,” the Pakistani envoy affirmed, warning that continued hostilities, use of force and unilateral actions would only deepen crises and cause unnecessary suffering. “We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure, and that all relevant parties will return to the negotiating table to find a lasting solution to their differences, based on mutual respect and understanding,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad said in conclusion. Opening the debate, UN Assistant Secretary-General Martha Pobee, briefing the Security Council members, called for restraint by all parties to prevent further escalation. Pobee described the situation in Iran as fluid and deeply concerning, noting that protests continue, albeit reportedly at a smaller scale than last week. She voiced alarm, however, over public statements suggesting possible military strikes on the country. “This external dimension adds volatility to an already combustible situation. All efforts must be undertaken to prevent any further deterioration,” she said. Moreover, UN Secretary-General António Guterres remains convinced that all concerns regarding Iran, including those related to the nuclear issue and ongoing protests, are best addressed through diplomacy and dialogue. He also urged maximum restraint at this sensitive moment and called on all actors to refrain from any actions that could lead to further loss of life or ignite a wider regional escalation. The protests erupted on December 28 after shopkeepers in the Iranian capital, Tehran, took to the streets to rail against the collapse of the national currency, soaring inflation and worsening living conditions. Ambassador Waltz, the US envoy, accused the Iranian government of actions against its own citizens that have repercussions for international peace and security. “President Donald J. Trump and the United States of America stand by the brave people of Iran,” he said. “Regardless of its excuses, the regime is solely responsible for the economic misery of the Iranian people and will be held accountable.” Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia hit back, saying the world has been watching as the United States continues to escalate tensions and fuel hysteria around Iran. He said that the current Security Council meeting, requested by the United States, is nothing more than yet another attempt to justify blatant aggression and interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. “And if, as Washington puts it, Iran’s authorities do not come to their senses, then Washington will solve the Iranian problem in its favourite way: through strikes aimed at overthrowing an undesirable regime in order to lend credibility to and justify its actions,” the Russian envoy said. China’s Ambassador, Sun Lei, said the United States has openly issued threats of the use of force against Iran. Stressing that China has always advocated adherence to UN Charter principles and international law, he said sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are the most fundamental norms of international affairs. “The use of force can never solve problems,” the Chinese envoy said, noting that military adventurism would push the region towards an abyss. “No action that defies international law can be tolerated,” he added. Ambassador Gholamhossein Darzi, Deputy Permanent Representative of Iran, said he was speaking on behalf of a nation in mourning. “It is deeply regrettable that the representative of the United States, which requested this meeting, has today resorted to lies, distortions of facts and deliberate disinformation to conceal his country’s direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran towards violence,” he said. He added that the United States requested the meeting in order to conceal its direct complicity in the crimes its mercenaries have committed against Iran. “The United States is attempting to portray itself as a friend of the Iranian people, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for political destabilisation and military intervention under a so-called humanitarian narrative,” he said. He described these claims as particularly cynical in light of what he called the United States’ long and well-documented record of unlawful military interventions, regime-change operations and systematic violations of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: At least 15 terrorists, including two armed suspects who were killed in an encounter with the police, were gunned down in different operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Rela­tions (ISPR) said 13 members of the “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij” — the state’s term for the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakistan — were killed in two separate engagements on January 13 and 14. In Bannu, the security forces effectively engaged the militants’ location and gunned down eight militants following an intense exchange of fire. The stat­e­ment read that an­other intelligence-based operation was conducted by the troops in Kurram, adding that five terrorists were killed in that operation. Meanwhile, two armed militants were killed and a policeman was injured in a shootout between the pol­ice and the militants in Dera Ismail Khan on Thursday. According to a police spok­esperson, the clash took place when the militants attacked the Khutti police check-post located within the limits of Dera Town police station on Wed­nesday night, triggering a fierce exchange of fire that left two attackers dead and a police constable injured. Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. In a press conference last week, ISPR Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025. Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.

      "summary_orig": "• Court hears dispute between Centre, province over anti-drugs legislation • Plea moved by federal govt argues presence of provincial law may ‘add to legal complications’ ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitu­tional Court (FCC) was told on Thursday that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s having its own narcotics law, in addition to the Control of Narcotics Substances Act (CNSA) 1997, would only undermine the federal government’s anti-drug efforts and might add to legal complications. The arguments were advanced by the federal government before a two-judge FCC bench comprising Justices Ali Baqar Najafi and Muhammad Karim Khan Agha. The bench was hearing a petition jointly moved by the federal government and the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) seeking to set aside the KP Control of Narcotics Substances Act 2019. The controversy revolves around whether a province can enact a parallel narcotics law in the presence of Section 71 of the CNSA 1997 — a move that the petitioners argue “undermine the federal government’s authority to legislate”. Filed against the backdrop of KP’s parallel legislation, despite the CNSA 1997 already being in effect, the petition asked the FCC to interpret the executive powers of both the federal and provincial governments under the Constitution. The petition argued that the federal government played a vital role in controlling and eliminating the narcotics threat in the country, particularly in the processing and trafficking of heroin and charas. It stated that the federal government had already taken effective measures to combat all aspects of the multifaceted drug problem since long. ‘Not a dispute’ During the hearing, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, representing the KP government, argued that the matter did not represent a dispute between the federal and provincial governments, as the law was duly enacted by the KP Assembly. In response, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman questioned how a provincial law could repeal a federal legislation. He added that once a province established its own force or agency to implement such a law, a dispute between the federal and provincial governments was bound to erupt. The FCC adjourned further proceedings until next week. ‘Comprehensive law’ The petition expressed the concern that the provincial law repealed the CNSA 1997 within KP to the extent of cultivation, possession, sale, purchase, delivery, and transportation of narcotics. It termed the KP law a “mala fide” and “colourable” exercise of power, seeking its declaration as illegal. It stated that licensing authority for import, export, internal transport, manufacturing, and transshipment of narcotic drugs fell within the purview of the federal government under the CNSA 1997. The provincial law, the petition contended, would create grave legal and constitutional chaos, including duplication of special courts, overlapping jurisdiction, and conflict of authority with other law enforcement agencies. This, the plea added, could lead to a legal and constitutional crisis. The petition argued that the CNSA 1997 was a comprehensive law applicable across Pakistan to curb the menace of narcotics as airports, dry ports, seaports, and land borders fell under the exclusive control of the federal government, which exercised its jurisdiction through the ANF. It contended that as narcotics trafficking was not only a cross-border offence but one with regional and international implications, only a federal agency could effectively deal with the menace, as the jurisdiction of provincial force extended only within its frontiers. The petition further argued that in the presence of a federal law enacted by parliament within its legislative competence under Articles 90 and 142 and Entries 3, 26, 27, 32, and 58 of the Federal Legislative List, any provincial law would be contradictory and thus void.

      "summary_en": "• Court hears dispute between Centre, province over anti-drugs legislation • Plea moved by federal govt argues presence of provincial law may ‘add to legal complications’ ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitu­tional Court (FCC) was told on Thursday that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s having its own narcotics law, in addition to the Control of Narcotics Substances Act (CNSA) 1997, would only undermine the federal government’s anti-drug efforts and might add to legal complications. The arguments were advanced by the federal government before a two-judge FCC bench comprising Justices Ali Baqar Najafi and Muhammad Karim Khan Agha. The bench was hearing a petition jointly moved by the federal government and the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) seeking to set aside the KP Control of Narcotics Substances Act 2019. The controversy revolves around whether a province can enact a parallel narcotics law in the presence of Section 71 of the CNSA 1997 — a move that the petitioners argue “undermine the federal government’s authority to legislate”. Filed against the backdrop of KP’s parallel legislation, despite the CNSA 1997 already being in effect, the petition asked the FCC to interpret the executive powers of both the federal and provincial governments under the Constitution. The petition argued that the federal government played a vital role in controlling and eliminating the narcotics threat in the country, particularly in the processing and trafficking of heroin and charas. It stated that the federal government had already taken effective measures to combat all aspects of the multifaceted drug problem since long. ‘Not a dispute’ During the hearing, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, representing the KP government, argued that the matter did not represent a dispute between the federal and provincial governments, as the law was duly enacted by the KP Assembly. In response, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman questioned how a provincial law could repeal a federal legislation. He added that once a province established its own force or agency to implement such a law, a dispute between the federal and provincial governments was bound to erupt. The FCC adjourned further proceedings until next week. ‘Comprehensive law’ The petition expressed the concern that the provincial law repealed the CNSA 1997 within KP to the extent of cultivation, possession, sale, purchase, delivery, and transportation of narcotics. It termed the KP law a “mala fide” and “colourable” exercise of power, seeking its declaration as illegal. It stated that licensing authority for import, export, internal transport, manufacturing, and transshipment of narcotic drugs fell within the purview of the federal government under the CNSA 1997. The provincial law, the petition contended, would create grave legal and constitutional chaos, including duplication of special courts, overlapping jurisdiction, and conflict of authority with other law enforcement agencies. This, the plea added, could lead to a legal and constitutional crisis. The petition argued that the CNSA 1997 was a comprehensive law applicable across Pakistan to curb the menace of narcotics as airports, dry ports, seaports, and land borders fell under the exclusive control of the federal government, which exercised its jurisdiction through the ANF. It contended that as narcotics trafficking was not only a cross-border offence but one with regional and international implications, only a federal agency could effectively deal with the menace, as the jurisdiction of provincial force extended only within its frontiers. The petition further argued that in the presence of a federal law enacted by parliament within its legislative competence under Articles 90 and 142 and Entries 3, 26, 27, 32, and 58 of the Federal Legislative List, any provincial law would be contradictory and thus void.
