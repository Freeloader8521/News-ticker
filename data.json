Seven members of the phishing ring, including its call center manager, were apprehended and six of them have been put under arrest, according to the Seoul Seodaemun Police Station. The suspects are accused of inducing money withdrawals from 38 victims by impersonating Financial Supervisory Service or prosecution officials between June and October last year. Most of the victims were deceived into believing that their bank accounts were used for fraud and sent money to the scammers, the police said. The police launched an investigation in August last year after receiving intelligence on the phishing ring. The call center manager in his 40s came to visit Korea and was apprehended before departure at Incheon International Airport last October, the police said, adding six other suspects who worked under the manager were detained later.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday granted lawyer and activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, one-day protective bail in relation to their arrest warrants in a case linked to controversial social media posts. The case has been registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. On January 17, Mazari and Chattha challenged their arrest orders in the IHC, arguing that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production. Justice Azam Khan of the IHC took up the petition today and stayed the arrest of Mazari and Chattha until tomorrow. Lawyer Kamran Murtaza, who represented the couple, informed the court that their bail had twice been cancelled. “Now an order has been issued to arrest them,” he said. He maintained that “if there were any misdoings on his client’s part, the judge should demonstrate patience”. “The judge is holding hearings every 15 minutes,” he said.“Imaan is a woman, and she has been sick,” he added. Earlier in the day, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka had directed authorities to obtain a search warrant for Mazari and Chattha. As the hearing at the sessions court resumed after two sittings, the prosecutor informed the session court that the two accused now have protective bail in the IHC and were ordered to appear before the court tomorrow. The judge adjourned the proceedings until tomorrow. Judge Majoka directed that the accused should be presented in the sessions court “within one hour of the appearance at IHC”. The judge also refused to entertain a request from the assistant counsel for adjournment till the day after tomorrow, stating that the counsel had taken “undue advantage” and no concession would be provided. Judge Majoka expresses displeasure During the hearing earlier today, judge Majoka expressed displeasure over why the accused had not yet been arrested. He directed the NCCIA officials to obtain a search warrant for the accused’s residence from a magistrate and ordered them to present Mazari and Chattha in court by 11am. When the hearing resumed, National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials, police officials, and special prosecutors appeared before the court. The court was informed that the arrest had not yet been made. NCCIA officials and police sought further time to submit a report regarding the arrest. Judge Majoka then adjourned the hearing till 2pm, warning that “whoever’s report is unsatisfactory, action will be taken against them”. On Saturday, the court reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Mazari and Chattha for their repeated absences from trial proceedings. In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Judge Majoka noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the NCCIA. During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest. At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad high court. The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused. Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants. The case The case stems from a complaint filed on August 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The death toll from Karachi’s Gul Plaza inferno rose to 15 on Monday as nine more bodies were recovered and firefighting efforts resumed after flames re-emerged from the smouldering debris. The fire , which erupted on Saturday night at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road, was finally doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday. A search operation was initiated amid fears of further casualties. Officials initially suspected an electrical short circuit, but said the cause has yet to be confirmed. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said they had managed to control the flames by upto 95 per cent, and the cooling phase has been initiated. “The cause of the fire is still unknown,” he noted. Officials have said it was believed that a short-circuit sparked the blaze. South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khosa had also said the cooling process was ongoing. Earlier in the day, Fire Officer Zafar Khan stated that 90pc of the blaze had been brought under control, although “flames are still present in the inner market”. “The building’s front and back façades have collapsed, and there are many cracks on the inside as well. So it is extremely dangerous,” Zafar said, adding that rescue teams were conducting “short-term operations” at some spots where they suspected bodies were present. Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Dr Abid Jalal said that firefighting efforts restarted from the Rimpa Plaza side, as flames continue to emerge from the smouldering debris. According to South DIG Syed Asad Raza, 15 bodies have been recovered so far by rescue personnel from the now-gutted shopping plaza. “Samples of eight family members [have been] collected for DNA matching,” he said. “Fire safety operation has been completed. Cooling process has now started with the removal of debris from the site by KMC, TMC and Pakistan Navy personnel,” said the DIG. According to DIG Raza, the shopping plaza had a total of 16 gates — 13 on the ground floor and three in the basement — out of which only two gates were open on the ground, while one exit was open in the basement. Separately, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that five bodies were brought to the Civil Hospital Karachi. CM Murad vows to rehabilitate affected traders Separately, in a meeting with representatives of the traders’ community, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah vowed to immediately rehabilitate the affected businesses. “We will reconstruct the building of Gul Plaza,” he announced, according to a statement from his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa. The chief minister also formed a committee that would make recommendations regarding the businesses’ rehabilitation and affectees’ compensation. “The Sindh government will have a forensic report conducted so the cause of the fire could be known. Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi informed the meeting that the death toll could surge to over 50. CM Murad, after being told that the cooling process was underway, ordered that the work to clear the rubble be initiated right away. Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab briefed the chief minister that 16 fire tenders and bowsers were involved in the dousing operations, in which “50 to 60” firefighters participated. He further said that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) had provided tankers and 431,000 gallons of water for the fire-extinguishing operations. CM’s aide Giyan Chand Essarani informed the meeting that the blaze erupted at 10:36pm on January 17, adding that Rescue 1122 ambulances reached the site within six minutes. He further said that a total of 24 fire rescue vehicles took part in the operations, including those of KMC and the Pakistan Navy. Scores missing The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625. Gul Plaza Traders Association President Tanveer Pasta said over 40 shopkeepers and salespersons were among those missing in the wake of the incident. Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site of the incident on Monday, told the media that “more than 70 people” remained missing. DIG Raza stated the same figure. A woman speaks to reporters (not pictured) as she mourns six missing family members who were shopping at Gul Plaza Shopping Centre for a wedding ceremony, on Jan 19, 2026. — Reuters “The reports of more than 70 missing persons are extremely alarming and constitute a major tragedy,” said the governor, adding that the incident has now “turned into a national tragedy”. “Information about a pregnant woman being trapped inside is extremely concerning,” he said. He further stated that while determining the cause of the fire is necessary, the priority for now is to save lives. “I am in constant contact with three major builders of the city for the restoration of the market,” he added, elaborating on efforts to provide relief to traders. Tessori vowed to “stand with the affected people” until their losses are fully compensated. “My cousin was inside,” said Raheel Ibrahim about Naveed Juma, who he said used to work at a shop on Gul Plaza’s first floor. “His phone was ringing till 12am [on Saturday] but he did not receive calls,” he said, adding that his cousin’s phone was unreachable afterwards. “Till now there is no news of him,” Ibrahim said, adding that his 43-year-old cousin had three young daughters. Another elderly man from the Metroville area said his daughter, daughter-in-law and sister had come to the mall for shopping on Saturday. “We have had no contact with them after 8pm that night,” he added. The distraught man lamented, “Wherever we go, they push us away like a football that ‘ask so and so, we do not know anything’.” Noting that some bodies were unidentifiable and needed DNA samples for cross-matching, the man said he was being told that details about that process would take two to three days. Traffic police announce alternate routes In an advisory by the Karachi Traffic Police, the portion of M.A. Jinnah Road from Tibet Centre to Garden Chowk is closed to traffic due to ongoing rescue and recovery operations at Gul Plaza. The traffic police advised that commuters heading towards Tower from Numaish should turn right at Capri and proceed via Saddar Dawakhana, Empress Market, Regal, Burns Road, or Fresco Chowk, then take the route from Dilpasand to M.A. Jinnah Road to reach Tower. Commuters heading towards M.A. Jinnah Road or Mazar-i-Quaid from Fresco Chowk should continue straight towards Regal Market, turn right at Empress Market towards Frere Chowk, and then proceed to M.A. Jinnah Road. ‘Heartbroken’ United Kingdom’s High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriot said she was “heartbroken” by the tragic fire at the shopping plaza. “May strength be with the community at this time,” she said. The German Consulate in Karachi, in a post on X, said the incident at Gul Plaza was deeply saddening. “Our thoughts & prayers are with the victims, their families, and those injured.” The French embassy in Pakistan expressed “profound sorrow over the loss of many lives in the devastating fire”. “We offer our sincere condolences to the bereaved families and stand with the people of Pakistan in this moment of grief,” the embassy said on X. ‘Delayed response’ The terrifying fire that erupted at Gul Plaza on Saturday night could have been contained sooner, but the delayed response and limited resources from the authorities allowed the blaze to rage unchecked for hours. Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday. Shopkeepers at the site told Dawn that if the firefighting team had arrived with full force and resources, the scene would probably look very different. One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken. A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation. People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side. Additional input by Asim Khan",

      "summary_orig": "Chairman Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Barrister Gohar Ali Khan has said that the party’s future participation in meetings of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was conditional upon whether consultations would be allowed with incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. Neither Barrister Gohar nor Barrister Syed Ali Zafar — who represent PTI in JCP meetings — have attended recent sessions of the council during which, in separate meetings last week, the commission had recommended the confirmation of 31 additional judges as permanent judges. JCP is the key judicial body responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary Speaking to the media at the Supreme Court today, Gohar said, “The party will take a final decision whether or not to attend future meetings of the JCP after having consultation with the PTI founder”. When asked why PTI skipped meetings of the commission, Barrister Gohar explained that the status of the commission had changed after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the establishment of the new courts, such as the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). He said that the party had serious reservations about the 26th Constitutional Amendment as well, which was enacted into law in 2024. However, Gohar maintained that despite that, PTI “still wanted to present the party’s point of view and give input in the selection of judges for the superior judiciary, but then our meetings with the PTI founder were severed”. He maintained that due to no contact with Imran, the party is unable to consult him. “Just as we boycotted participation from other committees, we also decided to stay away from the meetings of the JCP,” he explained. “We will make a proper decision in this regard after meeting with Khan sahib ,” he added. Meetings with the PTI founder have been suspended till February 8, Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in December last year. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. ‘NA opposition leader not appointed at behest of Nawaz’ On the matter of the appointment of Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Gohar dismissed reports that the appointment was made at the behest of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif. On January 16, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Achakzai was appointed leader of the opposition in the NA. Gohar held that it was at the discretion of the speaker of the National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, to issue the notification. “I understand that it was done by the speaker National Assembly for which we were grateful,” he said. Responding to a question regarding the appointment of the opposition leader in the Senate, Gohar said, “We have been told that the notification of the opposition leader in the Senate will also be done in a few days”. He detailed that the PTI had filed nomination papers before the Senate Secretariat, hoping that the process would be completed today. “Since the PTI founder has already nominated leaders of the opposition in both the Houses, it will be better if they are appointed soon,” he said. In October 2025, PTI had nominated Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas as its candidates for the slots of leader of the opposition in the National Assem­bly and Senate, respectively.",

      "summary_en": "Chairman Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Barrister Gohar Ali Khan has said that the party’s future participation in meetings of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was conditional upon whether consultations would be allowed with incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. Neither Barrister Gohar nor Barrister Syed Ali Zafar — who represent PTI in JCP meetings — have attended recent sessions of the council during which, in separate meetings last week, the commission had recommended the confirmation of 31 additional judges as permanent judges. JCP is the key judicial body responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary Speaking to the media at the Supreme Court today, Gohar said, “The party will take a final decision whether or not to attend future meetings of the JCP after having consultation with the PTI founder”. When asked why PTI skipped meetings of the commission, Barrister Gohar explained that the status of the commission had changed after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the establishment of the new courts, such as the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).

      "summary_orig": "A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) arrived in Saudi Arabia to take part in a multinational aerial combat exercise, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release on Monday. The PAF contingent, comprising F-16 Block-52 fighter aircraft alongside dedicated air and ground crew, arrived at King Abdulaziz Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to participate in the multinational aerial combat exercise ‘Spears of Victory 2026’. “The exercise is witnessing the participation of fighter jets and combat support elements from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, France, Italy, Greece, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America,” the ISPR said. “It offers a robust platform to enhance interoperability, operational synergy, mutual understanding and capacity building among participating air forces, particularly in large force employment, night composite air operations, integrated ISR (Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance), and operations in advanced electronic warfare environments.” Through participation in this multinational forum, the PAF seeks to enhance interoperability with partner air forces and “validate its operational preparedness in a contested, technology-driven battle space”. The military’s media wing elaborated that PAF fighter aircraft undertook a non-stop flight from their home base in Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, “demonstrating the long-range operational reach and expeditionary capabilities of Pakistan Air Force”. “During the conduct of the exercise, PAF pilots flying advanced F-16 Block-52 aircraft equipped with modern avionics and Beyond Visual Range capabilities will be pitched against air crews of participating air forces operating a wide array of sophisticated combat aircraft,” it added. The ISPR further said that the participation of the PAF contingent in the exercise not only reflected its firm commitment to regional and international military cooperation, but also underscored its “professional excellence and proven capability to operate effectively in diverse and demanding operational environments alongside leading contemporary air forces”. In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both. The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies , with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.",

      "summary_orig": "— Courtesy China Daily WHEN the United States attacks another country, it doesn’t just send in troops or launch missiles. It starts with language. What we’re seeing in Venezuela is not random messaging, but a well-designed narrative system — built around three basic steps and repeated through a set of familiar rhetorical tricks. And once you understand how this system works, you start noticing the same pattern again and again. The first step is disguise. Change what an action is called, and you change how it is judged. So the United States did not refer to its action in Venezuela as an “invasion”. In fact, it did not speak the language of war at all. Instead, it talked about “capture”, “arrest” and “joint operations with law enforcement”. All of these terms are synonymous with domestic policing and not war. The effect is powerful. Once it is able to make its action look like law enforcement, questions of sovereignty or the United Nations Charter quietly fade out from the conversation. The violence the US has unleashed is further neutralised through technical language. So, bombing becomes a “precision strike”, invasion becomes an “operation” and the civilian harm it caused is downgraded to “collateral damage”. Such wording does more than soften the blow, presenting war as a form of technical management — something orderly, controlled, almost bureaucratic. At the same time, the targeted state itself is personalised. A country is reduced to a single leader; sovereignty, institutions and the population fade into the background. Once a state is thus reduced to just one individual, regime change can easily be sold as criminal justice rather than aggression. The second step is redirection. If attention is diverted elsewhere, legality becomes irrelevant. This is why so much emphasis is placed on elite units and footage of “dramatic raids”. Command rooms, night-vision images and special forces narratives dominate coverage. The audience is encouraged to admire competence and efficiency. The more impressive the operation looks, the less space there is to ask whether it should have happened at all. Tactical success is then used to conceal strategic violence. A fast, “clean” operation is praised as restrained and responsible, although it says nothing about long-term consequences — regional instability, civilian suffering, economic collapse or endless cycles of intervention. Winning the scene replaces winning the peace. Public debate is carefully redirected toward procedure rather than substance. Media discussions fixate on whether Congress was informed or whether the timing was appropriate. These arguments divert attention from the core issue — who authorised the US to use force across its borders in the first place. Cause and effect are then quietly reversed. Interference came first, but the story is told backwards, as if instability demanded interference, rather than interference leading to instability. History is edited to make aggression appear inevitable. The third step is erasure. Control memory, and you control moral judgment. Latin America is not a new story. The US has interfered there more than 40 times. But that history is wiped clean. Each action is presented as exceptional, as if it has no connection to what came before. And before the public can fully process what happened in Venezuela, new headlines — Trump talking about occupying Greenland within two months, or news about military deployments aimed at Iran — appear. Attention shifts. Venezuela fades. Accountability never arrives. Even imagery is carefully controlled. The public is shown pictures of Nicolas Maduro — poorly dressed, exhausted, humiliated. What is not shown is the brutal process behind those images: the killing of dozens of Cuban bodyguards who died protecting him, and the violence of the raid itself. The focus stays on spectacle, not cost. When invasion is reframed as governance, and war becomes routine administration, the most dangerous transformation has already occurred. It doesn’t happen on the battlefield. It is all in the wording. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

Speaking to reporters after congratulating the newly-elected cabinet of the Timergara Press Club, Mr Khan alleged that trucks carrying flour were being stopped at Attock and bribes demanded, leading to severe shortages in Lower Dir and parts of KP, where a 40kg bag of flour was being sold for as much as Rs6,000. He said the situation amounted to a clear violation of Article 151 of the Constitution, which guarantees free trade among provinces, adding that despite Khyber Pakhtunkhwa being an integral part of Pakistan, the federal government was treating the province unfairly. He also criticised the provincial government for ‘failing to fulfill its constitutional and moral responsibilities’. Responding to a question, Mr Khan said military operations were underway in various parts of the province, but stressed that the growing insecurity must be curbed immediately as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa could not afford further loss of lives. He said instead of military operations, the capacity of police and other civilian institutions be upgraded to cope with the menace of terrorism. Inayat says capacity of police should be enhanced instead of conducting military operations Meanwhile, talking to reporters at the residence of party’s leader Maulana Wahid Gul in Khar area of Bajaur, Inayatullah Khan called for resolving the unrest in the merged districts through dialogue rather than military operations. He expressed sympathies with the family of the JI leader over the Friday night’s bombing targeting his house, and said his party had long held the ‘principled stance’ that issue of law and order in the tribal districts must be resolved through peaceful means, not by use of force. The JI leader alleged that military operations in the tribal districts were not only causing destruction and unrest but also adversely affecting the socioeconomic conditions of residents. Responding to a question, the JI leader said their party was in favour of dialogue on all issues, whether they pertained to security or internal political conflicts. Condemning the bombing at Wahid Gul’s residence, the Jamaat’s provincial chief called it a cowardly act, stating that such incidents were unacceptable and were intended to silence the voices of peace. He stated that the relevant authorities must immediately arrest those responsible for the attack. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

The army placed the units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence in the midwestern state escalates, the officials said, though it is not clear whether any of them will be sent. President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to use the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces if officials in the state do not stop protesters from targeting immigration officials after a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. But if the troops are deployed, it is unclear whether the Trump administration would invoke the Insurrection Act. Army places units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence escalates Even without invoking the act, a president can deploy active-duty forces for certain domestic purposes such as protecting federal property, which Trump cited as a justification for sending Marines to Los Angeles last year. In addition to the active-duty forces, the Pentagon could also attempt to deploy newly created National Guard rapid-response forces for civil disturbances. The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on the order, which was first reported by ABC News. Trump’s threat “If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

Trump said he would impose an additional 10pc import tariffs from Feb 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, which will rise to 25pc on June 1 if no deal is reached. “Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now — and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring,” Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmied-ing said, expecting the euro could come under pressure when Asian trade begins. “The US-EU trade war is back,” said Tina Fordham, strategist and Fordham Global Foresight founder. On Sunday, European leaders slammed the tariff threat over their opposition to his designs on Greenland, warning transatlantic ties were at risk. “Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden warned in a joint statement. An extraordinary meeting of its ambassadors was called in Brussels on Sunday by the EU, which clinched a deal with Washington in July for most EU exports to face a 15pc US levy. France’s President Emmanuel Macron will ask the EU to activate a never-before-used “anti-coercion instrument” against the US if Trump makes good on his tariff threat, Macron’s aides said. Even Trump’s European allies baulked at the threat. Italy’s far-right Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, called the threatened tariffs a ‘mistake’. “I believe that imposing new sanctions today would be a mistake,” she said during her Seoul trip. Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel called Trump’s threat an “inexplicable” form of “blackmail”. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was planning to discuss the situation with Trump “at the earliest opportunity”, UK culture minister Lisa Nandy told the BBC , calling the president’s tariff threat “wrong”. “We believe it’s deeply unhelpful, and we believe it’s counterproductive, and the prime minister has not shied away from making that clear,” she said. Trade war fear France’s Agricultural Minister Annie Genevard warned that tariffs would hurt Washington, too. “In this escalation of tariffs, (Trump) has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists,” she told broadcasters Europe 1 and CNews. Norway, targeted by the tariff threat but, like Britain, not an EU member, said it was not currently looking at retaliation against US goods. “I think one needs to stop and think so that a trade war can be averted that would lead to a downward spiral. Nobody would win,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store told NRK television. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

Trump said he would impose an additional 10pc import tariffs from Feb 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, which will rise to 25pc on June 1 if no deal is reached. “Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now — and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring,” Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmied-ing said, expecting the euro could come under pressure when Asian trade begins. “The US-EU trade war is back,” said Tina Fordham, strategist and Fordham Global Foresight founder. On Sunday, European leaders slammed the tariff threat over their opposition to his designs on Greenland, warning transatlantic ties were at risk. “Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden warned in a joint statement.

Tajikistan, in Central Asia, shares a mountainous border with Afghanistan and has had tense relations with Kabul’s Taliban authorities. According to Tajik security services cited by the state-owned Khovar news agency, “four terrorists were neutralised” after they refused to put down arms in the southern Khatlon region. Tajik authorities have reported at least five deadly incidents on the mountainous border, which is some 1,350 kilometres (840 miles) long, since November. An AFP count using official data found that 16 people have been killed in total. These include Tajik border guards, Chinese workers and what Dushanbe calls “smugglers” and “terrorists”. After attacks on Chinese nationals in November, Tajik authorities urged the Taliban government to take measures to prevent destabilisation of the volatile border region, where drug traffickers and militants are active. In December, five people were killed in an armed clash on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, according to Tajik state media. It added that the people killed in the clash included “three terrorists” and two Tajik border officers.

According to Regional Police Officer (RPO) Bahawalpur Ghazi Muhammad Salahuddin, Rahim Yar Khan police had cordoned off Kacha Rajwani, with contingents from Rajanpur (Punjab) and Ghotki (Sindh) taking part. Sindh police and Rangers were also conducting action in adjoining riverine areas. He said 1,700 police personnel had been deployed along with eight drone teams, six bulletproof vehicles and three armoured personnel carriers. Modern technology was being used to ensure effective progress and restore law and order in the area, he said, adding that police were conducting action against criminal elements under a coordinated and well-planned strategy. The RPO clarified that suspects who renounce criminal activities and voluntarily surrender to the police would not be engaged in encounters and would be produced before the courts in accordance with the law. However, criminals have been strictly warned to lay down their arms and surrender. He further emphasised that the operation would continue until the writ of the government was fully established in the riverine areas. District Police Officer (DPO) Rahim Yar Khan Irfan Ali Samo stated that action against criminals was ongoing and that ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the public remained the top priority. According to details, police with a heavy contingent and full combat equipment have launched a decisive operation against bandits after cordoning off the areas of Machka and Kacha Rajwani. Earlier this month, the Sindh government announced a “massive” operation against dacoits in the katcha areas of the province, vowing to eliminate them through the use of state force. Speaking to reporters after presiding over a high-level meeting on the law and order situation in the Sukkur and Larkana ranges, Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said it had been decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”. “We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits you see on social media,” he said, adding that special focus would be placed on Sukkur and Larkana. Mr Lanjar stressed that dacoits would be given a chance to lay down their arms and join the national mainstream. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them. There will be a fight and they will be eliminated through the use of state force,” he warned. The home minister thanked the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation in which a no-go katcha area was vaca­ted.

Police said the explosion did not result in any loss of life; however, it caused panic among residents of the area. Following the incident, police cordoned off the area and launched an investigation. In 2025, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. At the start of this year, Balochistan’s top police officer vowed to further strengthen the force in 2026 through improved planning, modern weapons and specialised training.

      "title_orig": "TTAP demands ‘independent probe’ into Feb 8 elections, punishment for those responsible for alleged rigging under Article 6",
      "summary_orig": "The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP) has demanded an “independent probe” into the alleged rigging in the February 8, 2024, election and “punishment for those responsible for it under Article 6 of the Constitution”, as they held an All Parties Conference (APC) in Karachi on Sunday. The TTAP delegation, led by the chairperson and the newly-appointed opposition leader in the National Assembly, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, has arrived in Sindh for four days . The visit is part of the mobilisation efforts for a nationwide ‘street movement’ called by the PTI, scheduled for February 8. TTAP members also announced observing “Black Day” and nationwide strike on Feb 8, to commemorate the second anniversary of the last general elections in Pakistan, which they claimed were rigged. According to the TTAP’s manifesto, “Democracy rests on the foundation of transparent elections; therefore, restoring public trust in the transfer of power is possible only through fair elections.” The manifesto demanded “the immediate appointment of an impartial chief election commissioner and the holding of transparent elections under a new election commission.” It further called for an independent investigation into the alleged rigging in the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, the identification of those responsible, and their punishment under Article 6 of the Constitution, which corresponds to high treason. “Through the 26th and 27th constitutional amendments , the independence of the judiciary has been undermined by keeping the sword of judges’ transfers hanging over their heads,” it said. “Conscientious judges, including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza, have been sidelined.” “The TTAP manifesto said it “strongly condemned” the recent actions against Justice Tariq Jahangiri , terming his disqualification the “latest example of an attack on the judiciary”. It further condemned the “false cases and convictions” against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife. “TTAP demands the immediate release of all political prisoners, including former prime minister Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Mian Mahmood ur Rashid, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Hassan Niazi, Ali Wazir, Haji Abdul Samad, Wali Mohmand, Dr Mahrang Baloch, and the detainees of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee,” the manifesto said. Moreover, it called for an end to restrictions on meetings of party leaders and family with Imran. Referring to the PECA law , the manifesto termed it a move to “silence critical voices and curtail media freedom”. It labelled the legislation as “black law” and demanded its “immediate revocation”. During the APC, members slammed the “economic exploitation” of media networks, including Dawn TV , by imposing an advertisement ban. The manifesto also demanded that the ongoing military operation in the Tirah Valley be “stopped immediately”, urging that the “federal government should take the provincial government into confidence on all matters”. “All issues with Afghanistan should be resolved diplomatically,” the manifesto read, further asking the “unanimous demands” of the Jirga held in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly be immediately accepted. ‘Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if provinces get their rights’ Speaking to the APC, TTAP chief Achakzai said, “Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if the provinces get their rights. “We have to understand the problems of every province.” “Come, let’s save our country,” Achakzai said, adding, “If you call the people of Waziristan and tell them that it is [Pakistan] your country, the terrorism will end.” He alleged that the mandate of 25 million people was stolen in the Feb 8 elections. “We have to come out on Feb 8 to protest peacefully,” he added, saying, “people will have to be united.” ‘90 per cent of people are in favour of Imran Khan’ Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) head and nominated leader of opposition in the Senate, Allama Raja Nasir, said, “90 per cent of people in Pakistan are in favour of Imran Khan.” “Despite keeping Imran in jail, they couldn’t keep people away from him. Only the public can pull Pakistan out of this turmoil,” he said. Abbas also urged people to take to the streets and join the peaceful protest on Feb 8. “If people come out on Feb 8, we will see a big difference on Feb 9.” ‘Over 200 FIRs and over two years in jail’ Former NA speaker Asad Qaiser said that Imran had been in jail for two years, and over 200 first information reports (FIRs) had been registered against him. “His wife and nephew are also in jail,” Qaiser said, adding that the PTI founder had always opted for a life of struggle over lavishness. “Despite problems, he [Imran Khan] stood firm and resolute.” The ex-speaker said that Imran’s perspective was centred around human rights; therefore, he “will never compromise.” He further stated that Imran had denied vengeance once he got in power. “Our Constitution gives the freedom to express and assemble, but we are not allowed to hold public gatherings.“",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been invited to be a part of the Gaza “Board of Peace” that is being formed by United States President Donald Trump, the Foreign Office has said. “The prime minister of Pakistan has received the invitation from the president of the United States to join the Board of Peace on Gaza,” said FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi in response to media queries. “Pakistan will remain engaged with international efforts for peace and security in Gaza, leading to a lasting solution to the Palestine issue in accordance with United Nations resolutions,” he added. The so-called “Board of Peace” has begun to take shape as the US moves on to the second phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza, which stands decimated after two years of Israel’s bombardment. Trump had already declared himself the chair of the body, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in the Palestinian territory. The United States has invited the heads of around 60 states to join the Board of Peace, including those of Turkiye, Egypt, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia. However, the charter of the board, which does not mention Gaza by name, suggests that Trump has begun to position it as a rival to the United Nations. On Friday, the US president named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and his senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to the panel. According to Reuters , the board also includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Israel has repeatedly opposed any Turkish role in Gaza. Other members of the executive board include UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Sigrid Kaag; Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay; and a minister from the United Arab Emirates, which established relations with Israel in 2020. A Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo on Friday, which was attended by Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who has partnered with Witkoff for months on the issue. Former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath , who is leading the committee, has an ambitious plan that includes pushing war debris into the Mediterranean Sea and rebuilding destroyed infrastructure within three years. Analysts say the coming weeks will test whether Washington can translate the ambitious blueprint into tangible progress on governance, security and reconstruction in Gaza, as negotiations over demilitarisation and political transition intensify.",
