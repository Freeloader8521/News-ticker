      "summary_orig": "Saudi Arabia is discussing a defence deal with the United States which it hopes to seal when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits the White House next month, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. A senior Trump administration official told the Financial Times there were discussions about signing something when the crown prince comes, but the details are in flux. The FT said the deal in discussion was similar to the recent US-Qatar pact that pledged to treat any armed attack on Qatar as a threat to the United States. The US deal with Qatar came after Israel last month attempted to kill leaders of Hamas with an air strike on Doha. The US State Department told the FT that defence co-operation with the kingdom was a “strong bedrock of our regional strategy,” but declined to comment on details of the potential deal. The US State Department, the White House and the Saudi government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the FT report. Last month, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. It also came just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.",

The US State Department, the White House and the Saudi government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the FT report. Last month, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. It also came just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.",

      "summary_orig": "SINCE the Afghan Taliban’s accession to power, Pakistan’s approach to Afghanistan has largely been one of patience, quiet diplomacy and cautious optimism, sometimes interrupted by defensive military counter strikes. The assumption was that a shared history and geography would translate into shared security interests. Islamabad placed its faith mainly in dialogue, believing that persuasion could prevent the Afghan side from allowing anti-Pakistan groups to operate across the border. Yet the events of the past months — the growing boldness of militant sanctuaries, the deadly border clashes , and Kabul’s defiant rhetoric — have underscored that diplomacy without accountability breeds impunity. At no point since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has Pakistan’s border security been so fragile as now. Each promise of cooperation from Kabul has been followed by another attack on Pakistani soil. Each meeting, each delegation, each attempt at quiet mediation has ended with the same grim pattern — militants re-emerging across the Durand Line, launching raids, killing soldiers, and retreating into what Pakistan calls ‘protected zones’. It’s time to rethink what ‘engagement’ means — not as an abandonment of diplomacy, but as its recalibration. Real peace must rest on mechanisms that compel compliance and consequences that deter transgression. The recent clashes on the border were the culmination of years of unreciprocated restraint. Pakistan’s soldiers, accustomed to exercising caution on a volatile frontier, faced heavy fire from across the line — and paid with their lives. Statements from Kabul, denying responsibility or shifting blame , deepened public outrage. The national consensus is that dialogue alone will not secure the frontier. A firm, accountable strategy does not mean reckless aggression or collective punishment. It means replacing appeasement with deterrence — a model rooted in law, precision, and protection of civilians. It begins with one principle: when one state’s territory is used repeatedly for attacks against another, the victim state has both the right and obligation to defend itself. The challenge is to exercise that right intelligently. The first step is accountability. For too long, violations of Pakistan’s sovereignty have gone unanswered in international forums. Documentation of cross-border incursions, militant safe havens, and targeted killings should form the basis of a formal diplomatic case, presented to regional partners and international organisations. The goal is to expose patterns of behaviour that can no longer be ignored. Evidence-based accountability will isolate those within Afghanistan who enable militancy while protecting its civilian population from broad sanctions. Pakistan has been a patient neighbour — at times too patient for its own security. The second step is defensive deterrence. Pakistan’s border is long and mountainous, but it cannot remain porous. A modernised surveillance grid, combining satellite imagery, drones and local intelligence as well as rapid response can sharply reduce infiltration. The message should be: incursions will meet with immediate, proportionate response — not to provoke war, but to prevent it. Third, Pakistan must harness economic and diplomatic leverage. Afghanistan’s economy remains heavily dependent on cross-border trade, transit revenue and remittances. Conditional trade facilitation will create tangible incentives for cooperation. At the same time, Pakistan can mobilise regional partners to impose targeted sanctions on networks financing cross-border militancy. This is not collective punishment; it is pressure applied exactly where it hurts the enablers most. Yet firmness must not blur into vindictiveness. Humanitarian channels must remain open. Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades, often with little international help. That tradition of generosity may selectively continue, but it must be insulated from exploitation. Humanitarian corridors should be monitored, aid flows regulated and border populations protected from both militant recruitment and retaliatory policies. The moral high ground remains Pakistan’s most potent diplomatic asset; it must not be surrendered. The fourth pillar is legal and multilateral engagement. Pakistan’s case must not rely solely on rhetoric. By submitting documented evidence of cross-border attacks to regional and UN mechanisms, Islamabad can shift the burden of proof. It can demand verification missions, border-monitoring arrangements, or third-party observers. If Kabul resists, its refusal will speak louder than any propaganda. This approach transforms Pakistan’s narrative from one of grievance to one of governance — a state acting within the law. Fifth, Pakistan should build a coalition of the willing. No regional state benefits from an unstable frontier. China, Iran, and the Central Asian republics all share concerns about cross-border militancy. Coordinated intelligence-sharing, joint patrol frameworks, and shared surveillance capacities can dilute the burden Pakistan currently shoulders alone. Regional consensus would deprive militant groups of the illusion that they can exploit one neighbour against another. But all these measures depend on clarity of intent. A firm posture is not an end in itself; it is a tool to restore deterrence. The objective is not perpetual hostility with Afghanistan, but a relationship redefined by boundaries — political, physical and moral. Peace cannot emerge from fear, but neither can it survive without respect — which must now be earned, not assumed. The lessons of history are unambiguous. States that fail to defend their borders under the guise of restraint invite greater aggression. States that act rashly without legal and moral legitimacy invite isolation. The middle path — disciplined strength — is the only viable route. For a long time now, Pakistan has been a patient neighbour — at times too patient for its own security. India’s and Afghanistan’s aggressions have demonstrated this. Pacifist voices are needed to maintain a semblance of sanity, but they should be rooted in reality, rather than a one-sided insistence on negotiations and self-defence. It is time now to take a harder stance. When dialogue becomes a loop of promises and denials, patience becomes vulnerability. It is time Islamabad replaced vulnerability with vigilance, and dialogue without consequence with diplomacy that carries weight. A firm, lawful, and strategically calibrated posture towards Afghanistan is the overdue recognition that peace without accountability is fiction. If Kabul truly desires a stable relationship, it will find a willing partner in Islamabad. But if Kabul continues to allow violence to flow across the border, it will face a neighbour that no longer confuses restraint with weakness.

      "title": "When patience runs out",
      "summary": "SINCE the Afghan Taliban’s accession to power, Pakistan’s approach to Afghanistan has largely been one of patience, quiet diplomacy and cautious optimism, sometimes interrupted by defensive military counter strikes. The assumption was that a shared history and geography would translate into shared security interests. Islamabad placed its faith mainly in dialogue, believing that persuasion could prevent the Afghan side from allowing anti-Pakistan groups to operate across the border. Yet the events of the past months — the growing boldness of militant sanctuaries, the deadly border clashes , and Kabul’s defiant rhetoric — have underscored that diplomacy without accountability breeds impunity. At no point since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has Pakistan’s border security been so fragile as now. Each promise of cooperation from Kabul has been followed by another attack on Pakistani soil. Each meeting, each delegation, each attempt at quiet mediation has ended with the same grim pattern — militants re-emerging across the Durand Line, launching raids, killing soldiers, and retreating into what Pakistan calls ‘protected zones’. It’s time to rethink what ‘engagement’ means — not as an abandonment of diplomacy, but as its recalibration. Real peace must rest on mechanisms that compel compliance and consequences that deter transgression. The recent clashes on the border were the culmination of years of unreciprocated restraint. Pakistan’s soldiers, accustomed to exercising caution on a volatile frontier, faced heavy fire from across the line — and paid with their lives. Statements from Kabul, denying responsibility or shifting blame , deepened public outrage. The national consensus is that dialogue alone will not secure the frontier. A firm, accountable strategy does not mean reckless aggression or collective punishment. It means replacing appeasement with deterrence — a model rooted in law, precision, and protection of civilians. It begins with one principle: when one state’s territory is used repeatedly for attacks against another, the victim state has both the right and obligation to defend itself. The challenge is to exercise that right intelligently. The first step is accountability. For too long, violations of Pakistan’s sovereignty have gone unanswered in international forums. Documentation of cross-border incursions, militant safe havens, and targeted killings should form the basis of a formal diplomatic case, presented to regional partners and international organisations. The goal is to expose patterns of behaviour that can no longer be ignored. Evidence-based accountability will isolate those within Afghanistan who enable militancy while protecting its civilian population from broad sanctions. Pakistan has been a patient neighbour — at times too patient for its own security. The second step is defensive deterrence. Pakistan’s border is long and mountainous, but it cannot remain porous. A modernised surveillance grid, combining satellite imagery, drones and local intelligence as well as rapid response can sharply reduce infiltration. The message should be: incursions will meet with immediate, proportionate response — not to provoke war, but to prevent it. Third, Pakistan must harness economic and diplomatic leverage. Afghanistan’s economy remains heavily dependent on cross-border trade, transit revenue and remittances. Conditional trade facilitation will create tangible incentives for cooperation. At the same time, Pakistan can mobilise regional partners to impose targeted sanctions on networks financing cross-border militancy. This is not collective punishment; it is pressure applied exactly where it hurts the enablers most. Yet firmness must not blur into vindictiveness. Humanitarian channels must remain open. Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades, often with little international help. That tradition of generosity may selectively continue, but it must be insulated from exploitation. Humanitarian corridors should be monitored, aid flows regulated and border populations protected from both militant recruitment and retaliatory policies. The moral high ground remains Pakistan’s most potent diplomatic asset; it must not be surrendered. The fourth pillar is legal and multilateral engagement. Pakistan’s case must not rely solely on rhetoric. By submitting documented evidence of cross-border attacks to regional and UN mechanisms, Islamabad can shift the burden of proof. It can demand verification missions, border-monitoring arrangements, or third-party observers. If Kabul resists, its refusal will speak louder than any propaganda. This approach transforms Pakistan’s narrative from one of grievance to one of governance — a state acting within the law. Fifth, Pakistan should build a coalition of the willing. No regional state benefits from an unstable frontier. China, Iran, and the Central Asian republics all share concerns about cross-border militancy. Coordinated intelligence-sharing, joint patrol frameworks, and shared surveillance capacities can dilute the burden Pakistan currently shoulders alone. Regional consensus would deprive militant groups of the illusion that they can exploit one neighbour against another. But all these measures depend on clarity of intent. A firm posture is not an end in itself; it is a tool to restore deterrence. The objective is not perpetual hostility with Afghanistan, but a relationship redefined by boundaries — political, physical and moral. Peace cannot emerge from fear, but neither can it survive without respect — which must now be earned, not assumed. The lessons of history are unambiguous.

The Gaza peace plan set out by US President Donald Trump does not rule out a Palestinian state, and also suggests allowing a role for the Palestinian Authority once it has completed a set of reforms. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to fight the establishment of a Palestinian state and has all but rejected the option of the Ramallah-based PA ruling over post-war Gaza. Mustafa said the PA had crafted a five-year plan for Gaza that would unfold over three phases and require $65 billion for 18 different sectors such as housing, education, governance and more. The plan builds on what was agreed at a summit of Arab countries in Cairo in March 2025, and Mustafa said that “police training programmes initiated with Egypt and Jordan are already underway.” “Our vision is clear,” he told an assembly of Palestinian ministers, UN heads of agency and diplomatic heads of mission from his office in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. “Gaza shall be rebuilt as an open, connected and thriving part of the State of Palestine,” Mustafa said. He also said that technical discussions were ongoing with the European Union over “secure crossing operations, customs systems, and integrated policing units”. The EU is one of the largest donors to the PA. Above all, the post-war reconstruction plan aims to make way for a single Palestinian government. The process will “reinforce the political and territorial unity between Gaza and the West Bank, and contribute to restoring a credible governance framework for the state of Palestine,” said Mustafa. Trading blame over bodies Meanwhile, as Israel and Hamas continued to trade blame over the latter’s failure to hand over bodies of all deceased prisoners held in Gaza, Turkiye has deployed dozens of disaster relief experts to help search for the remains. A dispute over the return of prisoners’ bodies threatens to derail the truce and other unresolved elements of the peace plan, including disarmament of militants and Gaza’s future governance. Hamas has handed over 10 bodies, which it said were all it could recover. The recovery of the rest of the remains would require heavy machinery and excavation equipment, which was not currently available, they said. Also on Thursday, a senior Hamas official accused Israel of flouting the ceasefire by killing at least 24 people in shootings since Friday, and said a list of such violations was handed over to mediators. Later on Thursday, local health authorities said an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis in southern Gaza killed two people. Separately, US President Donald Trump threatened Thursday to “go in and kill” Hamas if it keeps killing people in Gaza, in an apparent reference to recent shootings of Palestinian civilians following a ceasefire deal with Israel. Trump’s comments come just days after he said that the Hamas shootings – which included public executions – “didn’t bother me much” and described them as killings of gang members. “If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network. Trump did not elaborate on what he meant by “we.” But he said on Wednesday that “we won’t need the US military” to be involved in Gaza. Published in Dawn, October 17th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Over 42,000 personnel deployed as police plan to round up leaders, activists to scuttle Friday demos • Authorities look to freeze bank accounts, hand over properties to Auqaf LAHORE: As police plan a crackdown to round up the leadership of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakis­­tan (TLP) to scuttle its plans for protests today (Friday), the Pun­jab government has decided to ask the Centre to ban the radical outfit. Although most TLP leaders have ‘gone underground’ following the Muridke crackdown, the authorities are apprehensive about the hardline group’s plans to take to the streets after Friday prayers to stage another protest. These anxieties stem from a statement by TLP Balochistan president Wazir Ahmad Rizvi, who had called on protesters to converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar on Oct 17 (today), as well as intelligence reports suggesting that TLP activists may engage in violent clashes and widespread chaos after Friday prayers. A senior police official told Dawn that the law enforcement agencies had received a list of the TLP activists and had been assigned special tasks to launch a large-scale crackdown on Thursday night to ensure a large number of arrests before Friday. He said that the Punjab police senior command held a series of important meetings to arrest the ‘leftover’ leadership of the radical outfit that had gone into hiding following the Muridke crackdown. The officer said that a series of meetings were held in this regard on Thursday to devise multiple strategies in this respect. Chairing a high-level meeting, Punjab police chief Dr Usman Anwar approved a deployment of 30,000 personnel on the roads across the province, besides assigning special duties to 12,000 plainclothesmen of the Punjab Special Branch. At least five locations in the provincial capital have been declared ‘sensitive’ since these have rem­ained the hub of violent attacks carried out by the TLP in recent demonstrations. These included the TLP head on Multan Road, Shahdara, Chungi Amar Sidhu, Baghbanpura, Thokar Niaz Baig, and the Babu Sabu interchange. Warning against violence During the meeting, the police officers were given instructions on how to ‘handle the mobs’ in case of violence. “We have decided to treat the violators under anti-terrorism and other heinous charges to take them to the court of law for punishment up to 10 and 14 years,” Punjab police chief Dr Usman Anwar said. He said Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning all kinds of gatherings, demonstrations, processions and rallies. The Punjab Home Department has formally issued a notification enforcing Section 144 across the province, he said. “If anyone tries to attack law enforcers, vandalise public property or take the law into their hands, we are here to deal with them with iron hands,” Dr Usman said, adding that instructions have been issued to trace and arrest the TLP violators with the help of the AI-based technology. He said that the data of the TLP men wanted by the Punjab police had been updated in the record of the Safe City cameras and vehicles of the patrolling police to trace and arrest them. TLP ban In a meeting chaired by CM Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab government has also decided to place the TLP leadership in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Without naming any party, an official handout referred to decisions taken against an “extremist party”. However, Information Minister Azma Bokhari later confirmed that the reference was to TLP. According to the handout, the Punjab will “recommend to the federal government to impose a ban on an extremist party and the party leadership be placed in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act”. Apart from these recommendations, Punjab also decided to arrest all “individuals involved in hate speech, incitement and violation of law. All leaders and workers involved in the martyrdom of police officers and damage to state property will be tried in anti-terrorism courts (ATCs)”. “All properties and assets of the extremist party will be handed over to the Punjab Auqaf Department. There will be a complete ban on the extremist party’s posters, banners and advertisements,” the statement added. It further said that all bank accounts of the party will be frozen and that social media accounts spreading hatred will also be taken down. The Punjab would also ensure strict action on the violation of the Loudspeaker Act. It may be mentioned here that the federal government had banned the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government under the ATA. The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march towards Islamabad.

      "summary_orig": "• Shehbaz says Afghanistan must take the lead if it is serious about quelling cross-border terrorism; hopes Taliban govt will take steps to address ‘TTP problem’ • Uncertainty surrounds reports of peace talks in Doha in absence of official confirmation • Beijing, Tehran and UN mission urge restraint, ready to play constructive role for de-escalation ISLAMABAD: Back-channel diplomatic efforts were afoot on Thursday, as the Pakistan-Afghanistan border remained calm and no ceasefire violations being reported. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however, made it clear that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks. “The ball is in [their] court,” he said while addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet, informing his colleagues that the Afghan Taliban had formally requested a ceasefire after intense clashes between the two sides earlier in the week. “We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks. He, however, hoped that thorny issues between the two be resolved on a long-term basis, including the elimination of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) , which uses Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan, so that the neighbouring country’s territory was no longer used by terrorists. PM Shehbaz reiterated his hope that the ceasefire be maintained for the future on the basis of “solid demands”. “If this was only done to buy time, then we won’t accept it,” the premier warned, as per Dawn.com. He elaborated that officials from Pakistan had visited Kabul many times and engaged in cordial dialogue on resolving their issues together with mutual agreement for the sake of peace and prosperity. “Unfortunately, despite all efforts, this was not possible, and when this attack was ongoing on Pakistan, on India’s complete incitement, their (Afghan) Foreign Minister [Amir] Muttaqi was in New Delhi, so we were forced to give a comprehensive response,” the PM said. According to PM Shehbaz, the Qatari emir had condemned the entire episode in talks with him in Egypt and expressed his desire to play a role in cooling down tensions. There was no immediate response to his remarks from Kabul, with Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayatullah Khowarazmi saying only that the ceasefire was holding so far. A statement from the Afghan Taliban interior ministry said Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani met senior Iranian officials and told them that Afghanistan seeks good relations with all countries, especially its neighbours, Reuters reported. It may be noted that both sides reached a ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, which took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours. Doha talks? Though diplomatic efforts were continuing to arrange a meeting between the two sides before the truce expires, uncertainty surrounded the planned talks in the absence of any official confirmation. In its statement announcing the ceasefire, the Foreign Office had said that both sides would hold dialogue “to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue.” According to diplomatic sources, the talks were expected to focus on extending the ceasefire and finding ways to defuse the latest border tensions. On Thursday, reports emerged that Qatar had invited high-level delegations from both countries for talks in Doha on Friday. Though Doha’s invitation was not made public, but a day earlier, Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had received a message from Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr. M. Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi about “the regional situation.” The timing of the message, which coincided with the announcement of the ceasefire, appeared linked to Qatar’s efforts to mediate. Saudi Arabia also joined the diplomatic push on Thursday, with Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan speaking by phone with FM Dar to discuss “the regional situation and recent developments,” according to the Foreign Office. While Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Saudi Arabia on regional and international issues, the statement did not directly mention Afghanistan. Diplomatic sources said the main hurdle to the planned dialogue appeared to be internal deliberations within the Taliban’s top leadership. A source in Kabul said that Taliban supreme leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada had yet to give formal approval for his side’s participation. Late-night reports from Kabul suggested that Mullah Haibatullah had eventually agreed to send Defense Minister Mullah Yaqub to represent the Taliban at the proposed Doha meeting. The Pakistani side remained cautious. Officials in Islamabad declined to confirm or deny the meeting. They seemed to be waiting for Kabul’s decision. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the talks take place,” a Pakistani diplomat said on condition of anonymity, describing the negotiations as “fluid but not off the table.” Calls for restraint On Thursday, Iran and China urged restraint on both sides, calling on them to settle the current conflict through talks. China said it supports countries in exercising restraint and realising a full and lasting ceasefire. A foreign ministry spokesperson, when asked about Pakistan and Afghanistan agreeing to a 48-hour ceasefire, said that Beijing stands ready to continue to play a constructive role for continued improvement in the two countries’ relations. “Pakistan and Afgh­anistan are each other’s neighbours and both are China’s friends. China supports the two countries in staying cool-headed and exercising restraint, realizing a full and lasting ceasefire, properly handling differences through dialogue and consultation, returning to the track of political settlement, and together maintaining peace and stability in both countries and the wider region.” Iran also welcomed the ceasefire, urging dialogue and diplomacy. In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei expressed concern over civilian casualties and called for stronger regional cooperation to combat terrorism, while reaffirming Tehran’s readiness “to assist in any effort to maintain calm and reduce tensions between the two neighbouring Muslim countries”. Meanwhile, the Tasnim News Agency quoted Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian as calling for Muslim unity and dialogue following the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He said the renewed tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have raised serious concern among regional nations, including Iran, which shares borders with both. Pezeshkian reiterated that Iran would use all available resources to reduce tensions, promote dialogue, and strengthen ties between the two neighbours. Enemies continually seek to create discord among Muslim nations to weaken them, he said, adding that the region needs peace, cohesion, and cooperation more than ever. Meanwhile, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) also called on all parties “to bring a lasting end to hostilities to protect civilians and prevent further loss of life”. It also urged both Afghanistan and Pakistan to comply with their obligations under international law “to prevent” more civilian casualties. Published in Dawn, October 17th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured newly-elected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Thursday that the federal government was willing to work with his administration for the national interest. After a week-long constitutional and political crisis in the province over the chief minister’s election, Afridi was sworn in as the KP CM yesterday evening, with hundreds of PTI supporters present during the ceremony at the Governor House in Peshawar. The lead-up to the election saw criticism from government ministers against Afridi but a statement on X by state broadcaster PTV News today said the premier had a talk with the new chief minister and congratulated him. “The federation is ready to work with the you in the interest of Pakistan,“ the statement quoted PM Shehbaz as telling CM Afridi. Separately, the Peshawar High Court granted protective bail to Afridi till November 18. A two-member bench comprising PHC’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar took up Afridi’s bail application today, with the chief minister appearing before the court in person. During the hearing, Justice Ijaz asked whether there were any first information reports (FIR) registered against the KP chief minister. “We do not know how many FIRs there are. It is possible that there might be an FIR against me as well,” KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel told the court. Subsequently, the court approved CM Afridi’s bail plea, barring his arrest in any case till November 18. According to the court order, available with Dawn.com , the bench directed that details regarding criminal cases, if any, registered against Afridi be provided at the next hearing on November 18. Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Afridi said that the federal and “those individuals who are preventing the meeting [with Imran] should realise that a province’s chief minister is coming”. Responding to a reporter’s query, Afridi said he has not met Imran since he was imprisoned. He also refuted a list of names for his new cabinet that has been circulating on social media as “fake”. Asked whether the provincial cabinet will be finalised after his meeting with the PTI founder, CM Afridi replied in the affirmative. “No action will be taken without the approval of our lifelong [party] chairman sahib ,” he asserted. ‘Peaceful protest always an option’ Yesterday, the KP Home and Tribal Affairs Department had requested the secretary of its Punjab counterpart and the interior ministry secretary that “necessary arrangements” be made to facilitate Afridi’s meeting with Imran today, according to a letter shared by Niazi. Shortly after today’s hearing, PTI lawyer Naeem Panjhuta said on social media platform X that Afridi had departed for Adiala Jail to meet party founder Imran Khan, who has been incarcerated since August 2023 in multiple cases. CM’s Focal Person on Digital Media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi also shared a video on X, saying that the chief minister was on his way to Adiala Jail. Later in the afternoon, the PTI claimed that the authorities were “not letting” CM Afridi meet Imran, terming it the “real anti-Pakistan act”. “They are isolating the very leadership that millions of Pakistanis trust. They fear the people standing together with Imran Khan,” the party said on its official X account. Speaking at a checkpoint situated near Adiala jail, the chief minister assured the people gathered there that he would not disappoint them. Later, he also spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, he said he had come there to meet Imran. “Yesterday, the KP government had informed the federal and Punjab government that the [KP] chief minister would be meeting Imran today, but they did not respond,” he said, adding that he also spoke to PM Shehbaz. “I thanked Shehbaz Sharif sahib , he called and congratulated me. I told him that […] our people should not [get affected] by our personal and political differences. I requested him to let me meet Imran, at which he said he would enquire [about the matter] and get back to me. But till now, there has been no response from him,” Afridi said. The KP CM said they were trying to adopt all constitutional and legal means for his meeting with Imran. But, he went on to say, “we had tried all [other] means in the past and will do so again”, highlighting that the PTI was criticised for practicing the politics of protests in that case. “If courts don’t serve justice, if we adopted all constitutional means and still are not served justice, then peaceful protest is the only solution. We have always protested peacefully and we always have that option,” Afridi added.",

Asked whether the provincial cabinet will be finalised after his meeting with the PTI founder, CM Afridi replied in the affirmative. “No action will be taken without the approval of our lifelong [party] chairman sahib ,” he asserted. ‘Peaceful protest always an option’ Yesterday, the KP Home and Tribal Affairs Department had requested the secretary of its Punjab counterpart and the interior ministry secretary that “necessary arrangements” be made to facilitate Afridi’s meeting with Imran today, according to a letter shared by Niazi. Shortly after today’s hearing, PTI lawyer Naeem Panjhuta said on social media platform X that Afridi had departed for Adiala Jail to meet party founder Imran Khan, who has been incarcerated since August 2023 in multiple cases. CM’s Focal Person on Digital Media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi also shared a video on X, saying that the chief minister was on his way to Adiala Jail. Later in the afternoon, the PTI claimed that the authorities were “not letting” CM Afridi meet Imran, terming it the “real anti-Pakistan act”. “They are isolating the very leadership that millions of Pakistanis trust. They fear the people standing together with Imran Khan,” the party said on its official X account. Speaking at a checkpoint situated near Adiala jail, the chief minister assured the people gathered there that he would not disappoint them. Later, he also spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, he said he had come there to meet Imran. “Yesterday, the KP government had informed the federal and Punjab government that the [KP] chief minister would be meeting Imran today, but they did not respond,” he said, adding that he also spoke to PM Shehbaz. “I thanked Shehbaz Sharif sahib , he called and congratulated me. I told him that […] our people should not [get affected] by our personal and political differences. I requested him to let me meet Imran, at which he said he would enquire [about the matter] and get back to me. But till now, there has been no response from him,” Afridi said. The KP CM said they were trying to adopt all constitutional and legal means for his meeting with Imran. But, he went on to say, “we had tried all [other] means in the past and will do so again”, highlighting that the PTI was criticised for practicing the politics of protests in that case. “If courts don’t serve justice, if we adopted all constitutional means and still are not served justice, then peaceful protest is the only solution. We have always protested peacefully and we always have that option,” Afridi added.",

      "summary": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured newly-elected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Thursday that the federal government was willing to work with his administration for the national interest. After a week-long constitutional and political crisis in the province over the chief minister’s election, Afridi was sworn in as the KP CM yesterday evening, with hundreds of PTI supporters present during the ceremony at the Governor House in Peshawar. The lead-up to the election saw criticism from government ministers against Afridi but a statement on X by state broadcaster PTV News today said the premier had a talk with the new chief minister and congratulated him. “The federation is ready to work with the you in the interest of Pakistan,“ the statement quoted PM Shehbaz as telling CM Afridi. Separately, the Peshawar High Court granted protective bail to Afridi till November 18. A two-member bench comprising PHC’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar took up Afridi’s bail application today, with the chief minister appearing before the court in person. During the hearing, Justice Ijaz asked whether there were any first information reports (FIR) registered against the KP chief minister. “We do not know how many FIRs there are. It is possible that there might be an FIR against me as well,” KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel told the court. Subsequently, the court approved CM Afridi’s bail plea, barring his arrest in any case till November 18. According to the court order, available with Dawn.com , the bench directed that details regarding criminal cases, if any, registered against Afridi be provided at the next hearing on November 18. Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Afridi said that the federal and “those individuals who are preventing the meeting [with Imran] should realise that a province’s chief minister is coming”. Responding to a reporter’s query, Afridi said he has not met Imran since he was imprisoned. He also refuted a list of names for his new cabinet that has been circulating on social media as “fake”.

      "title_orig": "Trump says he will meet Putin again after making progress in Ukraine talks",
      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday agreed to another summit to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, a day before the US president was due to speak with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump said he and Putin would soon meet in Budapest after a more than two-hour-long phone call he described as productive. The Kremlin did not immediately comment. The surprise development came as Zelensky was headed to the White House on Friday to push for more military support, including potential long-range offensive missiles. Yet the positive tone following the US-Russia call appeared to leave in question the possibility of such support in the near term. Energy systems targeted Kyiv and Moscow have been escalating their war with massive attacks on energy infrastructure while Nato struggles to respond to a spate of Russian air incursions. The Trump-Putin meeting will follow lower-level talks between Moscow and Washington next week, Trump said. No date was provided for the leaders’ meeting. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he would brief Zelensky on the Russia talks in the Oval Office tomorrow. “I believe great progress was made with today’s telephone conversation,” he added. Ukraine wants to expand attack range Ukraine has been seeking US Tomahawk long-range missiles, which would put Moscow and other major Russian cities within range of missile fire from Ukraine. Trump, a Republican who has vowed to end the war that Russia started with its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, had before Thursday expressed increasing frustration with Putin over ongoing attacks. Trump has said he could supply the long-range weapons to Ukraine if Putin fails to come to the negotiating table. In its latest barrage, Russia launched more than 300 drones and 37 missiles to target infrastructure across Ukraine in overnight attacks on Thursday, Zelensky said. Kyiv has ramped up its own attacks on Russian targets, including an oil refinery in the Saratov region on Thursday.

      "summary_orig": "The Torkham and Chaman border crossings with Afghanistan remained closed for all trade activities last Sunday, in light of the “escalating security situation” along the Pak-Afghan border, it emerged on Thursday. This development comes in the wake of military hostilities between Pakistan and Afghan­istan. On Wednesday, the two neighbours agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours. According to a notification from the Directorate General of Transit Trade — dated October 15 and available with Dawn.com — transit vehicles headed to Afghanistan have arrived at the crossings but are unable to leave Pakistani territory. “These vehicles are mounted with tracking devices and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) seals under the new tracking and monitoring system that was launched on October 1,” the notification read. “These border terminals have limited parking spaces, leading to severe congestion,” it added. “Moreover, prolonged parking/stoppage of vehicles can encourage device theft as well as seal tampering that can lead to pilferage of bonded cargo. In addition, in the absence of return journeys, there is [a] possibility of a shortage of tracking devices at the Port terminals.” The directorate stated that as of Wednesday, 107 vehicles arrived at Torkham, while 357 arrived at Chaman. An additional 37 vehicles are en route to Torkham and another 85 to Chaman. “In order to avoid congestion at border stations and to ensure the security of the bonded goods, this directorate, in consultation with port terminal operators, bonded carriers, Afghan clearing agents and tracking companies, has temporarily stopped the processing of transit consignments till normalisation of border operations,” the notification concluded. Torkham and Chama are key trade corridors between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with goods such as fresh produce moving across the border. Official data showed that Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan surged 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25, up from $558.03m in the previous fiscal year. Trade across the border has been halted several times. Earlier this month, the disruption in internet service in Afghanistan impacted bilateral trade between Islamabad and Kabul via the Torkham border, with Pakistani customs authorities struggling to clear goods due to the non-availability of internet on the Afghan side. In March, the cross-border movement of people via the Torkham border crossing was abruptly suspended after Pakistani and Afghan security forces were at loggerheads over construction activities on both sides of the border.",

Earlier this month, the disruption in internet service in Afghanistan impacted bilateral trade between Islamabad and Kabul via the Torkham border, with Pakistani customs authorities struggling to clear goods due to the non-availability of internet on the Afghan side. In March, the cross-border movement of people via the Torkham border crossing was abruptly suspended after Pakistani and Afghan security forces were at loggerheads over construction activities on both sides of the border.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces have killed 34 “India-backed” terrorists during multiple operations that took place across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the last three days, the military’s media wing said on Thursday. According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “From 13-15 October 2025, thirty-four khawarij belonging to Indian-proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij were killed in multiple engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The security forces, per the ISPR, conducted intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and Bannu districts of the province. The first operation, it said, was carried out in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan district. “During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, eighteen khawarij were sent to hell,” it said. According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in the South Waziristan district, during which eight more terrorists were neutralised following an intense exchange of fire with the security forces. “In [the] third encounter, [which] took place in [the] Bannu district, own troops successfully neutralised eight more khawarij .” The ISPR added that sanitisation operations were being carried out in the said areas “to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji ”. It further said that a “relentless counterterrorism campaign under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam — as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan (NAP) —  by security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) of Pakistan, will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.” President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement, lauded the armed forces and security agencies for successfully carrying out the counterterrorism operations, saying that the “timely actions of the security forces have improved the peace and stability situation in the country.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces for “thwarting the nefarious plans of the terrorists with their professional expertise.” In a statement, he said that all possible measures will be taken for the safety of the Pakistani people and the country’s integrity. “The counter-terrorism campaign will continue with full vigour until the complete eradication of the menace of terrorism from the country,” he said. Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel. Last week, ISPR Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that as of September 15, a total of 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025. During these operations, 970 terrorists were killed, while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred. He added that in 2024, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP during which 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians lost their lives. Lt Gen Chaudhry attributed the surge in terrorist incidents across the country to several factors, including the non-implementation of the NAP, the politicisation of counterterrorism efforts, India’s use of Afghanistan as a “ base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the supply of modern weapons to militants in Afghanistan, and a “terrorism-crime nexus” that he said enjoyed “complete local and political backing.” On October 8, security forces neutralised 19 “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an operation in KP’s Orakzai district, according to the ISPR. However, eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred . Additional reporting by Nadir Guramani.",

      "summary_orig": "China, Saudi Arabia, and Iran on Thursday welcomed Pakistan and  Afghanistan’s agreement to a 48-hour ceasefire after the two neighbours witnessed a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict. China’s foreign ministry said today it supported countries in exercising restraint and realising a full and lasting ceasefire. “China stands ready to continue to play a constructive role for continued improvement in the two countries’ relations, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, told a regular press briefing. Iran also welcomed the ceasefire between its eastern neighbours, urging dialogue and diplomacy after days of deadly clashes. In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei expressed concern over civilian casualties and called for stronger regional cooperation to combat terrorism, while reaffirming Tehran’s readiness “to assist in any effort to maintain calm and reduce tensions between the two neighbouring Muslim countries”. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar held a telephonic conversation with his Saudi Arabian counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, and held a discussion regarding the matter. According to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO), “H.H. Prince Faisal appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to peace and security in the region and emphasised the importance of collective efforts for stability.” Per the statement, FM Dar “expressed gratitude for the Kingdom’s continued support” and also reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Saudi Arabia to further strengthen cooperation on regional and international issues. Following the announcement of the ceasefire, Dar also received a message from Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, who commended Pakistan’s “constructive engagement” in promoting regional peace. On Wednesday, the Foreign Office (FO) said that a temporary ceasefire had been agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid recent border hostilities between the two countries. “A temporary ceasefire has been decided between the Pakistani government and the Afghan Taliban regime, with the mutual consent of both parties, for the next 48 hours from 6pm today, at the request of the Taliban. “During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the FO said. Taliban regime spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said on X that Afghan forces were instructed to respect the ceasefire, “unless any aggression takes place”. Pakistani officials on the northern and southern border with Afghanistan told AFP that “no violence was reported overnight, and the ceasefire remains in effect”. Separately, United Nations rights chief Volker Turk welcomed the ceasefire and appealed to “both parties to prevent any further harm to civilians & commit to a lasting ceasefire,“ according to AFP . The announcement came after the Pakistan armed forces conducted “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and capital Kabul, state media PTV reported. Earlier in the day, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said security forces repulsed a separate attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 of their members. It said Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said. The fighting was the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, following an incident in Kurram and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations. Twenty-three Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 were injured in the incident that began with Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border, ISPR said. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself against terrorist groups such as the TTP. Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan; however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries, and the ties seem to have nose-dived with the recent increase in hostilities at the border.",
