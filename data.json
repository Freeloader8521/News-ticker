      "summary_orig": "The opposition alliance, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), on Saturday announced a nationwide protest movement against the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, urging the people to take a stand against the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution. Earlier today, after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice. The TTAP is a coalition of six opposition parties and was formed last year. Earlier in July, it formalised its organisational structure, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests. Pashtunkhawa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, in a video statement, said the protest movement would begin from November 9 (Sunday). Abbas said that democratic institutions in the country have been “paralysed” and the “nation must step up”. Lamenting the proposed changes, he said the government was given even more power through “to the powerful”. “In this hour, it is the responsibility of the people of Pakistan to take a stand and speak against against such an extremely dark and extremely dangerous constitutional amendment, which is the 27th (amendment). Leader of the opposition-designate Achakzai said the alliance, through the protest movement, will show that the “will of the people” of Pakistan will be the final decision. “I have given an oath, at least on five different occasions, that I will safeguard the Constitution. Our parliament is attacking our Constitution,” said the PkMAP leader. He added that as the parliament is representative of the people, the opposition alliance is approaching the masses directly. “The way they are attacking the parliament, and the manner in which they are shaking the foundations of the Constitution and Pakistan, we are left with no other option.” More to follow",

      "summary_orig": "The United States and Pakistan early on Saturday reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries, with Islamabad’s envoy describing it as an effort to build an “economically entrenched strategic partnership“. The development came as S. Paul Kapur — who assumed charge as the US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs on October 22 — met Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh at the State Department for what was described as a cordial and forward-looking exchange. Ambassador Sheikh said the two sides explored practical ways to translate recent high-level political resolve into concrete cooperation. “We discussed the ways and means of translating the resolve — expressed at the leadership level — of developing Pakistan–US ties into an economically entrenched strategic partnership, through sustained engagement in multiple domains of mutual interest,” he said in a post on social media platform X. Meanwhile, Kapur said it was a “pleasure” to meet the Pakistani envoy. “We discussed ways to advance the US-Pakistan relationship and make our countries more prosperous and secure,” he said in a post on X. Kapur’s meeting with Ambassador Sheikh comes as Washington and Islamabad recalibrate their relations under US President Donald Trump’s second administration. After years of uneven engagement and recurring mistrust, both sides are now emphasising economic cooperation alongside traditional security ties. In recent months, US officials have pointed to Pakistan’s potential role in regional stability and its capacity to contribute to economic and energy initiatives in South and Central Asia. The Trump administration has also encouraged American firms to explore investment opportunities in Pakistan’s infrastructure, minerals , and technology sectors. For Islamabad, the new tone in Washington offers an opportunity to diversify its partnership with the US, while the Trump administration appears keen to reduce Pakistan’s overreliance on China. Officials in both capitals say they want to anchor the relationship in trade, investment, and long-term development — not merely in aid or counterterrorism cooperation. Late last month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the US sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan, but added that the recent strengthening of ties between the two countries did not come at the expense of Washington’s relationship with New Delhi. In September, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also met with Trump in the Oval Office, where they discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters. Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was also present during the meeting. Trump’s South Asia narrative Trump has continued to highlight his role in what he calls the prevention of a nuclear war in South Asia following the brief but intense military conflict between India and Pakistan earlier this year in May. During several public remarks, he has claimed that his administration’s swift diplomatic engagement “ stopped a nuclear conflict ” after the two neighbours exchanged air strikes , and that “eight planes were shot down“ during the clashes. While New Delhi has not confirmed Trump’s account, his repeated references to that episode reflect Washington’s renewed interest in South Asian stability — and the value it assigns to maintaining direct communication with both capitals. Despite the fresh tone, the relationship needs greater effort to sustain its current momentum. Washington continues to view Pakistan through a regional lens — balancing its strategic interests between India and China — while Islamabad seeks broader recognition of its economic and geopolitical relevance. Analysts note that although the two countries are again speaking of a “strategic partnership“, much will depend on how the rhetoric translates into measurable progress. Both sides must still bridge differences over regional security, trade access, and Pakistan’s deepening engagement with China. As one observer in Washington noted, “It’s an encouraging start — but what matters now is whether this goodwill can evolve into a sustained, structured partnership.”",

      "title_orig": "Saim, Abrar star as Pakistan seal historic home series victory against South Africa",
      "summary_orig": "A capacity crowd at the Iqbal Stadium got what it so desperately wanted: flowing strokes off the bat of Babar Azam. Normally, home supporters would’ve quietened at seeing Fakhar Zaman cleaned up early on in a small chase – potentially a harbinger of things to come; perhaps an all too familiar collapse in the offing. But here on Saturday night, there were loud roars with chants of “Babar” echoing across the venue with Pakistan’s batting superstar set to come next. Babar didn’t disappoint, dispatching the South African bowlers with his trademark elan, and alongside Saim Ayub set Pakistan on their way to a rousing seven-wicket victory that sealed the three-match One-day International series 2-1 in their favour. The venue had gone silent after Babar’s departure in the 11th over, disappointment filling the air that they weren’t able to see more of him when he was looking close to his best, run out for 27 after stroking five crisp fours. But they soon found their voice as Saim tore into the South African attack with a 70-ball 77 that featured 11 fours and a six and although he fell with Pakistan nearing victory, Mohammad Rizwan (32 not out) took them through with Salman Ali Agha hitting the winning boundary. The foundation for Pakistan’s victory, under new skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi for this series, had been laid by the spinners as the visitors were bundled out for 143 in 37.5 overs. South Africa captain Matthew Breetzke had elected to bat and his side were coasting smoothly with openers Quinton de Kock (53) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (39) well set until their lineup collapsed in the face of spin. Salman (2-18) provided the first two wickets before Mohammad Nawaz (2-31) followed with the big dismissal of De Kock until Abrar Ahmed (4-27) ran through South Africa’s spine and Pakistan eventually secured their first-ever ODI series triumph at home against their opponents. “The credit goes to the players,” reflected Shaheen at the post-match ceremony. “We didn’t get much help in the first five or six overs but when the spinners came in, they made it really tough for them.” On a sun-kissed afternoon, the 72-run opening stand between Pretorius and De Kock ended after the former, who had hit four fours and a six, was caught at long-off by Babar and Salman struck again four overs later when Tony de Zorzi chipped him to the cover fielder. De Kock, whose splendid century in the second game had helped South Africa level the series, completed his half century off 68 deliveries with his sixth four, a sweep of Nawaz, only to be trapped lbw by the spinner two deliveries later. The left-hander also hit a six. South Africa then slipped from 106-2 to 109-4 with player-of-the-match Abrar cleaning up debutant Rubin Hermann on the first ball of the 26th over. Bails were flying once again, twice off two balls, two overs later as Abrar worked his magic. First Donovan Ferreira was bowled round his legs before a googly that stayed low knocked back Corbin Bosch’s off-stump. Pakistan had South Africa on the ropes with Breetzke (16) running out of partners quick and fast as Nawaz had Bjorn Fortuin lbw, and the writing was on the wall for the Proteas when their skipper was caught behind off Abrar, who recorded his career-best ODI figures, as they slipped to 130-8. Pakistan captain Shaheen (2-18) then cleaned up the tail with two wickets in two balls – both of them bowled, including the wicket of Nqabayomzi Peter who made a defiant 16. “Batting conditions were pretty tough and we didn’t get enough runs and they batted freely because of that,” rued De Kock, who was named player-of-the-series. The sentiment was echoed by Breetzke. “Not enough runs… we were probably looking at 250. It was tough conditions and unfortunately we lost too many wickets there.” Nandre Burger’s dismissal of Fakhar, knocking his stumps through the gate, brought Babar to the crease and after a quiet opening couple of overs, the right-hander, who had scores of seven and 11 in the opening two matches, got Pakistan off the mark in the third which ended with a boundary of Saim’s bat – a punch through the covers. A deft touch of Lundi Ngidi then brought Babar’s first boundary before Saim flicked away the pacer for four. Babar then pulled Burger away for four before treating the crowd to two delightful boundaries off Ngidi in the sixth over. Boundaries were flowing for Pakistan – three of them coming off the eighth over off Bosch, all of them from Saim with the first a six. At the other end, Babar showed his elegance with a scrumptious cover drive for four as Pakistan reached 59-1 after the first 10. Babar would soon be run out, but Saim took over and was unrelenting. He reached his 50 of just 39 balls with his eighth four, pulling away Burger. Fortuin and Ferreira were then swept for boundaries before the latter was hit for a one-bounce four. Saim fell when he couldn’t get the distance off Fortuin but by then the job was done with Rizwan closing it out. Rizwan, who was replaced by Shaheen as skipper ahead of the series, hit three fours and a six – over midwicket – to leave Pakistan four runs away and Salman finished it off with 24.5 overs to spare.",

      "summary_orig": "The sense of fear is palpable in parts of northern Japan, where some locals have fastened bells to their bags hoping the noise will keep bears away, while signs warn people to be on guard. The animals have killed a record 13 across the country since April, with a steady flow of reports of bears entering homes, roaming near schools and rampaging in supermarkets. “We hear news almost every day about people being attacked or injured,” said 28-year-old Kakeru Matsuhashi, a traditional “Matagi” hunter, as he walked through a forest clutching a knife. “It’s becoming something that feels personal, and it’s simply frightening,” he added in the northern prefecture of Akita, an area hit by a series of attacks. This year, the number of fatalities is double the previous record of 2023-24, with five months of the fiscal year still to go. Data is patchy from certain regions, but in recent years, Japan has seen among the highest number of fatal attacks globally. Bells used for warning bears of approaching hikers are seen at a store in Hanamaki, Iwate prefecture on October 24, 2025. — AFP Keiji Minatoya, also from Akita, knows this too well — a bear leapt from his garage, pinned him to the ground and sank its teeth into his face in 2023. “I was thinking: ‘This is how I die’”, said 68-year-old Minatoya, who managed to escape and take refuge inside his home. The government is now scrambling to deal with the surge in attacks , which scientists say is being driven by a fast-growing bear population combined with this year’s bad acorn harvest, leaving some mountains “overcrowded” with hungry bears. Troops have been deployed to provide logistical help for trapping and hunting bears, while riot police will be allowed to use rifles to shoot the animals, which can weigh half a tonne and outrun a human. The victims include a 67-year-old man in Iwate, a region next to Akita, whose body was found outside his home, with animal bite marks and scars. Hunters were called to the scene and shot a bear near the house. Also in Iwate, a 60-year-old man is thought to have been attacked while cleaning an outdoor bath at a remote hot spring resort. His body was discovered in nearby woods. Official data show the number of wounded is also on course to be a record, tallying over 100 people in the six months to September. Bear spray is seen at a store in Hanamaki, Iwate prefecture on October 24, 2025. ‘Overcrowded’ with bears A major issue is the expanding bear population, which is growing fast due to an abundance of food — including acorns, deer and boars — under the influence of a warming climate, experts say. Japan’s brown bear population has doubled in three decades, and now stands at around 12,000, while the number of Asian black bears has climbed on the country’s main Honshu island, reaching 42,000, according to a recent government report. Some mountains have become “overcrowded”, according to Naoki Ohnishi, researcher at the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute. “Put simply, the size of the bear population has gone beyond the capacity of the mountains to hold them,” he said. Although rising temperatures have led to more frequent bumper crops of acorns, the nuts still produce good and bad harvests every two to five years as part of their normal crop cycle. This year, as well as in 2023 — the year Minatoya was attacked — there is a poor supply. While most bears still stay in the mountains, recent bad harvests have led some — together with their cubs — to wander into towns to look for food, said Shinsuke Koike, professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. With exposure to humans, cubs in particular become less fearful and develop a taste for farmed produce and common fruits such as persimmon, Koike added. Steady rural depopulation due to a chronically low birthrate and young people moving to cities has also reduced the human presence at the edges of forests and mountains, blurring the traditional boundaries between people and bears. “Bear habitats inched closer to human habitats in 2023,” Ohnishi said. “This year, they are coming a step further because they are starting from where they left off.” ‘Witnessing a disaster’ Hajime Nakae, professor of emergency and critical medicine at the Akita University Hospital, said the frequent bear sightings made him feel like he was “living inside … a safari park for bears”. The doctor, who has treated bear injuries for three decades, explained the nature of wounds was changing as bears become less afraid of humans. In encounters years ago, a startled bear may have struck a human in the face before fleeing but now “they charge at you from about 10 metres and then leap at you”. He said that without meaningful intervention he expected bear injuries to increase and spread to other parts of the nation, adding: “We are witnessing a disaster”. “Thorough culling” to reduce the number of bears is the only effective way to reduce the risk for local people, researcher Ohnishi said. Last year, the government added bears to the list of animals subject to population control, reversing protection that had helped bears thrive. But rural resources are stretched thin and the number of hunters is less than half of what it was in 1980. As of 2020, the latest statistics available, there were around 220,000, mostly in their 60s or older. Japan culled more than 9,000 bears in 2023-2024, and over 4,200 between April to September this year. Akita has alone culled over 1,000 so far. In the immediate future, Japan’s worries should ease, if only temporarily.\nExperts Koike and Ohnishi said hibernation patterns had not shifted and the bears would soon go to sleep for the winter.

He said that without meaningful intervention he expected bear injuries to increase and spread to other parts of the nation, adding: “We are witnessing a disaster”. “Thorough culling” to reduce the number of bears is the only effective way to reduce the risk for local people, researcher Ohnishi said. Last year, the government added bears to the list of animals subject to population control, reversing protection that had helped bears thrive. But rural resources are stretched thin and the number of hunters is less than half of what it was in 1980. As of 2020, the latest statistics available, there were around 220,000, mostly in their 60s or older. Japan culled more than 9,000 bears in 2023-2024, and over 4,200 between April to September this year. Akita has alone culled over 1,000 so far. In the immediate future, Japan’s worries should ease, if only temporarily.\nExperts Koike and Ohnishi said hibernation patterns had not shifted and the bears would soon go to sleep for the winter.

      "summary": "The sense of fear is palpable in parts of northern Japan, where some locals have fastened bells to their bags hoping the noise will keep bears away, while signs warn people to be on guard. The animals have killed a record 13 across the country since April, with a steady flow of reports of bears entering homes, roaming near schools and rampaging in supermarkets. “We hear news almost every day about people being attacked or injured,” said 28-year-old Kakeru Matsuhashi, a traditional “Matagi” hunter, as he walked through a forest clutching a knife. “It’s becoming something that feels personal, and it’s simply frightening,” he added in the northern prefecture of Akita, an area hit by a series of attacks. This year, the number of fatalities is double the previous record of 2023-24, with five months of the fiscal year still to go. Data is patchy from certain regions, but in recent years, Japan has seen among the highest number of fatal attacks globally. Bells used for warning bears of approaching hikers are seen at a store in Hanamaki, Iwate prefecture on October 24, 2025. — AFP Keiji Minatoya, also from Akita, knows this too well — a bear leapt from his garage, pinned him to the ground and sank its teeth into his face in 2023. “I was thinking: ‘This is how I die’”, said 68-year-old Minatoya, who managed to escape and take refuge inside his home. The government is now scrambling to deal with the surge in attacks , which scientists say is being driven by a fast-growing bear population combined with this year’s bad acorn harvest, leaving some mountains “overcrowded” with hungry bears. Troops have been deployed to provide logistical help for trapping and hunting bears, while riot police will be allowed to use rifles to shoot the animals, which can weigh half a tonne and outrun a human. The victims include a 67-year-old man in Iwate, a region next to Akita, whose body was found outside his home, with animal bite marks and scars. Hunters were called to the scene and shot a bear near the house. Also in Iwate, a 60-year-old man is thought to have been attacked while cleaning an outdoor bath at a remote hot spring resort. His body was discovered in nearby woods. Official data show the number of wounded is also on course to be a record, tallying over 100 people in the six months to September. Bear spray is seen at a store in Hanamaki, Iwate prefecture on October 24, 2025. ‘Overcrowded’ with bears A major issue is the expanding bear population, which is growing fast due to an abundance of food — including acorns, deer and boars — under the influence of a warming climate, experts say. Japan’s brown bear population has doubled in three decades, and now stands at around 12,000, while the number of Asian black bears has climbed on the country’s main Honshu island, reaching 42,000, according to a recent government report. Some mountains have become “overcrowded”, according to Naoki Ohnishi, researcher at the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute. “Put simply, the size of the bear population has gone beyond the capacity of the mountains to hold them,” he said. Although rising temperatures have led to more frequent bumper crops of acorns, the nuts still produce good and bad harvests every two to five years as part of their normal crop cycle. This year, as well as in 2023 — the year Minatoya was attacked — there is a poor supply. While most bears still stay in the mountains, recent bad harvests have led some — together with their cubs — to wander into towns to look for food, said Shinsuke Koike, professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. With exposure to humans, cubs in particular become less fearful and develop a taste for farmed produce and common fruits such as persimmon, Koike added. Steady rural depopulation due to a chronically low birthrate and young people moving to cities has also reduced the human presence at the edges of forests and mountains, blurring the traditional boundaries between people and bears. “Bear habitats inched closer to human habitats in 2023,” Ohnishi said. “This year, they are coming a step further because they are starting from where they left off.” ‘Witnessing a disaster’ Hajime Nakae, professor of emergency and critical medicine at the Akita University Hospital, said the frequent bear sightings made him feel like he was “living inside … a safari park for bears”. The doctor, who has treated bear injuries for three decades, explained the nature of wounds was changing as bears become less afraid of humans. In encounters years ago, a startled bear may have struck a human in the face before fleeing but now “they charge at you from about 10 metres and then leap at you”.

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that the talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan on addressing cross-border terrorism are “over” and have “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides, adding that the ceasefire stands for the time being. “Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath ’. Earlier, officials and sources said the talks stalled without any agreement. “The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” a senior security source told reporters, confirming that the third round of discussions — which had began on Thursday in the Turkish capital — had hit an impasse. The defence minister added that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and that they were not willing to sign a written agreement. “They said that they would only respect the verbal agreement, but there is no room to do that.” Asif elaborated that during the earlier rounds, the negotiators urged for another round. “Even after the talks in Istanbul failed, they committed that they would participate in the next round.” “Our returning empty-handed reinforces a lack of faith in Afghanistan. The situation, God forbid if it flares up, if there are attacks on us from their soil, then we will respond depending on the gravity of the situation,” said the defence minister. Asif clarified that the ceasefire stands for the time being, but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”. “If they have put forward any unacceptable demand, then it is a means of escape, since they knew they would be unsuccessful, they can turn around and say that Pakistan denied our demands,” added the minister. He reiterated that Pakistan has one main demand: the cessation of attacks from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, the Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid held Islamabad responsible for the deadlock in the talks, saying that the Pakistani delegation’s “irresponsible and uncooperative spirit” led to the breakdown. Atmosphere described as ‘not positive’ Pakistan’s delegation, led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lieutenant General Asim Malik, included senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials. The Afghan Taliban side was headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and included Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib. The dialogue process was launched after border clashes in early October that left several soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Following those clashes, Turkiye and Qatar stepped in to mediate. The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire , while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks. The latest round was aimed at finalising the modalities of that verification and monitoring mechanism. Reports from Istanbul suggested that the Pakistani delegation left for the airport after the talks broke down. There was no direct meeting between the two delegations on Friday. The sides had met face to face in the presence of Qatari and Turkish mediators the previous day. DG ISI and some members of the Pakistan delegation have left Istanbul, but the Pakistani side is still not ruling out resumption of the process. A source said an attempt will be made to break the deadlock. It is believed that some senior officials stayed behind to work with the mediators. For most of Friday, mediators engaged the Afghan delegation separately, relaying Pakistan’s concerns and demands. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) spokesman, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, told reporters in Islamabad that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case in a “comprehensive and evidence-based manner”. “The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified, and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism,” Andrabi said. “They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point.” Afghan negotiators, meanwhile, claimed that their own proposals were “logical and easily achievable” for Pakistan but described Islamabad’s demands as “unrealistic and aggressive,” suggesting they might serve as a pretext to create further complications. According to a source familiar with the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed that “it is up to Pakistan’s own calculations to deal with the situation.” A source in Istanbul described the late-evening atmosphere at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel, where the talks were held, as “not positive.” Information Minister Ata Tarar, who had declared a similar deadlock at the previous round before mediators salvaged a statement, said the “onus lies on Afghanistan to fulfill its long-standing international, regional, and bilateral pledges regarding control of terrorism — in which so far they have failed.” “Pakistan shall continue to exercise all options necessary to safeguard the security of its people and its sovereignty,” Tarar said, echoing the Foreign Office spokesman’s earlier warning about Islamabad’s response in case of failure of the talks. “All I can say is that, in any eventuality, we will protect the lives of our people and make sure that our civilians, our military forces, and our law enforcement agencies on the border are not killed by attacks emanating from Afghanistan,” Andrabi said. Border clashes and talks Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021 . The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks began yesterday , surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire. Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing. Additional input from Tahir Khan",

In the Black Sea, Ukraine achieved an extraordinary military success by inflicting a “functional defeat” on Russia’s naval fleet using swarms of skilfully targeted sea drones. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "• Okays Rs960bn sovereign guarantee for Rs1.225tr loans from local banks • Says remittance incentives to be phased out with caution • Gas allocated to fertiliser sector; LNG cost adjustments cleared for tariffs ISLAMABAD: The Econo­mic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Fri­day approved an inter-corporate circular debt settlement plan, including tariff rationalisation for all six operational nuclear power plants in line with other power producers, thus also paving the way to wind up Power Holding Ltd (PHL), a shell company created to park old circular debt. The meeting of the ECC, pre­­sided over by Finance Mi­­nister Muhammad Aurangzeb, also approved about Rs660 billion in sovereign guarantees for Rs1.225 trillion in commercial loans from local banks for circular debt settlement and the diversion of gas for fertiliser plants. As finalised by the military-led task force on power sector reforms in line with similar previous renegotiations with private and government-ow­ned power plants earlier this year, the ECC approved a sum­mary of the Power Divi­sion for “rationalisation of tariffs and payment adjustments for nuclear power plants (NPPs), government-owned power plants (GPPs), OGDCL and SNGPL”, a statement said. The ECC approved the memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and authorised the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the Power Division “to execute negotiated settlement agreements based on these MoUs”. The meeting also authorised the CPPA and the commission to amend the relevant power purchase agreements of four key nuclear power plants, including four at Chashma (C1 to C4) and two at Karachi (K2 and K3), having a total capacity of about 3,500 megawatts. The federal government would take over some of their financial contractual obligations, for which the ECC also approved a set of facilitation measures. Based on this, the PAEC will file separate tariff petitions for these six plants, in line with the debt adjustments agreed in the negotiated settlement agreements. In most cases, the government has guaranteed some foreign supplier credits, while in other cases, it has extended cash development loans and charged significantly higher interest rates than the original borrowing cost. The meeting also authorised the CPPA to pay outstanding liabilities of GPPs from funds available under the circular debt financing facility, worth Rs1.225tr, recently contracted with local banks. The ECC approved PHL loan repayment of Rs23.6bn and a waiver of Rs119.5bn on late-payment interest receivables from the LNG-based GPPs at Bhikki, Balloki and Haveli Bahadur Shah. It also approved payment of the rem­aining balance due to OGDCL via the two Uch power plants of over 1,000MW combined. The ECC also approved policy guidelines to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority un­­der Section 21 of the Ogra Ord­­inance, enabling the inc­or­­poration of Rs22bn appro­ved by the federal cabinet to include LNG cost of supply in the consumer tariff, subject to verification by auditors. The Ministry of Finance said the decision would enh­ance financial sustainability, strea­mline payments, and redu­­ce overall costs in the power sector. Circular debt financing The ECC approved another summary of the Power Divi­sion for the issuance of a government guarantee amounting to Rs659.67bn for circular debt financing of Rs1.225tr. The guarantee is intended for the settlement of Power Holding Limited’s debt and overdue payments to independent power producers. It authorised the Finance Division to issue a “letter of comfort”, a document that as­­su­­res one party to another ab­­out a potential or existing busi­­ness or financial obligation. The Power Division was directed to report back to the ECC on the timeframe for PHL’s closure following the settlement of the debt issue. The meeting also decided in principle to phase out incentive schemes for banks and exchange companies for channelling home remittances, su­­bject to an appropriate timi­ng, given the State Bank of Pakis­tan’s warning that imme­diate action would severely affect healthy inflows. The ECC also approved a proposal from the Ministry of National Food Security and Re­­­search to reallocate funds within the division. The ap­­p­r­oval allows the transfer of res­ources from the Inter-Provi­n­c­i­­al Coordination Division thr­ou­­gh a technical supplementary grant to support ongoing agricultural research initiatives. A summary from the Minis­try of Maritime Affairs on utilising Pakistan International Bulk Terminal at Port Qasim for handling and exporting copper-gold and other mineral commodities was deferred, with instructions to resubmit a clearer framework after stakeholder consultation. The Ministry of Interior was granted Rs960 million to ensure timely disbursements to the transferred staff of the Pak Public Works Department for October 2025 to June 2026. On a Petroleum Division proposal, the ECC approved allocation of about 220m cubic feet of gas from the Ghazij and Shawal fields, diversion from decommissioned/auctioned older plants, and pricing of Mari field gas to fertiliser units to ensure adequate, affordable fertiliser supplies on a structural basis.
