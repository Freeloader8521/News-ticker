      "summary_orig": "• Israel offers one-way exit; Egypt rejects deal, demands two-way access for aid and people • More than 16,500 patients in Gaza need life-saving care; aid groups say hundreds have already died waiting • Tel Aviv violates truce again as its military strikes, kills two in Zeitoun CAIRO: Israel announced on Wednesday it would unilaterally open the Rafah crossing to allow residents to flee the Gaza Strip, a move swiftly rejected by Egypt as Cairo insisted on lifting the blockade in both directions to relieve the besieged Palestinian territory. The clash over the crossing underscores the desperate reality for Gaza’s population, who have been trapped under an intensifying siege since the Israeli military seized the Palestinian side of the terminal in May 2024. While Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said the crossing would open in the “coming days” exclusively for the exit of residents, Egypt denied any such agreement exists, refusing to facilitate what critics fear is the forced displacement of Palestinians. “If an agreement is reached to open the crossing, it will be in both directions, to enter and exit the Gaza Strip,” Egypt’s State Information Service said in a statement, insisting on adherence to the terms of the US-brokered peace plan which mandates full humanitarian access. The Rafah crossing, the only vital artery to the outside world for the residents of Gaza not controlled directly by Israel, has been shuttered for months, strangling the flow of life-saving aid. COGAT claimed the operation would be supervised by an EU Border Assistance Mission, mirroring a mechanism from a brief truce in early 2025. However, European diplomatic sources indicated that previous preparations to open the crossing were delayed, prolonging the suffering of civilians. While COGAT claimed convoys are passing through the nearby Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, humanitarian actors on the ground described the aid volume as pitifully inadequate compared to the scale of devastation. UN sources in Cairo revealed that while agreements promised 600 trucks daily, Israeli restrictions have kept that number at just over 100. “The vast majority of cargo entering is food, while essential goods like tents and medical equipment are still denied or face significant delays,” the UN sources said. Residents stranded For the Palestinians inside Gaza, the continued closure of the territory’s main gateway is a death sentence, particularly for the sick and wounded. At least 16,500 patients in the war-ravaged enclave urgently require medical care outside the strip, according to the United Nations. Since the Israeli military seized control of the border zone and shut down movement, the vast majority of these patients have been left stranded without access to specialised treatment. The situation has drawn pleas from medical officials who witness preventable deaths daily. Hani Isleem, an official with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), warned that the current trickle of medical evacuations is negligible. “The need is really huge,” Isleem said. He noted that the numbers accepted by foreign countries so far remain “just a drop in the ocean.” The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 8,000 patients have been evacuated since Oct 2023, but thousands more remain trapped. Isleem said the official count of 16,500 seeking treatment is likely a severe underestimate, placing the true figure three to four times higher. More than 900 people have died while waiting for evacuations since the war began, a statistic Isleem called a conservative estimate. Another truce violation Beyond the humanitarian catastrophe, the ceasefire remains fragile as bloodshed continues. On Wednesday, health officials at Al-Ahli Hospital reported that two Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire in the Zeitoun suburb of Gaza City. Diplomatic efforts are currently stalled over Israel’s refusal to fully reopen the border until the bodies of deceased prisoners are returned. Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad have already released 20 living prisoners and 26 bodies in exchange for roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad said it handed over a body to the Red Cross, found during a search in northern Gaza. The refusal to open the border for incoming aid constitutes a violation of the framework envisioned to end the conflict. Published in Dawn, December 4th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab visited the grieving family of a three-year-old boy who fell into an open manhole and drowned in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Wednesday night, assuring them of an impartial inquiry and action against those found negligent. The body of the boy, who drowned in an open manhole near Nipa in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night, was found on Monday, around 15 hours after the incident occurred. The child’s tragic death, particularly the lack of cooperation from relevant civic agencies to launch an immediate search, had angered relatives and area residents, who staged a protest on University Road on Sunday night and again during the day on Monday. On Tuesday, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials. A post by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation on X on Wednesday night said the mayor visited the boy’s family and extended his condolences. “An impartial inquiry will be conducted, and anyone found negligent will face action. We will take structured measures to prevent such incidents in the future,” the post quoted the mayor as saying. Addressing a press conference after meeting the family, the mayor termed the incident a “painful, shameful loss” and said he had no words to describe it adequately. “I say I seek forgiveness, it was my fault … I believe as mayor I was not successful, for which I am expressing my remorse.” He said the response by the government, administration and authorities should be “prompt and appropriate” to prevent anyone else falling victim to the same circumstances in the future. Wahab added he did not want to get bogged down in a “blame game” and said he accepted responsibility, since bickering over the matter would not solve the issue. The mayor further stated that he was relaying the sentiment from the top level of the provincial government and the PPP leadership that the reasons and issues that led to the death of the toddler would no longer be tolerated, and that action was now being taken. KMC report attributes death to ‘carelessness’ of BRT, department store officials A report by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) on the incident attributed the incident to the “carelessness” of officials from the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service and a department store adjacent to where the incident took place, it emerged earlier today. The report by the KMC, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said that the department had received instructions from the Karachi mayor and the municipal commissioner to initiate an operation for recovering the body of the child from the drain located in front of Chase Departmental Store in Nipa. It said that following the retrieval of the child’s body, “the site was meticulously inspected to ascertain the exact cause of the drowning”. According to the report, the inspection found the ongoing BRT construction work at the location to be a “significant contributing factor”. “Based on reports from the concerned inspector and area residents, the BRT construction has resulted in the severe damage and disruption of the entire drainage system, which runs from Nipa towards Aziz Bhatti Park,” it said. “It was observed that, at most locations, the drains were covered with temporary two-by-two-foot square covers. Unfortunately, one of these covers was reportedly left open in front of the Chase Departmental Store,” it said. “It is pertinent to mention that the procedure of covering cleaning pits with two-by-two-foot square covers from Nipa to Aziz Bhatti Park road is a non-standard practice never implemented by KMC at any location,” it said. It further stressed that BRT service officials had failed to formally notify or obtain clearance from KMC before carrying out excavation work. “These pits were excavated by BRT officials and subsequently paved over during road construction,” the report said. In light of those facts, the report concluded that the incident occurred due to the “carelessness of both the concerned BRT officials and the management of Chase Departmental Store” as “neither took adequate measures to secure the open drain”. It should be mentioned that the construction of the BRT’s Red Line project has turned the city’s major arteries, including one of the busiest thoroughfares, University Road, into construction zones. The report added that under the monitoring of the deputy commissioner for District East, the assistant commissioner of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, and BRT engineers, the excavated pits had been refilled to maintain the flow of traffic.",

      "title_orig": "Frustration in Indonesia as flood survivors await aid, toll crosses 700",
      "summary_orig": "Officials in Indonesia and Sri Lanka battled on Wednesday to reach survivors of deadly flooding in remote, cut-off regions as the toll in the disaster that hit four countries topped 1,500. In Indonesia, survivors expressed growing frustration about the slow pace of rescue efforts and aid delivery, as humanitarian groups warned the scale of the challenge was almost unprecedented, even in a country that has faced no shortage of natural disasters. Monsoon rains paired with two tropical storm systems dumped record deluges across Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia’s Sumatra, southern Thailand and northern Malaysia last week. In Indonesia, 770 were confirmed dead, the country’s disaster management agency said on Wednesday, revising the toll down from 812 it announced earlier in the day. Another 463 people are also missing. Information is only trickling in as many regions remain physically cut off by flood damage, isolated by electricity and communications failures, or both. “It’s very challenging logistically to respond,” said Ade Soekadis, executive director of aid group Mercy Corps Indonesia. “The extent of the damage and the size of the affected area is really huge.” The group is hoping to send hygiene equipment and water, both from Jakarta and locally. He said reports of food and water shortages were already “very concerning” and the situation will be “more problematic as time goes by”. ‘Like an earthquake’ At an evacuation centre in Pandan, 52-year-old Reinaro Waruwu told AFP he was “disappointed” in the government’s immediate response and the slow arrival of aid. “Some waited a day and night before receiving help, so they couldn’t be saved,” he said, surrounded by evacuees sitting on mats on the floor in the hall-turned-shelter. “I am frustrated, it doesn’t need to be said twice,” he added. He described the floodwaters and landslides as unprecedented. “It came like an earthquake … I thought ‘Well, if I am going to die, then so be it,’” he said, beginning to sob heavily. Traumatised, he could not even eat on arrival, and food has only been patchily available, though vegetables arriving on Tuesday offered a “semblance of hope”, he said. Nearby, Hamida Telaumbaunua, 37, described watching her entire kitchen swept away by floodwaters. “My heart … this was the first time I experienced such a flood,” she said. Her home was lost entirely, along with everything but the few possessions she took when she left. “It’s hard to think about what lies ahead. Maybe as long as we’re still here, it’s okay, but later … I don’t know what will happen.” In North Aceh, 30-year-old M. Atar said some areas were only just becoming accessible as roads were cleared. “We are in dire need of clean water. Very much in need,” he said. The weather system that hit Indonesia also brought heavy rains to Thailand, killing at least 267 people, authorities said today, and Malaysia, where two people were killed. Sri Lanka ‘open’ for tourists Though floods are common in Asia during the monsoon season, climate change is making heavy rain events more frequent because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. Warmer oceans can also turbocharge storm systems. A separate weather system, Cyclone Ditwah, brought torrential rain and deadly floods and landslides to much of Sri Lanka last week. At least 474 people were killed, and authorities have estimated the disaster’s cost at up to $7 billion. Another 356 people are unaccounted for, including in some of the hardest-hit regions that remain largely inaccessible. Officials said laws that allow a person to be declared dead only after being missing for six months could be shortened to expedite the issuance of death certificates. The government has said it will offer 25,000 rupees ($83) to families to help clean their homes. Those who lost homes will receive up to $8,000. On the outskirts of Colombo, RMV Lalith was beginning the clean-up at his two-storey home. “We managed to salvage some furniture by moving it upstairs, but the kitchen is a mess,” he told AFP , as a relative helped push mud out of the living room. People affected by floods collect their belongings from the railway tracks after drying them following Cyclone Ditwah Kandy, Sri Lanka, December 3. — Reuters Despite the disaster, the tourism-reliant country welcomed a luxury cruiseliner to Colombo port on Tuesday, authorities said. The arrival sends “a clear message to the world: Sri Lanka is safe, open, and ready to embrace visitors once again”, the country’s tourist board said. PM Shehbaz offers flood relief support to President Prabowo Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif conveyed Pakistan’s deep condolences and solidarity to Indonesia during a telephonic conversation with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. “The prime minister extended heartfelt sympathy on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan, calling the devastation a tragic human loss that Pakistan deeply mourns,” said a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office. Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering support, PM Shehbaz assured President Prabowo that the country was ready to provide all possible relief and humanitarian assistance. He offered to share Pakistan’s extensive experience in handling large-scale natural disasters, including emergency response, rehabilitation, and reconstruction efforts. Highlighting the shared vulnerability of both countries to climate-induced calamities, the premier underscored the need for stronger bilateral cooperation in disaster preparedness, crisis management and climate resilience. President Prabowo expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s message of solidarity and informed PM Shehbaz that Indonesian authorities had acted swiftly and effectively to manage the unfolding crisis. The premier said he looked forward to welcoming President Prabowo to Pakistan during his scheduled official visit next week. He noted that the visit would provide an important opportunity for both leaders to strengthen diplomatic ties and expand cooperation across all areas of mutual interest.",

      "summary_orig": "Chief of the Army (COAS) Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir expressed satisfaction on Wednesday with the “robust defence collaboration” underway between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies , with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad. In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both. A statement posted on X by state broadcaster PTV News said COAS Munir met Royal Saudi Land Forces (RSLF) Commander Lieutenant General Fahad Bin Saud Al-Johani at the General Headquarters. “COAS expressed satisfaction on robust defence collaboration between the two countries and emphasised upon the need for continued cooperation in training, capacity building, and intelligence sharing. Commander RSLF acknowledged the professionalism of Pakistan Army and appreciated the positive role played by Pakistan in regional peace and stability,” the press release said. It added that matters of mutual interest, regional security and avenues for enhanced bilateral defence cooperation were also discussed with both sides reiterating their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations. The army chief also separately met Bahrain National Guard Commander General Shaikh Mohammad Bin Isa Bin Salman Al Khalifa, with both sides reaffirming their resolve to enhance existing military-to-military ties. They also discussed matters of mutual interest, regional security, and bilateral defence cooperation. “The visiting dignitary appreciated the professionalism of Pakistan Army and acknowledged its role in regional peace and stability. COAS highlighted long-standing brotherly relations between the two nations and expressed Pakistan’s continued support for Bahrain in all domains.”",

      "summary_orig": "India is willing to amend an order requiring smartphone makers to pre-install a state-run cybersecurity app, the telecoms minister said on Wednesday, signalling a softening government stance following a backlash over surveillance fears. Earlier in the day, the main opposition party took the government to task over the issue, while newspaper editorials joined privacy advocates in denouncing the move. The government is also likely to find itself at odds with phone manufacturers. Apple does not plan to comply with the directive, sources have said. “We are ready to make changes to the order based on the feedback we receive,” Communications Minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia told lawmakers in parliament. The Indian government has confidentially ordered companies including Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi to preload new phones with an app called Sanchar Saathi, or Communication Partner, within 90 days. The government says the app only helps track and block stolen phones and prevents them from being misused. Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a notice to the parliament that the government needed to clarify the legal authority for “mandating a non-removable app” and called for the house to debate privacy and security risks. “The grave, serious and real apprehension is also that such compulsorily installed app can have a backdoor, thereby absolutely compromising the data and privacy of the user,” he added. The notice also called for the disclosure of what independent cybersecurity audits, safeguards and misuse-prevention mechanisms are in place for the app. Describing the app as a tool to combat the “serious endangerment” of cyber security, the government also ordered that the app be pushed to users via software updates for phones already sold and for manufacturers to ensure that the app is not disabled. Russian example Modi’s plan has little precedent, according to industry sources. Russia may be the only other known example. Moscow in August ordered that a state-backed messenger application called MAX, a rival to WhatsApp that critics say could be used to track users, must be pre-installed on all mobile phones and tablets. Apple will convey its concerns to New Delhi, noting that it does not follow such mandates anywhere in the world as they raise a host of privacy and security issues for the company’s iOS ecosystem, sources have said. The plan has become the story of the day on Indian prime time news, with politicians and privacy advocates sparring over its pros and cons. Major newspapers also chimed in, with The Indian Express saying the directive “raises serious apprehensions of surveillance and intrusion”. The Times of India said the government must “withdraw the order”, adding that phones “are our private space and one mandatory intrusion by govt raises fears of more in the future”. The storm of controversy marks the second major time that Modi has faced criticism over issues of privacy. In 2020, his government also came under fire for a Covid-19 contact-tracing app compulsory for use by office workers. That measure was later diluted to a request when privacy advocates protested. Downloads for the app have risen, however, with data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower showing a 13 per cent jump in daily downloads on Monday from a day earlier to 78,000.",

In 2020, his government also came under fire for a Covid-19 contact-tracing app compulsory for use by office workers. That measure was later diluted to a request when privacy advocates protested. Downloads for the app have risen, however, with data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower showing a 13 per cent jump in daily downloads on Monday from a day earlier to 78,000.",

      "summary_orig": "The search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will resume at the end of December, Malaysia’s transport ministry said on Wednesday, more than a decade after the plane disappeared. The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in one of aviation’s greatest enduring mysteries. Two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, while the others included Malaysians, Indonesians and Australians, as well as Indian, American, Dutch and French nationals. Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has not been found. Kuala Lumpur said in a statement it “wishes to update that the deep-sea search for (the) missing wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 will be resuming on 30 December 2025”. Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity will be conducting the search in a “targeted area assessed to have the highest probability of locating the aircraft”, the ministry said. The latest search in the southern Indian Ocean was suspended in April as it was “not the season”. It was conducted on the “no find, no fee” principle as Ocean Infinity’s previous search, with the government only paying out if the firm finds the aircraft. Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, led an unsuccessful hunt in 2018, before agreeing to launch a new search this year. An initial Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometres (46,300 square miles) in the Indian Ocean over three years but found hardly any trace of the plane other than a few pieces of debris. The ministry said the latest development underscores its commitment in “providing closure to the families affected by the tragedy”. Relatives of the victims had voiced hope in February that a new search could finally bring some answers. When contacted by AFP , relatives of victims were not immediately available for comment. Aviation mystery The plane’s disappearance has long been the subject of theories — ranging from the credible to outlandish — including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue. A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually. Investigators said in the 495-page report that they still did not know why the plane vanished and refused to rule out that someone other than the pilots had diverted the jet. Relatives of passengers lost on the flight have continued to demand answers from Malaysian authorities. Family members of Chinese passengers gathered in Beijing outside government offices and the Malaysian embassy in March on the 11th anniversary of the flight’s disappearance. Attendees of the gathering shouted, “Give us back our loved ones!”, with some holding placards asking, “When will the 11 years of waiting and torment end?”",

      "summary_orig": "• Pleas for FIR against mayor, KWSC, Gulshan town chairman and judicial inquiry land in courts • Parties, civil society demand mayor’s resignation • Celebrities blame failed civic management for tragedy KARACHI: The widespread outrage that the tragic death of a child, who drowned in an open manhole in Gulshan-i-Iqbal near Nipa, ignited has intensified, with political parties, civil society, and celebrities demanding answers, asking: “Who is responsible for this?” Three-year-old Ibrahim fell in an uncovered manhole in front of a departmental store near Nipa on Sunday evening. The body was recovered after a 15-hour-long rescue operation on Monday. By Tuesday evening, the manhole and the connected drain that had been dug up by rescuers to retrieve the body remained open, posing a threat to people. Many parties held protests against the provincial administration on Tuesday and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign. Pleas for FIR against mayor, KWSC, Gulshan town chairman and judicial inquiry land in courts A lawyer moved a sessions court seeking registration of a case against the mayor, Gulshan Town chairman, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) and Red Line contractor over their alleged negligence. Another lawyer filed a petition before the Sindh High Court for a judicial inquiry. Protests continue The Jamaat-i-Islami on Tuesday staged a protest near Nipa against Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab and the Sindh government of Pakistan People Party (PPP) over the incident that claimed the life of the three-year-old a day earlier. The protesters carrying placards and banners chanted slogans against the PPP government and demanded the mayor’s resignation. Senior party leader and opposition leader in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin said Karachi had been “bleeding for long” and another innocent life had now been lost. Those responsible, directly or indirectly, should be nominated in the FIR, he said, urging the Sindh chief minister to take serious action. Also on Tuesday, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders visited the area near Nipa and pointed out that the manhole was yet to be covered. They strongly condemned the inaction of the PPP-led provincial set-up and municipal authorities and demanded that lids be placed on all uncovered gutters across the metropolis. Meanwhile, the Karachi Restoration Movement (KRM) demanded that an FIR for the alleged killing of Ibrahim be registered against the mayor. Speaking at a press conference outside the KMC head office, KRM leaders said that as mayor — the “custodian and father of the city” — he must be held responsible. They announced that their protest camps would continue across the city in mourning for Ibrahim and other children who had died in similar incidents, and that their campaign would continue until a case is registered and the mayor resigns. Lawyers move courts A lawyer on Tuesday filed an application before a sessions court seeking registration of a case against the mayor, Gulshan town chairman, KWSC and the contractor of Red Line project over their alleged negligence. Applicant Advocate Sheikh Saqib Ahmed filed the application under Section 22-A of the Criminal Procedure Code and submitted that the tragic death of the child was not an isolated incident, as at least 23 people have lost their lives in Karachi in 2025 due to falling into open manholes. He stated that after incident, he approached the Aziz Bhatti SHO for lodging an FIR under Section 322 (qatl-e-bis-sabab) of the Pakistan Penal Code against the proposed accused persons but the police refused to register the case. Meanwhile, another lawyer filed a petition in the Sindh High Court seeking an independent judicial inquiry into the same incident by a district and sessions judge. Petitioner Gulzar Nigar also sought directives for the mayor and all 25 town chairmen to file detailed reports about uncovered manhole trenches and pits in the city. The petitioner also asked the SHC to further direct the respondents to formulate and implement a city-wide municipal safety and hazard prevention framework. Social media outrage Many X users framed Ibrahim’s death not as an unfortunate mishap, but as the latest example of systemic failure in the city. One post captured the sentiment bluntly: “Imagine taking your child shopping and walking out with empty arms because the street itself swallowed him… This isn’t an ‘accident’; it is state-engineered negligence. Every open manhole in Karachi is a death trap waiting for another Ibrahim.” Actor Mahira Khan called out “unimaginable apathy” after watching a “video of a mother helplessly screaming, crying for her baby”. All she could ask was, “Who the hell is responsible for Karachi?” Sajal Ali criticised the city’s crumbling infrastructure and “collapsing, failed system”, saying she couldn’t imagine the parents’ pain as they waited for a miracle that never came because “there was no one to save him”. She added that Karachi “carries the weight of millions yet receives no care in return”. Adnan Siddiqui blamed the authorities who “couldn’t be bothered to cover a manhole”, calling the tragedy a “simple, preventable act of responsibility” and the indifference “as if human life means nothing here”. Rapper Talha Yunus said, “My heart weeps and my blood is boiling; this is all the result of our government’s incompetence. 2026 is almost here and this is the state of our city. Curse you,” he said, offering condolences to the family. Naumaan Ijaz also questioned the government’s priorities, saying, “Cameras worth millions have been installed [to give out] e-challans, but manhole covers were not installed to save someone’s life.” Published in Dawn, December 3rd, 2025",

      "summary": "• Pleas for FIR against mayor, KWSC, Gulshan town chairman and judicial inquiry land in courts • Parties, civil society demand mayor’s resignation • Celebrities blame failed civic management for tragedy KARACHI: The widespread outrage that the tragic death of a child, who drowned in an open manhole in Gulshan-i-Iqbal near Nipa, ignited has intensified, with political parties, civil society, and celebrities demanding answers, asking: “Who is responsible for this?” Three-year-old Ibrahim fell in an uncovered manhole in front of a departmental store near Nipa on Sunday evening. The body was recovered after a 15-hour-long rescue operation on Monday. By Tuesday evening, the manhole and the connected drain that had been dug up by rescuers to retrieve the body remained open, posing a threat to people. Many parties held protests against the provincial administration on Tuesday and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign. Pleas for FIR against mayor, KWSC, Gulshan town chairman and judicial inquiry land in courts A lawyer moved a sessions court seeking registration of a case against the mayor, Gulshan Town chairman, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) and Red Line contractor over their alleged negligence. Another lawyer filed a petition before the Sindh High Court for a judicial inquiry. Protests continue The Jamaat-i-Islami on Tuesday staged a protest near Nipa against Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab and the Sindh government of Pakistan People Party (PPP) over the incident that claimed the life of the three-year-old a day earlier. The protesters carrying placards and banners chanted slogans against the PPP government and demanded the mayor’s resignation. Senior party leader and opposition leader in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin said Karachi had been “bleeding for long” and another innocent life had now been lost. Those responsible, directly or indirectly, should be nominated in the FIR, he said, urging the Sindh chief minister to take serious action. Also on Tuesday, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders visited the area near Nipa and pointed out that the manhole was yet to be covered. They strongly condemned the inaction of the PPP-led provincial set-up and municipal authorities and demanded that lids be placed on all uncovered gutters across the metropolis. Meanwhile, the Karachi Restoration Movement (KRM) demanded that an FIR for the alleged killing of Ibrahim be registered against the mayor. Speaking at a press conference outside the KMC head office, KRM leaders said that as mayor — the “custodian and father of the city” — he must be held responsible. They announced that their protest camps would continue across the city in mourning for Ibrahim and other children who had died in similar incidents, and that their campaign would continue until a case is registered and the mayor resigns. Lawyers move courts A lawyer on Tuesday filed an application before a sessions court seeking registration of a case against the mayor, Gulshan town chairman, KWSC and the contractor of Red Line project over their alleged negligence. Applicant Advocate Sheikh Saqib Ahmed filed the application under Section 22-A of the Criminal Procedure Code and submitted that the tragic death of the child was not an isolated incident, as at least 23 people have lost their lives in Karachi in 2025 due to falling into open manholes. He stated that after incident, he approached the Aziz Bhatti SHO for lodging an FIR under Section 322 (qatl-e-bis-sabab) of the Pakistan Penal Code against the proposed accused persons but the police refused to register the case. Meanwhile, another lawyer filed a petition in the Sindh High Court seeking an independent judicial inquiry into the same incident by a district and sessions judge. Petitioner Gulzar Nigar also sought directives for the mayor and all 25 town chairmen to file detailed reports about uncovered manhole trenches and pits in the city. The petitioner also asked the SHC to further direct the respondents to formulate and implement a city-wide municipal safety and hazard prevention framework. Social media outrage Many X users framed Ibrahim’s death not as an unfortunate mishap, but as the latest example of systemic failure in the city. One post captured the sentiment bluntly: “Imagine taking your child shopping and walking out with empty arms because the street itself swallowed him… This isn’t an ‘accident’; it is state-engineered negligence. Every open manhole in Karachi is a death trap waiting for another Ibrahim.” Actor Mahira Khan called out “unimaginable apathy” after watching a “video of a mother helplessly screaming, crying for her baby”. All she could ask was, “Who the hell is responsible for Karachi?” Sajal Ali criticised the city’s crumbling infrastructure and “collapsing, failed system”, saying she couldn’t imagine the parents’ pain as they waited for a miracle that never came because “there was no one to save him”. She added that Karachi “carries the weight of millions yet receives no care in return”. Adnan Siddiqui blamed the authorities who “couldn’t be bothered to cover a manhole”, calling the tragedy a “simple, preventable act of responsibility” and the indifference “as if human life means nothing here”. Rapper Talha Yunus said, “My heart weeps and my blood is boiling; this is all the result of our government’s incompetence. 2026 is almost here and this is the state of our city. Curse you,” he said, offering condolences to the family. Naumaan Ijaz also questioned the government’s priorities, saying, “Cameras worth millions have been installed [to give out] e-challans, but manhole covers were not installed to save someone’s life.” Published in Dawn, December 3rd, 2025",
