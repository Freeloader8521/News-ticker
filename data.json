      "summary_orig": "A day after revelations emerged about the vision loss of PTI founder Imran Khan, the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP) reached Parliament House on Friday to stage a sit-in. On Thursday, the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that PTI founder Imran Khan’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. Subsequently, the TTAP announced the sit-in outside the Parliament House on Friday (today). In a post on X, the opposition alliance said that “a sit-in has started outside the parliament house,” vowing that it will “continue until Imran is admitted to Al-Shifa Hospital“. “No compromise will be made on Imran Khan’s health,” the TTAP said, adding that all PTI parliamentarians were set to join the sit-in. Separately, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said that PTI lawmakers reached the parliament “after overcoming all the obstacles in their way” ahead of the sit-in. Qaiser said that he, along with the leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Shahram Khan Tarakai, and Shandana Gulzar, reached the assembly. He added that the “group discussed the present situation and deliberated on the future course of action”. He later shared a video of the sit-in outside Parliament House, saying that they were demanding the provision of medical facilities for Imran in the presence of his family and personal physician. “Providing the best medical facilities is Imran Khan’s legal and constitutional right. No compromise will be made on Imran Khan’s health. If our demands are not met, we will announce our next course of action,” he said. At around 7:40pm, the TTAP said in a post on X that the sit-in was now being held in a corridor of the Parliament House under the leadership of National Assembly and Senate opposition leaders, Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, respectively. The protest was actually being staged at the Parliament House’s main entrance, where the opposition reiterated that the sit-in would continue until Imran was moved to the hospital. Earlier in the day, TTAP chief Achakzai had also vowed to continue the sit-in “until all demands are met”. TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, had earlier claimed that the government “has cordoned off all roads leading to Parliament” ahead of the sit-in. Khokhar had also claimed that “gates of parliamentary lodges have been shut, trapping MNAs and Senators inside.” He stressed that the measures were being taken to “stop opposition MPs from protesting and demanding medical access to Imran Khan.” “This doesn’t reflect strength, rather weakness,” he added. Protest outside KP House Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was also in Islamabad, but his Focal Person on Digital Media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi alleged in a post on X in the evening that “Islamabad police forcibly stopped” the CM and other members of the provincial assembly from reaching the Parliament House. Consequently, they staged a sit-in outside the KP House in the federal capital, he said. It was also alleged in the post that police personnel “pushed and roughed up” the protesters. The PTI also alleged in a post on X that Special Assistant to the KP CM on Information Shafi Jan “had his collar grabbed by a police officer.” Jan later appeared on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath’ , where he said a large contingent of police and prison vans at reached the KP House as they were leaving for Parliament. He said he and others with him were stopped by police at a barrier near the KP House. The law enforcement personnel later “grabbed my collar and … threw me into a prison van, due to which [I suffered a minor] head injury”, Jan alleged. He said this behaviour of the “federal police and government was unfortunate”. PTI asks SC to issue written orders Separately, PTI, in a post on X, addressed the CJP, demanding “formal written directions” for the PTI founder’s health examination. “CJP, we require formal written directions to ensure that Imran Khan is examined by specialists and treated under the supervision of his own doctors at Shifa International Hospital,” the party said. It called on the CJP to “issue and release the written orders,” stressing that Imran needed “urgent eye treatment.” “This is not politics, this is not about power. This is about Imran Khan’s life,” PTI added. Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, in a post on X, also said that the family had not yet received a written order from the SC regarding the PTI founder’s eye inspection. “It is 1pm on Friday the 13th, and we still have not received the written order from the Supreme Court of Pakistan. We require formal written directions to ensure that Imran Khan is examined by specialists and treated under the supervision of his own doctors at Shifa International Hospital,” Aleema said. She said that despite the court’s deadline of February 16, the “directive cannot be implemented without a written order from the court.” “Given the urgency and the risk to his eyesight, why has the CJP delayed issuing the written orders?” she added. Imran will be taken wherever he prefers for medical treatment: Tariq Fazal Chaudhry Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry spoke to the media ahead of the sit-in. He was asked about the blockade during the media talk, at which he maintained that the opposition had a right to protest. He went on to claim that the “blockade was not from the government’s side.” He held that the government has “repeatedly” assured the opposition that “no negligence will be tolerated regarding Imran’s health”. “There is no need to deal with it politically; it is a medical issue,” he added. Chaudhry, during his media talk, gave assurance that the PTI founder would be taken “wherever he prefers” for medical treatment amid claims regarding the incarcerated leader’s vision, stating that there would be “no negligence in the matter”. Addressing the media outside Parliament, Chaudhry said: “Wherever he (Imran) wants to go for a check-up, he will be taken. If he wants to go to Al-Shifa Eye Trust, then he will be taken there. There will be no negligence in the matter.” “If the CJP recommends a doctor, he will be taken there,” Chaudhry added. He called on the opposition to refrain from politicising the issue. “This is a sensitive issue; politicising it and misrepresenting facts is completely unfair.” He added that the incarcerated leader would “now be examined by eye doctors or super-specialists, and we will try to ensure he receives every possible treatment available”. Addressing the claims of Imran’s deteriorating vision, the minister dismissed the reports and stated, “The issue did not surface when Imran’s sister met him on Dec 2 or on Dec 9 when he was examined by a medical board or on Dec 20 when the Toshakhana verdict was announced.” “The complaint was not brought up anywhere before,” the minister said. He further recalled that, “On January 16, it was recommended by a doctor that Imran be shifted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for an eye checkup. It is also on record that he was not shifted at the request of PTI, but the jail authorities and the government”. He said that following Imran’s procedure on Jan 24, a medical report was issued by the doctors, “and then there is a ‘report’ by the lawyer” — referring to PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar’s report submitted to the SC. He added that a new medical report will be issued soon. The minister said that the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Yahya Afridi, was “himself looking after the case”. Awaam Pakistan to join TTAP’s sit-in Separately, the leadership of Awaam Pakistan — Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Miftah Ismail — announced that it will participate in TTAP’s sit-in outside Parliament House. “The peaceful protest is being staged in response to the alleged deprivation of vision in Imran Khan’s one eye, and the government’s refusal to allow access to his personal doctors and family.” The TTAP further said the decision was made last night in a meeting also attended by Awaam Pakistan’s leadership. “Denying any prisoner timely and appropriate medical care is immoral, inhumane and illegal,” the opposition alliance said, adding that Imran Khan was Pakistan’s former prime minister and the leader of the “country’s largest political party”. “The Awaam Pakistan party will join TTAP’s sit-in outside Parliament immediately after Friday prayers today.” “We firmly believe in the rule of law, the people’s constitutional rights, free and fair elections, and true democracy, and we will always stand with the people in their struggle for these principles,” the post said. Dr Zafar Mirza, central spokesperson of Awaam Pakistan party, in a social media post on X, said, “Imran Khan’s eyesight is at risk without urgent medical treatment! Awaam Pakistan is part of the peaceful protest of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan and will stay until he receives the medical care he legally deserves.” Later, Ismail shared on X that Mirza had “rushed to Lahore to attend the Namaz-i-Janaza of our party’s founder and Punjab Convenor Syed Zaeem Hussain Qadri sb. But, he will attend the dharna tomorrow morning”.",

The 96- and 48-hour transit visas are sponsored by the UAE-based airlines — Emirates and Etihad Airways — and must be processed and approved before entering the UAE, according to the information available on the government’s website . “If you are not eligible for a visa on arrival or a visa-free entry to the UAE, and intend to step out of the airport, then you need a pre-arranged transit visa,” the website says. Several users shared screenshots on social media that stated: “As per the latest information from USE immigration transit visas (96 Hours and 48 Hours Visa) for PAKISTAN nationals has been temporarily suspended. Hence, kindly do not apply for this 96 Hours and 48 Hours visa category.” Others, meanwhile, just mentioned the reported suspension of the transit visas on X, citing a “notice”. Past visa issues Pakistanis have faced difficulties obtaining UAE visas over the past year. In January 2025, Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig told the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”. He said that the UAE had concerns about Pakistanis travelling on visit visas and resorting to begging. However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, said there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the UAE. In April, UAE Ambassador Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al Zaabi said visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could avail a five-year visa. However, in early July, reports of visa rejections prompted Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart . In a meeting that month, UAE Interior Minister Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens, according to an official account of the talks. On November 27, 2025, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chau­dhry told a Senate functional committee that the UAE was not issuing visas to Pakistanis. He had also said Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”. But that same day, UAE Amba­ssador to Pakistan Salem M. Salem Al-Bawab Al-Zaabi shared what was described as “major UAE visa facilitation refo­rms for Pakistanis” with Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb, according to a statement issued by the finance ministry. The reforms discussed during their meeting in Islamabad included online visa processing, e-visas without passport stamping and faster system-to-system linkages, the finance ministry said. Last month, Pakistan and the UAE agreed to pursue a formal agreement on “pre-immigration clearance” for Pakistani nationals travelling to the Gulf country, the interior ministry said. Under the proposed arrangement, immigration formalities wo­u­ld be completed in Pakistan before departure, allowing passengers to avoid routine immigration processing on arrival in the UAE.",

      "summary_orig": "Britain’s ban on pro-Palestinian campaign group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation was ruled unlawful by London’s High Court on Friday, though the ban will temporarily remain in place and the government said it would appeal against the decision. Palestine Action was proscribed in July, having increasingly taken “direct action” against Israel-linked defence companies in Britain, often blocking entrances or spraying red paint. Britain argued the group’s actions amounted to terrorism, citing a 2024 raid on a factory of Israel’s largest defence firm Elbit Systems, in which prosecutors said activists caused around £1 million ($1.4 m) of damage and a police officer was hit with a sledgehammer. Ban followed break-in at air base Palestine Action was banned shortly after a June break-in at the Royal Air Force’s Brize Norton air base, in which activists damaged two planes, an action described by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as “disgraceful”. Lawyers representing Huda Ammori, who co-founded Palestine Action in 2020, argued at a hearing last year that the move was an authoritarian restriction on the right to protest. Judge Victoria Sharp said Palestine Action “promotes its political cause through criminality and the encouragement of criminality”. The High Court nonetheless ruled the ban was a disproportionate interference with the right to freedom of expression, though the ban was not lifted ahead of a further hearing to decide whether it should remain pending an appeal. Interior minister Shabana Mahmood said in a statement: “I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal.” Government defeat follows ‘not guilty’ verdicts The ban put Palestine Action on a par with Islamic State or al Qaeda and made it a criminal offence to be a member, carrying a maximum 14-year prison sentence. More than 2,000 people have since been arrested for holding signs in support of the group though Friday’s ruling could lead to any criminal charges being dropped. London’s Metropolitan Police said following the judgment that it would focus on gathering evidence where people expressed support for Palestine Action rather than making arrests. Civil liberties groups, including Amnesty International, had called for the ban to be lifted and Irish novelist Sally Rooney said it could even lead to her books being withdrawn from sale due to her public support for Palestine Action. The British government argued proscription only prevented support for Palestine Action and had not prevented people from protesting in favour of the Palestinian cause. The High Court, however, said it could cause pro-Palestinian protesters to “exercise self-restraint in terms of what they say and what they do”. The judgment was announced two weeks after six people charged over the 2024 raid on Elbit were all acquitted of aggravated burglary. Prosecutors have said they will seek a retrial on those counts on which the jury could not reach a verdict, including the alleged assault on a police officer.",

      "summary_orig": "The UN Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a resolution extending by one year the mandate of the Monitoring Team that supports the 1988 Afghanistan Sanctions Committee, which oversees sanctions imposed on the Taliban. All 15 council members voted in favor of the US-drafted resolution, renewing the Monitoring Team’s mandate until February 17, 2027. The extension comes amid mounting international concern over Afghanistan’s deteriorating security situation, the growing influence of multiple terrorist groups, and the potential for regional destabilisation. Pakistan, which supported the resolution, stressed the ongoing threat posed by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K), Majeed Brigade, and Al-Qaeda. Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, said these groups “have been responsible for some of the most heinous terrorist attacks against Pakistan,” citing recent attacks that killed 80 people this month alone. “Once again, Afghan soil was used by these groups to plan and orchestrate attacks against neighbouring countries,” he said, urging the Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan territory for terrorist operations. “It is for the Taliban to decide what path they wish to choose for Afghanistan: whether the path to isolation or the path to peace and prosperity as a responsible member of the international community,“ he said. The ambassador also highlighted the council’s concerns over the wider humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. “The resolution rightly emphasises the dire human rights conditions, particularly for women and girls, economic collapse, political exclusion, and the challenges posed by drug trafficking,” he said. “Through this resolution, the council has sent a clear message that Afghan territory should not serve as a safe haven for terrorists and that all member states must prevent ransom payments or political concessions benefiting hostage-takers or terrorist groups.” The UN Monitoring Team’s 37th report, released this week, paints a grim picture of Afghanistan as a base for multiple terrorist organisations. It noted that the de facto Afghan authorities continue to provide a “permissive environment” for groups, particularly TTP. The report cited rising regional anxiety over cross-border attacks, the radicalisation of vulnerable communities, and the exploitation of commercial satellite communications and artificial intelligence by militant groups. While Afghan authorities insist no terrorist groups are present in the country, the Monitoring Team stated that “no UN member state supported that assessment.” Although the authorities have taken action against ISIL-K and control some external activities of other groups, TTP has enjoyed greater freedom, resulting in an escalation of attacks against Pakistan and heightened regional tensions. On Al-Qaeda, the report said the group’s intent and capability for external operations remain unchanged. It continues to serve as a training and advisory hub, particularly for TTP, and “favors spectacular attacks aimed at attracting global media attention,” highlighting the continued threat beyond the immediate region. Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), not listed under UN sanctions, remains active in southeastern Afghanistan, especially in areas influenced by the Haqqani Network. The report indicated AQIS leaders Osama Mahmoud and deputy Yahya Ghauri are believed to be in Kabul, with the group’s media cell operating from Herat. Member states warned that AQIS increasingly focuses on deniable external operations, possibly under cover groups such as Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan, likely to avoid causing difficulties for the Taliban. TTP, one of the largest terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan, has intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces and state institutions. A November 11 attack on an Islamabad courthouse killed 12 people, marking the first such strike in the capital in several years. Despite operational setbacks, including the killing of deputy emir Mufti Muzahim in October, the group remains a serious threat. The Monitoring Team warned that TTP could deepen cooperation with Al-Qaeda-aligned groups, potentially expanding the threat beyond the region. ISIL-K, though under pressure from Taliban actions and regional security operations, retains significant combat capability, particularly in northern Afghanistan near Badakhshan and along the Pakistani border. The group continues to replenish its ranks through online recruitment and seeks alliances with other armed factions. Other groups of concern include the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM/TIP), which reportedly enjoys Afghan patronage, including identity documents, and raises funds through poppy cultivation and mining. Approximately 250 ETIM/TIP members joined Taliban police forces in 2025, and some have called for fighters in Syria and neighboring countries to relocate to Afghanistan in preparation for operations in China’s Xinjiang region. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which is not listed under UN sanctions, has carried out attacks against Pakistani security forces and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects, including a September 16 ambush that killed 32 soldiers. While Pakistani counter-terrorism operations have constrained the group’s activities, it remains operational, with some member states reporting coordination between BLA, TTP, and ISIL-K through shared training and resources. The Monitoring Team’s findings are expected to shape further deliberations at the Security Council on Afghanistan’s security trajectory and the effectiveness of the existing sanctions regime. Pakistan and other member states have emphasised that the resolution underscores the need for the Taliban to take “sustained and verifiable” action against terrorist groups, prevent Afghan territory from being used for external attacks, and uphold commitments to international peace and security.",

ISIL-K, though under pressure from Taliban actions and regional security operations, retains significant combat capability, particularly in northern Afghanistan near Badakhshan and along the Pakistani border. The group continues to replenish its ranks through online recruitment and seeks alliances with other armed factions. Other groups of concern include the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM/TIP), which reportedly enjoys Afghan patronage, including identity documents, and raises funds through poppy cultivation and mining. Approximately 250 ETIM/TIP members joined Taliban police forces in 2025, and some have called for fighters in Syria and neighboring countries to relocate to Afghanistan in preparation for operations in China’s Xinjiang region. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which is not listed under UN sanctions, has carried out attacks against Pakistani security forces and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects, including a September 16 ambush that killed 32 soldiers. While Pakistani counter-terrorism operations have constrained the group’s activities, it remains operational, with some member states reporting coordination between BLA, TTP, and ISIL-K through shared training and resources. The Monitoring Team’s findings are expected to shape further deliberations at the Security Council on Afghanistan’s security trajectory and the effectiveness of the existing sanctions regime. Pakistan and other member states have emphasised that the resolution underscores the need for the Taliban to take “sustained and verifiable” action against terrorist groups, prevent Afghan territory from being used for external attacks, and uphold commitments to international peace and security.",
