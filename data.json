      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Parts of Karachi received rain on Thursday under the influence of a westerly wave, which the Met Office said was expected to lead to a dip in temperatures till Saturday. Reports of rain were received from Surjani, North Karachi, Scheme 33, Super Highway, Defence Housing Authority, Sohrab Goth, Clifton, Sharea Faisal and Gulistan-i-Jauhar. Data from the Met Office showed that the highest amount of rainfall in Karachi fell in Surjani Town, with 26.3 millimetres (mm) of rain recorded as of 5pm. The lowest readings were in Kemari and the old airport area, with trace amounts of rainfall, while Orangi Town, Quaidabad, Saddar and Bin Qasim saw no rain at all. In other parts of Sindh, Jacobabad and Sukkur experienced the most rainfall, with each recording 10mm of rain. The least fell in Shaheed Benazirabad and Sakrand, with both recording 1mm each. Karachi only received trace amounts of rainfall, according to the data. Meanwhile, an alert by the traffic police at 3:49pm said Hub River Road had been closed for vehicles headed toward Dabba Mor as water from a drain had spilled over onto the road due to rain. Traffic was being diverted toward Baldia Town from the Surti graveyard, the alert said. The traffic police also issued an advisory, urging citizens to drive slowly, keep headlights on, exercise caution near electricity poles and dilapidated buildings and avoid going near poles and broken wires. Earlier, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast cloudy weather in Karachi for today, saying that there were chances of rain. In its three-day weather forecast issued on January 22, the PMD said a westerly wave was likely to grip Sindh, adding that dust-thunderstorms and light to moderate rain were expected in Karachi. The forecast said highs of 23-25 degrees Celsius and lows of 13.5°C were expected today. It added that humidity was predicted to decrease from 84 per cent in the morning to between 50pc and 60pc in the evening, with a west/northwesterly wind. Over the next two days, it further stated, temperatures are expected to drop, with highs of 20–22°C and lows of 7–9°C each day. Dry weather and cold nights are forecast throughout. Additionally, both Friday and Saturday are forecast to be less humid than Thursday, with morning humidity at 40–50pc and 45–55pc respectively, dropping to 15–25pc in the evenings. The PMD added that a north/northwesterly wind is expected on Friday, and an east/northeasterly wind will likely blow in the metropolis on Saturday. Besides the Karachi division, it said, rain is also expected today in Jamshoro, Dadu, Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar, Sujawal, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Naushahro Feroze, Shaheed Benazirabad, Khairpur, Sukkur, Ghotki, Jacobabad, Larkana, Qambar Shahdadkot and Shikarpur districts. In view of the PMD’s rain forecast for the city, Mayor Murtaza Wahab instructed the Karachi Metropolitan Cooporation (KMC) teams to remain alert. In a statement, Wahab noted that all pumping stations across the city have been made functional for the timely discharge of rainwater. He further affirmed that teams were on the ground to “continuously monitor” if citizens needed any help. The mayor also issued directives to establish an emergency cell to deal with any untoward situation. On Wednesday, the PMD said that rain and heavy snowfall will affect all provinces as well as the northern regions on January 22 and 23, as the National Disaster Manage­ment Authority issued an alert and asked citizens to take precautions.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The confirmed death toll of the Gul Plaza blaze stood at 50 on Thursday, according to an official list shared by police surgeon Summaiya Syed, a day after several bodies were found in a gutted crockery shop at the shopping mall. Initially, police had estimated that the remains, charred beyond recognition, were of 30 individuals. Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza had said that the death toll was estimated to have risen from 31 to 60 following the development, but he had also cautioned that a definite number could only be reached after DNA reports. The list shared by Dr Syed on Thursday showed that the death of 50 individuals had been confirmed so far. Meanwhile, a search operation at Gul Plaza continued. It was initiated on Sunday night after around 24-hour-long efforts to extinguish the fire that erupted on Saturday night. The plaza, parts of which have collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards. Relatives of those still missing have criticised the slow operation at the three-storey plaza, where rescuers are scouring the wreckage for human remains. Faraz Ali, whose father and 26-year-old brother were inside the mall, told AFP he wants “the bodies to be recovered and handed over to their rightful families”. “That is all so that the families may receive something, some comfort, some peace. At least let us see them one last time, in whatever condition they are, so that we may say our final goodbye,” the 28-year-old said. Some families also staged a protest outside Gul Plaza on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Edhi Foundation said in a statement that three more bodies, which were kept in its morgue after they were pulled from the rubble, had been identified through DNA tests. One of the three identified deceased men ran a gift shop in Gul Plaza while the other two were employed at different shops in the shopping mall, the statement said. It added that the bodies had been handed over to the heirs. SBCA begins fire safety assessments The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), meanwhile, said it had initiated fire safety assessments in Karachi on the directives of Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah. A statement issued by SBCA Director General (DG) Muzammil Halepoto’s office said fire safety arrangements in 35 of the city’s buildings, including both residential and commercial ones, had been carried out. It quoted Halepoto as saying that the “functionality of firefighting and emergency systems” was being assessed in the exercise and notices for corrective measures would be issued to the owners of buildings with faulty fire safety systems. Halepoto further stated that fire safety notices had been issued for 266 buildings in Karachi, which also included those covered in a Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) survey . He recalled that the KMC had also issued directives to builders, building owners and unions in January 2024 to ensure fire safety. The official warned that buildings lacking firefighting tools and safety measures within the given time would be sealed. The SBCA DG asserted that fire safety assessments would continue in the city to ensure emergency preparedness. Inquiry committee visits gutted plaza Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, the convener of an inquiry committee formed by the Sindh government to probe the circumstances of the fire, visited the gutted plaza yesterday. Karachi Additional Inspector General Azad Khan, who is also a member of the committee, accompanied the commissioner. Speaking to the media, the Karachi commissioner said the inquiry had just begun. He highlighted the building’s condition, saying the Rimpa Plaza, located adjacent to the plaza, had also been affected. However, he said that Rimpa Plaza had not yet been declared dangerous. Naqvi lamented that the fire safety measures inside the buildings did not adhere to international standards. The additional Karachi IG, meanwhile, said that no evidence of sabotage had emerged so far. “We are investigating the incident thoroughly,” he said. He refuted media reports that two dumper trucks transporting debris from the plaza to KMC ground had disappeared. KMC’s Zafar Khan also spoke to the media, saying the firefighting team was still working on the plaza despite the presence of “extreme heat” while cooling work was also ongoing on two spots. He said one portion of the building had been cleared, while two other portions were in the process of being cleared. “We will try to retrieve the bodies buried under the debris,” he vowed, adding that firemen were being sent to the spots where the building’s structure was still stable. He also refuted claims alleging that the fire brigade had a delayed response to the fire. He said three fire tenders were sent as soon as information was received about the fire on Saturday night. Khan further added that shopkeepers had created a chaotic situation and were allegedly snatching pipes from firefighters to extinguish the flames at their own shops. He said that the door leading to the building’s roof was locked, therefore, people were unable to access it. He said that the market was meant to be closing when the fire erupted, which was why all the exits were closed. Additional input from AFP",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar on Thursday ordered an inquiry after Model Colony police arrested journalist Shahab Salman for allegedly firing a gun and injuring a person. The journalist’s arrest came after a first information report (FIR) was registered against him under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 324 (attempted murder) and 337A(i) (causing a head injury) of the Pakistan Penal Code. The complainant, who operates a “cable network”, alleged that he and his friends had met for tea at a restaurant on Wednesday night, when Salman and three others drew a pistol and started firing, resulting in a bullet injury to his thigh. He further alleged that the suspect was spreading fake news against him on social media for “blackmailing purposes”. Subsequently, the Sindh home minister took notice of the arrest and sought details from the Korangi senior superintendent of police (SSP), according to a statement. “Merit, transparency and impartiality should be given focus,” Lanjar said in the statement, adding that all media organisations should be taken into confidence and that a thorough inquiry be conducted. “I assure my journalist brethren that merit and transparency will be ensured during police investigation,” he added. Meanwhile, a statement issued by the police said the Shah Faisal Colony superintendent of police (SP) and SP Investigation had been appointed as investigating officers for the inquiry. The statement quoted the Korangi SSP as saying that the two officials  should ensure merit and transparency in the inquiry and that a complaint by the journalist’s wife should also be made a part of the probe. Salman’s wife had filed an application with the Model Colony police alleging that certain elements wanted to occupy the land of a bus terminal in Model Colony. She said her husband had exposed the land grabbing “while performing his professional duties”, leading the complainant to “threaten him”. “Suspects riding four motorcycles on Wednesday night arrived at the restaurant and threatened my husband,” she alleged in her application. “He (Salman) took out a licensed pistol and resorted to firing in self-defence,” she said. She further stated that they had sought protection from the police, which was not provided and accused the suspects of “being supported by political elements”. She further alleged that the suspects beat her husband while he was in police custody. Meanwhile, separate statements issued by the Karachi Press Club (KPC) and Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the arrest. “Arresting a person who opened fire in self-defence instead of the attacker is worrying,” the KUJ’s president and secretary said in a joint statement. It added that some elements had been threatening Salman for reporting the news over several days and that after opening fire in self-defence, Salman himself had approached the police for help but was refused. “Not only did they file a case against him, aiding the criminals, but they refused to accept his wife’s application,” the statement added. “High-ranking police officials should take notice of this matter and bring justice to the journalist [and] the authorities should ensure a transparent investigation,” the statement said. The KPC also demanded that Salman be released immediately and that an impartial investigation be conducted into the incident. “KPC President Fazil Jamili, Secretary Aslam Khan and the executive council have expressed deep concern over the attempted attack on Salman, a senior member of the press club, and his subsequent arrest,” the statement said. It noted that Salman was a “responsible and professional journalist” and that if he were threatened or attacked, law enforcement agencies’ first responsibility should be to provide protection to him and take action against the real suspects. “Arresting a senior journalist on the basis of self-defence is upsetting and concerning, while the impression that the victim should be blamed instead of the complainant is also extremely dangerous,” the statement added. The KPC, alongside demanding Salman’s release and a transparent probe, demanded the assurance that journalists would not face harassment or retaliation while carrying out their duties.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other world leaders on Thursday signed the charter for the “ Board of Peace ” headed by United States President Donald Trump, who has billed the body as a platform for resolving international conflicts. Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year war on the Palestinian enclave, the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts. A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — gathered on stage with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland to put their names to the founding charter of the body. Trump — who is the chairman of the Board of Peace — said they were “in most cases very popular leaders, some cases not so popular”. “That’s the way it goes in life,” he said. “Congratulations, President Trump. The charter is now in full force, and the Board of Peace is now an official international organisation,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “Every one of them are friends of mine. I like every single one of them,” Trump said about the signatories. “Just about every country wants to be a part of it. We sent out the letters a couple of days ago and countries that are here just happened to be in Davos,” he said. The US president declared, “Everybody in this room is a star […] There’s a reason that you’re here. When you use that inspired genius for peace, the opposite of peace has no chance.” Trump officials also unveiled ambitious plans for a “New Gaza” during the ceremony, with the US leader describing the devastated Palestinian territory as “great real estate.” Referring to the signatories at the outset of his speech, Trump said, “Each and every one of you, we are truly honoured by your presence today. Leaders of countries, in most cases, very popular leaders; in some cases, not so popular.” Among those seated in the audience was PM Shehbaz. Pakistan on Wednesday had accepted Trump’s invitation to join the Board of Peace. After Trump’s address, the heads of various countries took turns to sign the board’s charter. Permanent members must also pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a “pay to play” version of the UN Security Council. While Trump’s plan had sparked concerns that he wants the board to rival the United Nations (UN), the US president said the body will work “in conjunction” with the UN. Officials from Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan also signed the document with Trump. Apart from the US, no other permanent member of the UNSC — the five nations with the most say over international law and diplomacy since the end of World War Two — has so far committed to join. France has declined to join. Britain said on Thursday it was not joining at present. China has not yet said whether it will do so. However, the Board of Peace’s potential membership has been controversial, with Trump inviting Israel’s PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Gaza. Netanyahu has said Israel will join the board, but he was not at the ceremony. Trump had also invited Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine four years ago. While the US president said Putin had agreed to join, the Russian leader said he was still studying the invitation. Reuters could not immediately spot any representatives from governments of top global powers or from Israel or the Palestinian Authority (PA) at the signing ceremony. ‘End’ of Hamas if it doesn’t disarm: Trump During his speech, the US president also said that Hamas must disarm under the Gaza ceasefire deal or it will be the “end” of the Palestinian movement. “They have to give up their weapons, and if they don’t do that, it’s going to be the end of them,” Trump said. “We’re committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,” he affirmed, adding that “we can spread out to other things as we succeed with Gaza”. “Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do, and we’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,” the US president said, adding that the combination of the Board of Peace and the UN could be “very, very unique for the world”. Trump recalled that under Phase 1 of the ceasefire plan, “we have painstakingly […] maintained the Gaza ceasefire, delivered record levels of humanitarian aid”. “We’ve given aid, you know, you used to hear that all the people were starving and it was terrible. You don’t hear that anymore,” he insisted, highlighting the release of 20 Israeli captives and the bodies of most of the deceased ones. The US president asserted: “The first steps toward a brighter day for the Middle East and a much safer future for the world are unfolding before your very eyes. “Together we are in a position to have an incredible chance — I don’t even call it a chance, it’s gonna happen — to end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region, and for the whole region of the world, because I’m calling the world a region.” Trump also claimed that Iran wants to hold talks with the US, and that Washington was willing to do so. “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.” He also recalled the US strikes on Iran’s uranium enrichment sites in June 2025.“Can’t let that happen,” he said, referring to the US’s stance that Tehran plans to build nuclear weapons. ‘New Gaza’ plans A large part of the ceremony was devoted to talking about its plans for shattered Gaza. US businessman Jared Kushner speaks as a “Gaza Timeline” is displayed on a giant screen at the “Board of Peace” meeting during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit in Davos on Jan 22, 2026. — AFP Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a former property developer like the president, showed slides of what he billed as a “master plan” for Gaza’s reconstruction. The slides included maps of new settlements in the Gaza Strip and artist renderings of gleaming seafront hotels and apartments under the caption “New Gaza”. “It could be a hope. It could be a destination,” Kushner said. Kushner said the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal would address funding for reconstruction in the territory, which lies mostly in ruins, as well as disarmament by Hamas, one of the most intractable unresolved issues. “If Hamas doesn’t demilitarise, that would be what holds this plan back,” Kushner said. “The next 100 days, we’re going to continue to just be heads down and focused on making sure this is implemented. We continue to be focused on humanitarian aid, humanitarian shelter, but then creating the conditions to move forward.” Focus right now on Gaza: Rubio US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff also spoke on the occasion. In his speech, Rubio highlighted that Trump was “willing to talk to or engage with anyone in the interest of peace”. He stressed, “Now we have this Board of Peace … [its] possibilities are endless. Obviously, with a focus first and foremost on making sure this peace deal in Gaza becomes enduring. “I know this president has it as his highest priority and will give everything that he has to make sure that this is successful.” The US secretary of state asserted: “This is not just a Board of Peace but a board of action, just like President Trump is a president of action.” Rubio emphasised that the “focus is right now on Gaza and making sure that the […] vision for the future of Gaza […] of the region, is not just possible and promising, but it is our destiny”. He further said it would serve as an example of “what’s possible for other places and other conflicts that seem impossible to solve right now”. “Many others who are going to join … are not in town today or they have to go through some procedure internally in their own country because of constitutional limitations, but others will join,” Rubio added. Brazen disregard for int’l law, human rights: Amnesty Meanwhile, Amnesty International termed the ceremony marking the Board of Peace’s establishment a “brazen disregard for international law and human rights”. “It also represents a stark new manifestation of the escalating assault on United Nations mechanisms, international justice institutions and universal norms,” the rights body said in a statement on X. Amnesty further noted: “At the direction of its to-be chairman, President Trump, with its membership comprised of US allies including a few heads of state he has personally invited, the putative mechanism is fundamentally at odds with the international legal system that underpins the global order. “It is a slap in the face of decades of efforts to strengthen global governance through adherence to universal values and greater equality between member states and derails legitimate efforts to address the current system’s limitations and gaps.” Amnesty emphasised that now was “precisely the moment that international law must be upheld, defended and enforced; not abandoned in favour of ad hoc arrangements shaped and distorted by political and economic interests, personal ambition or vanity”. Rafah crossing to open ‘in both directions’: Palestinian official The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip will reopen in both directions next week, said Ali Shaath , the newly-appointed administrator of the Palestinian territory under the US-backed plan. The reopening of the crossing is part of the Gaza truce plan announced by Trump in October, but it has remained closed so far. “I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions,” Shaath, a former PA deputy minister, said at the Board of Peace launch ceremony. “For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate; it is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity. Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and the world,” Shaath said. As part of the truce plan, Shaath was named to head a committee of 15 Palestinian technocrats to oversee the day-to-day administration of Gaza. Additional input from Reuters",

Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters of key frontrunner Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) crowded the streets of the northern city of Sylhet, chanting his name. “We have liberated the country from autocratic rule,” prime ministerial hopeful Rahman, who returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile, told crowds of BNP loyalists. “Now we must establish the rights of the people.” Rahman vowed to create jobs for “millions of unemployed youth” and support women’s economic independence. “Do we have a leader?

      "title_orig": "Could voting break the plastics treaty deadlock?",
      "summary_orig": "Three years ago, the international effort to create a binding treaty to end plastic pollution started with an explosion of hope. Last year it collapsed. This has stalled the birth of an agreement that could begin to rein in production of a fossil-fuel-based material that is harming ecosystems on every part of Earth. The treaty seemed to be the latest victim of a struggling multilateral system. Shifting geopolitics, changing national positions and the global influence of fossil fuels are frustrating the broader work of curbing climate change – humanity’s common interest. I reported on the plastics negotiations over this period, watching as 184 countries seemed increasingly unable to find common ground. With so much at stake, one absence in particular seemed to weaken the process: the ability, when countries could not reach full consensus, to make a decision anyway based on a two-thirds majority vote. Arcane as it sounds, this omission lurked behind some of the most dramatic negotiation scenes, and still haunts other environmental processes today, including the UN’s climate negotiations. This is the story of how voting is an ever-present obstacle to the global plastics treaty, what it reveals about political will, and why, despite the process fizzling out, I believe there is still a desire in many quarters to reach an ambitious deal. Resistance mounts against a vote Paris, France, May 2024: When countries gathered to begin textual negotiations on the plastics treaty, a small group soon began to question the rules of procedure. Though hard to detect behind the practised calm of negotiators, a mighty conflict was brewing. Saudi Arabia, backed by Iran, India, Brazil and China, took the floor. They challenged a standard rule in UN negotiations that allows a decision to be passed by a two-thirds majority when consensus cannot been reached. After hours of plenary statements and rebuttals, Saudi Arabia delivered the clincher. It would “not be moving forward [with negotiations] until the rule is bracketed”. Words are bracketed in international negotiations to indicate disagreement over their inclusion in the final text. Requesting brackets at this stage was an attempt to kick voting into the long grass. Negotiators ultimately spent two of their five days wrangling over this point, until – anxiously watching the clock – they effectively agreed to bracket the voting rule. The decision was accompanied by a statement noting the issue still hadn’t been resolved, in case it came up in a future discussion. But that discussion never came, and the voting rule was never applied. To the treaty novice I was at the time, it wasn’t immediately clear why this mattered. But treaty die-hards saw eerie echoes of what had happened at the start of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process to negotiate curbs on greenhouse gas emissions. Back in 1991, a group of petrochemical-rich countries wrestled the voting rules for UNFCCC negotiations into brackets, where they have now been gathering dust for 35 years. Many people told me this move has been responsible for slow action on climate change today. Voting is standard in other multilateral environmental agreements. The High Seas Treaty, the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions on dangerous chemicals, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, for example, all allow decisions by a majority vote. That being said, those UN environmental agreements that allow voting still prefer consensus, reserving voting for decision deadlocks. The desire to avoid a vote pushes countries “to find common ground” instead of overriding a minority, says David Azoulay, senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law: “Knowing a vote is possible is all you need to create the incentive to actually negotiate in good faith. Because nobody wants to find themselves on the losing end of a vote.” Without that pressure, a country may simply veto a decision it dislikes, potentially due to vested interests. Where environmental issues intersect with economic interests, that is a particular risk. In the UNFCCC process, “petrostates succeeded in arranging consensus as the rule of procedure” and have thereby stalled progress since 1991. That’s according to Nona Chai, programme coordinator for the Just Transition Alliance, a coalition of environmental justice groups and labour unions. The plastics treaty negotiations attracted many lobbyists, interested groups and protestors, including these at the Geneva headquarters of the UN  — Salvatore Di Nolfi / Associated Press / Alamy via Dialogue Earth Last year, Chai attended the COP30 climate conference in Brazil. She says the no-voting norm has made it easier to block key proposals, such as language previously agreed at COP28 on “transitioning away from fossil fuels”. This was opposed by Saudi Arabia and a handful of others, and ultimately removed from COP30’s final text. Many of the same countries now seem to see plastic as a way to keep extracting the fossil fuels that underpin their economies. Production limits brought on by a global plastics treaty could threaten that. What unfolded during 2023’s Paris plastics talks , therefore, triggered alarm bells that the same old tactics were being used. ‘Us’ and ‘them’ Busan, South Korea, November 2024: Journalists jostled into the press room, briefly warming the frigid air of the cavernous conference centre, where the fifth (and supposedly final) plastics treaty meeting was underway. A panel of negotiators were making a rare speech, about a proposal to reduce global plastic production to sustainable levels. Most country delegates, civil society representatives and scientists in attendance believed production limits were key to a successful treaty. This is in line with the 2022 UN Environment Assembly resolution that created these negotiations. It mandated that the talks should tackle pollution across the entire plastic lifecycle. But over the preceding four meetings, countries had broadly split into factions for and against this issue. Several factors had stoked the division. At the third meeting in Nairobi in November 2023, a cluster of petrochemical-producing countries formed the “like-minded group”. It pushed for waste management over production cuts. A fourth meeting, in Ottawa in April 2024, featured aggressive pro-plastic ad campaigns and almost 200 petrochemical lobbyists, exposing corporate influence on the process. By the Busan meeting, the US – a major treaty player – had started rolling back its support for production cuts. (Later, under President Trump, this evolved into an allegiance with oil-rich states, and secret pressure on countries to reject production limits.) The press briefing in Busan made it clear that the majority was trying to keep a production limit on the negotiating table. Wearing his trademark straw hat, Panama’s lead negotiator, Juan Carlos Monterrey-Gomez, said countries opposing limits had “not moved a centimetre”. He urged them to negotiate to meet the majority halfway. And with something approaching anger, he had a message for those unwilling to do so: “Please leave it to the rest of us and get out of the way.” If anyone was looking for a sign that multilateralism was flailing, this atypical “us” and “them” framing was it. Behind the scenes, the like-minded minority had been suggesting “no text” or “no article” on production reduction, meaning no mention of it. “When we started to talk about the text among those of us who wanted it, they didn’t want to have that conversation,” Dennis Clare, a negotiator for Micronesia, told me at the time. He said they used several tactics to shut it down. “It was an impasse.” Meanwhile, I watched as these countries kept raising the importance of consensus in plenaries and public statements – despite reportedly not engaging in the normal processes of discussion and compromise needed to reach it. This tendency has crept into other multilateral spaces. Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement, told Carbon Brief that “consensus” has come to be misunderstood as “unanimity”. A decision doesn’t actually need the unreserved agreement of everyone. In difficult decisions of all shades, consensus is achieved through flexibility and compromise, delivering a compromise that all parties are satisfied with, if not necessarily ecstatic about. In Busan, it seemed, the fears expressed 18 months prior in Paris had become real. Without voting, a handful of countries hiding behind the cover of consensus had been emboldened to veto the majority. Cacophonous collapse Geneva, Switzerland, August 2025: On a sweltering summer night, exhausted delegates gathered on a manicured lawn at the UN headquarters in Geneva — Emma Bryce via Dialogue Earth It was the final day of the sixth UN plastics treaty meeting, called after the fifth in Busan had failed to reach an agreement. People had been waiting hours for the final text. Just before midnight, everyone was summoned into the vast plenary hall, and an expectant hush fell. But then Luis Vayas Valdievieso , the meeting’s chair, explained that the treaty was still not ready. “This plenary is adjourned!”, he boomed, banging his gavel down. Almost 4,000 delegates let out a roar of frustration. At 31 seconds, it was the shortest plenary in UN history. It seemed to symbolise a process in crisis. The anticipated text was expected to be a significant upgrade on a draft Valdievieso had released the day before, which had provoked widespread outrage and despair. It remains unclear why, but that draft barely resembled what most negotiators wanted. A section on production controls was replaced with pollution measures only, language on regulating harmful plastic chemicals was erased and the agreement was no longer legally binding. Camila Zepeda, Mexico’s lead negotiator, described that draft to me as “an empty shell.” The text had been roundly rejected, pushing countries back into negotiations to try and develop another draft. That still wasn’t ready by the midnight plenary on the final day. When Valdievieso gavelled that bafflingly brief plenary to a close, the meeting moved into overtime and he held informal meetings with countries to try and reach some resolution. Ultimately, they could not agree on a final text. At a final closing plenary just after 5am, Colombia captured the sense of frustration, saying the process had been “consistently blocked by a small number of states who simply don’t want an agreement”. Two months later, Valdievieso resigned as chair. A vote for the future How different would things be if voting had been part of this fraught process? Azoulay feels sure it would have at least brought an agreement “very, very much closer”. Voting in multilateral environment agreements, intended as a last resort, has become one of the only available tools to defend multilateralism. Having watched the process unfold, along with others, I feel unsure whether voting could realistically have closed the gaping void between the countries on either side of this issue. In other words, voting is not a substitute for political will. Fernando Tormos-Aponte, policy lead at the Just Transition Alliance, worries that a voting process might just encourage countries that dislike a negotiated outcome to leave the whole process, as the US has done with the Paris climate agreement. “If [the plastics treaty] becomes too ambitious, the US won’t sign it, just like they didn’t sign Kyoto and just like they eventually withdrew from Paris.” I consulted Alexandra Harrington, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Plastic Pollution Task Force. She sees things slightly differently. Fighting harder for voting at the commencement of the plastics negotiations would have helped, Harrington says, by immediately revealing countries’ true intentions. Despite attempts by massed negotiators, sessions in Geneva last year failed to lead to a global plastics treaty — Newscom / Alamy via Dialogue Earth A vote demanded by the majority in the early days of the treaty may have pushed the blockers to actually consider whether they could commit and negotiate in good faith, or if they would prefer to exit the negotiations. It also helps avoid a situation where ambition is compromised by a minority that may never even ratify the agreement. “I think voting brings more honesty to that process,” says Harrington. Along these lines, some have suggested that those countries that do actually want a treaty – the so-called “coalition of the willing” – could break out of the UN system and begin a new process among themselves. That idea is not unique to the plastics treaty. Frustrations with the creaking, consensus-focused multilateral system also surfaced at COP30. As it ended, Colombia and the Netherlands launched a separate global conference for nations willing to transition away from fossil fuels. A new plastics process that at least includes the world’s major plastics consumers could be effective in reducing production and pollution, experts argue . It could shift the markets, even without the world’s biggest plastics and petrochemicals producers on board. Others say an agreement outside the UN could be effective if it includes China, the world’s biggest plastic producer. This is how you undermine the multilateral system, by making it useless. David Azoulay, Center for International Environmental Law Some national negotiators I spoke to in Geneva said it is important not to knock multilateralism when it is already down, and therefore to stay within the UN. But Azoulay feels the damage is already done, pointing to the plastic treaty process itself: “This is how you undermine the multilateral system, by making it useless.” For most nations, an exit may be a step too far for now. “I believe there’s not enough appetite to move outside of the UN system,” says Felix Wertli, Switzerland’s lead negotiator in the plastics treaty process. An alternative could be for some of the measures of the plastic treaty to be adopted under an existing international agreement, such as the 1989 Basel Convention, Wertli says. That convention includes the possibility to vote. The plastics treaty process will continue in some form. The next step is for countries to elect a new chair to replace Valdievieso at a one-day meeting scheduled for February. This meeting won’t include formal negotiations but countries can raise procedural issues. Harrington says voting rules could come up. Formal negotiations are due to resume at some point after that. Voting is still an option. As Harrington points out, it is hibernating in the rules of procedure, ready to be reawakened by a party bold enough to roll the diplomatic dice: “You need one country that is willing to just put its hand up and say, okay, we’re calling for a vote.” Future momentum Amid the various twists and turns of the plastics treaty process, one thing seemed clear to me throughout: there is huge momentum to reach a deal. It is embodied by the activists who turned up, year after year and at great expense, to fight for the cause. It is in the mounting science, and the raw emotion of negotiators who wept in the final plenary. But even as that momentum grows, tonnes of plastic continue to be churned out, advancing one of the planet’s richest and most destructive industries. While many mourn the treaty’s apparent collapse, some are celebrating it. Ultimately, the world’s majority wants a treaty that begins to reduce the damaging impact of plastic on people and planet. History will judge the treaty by whether it achieves that goal.

      "summary_en": "Three years ago, the international effort to create a binding treaty to end plastic pollution started with an explosion of hope. Last year it collapsed. This has stalled the birth of an agreement that could begin to rein in production of a fossil-fuel-based material that is harming ecosystems on every part of Earth. The treaty seemed to be the latest victim of a struggling multilateral system. Shifting geopolitics, changing national positions and the global influence of fossil fuels are frustrating the broader work of curbing climate change – humanity’s common interest. I reported on the plastics negotiations over this period, watching as 184 countries seemed increasingly unable to find common ground. With so much at stake, one absence in particular seemed to weaken the process: the ability, when countries could not reach full consensus, to make a decision anyway based on a two-thirds majority vote. Arcane as it sounds, this omission lurked behind some of the most dramatic negotiation scenes, and still haunts other environmental processes today, including the UN’s climate negotiations. This is the story of how voting is an ever-present obstacle to the global plastics treaty, what it reveals about political will, and why, despite the process fizzling out, I believe there is still a desire in many quarters to reach an ambitious deal. Resistance mounts against a vote Paris, France, May 2024: When countries gathered to begin textual negotiations on the plastics treaty, a small group soon began to question the rules of procedure. Though hard to detect behind the practised calm of negotiators, a mighty conflict was brewing. Saudi Arabia, backed by Iran, India, Brazil and China, took the floor. They challenged a standard rule in UN negotiations that allows a decision to be passed by a two-thirds majority when consensus cannot been reached. After hours of plenary statements and rebuttals, Saudi Arabia delivered the clincher. It would “not be moving forward [with negotiations] until the rule is bracketed”. Words are bracketed in international negotiations to indicate disagreement over their inclusion in the final text. Requesting brackets at this stage was an attempt to kick voting into the long grass. Negotiators ultimately spent two of their five days wrangling over this point, until – anxiously watching the clock – they effectively agreed to bracket the voting rule. The decision was accompanied by a statement noting the issue still hadn’t been resolved, in case it came up in a future discussion. But that discussion never came, and the voting rule was never applied. To the treaty novice I was at the time, it wasn’t immediately clear why this mattered. But treaty die-hards saw eerie echoes of what had happened at the start of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process to negotiate curbs on greenhouse gas emissions. Back in 1991, a group of petrochemical-rich countries wrestled the voting rules for UNFCCC negotiations into brackets, where they have now been gathering dust for 35 years. Many people told me this move has been responsible for slow action on climate change today. Voting is standard in other multilateral environmental agreements. The High Seas Treaty, the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions on dangerous chemicals, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, for example, all allow decisions by a majority vote. That being said, those UN environmental agreements that allow voting still prefer consensus, reserving voting for decision deadlocks. The desire to avoid a vote pushes countries “to find common ground” instead of overriding a minority, says David Azoulay, senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law: “Knowing a vote is possible is all you need to create the incentive to actually negotiate in good faith. Because nobody wants to find themselves on the losing end of a vote.” Without that pressure, a country may simply veto a decision it dislikes, potentially due to vested interests. Where environmental issues intersect with economic interests, that is a particular risk. In the UNFCCC process, “petrostates succeeded in arranging consensus as the rule of procedure” and have thereby stalled progress since 1991. That’s according to Nona Chai, programme coordinator for the Just Transition Alliance, a coalition of environmental justice groups and labour unions. The plastics treaty negotiations attracted many lobbyists, interested groups and protestors, including these at the Geneva headquarters of the UN  — Salvatore Di Nolfi / Associated Press / Alamy via Dialogue Earth Last year, Chai attended the COP30 climate conference in Brazil. She says the no-voting norm has made it easier to block key proposals, such as language previously agreed at COP28 on “transitioning away from fossil fuels”. This was opposed by Saudi Arabia and a handful of others, and ultimately removed from COP30’s final text. Many of the same countries now seem to see plastic as a way to keep extracting the fossil fuels that underpin their economies. Production limits brought on by a global plastics treaty could threaten that. What unfolded during 2023’s Paris plastics talks , therefore, triggered alarm bells that the same old tactics were being used. ‘Us’ and ‘them’ Busan, South Korea, November 2024: Journalists jostled into the press room, briefly warming the frigid air of the cavernous conference centre, where the fifth (and supposedly final) plastics treaty meeting was underway. A panel of negotiators were making a rare speech, about a proposal to reduce global plastic production to sustainable levels. Most country delegates, civil society representatives and scientists in attendance believed production limits were key to a successful treaty. This is in line with the 2022 UN Environment Assembly resolution that created these negotiations. It mandated that the talks should tackle pollution across the entire plastic lifecycle. But over the preceding four meetings, countries had broadly split into factions for and against this issue. Several factors had stoked the division. At the third meeting in Nairobi in November 2023, a cluster of petrochemical-producing countries formed the “like-minded group”. It pushed for waste management over production cuts. A fourth meeting, in Ottawa in April 2024, featured aggressive pro-plastic ad campaigns and almost 200 petrochemical lobbyists, exposing corporate influence on the process. By the Busan meeting, the US – a major treaty player – had started rolling back its support for production cuts. (Later, under President Trump, this evolved into an allegiance with oil-rich states, and secret pressure on countries to reject production limits.) The press briefing in Busan made it clear that the majority was trying to keep a production limit on the negotiating table. Wearing his trademark straw hat, Panama’s lead negotiator, Juan Carlos Monterrey-Gomez, said countries opposing limits had “not moved a centimetre”. He urged them to negotiate to meet the majority halfway. And with something approaching anger, he had a message for those unwilling to do so: “Please leave it to the rest of us and get out of the way.” If anyone was looking for a sign that multilateralism was flailing, this atypical “us” and “them” framing was it. Behind the scenes, the like-minded minority had been suggesting “no text” or “no article” on production reduction, meaning no mention of it. “When we started to talk about the text among those of us who wanted it, they didn’t want to have that conversation,” Dennis Clare, a negotiator for Micronesia, told me at the time. He said they used several tactics to shut it down. “It was an impasse.” Meanwhile, I watched as these countries kept raising the importance of consensus in plenaries and public statements – despite reportedly not engaging in the normal processes of discussion and compromise needed to reach it. This tendency has crept into other multilateral spaces. Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement, told Carbon Brief that “consensus” has come to be misunderstood as “unanimity”. A decision doesn’t actually need the unreserved agreement of everyone. In difficult decisions of all shades, consensus is achieved through flexibility and compromise, delivering a compromise that all parties are satisfied with, if not necessarily ecstatic about. In Busan, it seemed, the fears expressed 18 months prior in Paris had become real. Without voting, a handful of countries hiding behind the cover of consensus had been emboldened to veto the majority. Cacophonous collapse Geneva, Switzerland, August 2025: On a sweltering summer night, exhausted delegates gathered on a manicured lawn at the UN headquarters in Geneva — Emma Bryce via Dialogue Earth It was the final day of the sixth UN plastics treaty meeting, called after the fifth in Busan had failed to reach an agreement. People had been waiting hours for the final text. Just before midnight, everyone was summoned into the vast plenary hall, and an expectant hush fell. But then Luis Vayas Valdievieso , the meeting’s chair, explained that the treaty was still not ready. “This plenary is adjourned!”, he boomed, banging his gavel down. Almost 4,000 delegates let out a roar of frustration. At 31 seconds, it was the shortest plenary in UN history. It seemed to symbolise a process in crisis. The anticipated text was expected to be a significant upgrade on a draft Valdievieso had released the day before, which had provoked widespread outrage and despair. It remains unclear why, but that draft barely resembled what most negotiators wanted. A section on production controls was replaced with pollution measures only, language on regulating harmful plastic chemicals was erased and the agreement was no longer legally binding. Camila Zepeda, Mexico’s lead negotiator, described that draft to me as “an empty shell.” The text had been roundly rejected, pushing countries back into negotiations to try and develop another draft. That still wasn’t ready by the midnight plenary on the final day. When Valdievieso gavelled that bafflingly brief plenary to a close, the meeting moved into overtime and he held informal meetings with countries to try and reach some resolution. Ultimately, they could not agree on a final text. At a final closing plenary just after 5am, Colombia captured the sense of frustration, saying the process had been “consistently blocked by a small number of states who simply don’t want an agreement”. Two months later, Valdievieso resigned as chair. A vote for the future How different would things be if voting had been part of this fraught process? Azoulay feels sure it would have at least brought an agreement “very, very much closer”. Voting in multilateral environment agreements, intended as a last resort, has become one of the only available tools to defend multilateralism. Having watched the process unfold, along with others, I feel unsure whether voting could realistically have closed the gaping void between the countries on either side of this issue. In other words, voting is not a substitute for political will. Fernando Tormos-Aponte, policy lead at the Just Transition Alliance, worries that a voting process might just encourage countries that dislike a negotiated outcome to leave the whole process, as the US has done with the Paris climate agreement. “If [the plastics treaty] becomes too ambitious, the US won’t sign it, just like they didn’t sign Kyoto and just like they eventually withdrew from Paris.” I consulted Alexandra Harrington, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Plastic Pollution Task Force. She sees things slightly differently. Fighting harder for voting at the commencement of the plastics negotiations would have helped, Harrington says, by immediately revealing countries’ true intentions. Despite attempts by massed negotiators, sessions in Geneva last year failed to lead to a global plastics treaty — Newscom / Alamy via Dialogue Earth A vote demanded by the majority in the early days of the treaty may have pushed the blockers to actually consider whether they could commit and negotiate in good faith, or if they would prefer to exit the negotiations. It also helps avoid a situation where ambition is compromised by a minority that may never even ratify the agreement. “I think voting brings more honesty to that process,” says Harrington. Along these lines, some have suggested that those countries that do actually want a treaty – the so-called “coalition of the willing” – could break out of the UN system and begin a new process among themselves. That idea is not unique to the plastics treaty. Frustrations with the creaking, consensus-focused multilateral system also surfaced at COP30. As it ended, Colombia and the Netherlands launched a separate global conference for nations willing to transition away from fossil fuels. A new plastics process that at least includes the world’s major plastics consumers could be effective in reducing production and pollution, experts argue . It could shift the markets, even without the world’s biggest plastics and petrochemicals producers on board. Others say an agreement outside the UN could be effective if it includes China, the world’s biggest plastic producer. This is how you undermine the multilateral system, by making it useless.

      "title_orig": "MQM-P demands Karachi be made ‘federal territory’, be declared ‘financial capital’",
      "summary_orig": "Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Mustafa Kamal on Thursday called on the federal government to declare Karachi a federal territory by making it the country’s “financial capital”. The remarks come against the backdrop of the Gul Plaza inferno in the metropolis, which has resulted in lawmakers stressing the need for reforms in the city’s administration, particularly in local governments (LGs). Kamal, addressing a press conference today, called on the federal government to “invoke Article 148 and 149 of the Constitution, and declare Karachi as the financial capital of the country”. Article 148 of the Constitution pertains to the obligation of provinces and the federation, while Article 149 allows the federal government to issue directives to provinces in certain cases. Article 149 enables the federal government to direct provincial governments regarding the “manner in which the executive authority thereof is to be exercised for the purpose of preventing any grave menace to the peace or tranquillity or economic life”. Kamal stressed that given the potential of the metropolis, “it can not be given to such a provincial administration”, referring to the ruling PPP in Sindh. “We have an administrative capital, but Karachi should be made a financial capital,” he reiterated, adding that the demand for provinces can be addressed later. “A city that runs the entire country cannot remain under an administration engaging in democratic terrorism,” the MQM-P leader claimed. Kamal insisted that the current city administration was “turning people against the state” by “disenfranchising them”, and cautioned that Pakistan’s enemies stood to gain from such a situation. ‘PPP taking unfair advantage of 18th Amendment’ The MQM-P leader further claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage of the 18th Amendment”, alleging that it was being “used against us (Karachi citizens)”. “End this 18th Amendment drama now,” Kamal said. He also reiterated the party’s demand for strengthening the LG system. Recalling the discussions ahead of the 27th Constitutional Amendment passed in November last year, he said that “even the prime minister agreed to the local government reforms”. “The cabinet, including Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Tanveer and Rana Sanaullah, supported it unequivocally. However, the PPP was the sole party which refused to comply,” the MQM-P leader said. “They threatened to pull out from voting for the other clauses in the Amendment, so we had to retreat,” Kamal added, echoing his stance of the PPP creating a “deadlock”. The MQM-P has been calling for empowering LGs for a long time, even tying its support for the 26th and 27th Amendments to the inclusion of related provisions in Article 140A . However, after both amendments did not address the matter, the party claimed that its suggested constitutional tweaks would now be advanced as the 28th constitutional amendment . On Tuesday, the National Assembly session also echoed with calls for empowering LGs as lawmakers voiced their concerns over the deadly Gul Plaza tragedy. MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units”, and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif also favoured strengthening LGs for better city management. Memon assails MQM-P for ‘politicising’ Gul Plaza fire On the other hand, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon lashed out at the MQM-P for “politicising” the Gul Plaza incident. Addressing a press conference in Karachi, he regretted that “certain parties” were attempting to politicise the Gul Plaza fire incident, and asserted that the Sindh government was displaying “great patience”. “You call yourself the entire city’s party, so you have the full right to criticise, but they start making other sorts of statements in the guise of criticism,” Memon said, indirectly mentioning Kamal’s press conference from a while before. “Will ending the 18th Amendment and handing over Karachi to the Centre prevent such incidents?” the PPP minister asked. “We are not evading our responsibility,” he asserted, acknowledging that the protection of the public’s life and property. He quipped, “This (Gul Plaza fire) was an incident. […] But those who have carried out such incidents in this city with their hands are making such remarks. “Those parties are talking that have even burned people alive for extortion,” he alleged. Memon said he was “forced to respond” as “serious allegations” were being made against his party. “The Baldia factory was set on fire , innocent people were deprived of their lives, and the human hunting game was played on May 12, 2007 , […] such statements from your mouth do not suit you.” The PPP leader then played some old video clips of Kamal, wherein he could be heard making allegations against his current party leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and coalition ally PML-N, as well as hurling abuses in public. Memon said he had responses for each statement made by Kamal, but he would “not fall in that trap”. The PPP leader questioned why Kamal, being the federal health minister, had not paid a visit to Gul Plaza or asked if his help was needed in any matter. “When your quaid (Altaf Hussain) used to give a strike call, when your workers used to count a score of 100 and kill people on the roads, and when bodies in sacks were found daily, did you not remember humanity then?” Responding to a query, Memon said he was unable to “comprehend the objective” of the recent statements made by Kamal and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif . Speaking on the Gul Plaza incident, Memon affirmed that the Sindh government was working on the “one-point agenda” of returning the remains of the victims to their loved ones. “Neither can there be a price for a valuable life, nor can there be any substitute,” the minister said, reiterating that the government stood with the survivors during this “difficult time”. Of the 1,200 shops in Gul Plaza that suffered damage, he said: “We will not argue about how many of these were legal and how many were built afterwards. Whoever has suffered damages and however much, the Sindh government has said that it stands with them and considers it its responsibility to get them back on their feet.” Memon added that the government was also planning on giving interest-free loans to shop owners of Gul Plaza to help them. According to Memon, Sindh’s Rescue 1122 received 1,094 reports of fire incidents across Karachi in 2025, while 84 such incidents were reported this month so far. “It will come forward how this incident happened, how rescue efforts were carried out — if there is any shortcoming anywhere, the government will take action against it,” he said.",

Addressing a press conference in Karachi, he regretted that “certain parties” were attempting to politicise the Gul Plaza fire incident, and asserted that the Sindh government was displaying “great patience”. “You call yourself the entire city’s party, so you have the full right to criticise, but they start making other sorts of statements in the guise of criticism,” Memon said, indirectly mentioning Kamal’s press conference from a while before. “Will ending the 18th Amendment and handing over Karachi to the Centre prevent such incidents?” the PPP minister asked. “We are not evading our responsibility,” he asserted, acknowledging that the protection of the public’s life and property. He quipped, “This (Gul Plaza fire) was an incident. […] But those who have carried out such incidents in this city with their hands are making such remarks. “Those parties are talking that have even burned people alive for extortion,” he alleged. Memon said he was “forced to respond” as “serious allegations” were being made against his party. “The Baldia factory was set on fire , innocent people were deprived of their lives, and the human hunting game was played on May 12, 2007 , […] such statements from your mouth do not suit you.” The PPP leader then played some old video clips of Kamal, wherein he could be heard making allegations against his current party leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and coalition ally PML-N, as well as hurling abuses in public. Memon said he had responses for each statement made by Kamal, but he would “not fall in that trap”. The PPP leader questioned why Kamal, being the federal health minister, had not paid a visit to Gul Plaza or asked if his help was needed in any matter. “When your quaid (Altaf Hussain) used to give a strike call, when your workers used to count a score of 100 and kill people on the roads, and when bodies in sacks were found daily, did you not remember humanity then?” Responding to a query, Memon said he was unable to “comprehend the objective” of the recent statements made by Kamal and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif . Speaking on the Gul Plaza incident, Memon affirmed that the Sindh government was working on the “one-point agenda” of returning the remains of the victims to their loved ones. “Neither can there be a price for a valuable life, nor can there be any substitute,” the minister said, reiterating that the government stood with the survivors during this “difficult time”. Of the 1,200 shops in Gul Plaza that suffered damage, he said: “We will not argue about how many of these were legal and how many were built afterwards. Whoever has suffered damages and however much, the Sindh government has said that it stands with them and considers it its responsibility to get them back on their feet.” Memon added that the government was also planning on giving interest-free loans to shop owners of Gul Plaza to help them. According to Memon, Sindh’s Rescue 1122 received 1,094 reports of fire incidents across Karachi in 2025, while 84 such incidents were reported this month so far. “It will come forward how this incident happened, how rescue efforts were carried out — if there is any shortcoming anywhere, the government will take action against it,” he said.",
      "title": "MQM-P demands Karachi be made ‘federal territory’, be declared ‘financial capital’",
      "summary": "Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Mustafa Kamal on Thursday called on the federal government to declare Karachi a federal territory by making it the country’s “financial capital”. The remarks come against the backdrop of the Gul Plaza inferno in the metropolis, which has resulted in lawmakers stressing the need for reforms in the city’s administration, particularly in local governments (LGs). Kamal, addressing a press conference today, called on the federal government to “invoke Article 148 and 149 of the Constitution, and declare Karachi as the financial capital of the country”. Article 148 of the Constitution pertains to the obligation of provinces and the federation, while Article 149 allows the federal government to issue directives to provinces in certain cases. Article 149 enables the federal government to direct provincial governments regarding the “manner in which the executive authority thereof is to be exercised for the purpose of preventing any grave menace to the peace or tranquillity or economic life”. Kamal stressed that given the potential of the metropolis, “it can not be given to such a provincial administration”, referring to the ruling PPP in Sindh. “We have an administrative capital, but Karachi should be made a financial capital,” he reiterated, adding that the demand for provinces can be addressed later. “A city that runs the entire country cannot remain under an administration engaging in democratic terrorism,” the MQM-P leader claimed. Kamal insisted that the current city administration was “turning people against the state” by “disenfranchising them”, and cautioned that Pakistan’s enemies stood to gain from such a situation. ‘PPP taking unfair advantage of 18th Amendment’ The MQM-P leader further claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage of the 18th Amendment”, alleging that it was being “used against us (Karachi citizens)”. “End this 18th Amendment drama now,” Kamal said. He also reiterated the party’s demand for strengthening the LG system. Recalling the discussions ahead of the 27th Constitutional Amendment passed in November last year, he said that “even the prime minister agreed to the local government reforms”. “The cabinet, including Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Tanveer and Rana Sanaullah, supported it unequivocally. However, the PPP was the sole party which refused to comply,” the MQM-P leader said. “They threatened to pull out from voting for the other clauses in the Amendment, so we had to retreat,” Kamal added, echoing his stance of the PPP creating a “deadlock”. The MQM-P has been calling for empowering LGs for a long time, even tying its support for the 26th and 27th Amendments to the inclusion of related provisions in Article 140A . However, after both amendments did not address the matter, the party claimed that its suggested constitutional tweaks would now be advanced as the 28th constitutional amendment . On Tuesday, the National Assembly session also echoed with calls for empowering LGs as lawmakers voiced their concerns over the deadly Gul Plaza tragedy. MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units”, and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif also favoured strengthening LGs for better city management. Memon assails MQM-P for ‘politicising’ Gul Plaza fire On the other hand, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon lashed out at the MQM-P for “politicising” the Gul Plaza incident.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump repeatedly made an apparent gaffe in a speech Wednesday to world leaders assembled in Switzerland by referring to “Iceland” several times instead of his much coveted “Greenland”, with the White House furiously denying any confusion on his part. The 79-year-old Republican has been clamoring for the United States to acquire Greenland, a large island territory of Denmark, citing what he called security threats from Russia and China in the Arctic Circle. On Wednesday he announced a “ framework ” for a future deal on Greenland and the cancellation of planned tariffs on European countries that had opposed his moves to control the island — but not before ruffling Nato allies and straining transatlantic relations. “I’m helping Nato, and until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,” Trump said during his remarks to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. “They’re not there for us on Iceland — that I can tell you. I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money.” It seemed obvious he was referring to Greenland and not the smaller neighbouring Iceland, an island in the North Atlantic famous for its breathtaking volcanic landscapes. After the speech, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back against a post on X by a journalist, Libbey Dean, who wrote that “President Trump appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland around three times.” “No he didn’t, Libby.

      "summary_orig": "• Rule out use of force, lifts tariff threat against European countries • European Parliament suspends work on EU-US trade deal DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had reached a framework for a deal over Greenland following a meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte, and that he would therefore waive tariffs scheduled to hit European allies. In a speech on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump for the first time ruled out using force, but demanded “immediate negotiations” to acquire the island from Denmark. “We have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Meanwhile, the European Parliament decided to suspend its work on a trade deal between the 27-member bloc and the United States, a parliament member said, following President Trump’s repeated threats to take control over Greenland. The US president did not provide any details on the framework, but added that his threatened tariffs against European countries which were resisting his quest to acquire Greenland was now off the table. “Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,” Trump wrote. In a speech that veered from topic to topic, Trump also expressed hope of ending the Ukraine war soon. Trump’s quest to take the strategic Arctic island of Greenland from Nato ally Denmark has deeply shaken the global order and markets. “We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher after his speech, and jumped further following his post. Trump insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China. But Trump appeared to take the threat of military action off the table, in a dramatic turnaround from his previous threats that the US could use force to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island. “We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher on Wednesday after Trump’s comments. Denmark said it was a “positive” sign that Trump had said he wanted to avoid military force — but stressed that the US president had not backed away from his push to acquire Greenland. “What is quite clear after this speech is that the president’s ambition remains intact,” Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said. Greenland’s government meanwhile unveiled a new brochure on Wednesday offering advice to the population in the event of a “crisis” in the territory, saying it was an “insurance policy”. ‘Immediate negotiations’ Trump repeatedly pushed his claims to Greenland — which he mistakenly called Iceland several times — during lengthy remarks on the deepest crisis in transatlantic relations for decades. He said he was “seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States” and added that Washington would “remember” if Denmark said no. Trump says Greenland is under threat from Russia and China. The US president also lambasted Europe on a number of fronts from security to tariffs and the economy, saying it was “not heading in the right direction”. Trump flew into Davos by helicopter, stepping onto a red carpet laid in the snow — but he flew into a growing international storm over Greenland. He arrived some two hours behind schedule, after an electrical issue earlier forced Air Force One to turn back to Washington and the president to switch planes. Europe and Canada had earlier closed ranks against what they view as a threat to the US-led global order from Trump’s territorial ambitions. French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said Europe would not be bullied. But Trump, who was due to meet a number of leaders in Davos, renewed his attacks on the two leaders, mocking Macron in particular for wearing sunglasses at Davos, which the French president said was because of an eye condition. ‘Thoughtful diplomacy’ Trump also repeatedly expressed doubts on Nato during his speech, saying Washington was treated “so unfairly” and questioning whether the alliance would defend the United States if asked. Nato chief Mark Rutte, whom Trump was due to meet in Davos, said that “thoughtful diplomacy” was needed to resolve the crisis. The Greenland row has also soured relations with the European Union, which has threatened countermeasures after Trump vowed tariffs of up to 25pc on eight European countries for backing Denmark. UN chief warns UN chief Antonio Guterres warned on Wednesday of world leaders upending international order in a statement made as President Donald Trump said the United States needs to acquire Greenland in a hardline speech at Davos. “When leaders run roughshod over international law, picking & choosing which rules to follow — they are undermining global order & setting a perilous precedent,” Guterres said on X. “When a handful of individuals can bend global narratives, sway elections, or dictate the terms of public debate, we are facing inequality and the corruption of institutions.” Published in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",

The US president did not provide any details on the framework, but added that his threatened tariffs against European countries which were resisting his quest to acquire Greenland was now off the table. “Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,” Trump wrote. In a speech that veered from topic to topic, Trump also expressed hope of ending the Ukraine war soon. Trump’s quest to take the strategic Arctic island of Greenland from Nato ally Denmark has deeply shaken the global order and markets. “We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher after his speech, and jumped further following his post. Trump insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China. But Trump appeared to take the threat of military action off the table, in a dramatic turnaround from his previous threats that the US could use force to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island. “We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher on Wednesday after Trump’s comments. Denmark said it was a “positive” sign that Trump had said he wanted to avoid military force — but stressed that the US president had not backed away from his push to acquire Greenland. “What is quite clear after this speech is that the president’s ambition remains intact,” Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said. Greenland’s government meanwhile unveiled a new brochure on Wednesday offering advice to the population in the event of a “crisis” in the territory, saying it was an “insurance policy”. ‘Immediate negotiations’ Trump repeatedly pushed his claims to Greenland — which he mistakenly called Iceland several times — during lengthy remarks on the deepest crisis in transatlantic relations for decades. He said he was “seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States” and added that Washington would “remember” if Denmark said no. Trump says Greenland is under threat from Russia and China. The US president also lambasted Europe on a number of fronts from security to tariffs and the economy, saying it was “not heading in the right direction”. Trump flew into Davos by helicopter, stepping onto a red carpet laid in the snow — but he flew into a growing international storm over Greenland. He arrived some two hours behind schedule, after an electrical issue earlier forced Air Force One to turn back to Washington and the president to switch planes. Europe and Canada had earlier closed ranks against what they view as a threat to the US-led global order from Trump’s territorial ambitions. French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said Europe would not be bullied. But Trump, who was due to meet a number of leaders in Davos, renewed his attacks on the two leaders, mocking Macron in particular for wearing sunglasses at Davos, which the French president said was because of an eye condition. ‘Thoughtful diplomacy’ Trump also repeatedly expressed doubts on Nato during his speech, saying Washington was treated “so unfairly” and questioning whether the alliance would defend the United States if asked. Nato chief Mark Rutte, whom Trump was due to meet in Davos, said that “thoughtful diplomacy” was needed to resolve the crisis. The Greenland row has also soured relations with the European Union, which has threatened countermeasures after Trump vowed tariffs of up to 25pc on eight European countries for backing Denmark. UN chief warns UN chief Antonio Guterres warned on Wednesday of world leaders upending international order in a statement made as President Donald Trump said the United States needs to acquire Greenland in a hardline speech at Davos. “When leaders run roughshod over international law, picking & choosing which rules to follow — they are undermining global order & setting a perilous precedent,” Guterres said on X. “When a handful of individuals can bend global narratives, sway elections, or dictate the terms of public debate, we are facing inequality and the corruption of institutions.” Published in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",
