      "title_orig": "‘Welcome step’: PM hails Malaysian announcement of import of Halal meat worth $200m from Pakistan",
      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed on Monday his Malaysian counterpart’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”, which he said would further augment engagement in this sector between the countries. The PM’s remarks came in a post on X after he addressed a joint press conference alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya following bilateral talks between the two leaders. PM Shehbaz had also mentioned during the press conference that the Malaysian premier had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan. PM Shehbaz, who reached Malaysia yesterday on a state visit, further shared in his post that he had a “most productive exchange of views with my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya today”. “We held wide-ranging discussions on ways to further strengthen our historic partnership — focusing on trade and investment, climate, defence, education, and tourism.” The prime minister added that the two leaders also had an in-depth discussion on regional and global developments, including the situation in the Middle East and South Asia. Both prime ministers “reaffirmed our shared resolve to continue working together for the peace, progress, and prosperity of our peoples,” PM Shehbaz said. Mentioning a “gracious and impressive welcome ceremony at Perdana Putra”, he thanked the Malaysian PM for the “warm and generous hospitality extended to me and my delegation”. Moreover, he said, “We also reflected on Allama Iqbal’s philosophy that the strength of a nation and the destiny of its people lie in the awakening of the self. It is through faith, effort, and perseverance that people shape their destiny. “Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and I shared our deep admiration for Allama Iqbal, whose message of faith and self-renewal continues to inspire generations across the Muslim world.” PM concluded his post saying that he was “looking forward to continued Pakistan–Malaysia collaboration across all areas of mutual interest”. ‘Pakistan wants to join hands for mutually beneficial projects’ Earlier, PM Shehbaz said during the press conference with Ibrahim alongside him that Pakistan wanted to “join hands” with Malaysia for mutually beneficial projects which allowed for expertise from the two countries to come together. PM Shehbaz began his media talk by thanking Ibrahim on behalf of the people of Pakistan for extending an exceptionally warm welcome to the visiting delegation and called the country a “second home”. “This is my first visit to your great country but believe me, ever since we arrived here last night, I [see] familiar faces — very cordial, very warm — as if we have known each other for ages and that stems from sincerity of purpose and very true friendship. It’s like a family reunion,” he said. “The way you are focused on building your great country into one of the most strong economies in the region and around the globe speaks volumes about your leadership skills, vision, and dynamism,” the premier said. PM Shehbaz said that he and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and they had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters during a meeting held prior to the joint presser. “I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations. “Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic and trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas. “Today, I want to make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said. The premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger,” he said. He noted that Ibrahim, in his remarks, had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism. “It  will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will  achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come it will increase and  have a quantum jump,” he said. The premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development. “These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said. He further said that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”. “When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before,” he said. Talking about Pakistan’s youth and their potential, he said, “If we can really dedicate ourselves to injecting modern technology in their souls, they will be great hands, great builders of Pakistan. I have no doubt about it,” he said. He concluded his remarks by expressing the wish for Malaysia to continue prospering. Later, the two premiers also witnessed an exchange of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between Pakistan and Malaysia. PM Ibrahim ‘extremely appreciative’ of Pakistan’s stance on Palestine In his remarks, the Malaysian premier acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities. He said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan. He stated there was also an interest regarding importing meat and Malaysia would facilitate this, noting that Shehbaz had mentioned exports worth $200 million. Ibrahim humourously quipped that when he visited PM Shehbaz at his hotel at night, the latter “politely suggested” this but also “harassed”. “So I certainly welcome that and will discuss with my team,” he said. Calling PM Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). “Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said. Regarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism. He also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestine and Gaza issue. “We jointly look favourably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald Trump. Although Malaysia does express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave. “Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said. PM given guard of honour After the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.” “He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said. “The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said. PM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office. According to Radio Pakistan , Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier. Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement. “I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight. Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added. ‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’ The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact. “The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read. It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.” Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.",

PM Shehbaz said that he and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and they had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters during a meeting held prior to the joint presser. “I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations. “Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic and trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas. “Today, I want to make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said. The premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger,” he said. He noted that Ibrahim, in his remarks, had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism. “It  will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will  achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come it will increase and  have a quantum jump,” he said. The premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development. “These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said. He further said that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”. “When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before,” he said. Talking about Pakistan’s youth and their potential, he said, “If we can really dedicate ourselves to injecting modern technology in their souls, they will be great hands, great builders of Pakistan. I have no doubt about it,” he said. He concluded his remarks by expressing the wish for Malaysia to continue prospering. Later, the two premiers also witnessed an exchange of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between Pakistan and Malaysia. PM Ibrahim ‘extremely appreciative’ of Pakistan’s stance on Palestine In his remarks, the Malaysian premier acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities. He said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan. He stated there was also an interest regarding importing meat and Malaysia would facilitate this, noting that Shehbaz had mentioned exports worth $200 million. Ibrahim humourously quipped that when he visited PM Shehbaz at his hotel at night, the latter “politely suggested” this but also “harassed”. “So I certainly welcome that and will discuss with my team,” he said. Calling PM Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). “Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said. Regarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism. He also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestine and Gaza issue. “We jointly look favourably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald Trump. Although Malaysia does express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave. “Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said. PM given guard of honour After the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.” “He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said. “The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said. PM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office. According to Radio Pakistan , Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier. Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement. “I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight. Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added. ‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’ The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact. “The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read. It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.” Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.",

      "summary_orig": "The president said an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fight planned at the White House will take place on Donald Trump’s 80th birthday, despite the much-hyped event previously being announced for July 4. “On June 14 next year, we’re going to have a big UFC fight at the White House — right at the White House, on the grounds of the White House,” Trump told a crowd of Navy sailors at the huge naval base Norfolk in Virginia. He did not mention that June 14 is his birthday or that next year will be his 80th. This year, on Trump’s 79th birthday, he held a military parade to commemorate the founding of the US Army. In August, UFC boss Dana White said the mixed martial arts bout at the White House would be held on July 4 next year, the day the United States marks the 250th anniversary of its founding. Trump has been a regular guest at the often-bloody UFC contests , where fighters punch, kick, and grapple with their opponent in a no-holds-barred battle to submission or knockout. Bringing the brutal combat sport to the centre of US political power will mark a historic first. At a press conference shared on UFC’s YouTube channel, White said that early next year, “we’ll start looking at building the White House card, which I will right now tell you will be the greatest fight card ever assembled in the history of this company.” UFC is the largest and most successful organisation in the burgeoning world of MMA, a blend of martial arts disciplines like jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, boxing, and wrestling. Bouts take place in an eight-sided ring — dubbed “The Octagon” —bounded by a chainlink fence. With few exceptions — such as eye-gouging — male and female fighters are allowed to employ almost any technique to attack their opponent. The sport’s popularity with young men — a key demographic in the 2024 US election — and Trump’s long association with the UFC have made the president a regular fixture at some of its more high-profile events, where he is greeted like a rock star. Its brutal nature and high injury rate mean the sport is controversial, with doctors decrying the potential for brain damage amongst fighters who are repeatedly hit in the head, though it has gained increasing mainstream acceptance in recent years.",

In an address to mark the 1973 war between Israel and Egypt that led to the end of Israel’s occupation of the Sinai peninsula, Sisi said on Monday: I can only extend my praise and appreciation for US President Donald Trump for his initiative that seeks a ceasefire in Gaza after two years of war, genocide, killing and destruction. A ceasefire, the return of prisoners and detainees, the reconstruction of Gaza and the launch of a peaceful political process that leads to the establishment and recognition of the Palestinian state means we are on the right path to lasting peace and stability.

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office said on Monday it was making efforts for the safe evacuation of former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Muhstaq Ahmad Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, and hoped that the process could be “successfully concluded within the next couple of days”. Mushtaq led the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF). The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it and detained the activists on board. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, through its embassy in Amman, is working tirelessly to secure the safe evacuation of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan,” the FO said in a statement. “With the invaluable assistance of the Jordanian government, we are hopeful that the process can be successfully concluded within the next couple of days,” the FO said. The statement also expressed deep gratitude to the “brotherly” government of Jordan for “their exemplary cooperation and generous support”. Last week, Pakistan and several other countries condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the GSF. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for the release of those detained by Israel. “We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release,“ he said in a post on X on Thursday. In a later post, he commended the “dignified participation” of Pakistani activists, including Mushtaq, in the humanitarian mission. “The government of Pakistan … strongly demands the return of its citizens, praying and striving for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the homeland,” he added. On Friday, he assured JI chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman during a telephone conversation that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including Mushtaq. The PM told Naeem that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had been assigned to lead these efforts and coordinate with friendly countries and international organisations. Subsequently, the FO assured in a statement yesterday that it was actively engaged with international partners to ensure the “safety and prompt repatriation of its citizens” who were detained following the interception of the GSF by Israeli forces. Particularly mentioning Mushtaq, the FO said it had been confirmed through the “diplomatic channels of a friendly European country” that Mushtaq was in the custody of Israeli forces, “safe and in good health”. “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis,” the FO added. Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir noted in a post on X today that the activists detained during the Israeli raid were receiving a hero’s welcome upon their return home. “God willing, [former] senator Mushtaq will also return to a hero’s welcome,” he added. Israel had previously blocked attempts to bring aid to Gaza as well. In June, the aid vessel Madleen , carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces.",

      "summary_orig": "A cop was martyred while a Frontier Constabulary (FC) official was injured when a police checkpoint came under attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district, police said on Monday. Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have witnessed terrorist attacks , particularly targeting police personnel. Speaking to Dawn.com , Kohat District Police Officer (DPO) Dr Zahidullah Khan said that a “large number of miscreants” had attacked a checkpoint in Kohat’s Darra Adamkhel from “multiple sides” at 1am. He said that an exchange of fire then took place between the police and the unidentified assailants, which claimed the life of one cop and left an FC official injured. He said that the exchange of fire went on for two-and-a-half hours. “The unidentified assailants aimed to capture the checkpoint, but their attempt was thwarted,” he said, adding that a search operation was currently underway. “Three improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have been recovered so far during the clearance operation,” the DPO said. Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the attack and paid tribute to the martyred cop. In a statement, he also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured. “The sacrifices of the police in the war against terrorism will not go in vain,” he added. The attack comes a day after a soldier was martyred and another injured when unidentified assailants opened fire on them near KP’s Bannu district. On Sept 1, a police constable embra­ced martyrdom and ano­t­her sustained serious injuries in an attack on a police post in Mir Ali. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies. According to a Dawn report , KP remained the most affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.",

On Sept 1, a police constable embra­ced martyrdom and ano­t­her sustained serious injuries in an attack on a police post in Mir Ali. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies. According to a Dawn report , KP remained the most affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: The federal and provincial governments withdrew police and Federal Constabulary security protection to Awami National Party central president Senator Aimal Wali Khan and his family, following his critical speech in the upper house of parliament. The withdrawal of security came despite assurances by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in a personal telephone call to Aimal Wali with the latter thanking the chief minister. However, it transpired later that police personnel were reportedly withdrawn which, the provincial government’s spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif refuted. Meanwhile, the chief minister’s focal person on digital media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi, in a post on social media platform ‘X’ said the provincial government deployed four police personnel for Mr Khan’s security while eight personnel were deployed at his residence in Charsadda district. CM’s focal person says four policemen deployed for ANP leader’s security while eight personnel posted at his residence in Charsadda However, ANP’s central spokesperson said it was an offer which was not accepted as yet. He appreciated the provincial government’s gesture. “We thank the KP government but, also, we can provide security to our provincial president,” he said. Similarly, Walibagh, the residence of Aimal Wali, said that federal government had also withdrawn Federal Constabulary from the abode of ANP chief and his father Asfandyar Wali Khan. On Saturday, federal government withdrew Federal Constabulary personnel deployed for Aimal Wali’s security following his speech wherein he criticised Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir for allegedly presenting samples of rare earth metals to US President Donald Trump in Washington . Aimal Wali, in a tweet on his X account [former twitter] said that federal government/interior ministry took back all the security personnel allotted to him, his father and family. He said that if anything happened to him or his family, the responsibility would rest with the government. “I’ll keep on speaking for the public and am ready for anything coming my way. Yes, I will be moving more securely with private personal and Salaars [referring to ANP workers],” the ANP president tweeted. Soon after the federal government’s decision, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur called Aimal Wali and assured him that the provincial government would make security arrangements for him and his family and directed KP police chief in that regard. On Sunday, however, KP police personnel assigned for security of the ANP president were also called back. None among the police officials took the responsibility while KP police’s security division, established for providing security to VVIPs, bureaucrats and politicians, could not be reached for an official version despite repeated attempts. “It was early in the morning when provincial government also withdrew Aimal Wali’s security and called back police personnel,” ANP central spokesperson Ehsanullah told Dawn . He said that party workers took over security of the ANP president and his father. A statement later issued from Bacha Khan Markaz, the central office of ANP, here said that KP police chief completely disregarded directives of chief minister. He said that Mr Gandapur appeared completely powerless against the group comprising ‘Khaki patrons’ of the hybrid regime entrenched in central government and their political lackeys. It said that Mr Gandapur personally assured Senator Aimal Wali Khan that his security detail would be maintained and not reduced. However, despite assurance, all relevant police personnel were ordered to report back to line duties this [Sunday] morning, he said. The ANP central spokesperson asked Mr Gandapur to clarify his position. He said that the hybrid regime refused to abide by the Constitution concerning provincial autonomy and federation. He said that ANP would devise a comprehensive plan regarding security of its leadership to effectively counter such violations and ensure protection of party leadership. Also, the ANP leadership termed withdrawal of security of the party chief an attack on 18th Amendment. Former chief minister and central leader of ANP Ameer Haider Khan Hoti termed the decision of withdrawing security of Aimal Wali a political revenge and questioned if any political leader’s security would be determined by centre’s likes or dislikes. He also questioned that if asking questions in the parliament was a crime. “Withdrawing [ANP president’s] security for raising Constitutional questions in parliament is an attempt to suppress opposition,” he said. Mr Hoti said in a statement that federal government’s interference in provincial matters was a threat to democracy. He said that provincial police chief refused to follow Mr Gandapur’s orders. On the other hand, KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif refuted the ANP leadership’s claim, saying provincial government did not withdraw Aimal Wali’s security. “If the chief minister has ordered, security will be provided. How it is possible that the chief minister issues orders and security is not provided,” he questioned while talking to Dawn . Published in Dawn, October 6th, 2025",

He also questioned that if asking questions in the parliament was a crime. “Withdrawing [ANP president’s] security for raising Constitutional questions in parliament is an attempt to suppress opposition,” he said. Mr Hoti said in a statement that federal government’s interference in provincial matters was a threat to democracy. He said that provincial police chief refused to follow Mr Gandapur’s orders. On the other hand, KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif refuted the ANP leadership’s claim, saying provincial government did not withdraw Aimal Wali’s security. “If the chief minister has ordered, security will be provided. How it is possible that the chief minister issues orders and security is not provided,” he questioned while talking to Dawn . Published in Dawn, October 6th, 2025",

      "summary": "PESHAWAR: The federal and provincial governments withdrew police and Federal Constabulary security protection to Awami National Party central president Senator Aimal Wali Khan and his family, following his critical speech in the upper house of parliament. The withdrawal of security came despite assurances by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in a personal telephone call to Aimal Wali with the latter thanking the chief minister. However, it transpired later that police personnel were reportedly withdrawn which, the provincial government’s spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif refuted. Meanwhile, the chief minister’s focal person on digital media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi, in a post on social media platform ‘X’ said the provincial government deployed four police personnel for Mr Khan’s security while eight personnel were deployed at his residence in Charsadda district. CM’s focal person says four policemen deployed for ANP leader’s security while eight personnel posted at his residence in Charsadda However, ANP’s central spokesperson said it was an offer which was not accepted as yet. He appreciated the provincial government’s gesture. “We thank the KP government but, also, we can provide security to our provincial president,” he said. Similarly, Walibagh, the residence of Aimal Wali, said that federal government had also withdrawn Federal Constabulary from the abode of ANP chief and his father Asfandyar Wali Khan. On Saturday, federal government withdrew Federal Constabulary personnel deployed for Aimal Wali’s security following his speech wherein he criticised Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir for allegedly presenting samples of rare earth metals to US President Donald Trump in Washington . Aimal Wali, in a tweet on his X account [former twitter] said that federal government/interior ministry took back all the security personnel allotted to him, his father and family. He said that if anything happened to him or his family, the responsibility would rest with the government. “I’ll keep on speaking for the public and am ready for anything coming my way. Yes, I will be moving more securely with private personal and Salaars [referring to ANP workers],” the ANP president tweeted. Soon after the federal government’s decision, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur called Aimal Wali and assured him that the provincial government would make security arrangements for him and his family and directed KP police chief in that regard. On Sunday, however, KP police personnel assigned for security of the ANP president were also called back. None among the police officials took the responsibility while KP police’s security division, established for providing security to VVIPs, bureaucrats and politicians, could not be reached for an official version despite repeated attempts. “It was early in the morning when provincial government also withdrew Aimal Wali’s security and called back police personnel,” ANP central spokesperson Ehsanullah told Dawn . He said that party workers took over security of the ANP president and his father. A statement later issued from Bacha Khan Markaz, the central office of ANP, here said that KP police chief completely disregarded directives of chief minister. He said that Mr Gandapur appeared completely powerless against the group comprising ‘Khaki patrons’ of the hybrid regime entrenched in central government and their political lackeys. It said that Mr Gandapur personally assured Senator Aimal Wali Khan that his security detail would be maintained and not reduced. However, despite assurance, all relevant police personnel were ordered to report back to line duties this [Sunday] morning, he said. The ANP central spokesperson asked Mr Gandapur to clarify his position. He said that the hybrid regime refused to abide by the Constitution concerning provincial autonomy and federation. He said that ANP would devise a comprehensive plan regarding security of its leadership to effectively counter such violations and ensure protection of party leadership. Also, the ANP leadership termed withdrawal of security of the party chief an attack on 18th Amendment. Former chief minister and central leader of ANP Ameer Haider Khan Hoti termed the decision of withdrawing security of Aimal Wali a political revenge and questioned if any political leader’s security would be determined by centre’s likes or dislikes.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Thousands of people, including women and children, marched on Sharea Faisal on Sunday to protest against the genocide in Gaza by Israeli forces, demanding united action from the Islamic world to support the oppressed Muslims. They also warned the government to refrain from endorsing any proposal, including the Abraham Accords, which they said was against the will of the Palestinian people. Dozens of caravans from different parts of the city converged near the Nursery bus stop on Sharea Faisal, where they formed a mammoth rally addressed by leaders of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI). Riding motorbikes, cars, buses and other modes of transport, the participants carried Palestinian flags and placards bearing images of Hamas leaders. JI chief warns Islamabad against joining Abraham Accords The march was organised by the party as a show of solidarity with Gaza, particularly in the backdrop of Israeli aggression against the Freedom Flotilla . In his address, JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman made it clear to Islamabad that any paradigm shift in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine, set by none other than Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, would not be tolerated at any cost. “Even decades ago, the All India Muslim League used to protest against Israel,” he said. “On March 23, 1940, two resolutions were passed by the Muslim League — one was the Pakistan Resolution and the other was for Palestine. There is only one state, and that is Palestine, and there is only one leadership in Gaza, and that is Hamas,” he said while urging the government to recognise Hamas and support it as the legitimate representative of the people of Gaza. “Don’t dare to accept Israel or join the Abraham Accords,” he warned. He said that the United States was directly responsible for the genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza and therefore had no right to deliver lectures on humanity. The JI leader claimed that Israel had failed militarily in Gaza as it could not secure the release of its soldiers from Hamas and was, in fact, engaging with the group in one way or another to secure their freedom. “Hamas is a resistance movement that represents the people of Gaza. However, the ruling class here is not even willing to mention Hamas by name because they fear any movement that originates from the people. The ruling elite dislikes any movement that opposes the US and Israel,” the JI chief added. He also stressed the need for another UN, saying the current one had become a total failure and an “agent” of the US and Israel, having never resolved the issues faced by Muslims. He was of the view that the massacre in Palestine happened not because of Hamas, but because of the cowardly Muslim rulers. “We want to tell the rulers and opposition parties of Pakistan to abandon hypocrisy and double standards. The people of Gaza and Hamas must be accepted, and Hamas offices must be opened in Pakistan,” he said. He also called on Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, currently in Adiala Jail, to express solidarity with Hamas and condemn Israel and the US. “From Karachi’s Keamari to the mountains of Chitral, the public is united in one voice: we will not accept slavery to America,” he said. “Greta Thunberg was tortured and forced to kiss the Israeli flag — this is the real face of the Zionist state,” he added. Other leaders, including Dr Osama Razi, Monem Zafar and Advocate Saifuddin, also addressed the rally. Published in Dawn, October 6th, 2025",

      "title_orig": "Fixing the governance web",
      "summary_orig": "PAKISTAN’S governance structure is often at the centre of national debate. From questions of provincial autonomy to disaster management, and now, calls to redraw the country’s internal boundaries, each of these discussions is rooted in legitimate concerns: unequal development, sluggish service delivery, and political imbalance. Yet too often, the solutions proposed are reactive, fragmented, or short-sighted. Instead of piecemeal fixes like carving out new provinces, separating disaster functions, or rolling back devolution we need a deeper conversation about what kind of governance model Pakistan really needs. Because behind every institutional failure lies a more fundamental problem: a state that struggles to function effectively at both the centre and the grassroots. The 18th Amendment in 2010, was hailed as a democratic milestone. The amendment was designed to empower provinces, dismantle centralised authority, and bring governance closer to the people. More than a decade later, however, it’s time to ask a difficult question: has the devolution of power come at the cost of effective policymaking? In reality it has led to uneven policy implementation across provinces, created jurisdictional ambiguity and exposed the institutional fragility of our system. The provinces, suddenly saddled with vast responsibilities, were neither administratively equipped nor financially ready. The federal government, stripped of much of its role in social sectors, lacked the tools to coordinate national-level strategies. The result: fragmented policy, duplicated efforts, and weak implementation. In times of crisis, we need clarity and a unified command not bureaucratic overlap. But perhaps nowhere is this governance fragmentation more dangerous than in disaster management, particularly in the era of climate change. Pakistan faces one of the world’s highest risks from climate-induced disasters ranging from floods, heatwaves and glacial melts. And yet our disaster architecture remains stuck in reactive mode. Disaster management is not a linear process. It spans risk assessment, early warning, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. Creating two separate institutions, one for risk reduction (National Disaster Risk Management Authority) and another for disaster response (NDMA) breaks this continuum. When a flood hits, will one authority manage the data and mapping while another handles evacuation and relief? In times of crisis, we need clarity and a unified command not bureaucratic overlap and institutional finger-pointing. Global best practices point in a different direction. Countries like Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines — each facing frequent natural disasters have chosen integrated disaster management authorities, where risk reduction and response are handled under one roof. The UN’s Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction also emphasises the importance of mainstreaming risk into all phases of disaster management, not siloing it in a separate entity. The third idea currently gaining traction in political circles is creating new provinces. Pakistan has long wrestled with questions of federalism, representation, and administrative efficiency. One of the most persistent debates in this regard is whether the country’s large provinces, particularly Punjab, should be divided into smaller administrative units. On the surface, the argument makes sense: smaller provinces would presumably bring government closer to the people, reduce bureaucratic inertia, and help address long-standing grievances of regional neglect. But dig deeper, and it becomes clear that the issue is far more complex. Beyond governance concerns, there’s the federal imbalance created by Punjab’s numerical dominance. With over 50 per cent of the country’s population, Punjab holds the largest number of seats in the National Assembly. This has long been a source of resentment among smaller provinces, who perceive Punjab’s dominance as a threat to equitable federalism. However, proponents of smaller provinces often ignore the massive financial, political, and logistical costs involved. Each new province would require its own governor house, provincial assembly, cabinet, civil service, judiciary, police, and infrastructure. In a country already facing a serious fiscal crunch, this will add to the burden. Worse still, the process of redrawing provincial boundaries is almost always politically charged. Demands for new provinces often follow ethnic, linguistic, or sectarian lines. Such identity-driven divisions risk deepening societal fractures, rather than healing them. There’s also the constitutional hurdle. Under Article 239(4) of the Constitution, a new province can only be created with a two-thirds majority in the concerned provincial assembly. That effectively gives existing provincial power centres veto power over any proposed division. In other words, no new province is likely to be formed without the consent of the very political elites who stand to lose the most. Rather than focusing solely on carving up provinces, perhaps the real solution lies in strengthening local governance. Pakistan’s districts and divisions can be empowered with administrative and financial autonomy, allowing for more responsive governance without the constitutional and political drama of redrawing provincial boundaries. Effective local government systems can serve the same purpose as smaller provinces. And unlike new provinces, empowering local governments doesn’t require constitutional amendments or new assemblies. It just requires political will. Similarly, there’s a need for fairer resource distribution between and within provinces. Mechanisms like the National Finance Commission award must be revisited to ensure equitable development, particularly in neglected regions of larger provinces. Pakistan’s real challenge is not geography, it’s governance. Creating new provinces without a serious plan for local empowerment, fiscal management, and political consensus could do more harm than good.

      "summary_en": "PAKISTAN’S governance structure is often at the centre of national debate. From questions of provincial autonomy to disaster management, and now, calls to redraw the country’s internal boundaries, each of these discussions is rooted in legitimate concerns: unequal development, sluggish service delivery, and political imbalance. Yet too often, the solutions proposed are reactive, fragmented, or short-sighted. Instead of piecemeal fixes like carving out new provinces, separating disaster functions, or rolling back devolution we need a deeper conversation about what kind of governance model Pakistan really needs. Because behind every institutional failure lies a more fundamental problem: a state that struggles to function effectively at both the centre and the grassroots. The 18th Amendment in 2010, was hailed as a democratic milestone. The amendment was designed to empower provinces, dismantle centralised authority, and bring governance closer to the people. More than a decade later, however, it’s time to ask a difficult question: has the devolution of power come at the cost of effective policymaking? In reality it has led to uneven policy implementation across provinces, created jurisdictional ambiguity and exposed the institutional fragility of our system. The provinces, suddenly saddled with vast responsibilities, were neither administratively equipped nor financially ready. The federal government, stripped of much of its role in social sectors, lacked the tools to coordinate national-level strategies. The result: fragmented policy, duplicated efforts, and weak implementation. In times of crisis, we need clarity and a unified command not bureaucratic overlap. But perhaps nowhere is this governance fragmentation more dangerous than in disaster management, particularly in the era of climate change. Pakistan faces one of the world’s highest risks from climate-induced disasters ranging from floods, heatwaves and glacial melts. And yet our disaster architecture remains stuck in reactive mode. Disaster management is not a linear process. It spans risk assessment, early warning, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. Creating two separate institutions, one for risk reduction (National Disaster Risk Management Authority) and another for disaster response (NDMA) breaks this continuum. When a flood hits, will one authority manage the data and mapping while another handles evacuation and relief? In times of crisis, we need clarity and a unified command not bureaucratic overlap and institutional finger-pointing. Global best practices point in a different direction. Countries like Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines — each facing frequent natural disasters have chosen integrated disaster management authorities, where risk reduction and response are handled under one roof. The UN’s Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction also emphasises the importance of mainstreaming risk into all phases of disaster management, not siloing it in a separate entity. The third idea currently gaining traction in political circles is creating new provinces. Pakistan has long wrestled with questions of federalism, representation, and administrative efficiency. One of the most persistent debates in this regard is whether the country’s large provinces, particularly Punjab, should be divided into smaller administrative units. On the surface, the argument makes sense: smaller provinces would presumably bring government closer to the people, reduce bureaucratic inertia, and help address long-standing grievances of regional neglect. But dig deeper, and it becomes clear that the issue is far more complex. Beyond governance concerns, there’s the federal imbalance created by Punjab’s numerical dominance. With over 50 per cent of the country’s population, Punjab holds the largest number of seats in the National Assembly. This has long been a source of resentment among smaller provinces, who perceive Punjab’s dominance as a threat to equitable federalism. However, proponents of smaller provinces often ignore the massive financial, political, and logistical costs involved. Each new province would require its own governor house, provincial assembly, cabinet, civil service, judiciary, police, and infrastructure. In a country already facing a serious fiscal crunch, this will add to the burden. Worse still, the process of redrawing provincial boundaries is almost always politically charged. Demands for new provinces often follow ethnic, linguistic, or sectarian lines. Such identity-driven divisions risk deepening societal fractures, rather than healing them. There’s also the constitutional hurdle. Under Article 239(4) of the Constitution, a new province can only be created with a two-thirds majority in the concerned provincial assembly. That effectively gives existing provincial power centres veto power over any proposed division. In other words, no new province is likely to be formed without the consent of the very political elites who stand to lose the most. Rather than focusing solely on carving up provinces, perhaps the real solution lies in strengthening local governance. Pakistan’s districts and divisions can be empowered with administrative and financial autonomy, allowing for more responsive governance without the constitutional and political drama of redrawing provincial boundaries. Effective local government systems can serve the same purpose as smaller provinces. And unlike new provinces, empowering local governments doesn’t require constitutional amendments or new assemblies. It just requires political will. Similarly, there’s a need for fairer resource distribution between and within provinces. Mechanisms like the National Finance Commission award must be revisited to ensure equitable development, particularly in neglected regions of larger provinces. Pakistan’s real challenge is not geography, it’s governance. Creating new provinces without a serious plan for local empowerment, fiscal management, and political consensus could do more harm than good. Instead of redrawing maps, we should focus on redesigning the system that serves all citizens. Governance in Pakistan needs a reset, not in form, but in function. We need a system that delivers.

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: UK police are to be given greater powers to restrict protests as a minister said repeated large-scale pro-Palestinian demonstrations had caused “considerable fear” for the Jewish community. The government initiative follows Thursday’s deadly knife and car-ramming attack on a synagogue in the northwestern city of Manchester. A pro-Palestinian demonstration in central London went ahead on Saturday despite pleas from Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the capital’s Metropolitan Police to delay it. The government said police would be authorised to consider the “cumulative impact” of protests when deciding to impose limits on protesters. London witnesses huge rally despite Starmer’s appeal for postponement “The right to protest is a fundamental freedom in our country. However, this freedom must be balanced with the freedom of their neighbours to live their lives without fear,” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in a statement. Over 1,000 people took part in Saturday’s protest in London’s Trafalgar Square with nearly 500 people arrested for showing supporting for the banned Palestine Action campaign group. Organisers rejected calls not to gather saying they “stood in solidarity” with the Jewish community over the Manchester attack but that “cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win”. A day earlier, Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was booed at a vigil for the Jewish victims of the synagogue attack. “Large, repeated protests can leave sections of our country, particularly religious communities, feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes,” Mahmood claimed. “This has been particularly evident in relation to the considerable fear within the Jewish community.” Questioned by a BBC television interviewer about the Jewish community’s repeated warnings about the dangers they face, Mahmood admitted she was “very worried about the state of community relations in our country”. The home secretary added, speaking to Times Radio , that there was a broad “problem of a rise not only in anti-Semitism but in other forms of hatred as well”. “There are clearly malign and dark forces running amok across our country,” she asserted Police shot dead assailant Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old UK citizen of Syrian descent, within minutes of the alarm being raised on Thursday. One person died in the attack outside the synagogue in north Manchester. Another died after suffering a fatal gunshot, believed by police to have been fired by armed officers as they tackled Shamie. Three people who were seriously injured remain in hospital, including one who is also believed to have been accidentally hit by police fire. Counter terrorism police have been granted more time to detain four people arrested on suspicion of terrorism-linked offences over the incident. Published in Dawn, October 6th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Trump says Gaza negotiations to go on for a ‘couple’ of days • Warns Hamas of ‘complete obliteration’ if it refuses to cede power • Despite US calls for pause, Israel continues attacks on Gaza •  Khalil al-Hayya appears on TV first time since Doha strike • Eight-nation Muslim bloc sees real window for ceasefire • Ex-Jamaat senator ‘still in Israeli custody’, FO says engaging with international partners to repatriate citizens CAIRO: Hamas on Sunday called for a swift start to a prisoner exchange with Israel, as negotiators from both sides prepare to meet in Egypt today (Monday) for crucial talks aimed at ending the nearly two-year-long Israeli invasion of Gaza. Foreign ministers of several countries, including Egypt, said the talks were a “real opportunity” to achieve a sustainable ceasefire. “Hamas is very keen to reach an agreement to end the war and immediately begin the prisoner exchange process in accordance with the field conditions,” a senior official told AFP. The diplomatic push follows the group’s flexible response to US President Donald Trump’s roadmap to end the fighting and secure the release of captives held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Ahead of the discussions in Egypt, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza. “You can’t release (prisoners) in the middle of strikes, so the strikes will have to stop,” Rubio told CBS News. “There can’t be a war going on in the middle of it.” Negotiators are due to gather in Sharm El-Sheikh, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressing the hope that the prisoners could be released within days. Cairo confirmed it would be hosting a delegation from Hamas for talks on “the ground conditions and details of the exchange of all Israeli detainees and Palestinian prisoners”. The White House said Trump had also sent two envoys to Egypt — his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East negotiator Steve Witkoff. “During communications with mediators, Hamas insisted that it is essential for Israel to halt military operations across all areas of the Gaza Strip, cease all air, reconnaissance, and drone activity, and withdraw from inside Gaza City,” a Palestinian source close to Hamas said, adding that the group would “also halt their military operations” in parallel. According to Trump’s plan , in return for the prisoners, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinian prisoners with life sentences and more than 1,700 detainees from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after the war began. ‘Complete obliteration’ But Trump has warned he will “not tolerate delay” from Hamas, urging the group to move quickly towards a deal “or else all bets will be off”. “When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal,” he posted on Truth Social. He also said Hamas will face “complete obliteration” if the group refuses to give up power and control of Gaza, Reuters reported. When asked if Netanyahu is on board with ending the bombing in Gaza and supporting the US’ broader vision, Trump told CNN on Saturday, “Yes on Bibi.” In the interview that aired on Sunday, Trump added that he expects to soon know whether Hamas is committed to peace. He also said talks on implementing a truce for Gaza will take days. “They’re in negotiations right now as we speak. They’ve started the negotiations. It’ll last a couple of days,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’ll see how it turns out. But I’m hearing it’s going very well,” he added. Strikes continue Meanwhile, Israel has continued to carry out strikes on Gaza, in spite of the US calls for a pause. Footage showed thick smoke billowing over the skyline over the coastal territory on Sunday. Gaza’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas authority, said Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people in Gaza on Sunday, after several attacks through the night. “The decision to occupy Gaza, the collapse of multi-storey buildings, and the intensity of IDF operations in the city have led to the evacuation of roughly 900,000 residents to the south, creating immense pressure on Hamas and the countries that support it,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a speech on Sunday. The UN estimates that around one million people were living in the area before the assault began. “There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of air strikes (since last night). The tanks and military vehicles have slightly pulled back, but I believe this is a tactical move, not a withdrawal,” said Muin Abu Rajab, 40, a resident of Al-Rimal neighbourhood in Gaza City. Hayya appears on TV Before arriving at Cairo, Hamas’ top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya broke his silence during a pre-recorded statement that aired in Qatar overnight, in his first televised appearance since Israel targeted him and other leaders of the group in Doha last month. The Hamas leader remained defiant in the interview, saying he drew no distinction between those killed in the attack on Doha, including his son, and the tens of thousands who have died during the nearly two years of devastating war in Gaza. “We hope that their blood will pave the way to victory, the way to Jerusalem, the way to the disgrace of the occupation, and the way to the dignity and triumph of the nation,” he said in the video aired by Al Araby Television Network in Qatar. Hope for sustainable ceasefire Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of several Islamic countries on Sunday welcomed the latest developments over Gaza, affirming that these represented a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire and to address the critical humanitarian conditions facing people in the Gaza Strip, APP reported. Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt, today welcomed the steps taken by Hamas regarding Trump’s proposal to end the war in Gaza, said a joint statement of the foreign ministers, shared by the foreign office spokesperson with the media. The foreign ministers also welcomed the US president’s call on Israel to immediately stop the bombing and to begin implementation of the exchange agreement. They expressed appreciation for his commitment to establishing peace in the region. They also welcomed the announcement by Hamas of its readiness to hand over the administration of Gaza to a transitional Palestinian Administrative Com­mittee of independent technocrats. Pakistani citizens Also on Sunday, the spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was actively engaged with its international partners to ensure the safety and prompt repatriation of its citizens who were illegally detained by the Israeli occupying forces. In response to media inquiries concerning Pakistani nationals aboard the Sumud flotilla, the spokesperson said in a statement, “Through the diplomatic channels of a friendly European country, we have confirmed that former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan is in the custody of the Israeli occupying forces and is safe and in good health.” He added, “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, Senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.” Published in Dawn, October 6th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Nepra allowed Rs215m burden caused by coal supplier’s default to be passed to consumers • Supplier continued delivery to other industries, made ‘dubious’ force majeure claims to escape accountability ISLAMABAD: Electricity consumers in Pakistan are having to shoulder a financial burden of nearly Rs215 million, mainly due to regulatory weaknesses, it has emerged. While the capacity trap, currency devaluation and exch­ange-rate volatility are touted as the main factors behind expensive electricity, similar attention is not paid to issues of weak contract enforcement and inadequate regulatory oversight, which are actually forcing consumers to foot the bill for contractual default by private companies. In the latest episode that has come to light, a Punjab-based coal power plant faced a significant contractual default by its long-term supplier. Subsequent decisions by regulators such as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) and the Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G) allowed the resulting financial burden to be passed directly on to consumers in the form of higher tariffs. This is just one example of persistent weaknesses in the coal procurement process, which previously made headlines earlier this year, sparking inquiries and leading to partial improvements. However, the issue is far from resolved and continues to add to the public’s financial strain. Dawn reached out to Nepra with a set of questions on Sept 22. Over the following weeks, the regulator repeatedly promised a written response, but failed to provide one until going to press. Default on coal supply The issue at hand stems from the breach of a long-term coal supply agreement between the power plant and its coal supplier in December last year. The contract, awarded through a competitive process, secured a substantial discount of $2.51 per tonne on API-4 specification coal. This was seen as an improvement over a previously-challenged contract, which only offered a discount of $0.50 per tonne. However, the supplier defa­ulted on its obligation to del­iver coal against issued purchase orders, citing an alleged ‘force majeure’ as the basis for its non-performance, referencing factors such as congestion at the Richards Bay Coal Terminal in South Africa and, notably, the India-Pakistan conflagration in May. The claim regarding terminal congestion is noteworthy, as industry experts routinely consider this risk as a foreseeable trade challenge in the international coal market. However, the use of the India-Pakistan flare-up as an excuse does not hold up, as documentation indicates that other suppliers successfully fulfilled their contractual obligations during the same timeframe. Additionally, other industries in Pakistan continued to import coal without interruption, raising questions over the enormity of the supplier’s ‘force majeure’ claims. Interestingly, while it defaulted on the long-term contract with the power plant, the company continued to supply coal to other industries, suggesting the decision was linked to the high discount offered rather than the self-proclaimed ‘force majeure’. Cost increases As a direct consequence of the default, the power plant in question was forced to procure replacement coal from the next-ranked supplier, at a significantly higher price. This resulted in an additional cost of $1.86 per tonne being incurred. When applied to the total defaulted quantity of nearly 372,000 tonnes across eight vessels, this nonperformance by the original supplier generated a verifiable loss of $691,931, equivalent to around Rs197m. The regulatory response by Nepra solidified the public’s exposure to this financial loss. In its Fuel Cost Adjustment decision of June 26, 2025, the authority green-lit passing the full impact of the Rs197m cost directly into consumer tariff, instead of protecting consumers’ interests by holding the defaulting party accountable, as explicitly outlined in the Coal Supply Agreement. The contract stipulates that the defaulting party must bear the incremental cost of replacement coal and forfeit its performance guarantee to cover such losses. According to records, the supplier’s performance guarantee was not forfeited, and the recovery of the $691,931 loss was not enforced by either CPPA-G or Nepra. Despite its ongoing default, the same company was allowed to continue supplying under the long-term tender and participate in, and win, a spot tender for the same plant again on June 11, 2025. This spot tender secured a discount of only $1.58 per tonne, which was 93 cents per tonne lower than the discount on the defaulted long-term contract. The price disparity created an additional loss of $55,800, about Rs16m, on a single 60,000-tonne supply, placing yet more burden on consumers. The CPPA-G’s issuance of NOC to the defaulting supplier, both for the spot tender and its continued long-term supplies, illustrates the absence of an effective systemic penalty framework. Following an earlier episode, a Nepra fact-finding committee had identified “anomalies” in the coal procurement process. The committee’s subsequent report underscored the structural weaknesses inherent in the system, which led to single-bidder scenarios and limited competition. The report had also acknowledged the absence of requisite regulatory guidelines for long-term coal procurement and recommended the urgent creation of an independent coal regulator to protect consumers from unjustified costs. But even after the passage of eight months, those recommendations remain unenforced. Published in Dawn, October 6th, 2025",

      "summary_en": "• Nepra allowed Rs215m burden caused by coal supplier’s default to be passed to consumers • Supplier continued delivery to other industries, made ‘dubious’ force majeure claims to escape accountability ISLAMABAD: Electricity consumers in Pakistan are having to shoulder a financial burden of nearly Rs215 million, mainly due to regulatory weaknesses, it has emerged. While the capacity trap, currency devaluation and exch­ange-rate volatility are touted as the main factors behind expensive electricity, similar attention is not paid to issues of weak contract enforcement and inadequate regulatory oversight, which are actually forcing consumers to foot the bill for contractual default by private companies. In the latest episode that has come to light, a Punjab-based coal power plant faced a significant contractual default by its long-term supplier. Subsequent decisions by regulators such as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) and the Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G) allowed the resulting financial burden to be passed directly on to consumers in the form of higher tariffs. This is just one example of persistent weaknesses in the coal procurement process, which previously made headlines earlier this year, sparking inquiries and leading to partial improvements. However, the issue is far from resolved and continues to add to the public’s financial strain. Dawn reached out to Nepra with a set of questions on Sept 22. Over the following weeks, the regulator repeatedly promised a written response, but failed to provide one until going to press. Default on coal supply The issue at hand stems from the breach of a long-term coal supply agreement between the power plant and its coal supplier in December last year. The contract, awarded through a competitive process, secured a substantial discount of $2.51 per tonne on API-4 specification coal. This was seen as an improvement over a previously-challenged contract, which only offered a discount of $0.50 per tonne. However, the supplier defa­ulted on its obligation to del­iver coal against issued purchase orders, citing an alleged ‘force majeure’ as the basis for its non-performance, referencing factors such as congestion at the Richards Bay Coal Terminal in South Africa and, notably, the India-Pakistan conflagration in May. The claim regarding terminal congestion is noteworthy, as industry experts routinely consider this risk as a foreseeable trade challenge in the international coal market. However, the use of the India-Pakistan flare-up as an excuse does not hold up, as documentation indicates that other suppliers successfully fulfilled their contractual obligations during the same timeframe. Additionally, other industries in Pakistan continued to import coal without interruption, raising questions over the enormity of the supplier’s ‘force majeure’ claims. Interestingly, while it defaulted on the long-term contract with the power plant, the company continued to supply coal to other industries, suggesting the decision was linked to the high discount offered rather than the self-proclaimed ‘force majeure’. Cost increases As a direct consequence of the default, the power plant in question was forced to procure replacement coal from the next-ranked supplier, at a significantly higher price. This resulted in an additional cost of $1.86 per tonne being incurred. When applied to the total defaulted quantity of nearly 372,000 tonnes across eight vessels, this nonperformance by the original supplier generated a verifiable loss of $691,931, equivalent to around Rs197m. The regulatory response by Nepra solidified the public’s exposure to this financial loss. In its Fuel Cost Adjustment decision of June 26, 2025, the authority green-lit passing the full impact of the Rs197m cost directly into consumer tariff, instead of protecting consumers’ interests by holding the defaulting party accountable, as explicitly outlined in the Coal Supply Agreement. The contract stipulates that the defaulting party must bear the incremental cost of replacement coal and forfeit its performance guarantee to cover such losses. According to records, the supplier’s performance guarantee was not forfeited, and the recovery of the $691,931 loss was not enforced by either CPPA-G or Nepra.

      "summary_orig": "GILGIT: A judge of the Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Court survived a brazen gun attack in Gilgit on Sunday morning, police said. The incident came the same day as a separate attack on a religious leader left at least five people injured. According to police, Judge Malik Inayatur Rehman and his security staff came under fire from unidentified assailants near Khari City Hospital. The judge’s vehicle was hit by at least 12 bullets, but all occupants survived the ambush. Law enforcement agencies reached the site soon afterwards and cordoned off the area for investigation. Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan took notice of the attack and directed the home secretary, inspector general of police, and other law enforcement authorities to tighten security across the city. He instructed them that those involved in the attack be dealt with “iron hands” and brought to justice. The chief minister also urged citizens to remain peaceful and united to foil the designs of elements seeking to disturb the region’s peace. GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah also condem­ned the attack and called for a transparent investigation. Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate, Deputy Speaker Sadia Danish, Opposition Lea­der Kazim Mesum, lawyers’ representatives, and civil society members also denounced the incident. Religious leader attacked Earlier in the day, a religious leader from the proscribed Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) was also targeted near the Central Police Office (CPO). Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed, who is the emir of the group’s GB and Kohistan chapter was travelling along with police guards and a driver when the convoy came under fire. According to a GB government statement, Maul­ana Nisar, his driver, and three police personnel assigned to his security sustained injuries. Police officials said the guards retaliated immediately, injuring some of the attackers, who managed to escape with the help of accomplices. CCTV footage showed the assailants fleeing in a Suzuki vehicle they allegedly snatched at gunpoint after their own vehicles became inoperative. The injured were shifted to a hospital for medical treatment, where their condition was reported to be stable. Police launched an investigation and took into custody two vehicles used in the attack along with other evidence. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Gilgit Ishaq Hussain said the district police had been placed on high alert following recent security concerns. He added that comprehensive operations were underway to apprehend those involved in the attack. Protests erupt Following the incidents, protests erupted across the region. Demonstrators blocked main roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Gilgit–Shandur Road, and Baltistan Road, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits. Shops and markets in Gilgit remained closed in protest. Protest demonstrations were reported from Gilgit, Diamer, Nagar, Skardu, Astore, Ghizer, Ghanche, and Shigar, where people from all walks of life participated. Religious leaders from all sects condemned the attacks, describing them as a conspiracy to sabotage peace in the region. Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engineer Amir Muqam, also condemned the assassination attempt on Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed and ordered a high-level investigation. In a statement issued during his official visit abroad, Mr Muqam said he had contacted the GB chief minister, chief secretary, and inspector general of police, seeking a detailed report. He said Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed was a respected religious scholar and that the attack was not only on an individual but “an assault on the peace and stability of the entire region.” The minister directed authorities to use all available resources to ensure the swift arrest of the attackers. “Those involved in this heinous crime will not escape justice,” he said. Chief Minister Gulbar Khan reiterated that no conspiracy against the peace of Gilgit-Baltistan would be allowed to succeed. He ordered the IG and law enforcement agencies to conduct a transparent investigation and immediately arrest the culprits. Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Speaker Nazir Ahm­ed Advocate, Deputy Spe­a­ker Sadia Danish, Oppo­sition Leader Kazim Mes­um, cabinet ministers, reli­g­ious leaders from var­ious sects, and civil society activists all condem­ned the incidents and dem­anded a fair and tran­s­parent investigation.

      "summary_orig": "Hundreds of trekkers stranded by a blizzard near the eastern face of Mount Everest in Tibet were guided to safety by rescuers, Chinese state media reported on Sunday, as unusually heavy snow and rainfall pummelled the Himalayas. As of Sunday, 350 trekkers had reached the small township of Qudang, while contact with the remaining 200-plus trekkers had been made, CCTV reported. Visitors to the remote valley of Karma, which leads to the eastern Kangshung face of Everest, were in the hundreds this week, taking advantage of an eight-day National Day holiday in China. “It was so wet and cold in the mountains, and hypothermia was a real risk,” said Chen Geshuang, who was part of an 18-strong trekking team that made it to Qudang. “The weather this year is not normal. The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly,” Chen told Reuters . Snow, thunder and lightning Snowfall in the valley, which lies at an elevation averaging 4,200 metres, began on Friday evening and persisted throughout Saturday. The remaining trekkers will arrive in Qudang in stages under the guidance and assistance of rescuers organised by the local government, CCTV reported. Chen’s party descended from the mountains on Sunday and was greeted by villagers after enduring a harrowing evening of heavy snowfall combined with thunder and lightning. With tears in her eyes, Chen accepted their offers of sweet tea and the promise of warmth, she said. “Back in the village, we had a meal and were finally warm.” Hundreds of local villagers and rescue teams had been deployed to help remove snow blocking access to the area, where nearly 1,000 people had been trapped, according to an earlier report by Jimu News . North face of Everest The CCTV report did not say if local guides and support staff of the trekking parties had been accounted for. It was also unclear if trekkers near the north face of Everest, also in Tibet, had been affected or not. The north face of Everest, due to its easy access by paved road, regularly draws large numbers of tourists. October is a peak season, when skies usually clear at the end of the Indian monsoon. Ticket sales and entry to the entire Everest Scenic Area were suspended from late Saturday, according to notices on the official WeChat accounts of the local Tingri County Tourism Company. To the south of Tibet in Nepal, heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 47 people since Friday. Thirty-five people died in separate landslides in the eastern Ilam district bordering India. Nine people were reported missing after being swept away by floodwaters and three others were killed in lightning strikes elsewhere in the country.",

      "summary_orig": "Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Sunday addressed a massive rally on Karachi’s Sharea Faisal and called on the nation to take to the streets on October 7 as a show of solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. According to a press release from the JI, the participants of the “Gaza Solidarity March” chanted slogans against Israel and its supporters over the ongoing genocide in the enclave. They were also carrying placards and banners and people from all walks of life participated in the event and formed a chain to express solidarity. “Any paradigm shift in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine — [which was] set by none other than Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah — will not be tolerated at any cost,” Rehman said in his keynote address, according to the press release. “On March 23, 1940, two resolutions were passed by the Muslim League — one called [the] Pakistan Resolution and the second one was for Palestine,” he added. “There is only one state and that is Palestine, whereas there is only one leadership in Gaza and that is Hamas.” The JI chief demanded that the government recognise Hamas as the leadership in the Gaza Strip, while “warning them strongly” against joining the Abraham Accords , a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab states. Jamaat-i-Islami supporters carry banners and placards in solidarity with Palestinians at a party rally in Karachi on October 5. — Photo by author “He (Rehman) further said that Israel had totally failed militarily in Gaza as it couldn’t get its soldiers freed by Hamas and was in fact engaging Hamas in one way or another to secure their release,” the statement read. “Hamas is a resistance movement that represents the people of Gaza. However, the ruling class is not even willing to mention the name … because they are afraid of any movement that comes from the people,” Rehman was quoted as saying. “The ruling elite dislikes any movement that opposes the United States and Israel.” The JI chief added that Hamas was a legal political movement and if they had taken up arms, it they did so according to the UN Charter. Moreover, he demanded that the government “abandon hypocrisy and double standards” and accept the people of Gaza and Hamas, adding that Hamas offices must be opened in Pakistan. “On the occasion, he stressed the need [for] another United Nations as the present one became a total failure and agent of the US and Israel,” the press release read. “It never solved the issues of Muslims. He (Rehman) was of the view that the massacre in Palestine happened not because of Hamas, but because of the cowardly Muslim rulers.” According to the press release, Rehman said that October 7 is a “symbol of struggle and resistance” and that people around the world will come out of their homes to “express solidarity with the resistance forces and oppressed people of Gaza”. “On October 7 at 11 am, the entire Pakistan will come out on [the] roads in support of Palestinians and [we] ask the nation to join the global solidarity demonstration,” Rehman was quoted as saying. The Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced. Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement. US President Donald Trump worked with eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, to formulate a peace plan to end the conflict. The proposal was accepted by both Israel and Hamas, although Tel Aviv’s attacks still continue in the Strip. Moreover, Israeli forces also intercepted and arrested activists aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla — a fleet of boats trying to deliver aid to the enclave — on October 1, drawing global ire and condemnation. One of the participants arrested was former JI senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan , who led a Pakistani delegation on the flotilla.",

He (Rehman) was of the view that the massacre in Palestine happened not because of Hamas, but because of the cowardly Muslim rulers.” According to the press release, Rehman said that October 7 is a “symbol of struggle and resistance” and that people around the world will come out of their homes to “express solidarity with the resistance forces and oppressed people of Gaza”. “On October 7 at 11 am, the entire Pakistan will come out on [the] roads in support of Palestinians and [we] ask the nation to join the global solidarity demonstration,” Rehman was quoted as saying. The Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced. Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement. US President Donald Trump worked with eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, to formulate a peace plan to end the conflict. The proposal was accepted by both Israel and Hamas, although Tel Aviv’s attacks still continue in the Strip. Moreover, Israeli forces also intercepted and arrested activists aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla — a fleet of boats trying to deliver aid to the enclave — on October 1, drawing global ire and condemnation. One of the participants arrested was former JI senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan , who led a Pakistani delegation on the flotilla.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has arrived in Malaysia for a two-day official visit, according to state broadcaster PTV News . The broadcaster reported in a post on X that he arrived at Kuala Lumpur’s Banga Raya International Airport, being welcomed by the Malaysian information and communications minister and the Pakistani high commissioner to Malaysia. PM Shehbaz was then escorted with a royal protocol to his accommodation, where he was welcomed by his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim. “I am extremely delighted to be in Malaysia; I express my gratitude to the prime minister of Malaysia for the warm reception,” PTV News quoted him as saying. “This visit will further strengthen Pakistan-Malaysia bilateral relations.” Upon his departure, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement. “I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight. Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added. Later, a post by the PM Office’s official X account confirmed the premier had departed from Lahore for the three-day official visit. The Foreign Office (FO) earlier said PM Shehbaz would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other federal ministers and senior government officials on the trip. Sharing details of the visit in a statement, the FO said talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact. “The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read. It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.” Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.",
