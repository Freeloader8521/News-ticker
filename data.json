      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said Wednesday he had been told the killings of protesters in Iran had been halted, but added that he would “watch it and see” about threatened military action. Trump had repeatedly talked in recent days about coming to the aid of the Iranian people over the crackdown on protests. But in a surprise announcement at the White House, Trump said he had now received assurances from “very important sources on the other side” that Tehran had now stopped, and that executions would not go ahead. “They’ve said the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place - there were supposed to be a lot of executions today and that the executions won’t take place - and we’re going to find out,” Trump said. He offered no details and noted that the United States had yet to verify the claims. Asked by an AFP reporter in the Oval Office if US military action was now off the table, Trump replied: “We’re going to watch it and see what the process is.” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later said there would be “no hanging today or tomorrow,” in an interview with US network Fox News. “I can tell you, I’m confident that there is no plan for hanging,” Araghchi said, also accusing Israel of orchestrating violence. ‘Full control’ But Araghchi said the Iranian government was “in full control” and reported an atmosphere of “calm” after what he called three days of “terrorist operation.” Iran also struck a defiant tone about responding to any US attack, as Washington appeared to draw down staff at a base in Qatar that Tehran targeted in a strike last year. Iran targeted the Al Udeid base in June in retaliation for US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Ali Shamkhani, a senior advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Trump that the strike showed “Iran’s will and capability to respond to any attack.” Fears of possible US military action continued to rile the region. The British government said its embassy in Tehran had been “temporarily closed,” while the US embassy in Saudi Arabia urged staff to exercise caution and avoid military installations. Trump has threatened to intervene militarily in Iran several times since the protest movement that has shaken the country began in late December. Iran’s judiciary chief vowed fast-track trials for those arrested, stoking fears authorities will use capital punishment as a tool of repression. In Tehran, authorities held a funeral for more than 100 security personnel and other “martyrs” killed in the unrest, which officials have branded “acts of terror.” Iran reopens airspace Iran reopened its airspace after a near-five-hour closure amid concerns about possible military action between the US and Iran that forced airlines to cancel, reroute or delay some flights. Iran closed its airspace to all flights except international ones to and from Iran with official permission at 2215 GMT on Wednesday, according to a notice on the US Federal Aviation Administration website. The notice was removed shortly before 0300 GMT, according to tracking service Flightradar24, which showed five flights from Iranian carriers Mahan Air, Yazd Airways and AVA Airlines were among the first to resume over the country. At a similar time last week to the airspace closure there had been dozens of planes in the air over Iran, Flightradar24 said. The United States was withdrawing some personnel from bases in the Middle East, a US official said on Wednesday, after a senior Iranian official said Tehran had warned neighbors it would hit American bases if Washington strikes. Missile and drone barrages in a growing number of conflict zones represent a high risk to airline traffic. Indian airlines among those affected India’s largest airline, IndiGo said some of its international flights would be impacted by Iran’s sudden airspace closure. Air India said its flights were using alternative routes that could result in delays or cancellations. A flight by Russia’s Aeroflot bound for Tehran returned to Moscow after the closure, according to Flightradar24 data. Empty airspace over Iran, during a temporary closure of the country’s airspace amid concerns about possible military action between the United States and Iran, in this screengrab obtained from the internet on January 14, 2026. — FlightRadar/Reuters Earlier on Wednesday, Germany issued a new directive cautioning the country’s airlines from entering Iranian airspace, shortly after Lufthansa rejigged its flight operations across the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region. The United States already prohibits all US commercial flights from overflying Iran and there are no direct flights between the countries. Airline operators like flydubai and Turkish Airlines have canceled multiple flights to Iran in the past week. “Several airlines have already reduced or suspended services, and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” said Safe Airspace, a website run by OPSGROUP, a membership-based organisation that shares flight risk information. “The situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defence, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.” A Ukraine International Airlines jet was downed by Iran’s military in 2020, killing all 176 passengers and crew. Lufthansa said on Wednesday that it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice while it would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman from Wednesday until Monday next week so that crew would not have to stay overnight. Some flights could also be canceled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement. Italian carrier ITA Airways, in which Lufthansa Group is now a major shareholder, said that it would similarly suspend night flights to Tel Aviv until Tuesday next week. ‘Unprecedented level of brutality’ G7 nations said Wednesday they were “deeply alarmed at the high level of reported deaths and injuries” and warned of further sanctions if the crackdown continued. Monitor NetBlocks said Iran’s internet blackout had lasted 144 hours. Amnesty International accused authorities of committing mass unlawful killings “on an unprecedented scale,” citing verified videos and eyewitness accounts. The US-based Institute for the Study of War said authorities were using “an unprecedented level of brutality to suppress protests,” noting reports of protest activity had sharply declined. A senior Iranian official told journalists there had been no new “riots” since Monday, distinguishing them from earlier cost-of-living protests. “Every society can expect protests, but we will not tolerate violence,” he said. Prosecutors have said some detainees will face capital charges of “waging war against God.” State media reported hundreds of arrests and the detention of a foreign national for espionage, without giving details. AI-created Iran protest videos gain traction AI-generated videos purportedly depicting protests in Iran have flooded the web, researchers said Wednesday, as social media users push hyper-realistic deepfakes to fill an information void amid the country’s internet restrictions. US disinformation watchdog NewsGuard said it identified seven AI-generated videos depicting the Iranian protests - created by both pro - and anti-government actors - that have collectively amassed some 3.5 million views across online platforms. Among them was a video shared on the Elon Musk-owned platform X showing women protesters smashing a vehicle belonging to the Basij, the Iranian paramilitary force deployed to suppress the protests. One X post featuring the AI clip, shared by what NewsGuard described as anti-regime users, garnered nearly 720,000 views. Anti-regime X and TikTok users in the United States also posted AI videos depicting Iranian protesters symbolically renaming local streets after President Donald Trump. One such clip shows a protester changing a street sign to “Trump St” while other demonstrators cheer, with an overlaid caption reading: “Iranian protestors are renaming the streets after Trump.” Pro-regime social media users also shared AI videos purportedly showing large-scale pro-government counterprotests throughout the Islamic republic. The AI creations highlight the growing prevalence of what experts call “hallucinated” visual content on social media during major news events, often overshadowing authentic images and videos. In this case, AI creators were filling an information void caused by the internet blackout imposed by the Iranian regime as it sought to suppress demonstrations, experts said. “There’s a lot of news - but no way to get it because of the internet blackout,” said NewsGuard analyst Ines Chomnalez. “Foreign social media users are turning to AI video generators to advance their own narratives about the unfolding chaos.” The fabricated videos were the latest example of AI tools being deployed to distort fast-developing breaking news. AI fabrications, often amplified by partisan actors, have fueled alternate realities around recent news events, including the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and a deadly shooting by immigration agents in Minneapolis. AFP fact-checkers also uncovered misrepresented images that created misleading narratives about the Iranian protests, the largest since the Islamic Republic was proclaimed in 1979. One months-old video purportedly showing demonstrations in Iran was actually filmed in Greece in November 2025, while another claiming to depict a protester tearing down an Iranian flag was filmed in Nepal during last year’s protests that toppled the Himalayan nation’s government.",

      "summary_orig": "• ‘Bans’ purchase of petrol, diesel vehicles to ‘cut emissions’ • Approval for new fuel pumps linked to installation of EV charging units • S&GAD yet to notify policy • Minister says move part of ‘smog mitigation measures’ LAHORE: The Punjab government on Wednesday announced a complete ban on the purchase of petrol and diesel vehicles across its departments, allowing only electric or hybrid modes of transportation in a move aimed at cutting emissions and accelerating the transition to clean transport. The announcement was made by Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman in a statement issued here. However, it added that vehicles deployed for field duties had been exempted from the restriction. Mr Zaman noted that a comprehensive electric vehicle (EV) policy for the province was expected to be announced shortly. He said the policy would reflect the provincial government’s commitment to environmental protection and the promotion of green energy. New petrol pumps As part of the same initiative, the approval of no-objection certificates (NOCs) for new petrol pumps has been made conditional on the installation of electric vehicle charging units. “No new petrol pump will be allowed to operate without EV charging facilities,” the chief secretary stated. The statement added that NOCs had already been issued through the e-Biz Portal for 170 new petrol pumps across 31 cities in Punjab, all of which are required to install EV charging units. These include 29 petrol pumps in Faisalabad, 14 in Lahore, 10 in Bahawalpur, nine each in Khanewal and Bahawalnagar, eight each in Rawalpindi and Jhang, and seven each in Toba Tek Singh, Mianwali, Kasur, and Chiniot. However, the chief secretary did not respond to a question on whether the policy decision banning the purchase of petrol and diesel vehicles was taken at any formal forum or was merely a statement. S&GAD yet to notify move It is learnt that no notification regarding the policy change banning the procurement of petrol and diesel vehicles and promoting the procurement of electric and hybrid vehicles has been issued by the Services and General Administration Department (S&GAD). When contacted, an S&GAD Transport Wing official told Dawn that the department had neither received any formal approval for the change in policy nor issued any notification in this regard. Answering a question, the official said discussions on shifting to electric and hybrid vehicles had been underway in the department for quite some time, in line with environmental and climate change initiatives. The official added that the policy would take effect once formal approval is granted by the chief minister following the required process. The S&GAD would then issue a formal notification to launch the new policy. ‘Combating smog’ During a meeting with American business leaders, Senior Punjab Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the provincial government would now purchase only hybrid and electric vehicles as part of its smog mitigation measures. “The government has decided to replace petrol vehicles in the official fleet with hybrid and electric vehicles,” she said. According to a statement, the US delegation was given a comprehensive briefing on Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s vision and policy initiatives. It added that the American business leaders commended CM Maryam’s governance reforms and environmental policies. They were informed about the provincial government’s policies and enforcement measures related to the shift towards electric and hybrid transport, brick kiln mechanisation, e-transport, official use of super seeders, and other practical reforms. “For the first time, sectoral-level anti-smog measures have been introduced in Lahore, with the Planning and Development Department designated as the central policy hub,” Ms Aurangzeb said, adding that the city’s air quality had shown marked improvement. To combat smog, she said, 41 monitoring stations had been installed, with the number set to reach 100 by June. The minister added that surveillance was being carried out through drones and thermal cameras. “A Smog War Room is monitoring industries, brick kilns, and vehicles around the clock, while Punjab Climate Watch is fully operational.” The minister told the delegation that to control crop burning, 5,000 super seeders had been provided to farmers at a 60 per cent subsidy. “A Nasa [US space agency] report has confirmed a 60 per cent reduction in smog levels.,” she said. She further said 1,000 e-buses had been added across Punjab, with a decision taken to procure an additional 10,000 this year. Published in Dawn, January 15th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The opposition alliance comprising the PTI and other parties has demanded a joint session of parliament to discuss the tensions in the Middle East, particularly Iran, besides urging the government to convene a meeting of “neighbouring countries” to formulate a “joint and coordinated strategy”. The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) held a meeting in the federal capital under the chairmanship of Mahm­ood Khan Achakzai, wherein the participants expressed concerns over the deteriorating regional situation. The participants urged the government to call an urgent joint session of parliament to form a national policy through collective wisdom. They claimed that the international order was changing: the Israeli aggr­ession in Palestine and the conduct of the United States in Latin America have severely undermined international law. They observed that imperial and colonial powers were tightening their grip around Pakistan’s neighbouring country, Iran, while the western media was creating an environment that could be used as a pretext to undermine Iran’s sovereignty. The TTAP proposed that in view of the seriousness of the potential crisis and its possible impact on the region, the government should also convene a meeting of neighbouring countries to develop a joint and coordinated strategy to address these challenges. PTI slams action against Adiala protesters Meanwhile, the PTI denounced the use of force by the Rawalpindi police to disperse its sit-in outside Adiala jail on Tuesday night. The police, in a midnight operation, had used force to disperse the participants. In a statement, the PTI said these actions constituted a grave assault on the Constitution, the rule of law and fundamental human rights, and reflected a systematic campaign of political victimisation designed to silence dissent. The party vowed that such conduct was unacceptable in any democratic society and would be vigorously challenged at every constitutional, legal and democratic forum. The party claimed that family members of Imran Khan and party workers were present outside the jail to exercise their constitutional and legal right to meet their incarcerated leader, but the police suppressed this activity using force, intimidation and harassment. “Peaceful party leaders and workers, along with Imran Khan’s sisters, were subjected to baton charges, manhandling and abuse. As a result of this inhumane operation, 11 male party workers were detained at the Rawat police station, while three women—Zulekha, Dr Asma and Sanaiya Safeer—remained in the custody of Rawalpindi Police,” it claimed. Similarly, the PTI stated that Advocate Raja Yasir, Adil, and Tanveer were also arrested. Furthermore, the party stated that the Raw­alpindi police established checkpoints near Bahria Town, where citizens returning from Adiala were subjected to searches, with mobile phones snatched, women’s vehicles seized, and the windows of several cars smashed. The PTI alleged that the citizens were coerced into paying money to recover their mobile phones and vehicles from the police, while those who refused to pay bribes had their vehicles confiscated.

      "summary_orig": "• Washington withdraws staff from Middle East bases; diplomatic contact cut off • Tehran threatens retaliation; informs Qatar, Saudi Arabia, others • Riyadh assures it won’t allow its territory to be used against Iran WASHINGTON: Tensions flared across the Middle East on Wednesday as the US began withdrawing personnel from crucial bases in the region, while Tehran warned that it would retaliate against American bases in the Gulf, if Washington initiated an attack. The catalyst for the showdown is the violent protests within Iran. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters, declaring in a Tuesday interview that “help is on the way” and vowing “very strong action” if executions of demonstrators continue. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said in a press conference late on Wednesday night he had been told that killings in Iran’s crackdown on nationwide protests were subsiding and that he believed there was currently no plan for large-scale executions. The New York Times also reported that the Pentagon is considering a broader array of strike options than previously disclosed, potentially targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities and ballistic missile sites. European officials also cautioned that an American strike could be imminent. “All the signals are that a US attack is imminent, but that is also how this administration behaves to keep everyone on their toes. Unpredictability is part of the strategy,” a Western military official said. Meanwhile, a senior Iranian official said regional countries — including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey — had been informed that American bases within their borders will be targeted if the US strikes Iran. Direct contact between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff have also been suspended, the official added. As of Wednesday, Britain was also withdrawing some personnel from an air base in Qatar, according to British media reports, though the defence ministry in London offered no immediate comment. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was pulling some personnel from bases in the region as a precautionary measure given the heightened friction. Qatar confirmed that drawdowns from its Al Udeid air base, the largest US military hub in the Middle East, were “being undertaken in response to the current regional tensions.” Facing the threat of regional crossfire, Saudi Arabia moved to insulate itself. Two sources close to the kingdom’s government said Riyadh explicitly informed Iran that it would not permit its territory to be used for offensive operations. In light of the threats, the US Embassy in Saudi Arabia issued a directive urging staff and citizens to “exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region.” Published in Dawn, January 15th, 2026",

      "title_orig": "Denmark, Greenland in crunch White House talks as Trump ups pressure",
      "summary_orig": "Denmark and Greenland’s top diplomats held high-stakes talks at the White House on Wednesday, with US President Donald Trump warning it was “vital” for the United States to take control of the Arctic island. Shortly before the meeting with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Denmark announced it was immediately boosting its military presence in strategic Greenland. Footage from CNN showed Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt arriving at the White House campus, while AFP journalists saw Rubio and Vance heading into the talks. Trump’s escalating threats over Greenland — a vast and sparsely populated autonomous territory belonging to Nato ally Denmark — have deeply shaken transatlantic relations. The 79-year-old Republican insisted ahead of the talks that Nato should support the US effort to take control of Greenland, saying it was crucial for his planned Golden Dome air and missile defence system. “Nato becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES. Anything less than that is unacceptable,” he wrote on his Truth Social network. “IF WE DON’T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!” added Trump. Vance, who slammed Denmark as a “bad ally” during a visit to Greenland last year, is known for a hard edge, which was on display when he publicly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last February. “If the US continues with, ‘We have to have Greenland at all costs,’ it could be a very short meeting,” said Penny Naas, a senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington think tank. Trump has derided recent Danish efforts to increase security for Greenland as amounting to “two dogsleds”. Denmark says it has invested almost $14 billion in Arctic security. Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen sought to further ease US concerns on Thursday, telling AFP his country was boosting its military presence in Greenland and was in talks with Nato allies. The Danish defence ministry then announced that it would do so “from today,” hosting a military exercise and sending in “aircraft, vessels and soldiers”. Swedish officers were joining the exercise at Denmark’s request, Stockholm said. ‘Big problem’ Denmark’s Rasmussen said ahead of the meeting that he was hoping to “clear up certain misunderstandings”. But it remains to be seen if there is a chance of de-escalating the situation. Greenland’s leader said on Tuesday that the island prefers to remain part of Denmark, prompting Trump to say “that’s going to be a big problem for him.” Shortly after the White House talks, a senior delegation from the US Congress — mostly Democrats, but with one Republican — will visit Copenhagen to offer solidarity. Trump has appeared emboldened on Greenland — and on what he views as the US backyard as a whole — since ordering a deadly January 3 attack in Venezuela that removed President Nicolas Maduro. The White House has said that military action against Greenland remains on the table. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an attack on a Nato ally would end the alliance that has been the bedrock of Western security since World War II. It is a founding member of Nato, and its military joined the United States in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the latter to much criticism. An agreement with Denmark currently allows the United States to station as many soldiers as it wants on Greenland. It also has a “space base” at Pituffik in northern Greenland. Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, meanwhile, said ahead of the Washington talks that “Greenland does not want to be part of the United States.” But Trump has been insistent that he wants to acquire Greenland wholesale, repeatedly insisting on what he calls the threat of a takeover by Russia or China. The two rival powers have both stepped up activity in the Arctic, where ice is melting due to climate change, but neither claims Greenland, which is home to 57,000 people.",

Anything less than that is unacceptable,” he wrote on his Truth Social network. “IF WE DON’T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!” added Trump. Vance, who slammed Denmark as a “bad ally” during a visit to Greenland last year, is known for a hard edge, which was on display when he publicly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last February. “If the US continues with, ‘We have to have Greenland at all costs,’ it could be a very short meeting,” said Penny Naas, a senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington think tank. Trump has derided recent Danish efforts to increase security for Greenland as amounting to “two dogsleds”. Denmark says it has invested almost $14 billion in Arctic security. Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen sought to further ease US concerns on Thursday, telling AFP his country was boosting its military presence in Greenland and was in talks with Nato allies. The Danish defence ministry then announced that it would do so “from today,” hosting a military exercise and sending in “aircraft, vessels and soldiers”. Swedish officers were joining the exercise at Denmark’s request, Stockholm said. ‘Big problem’ Denmark’s Rasmussen said ahead of the meeting that he was hoping to “clear up certain misunderstandings”. But it remains to be seen if there is a chance of de-escalating the situation. Greenland’s leader said on Tuesday that the island prefers to remain part of Denmark, prompting Trump to say “that’s going to be a big problem for him.” Shortly after the White House talks, a senior delegation from the US Congress — mostly Democrats, but with one Republican — will visit Copenhagen to offer solidarity. Trump has appeared emboldened on Greenland — and on what he views as the US backyard as a whole — since ordering a deadly January 3 attack in Venezuela that removed President Nicolas Maduro. The White House has said that military action against Greenland remains on the table. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an attack on a Nato ally would end the alliance that has been the bedrock of Western security since World War II. It is a founding member of Nato, and its military joined the United States in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the latter to much criticism. An agreement with Denmark currently allows the United States to station as many soldiers as it wants on Greenland. It also has a “space base” at Pituffik in northern Greenland. Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, meanwhile, said ahead of the Washington talks that “Greenland does not want to be part of the United States.” But Trump has been insistent that he wants to acquire Greenland wholesale, repeatedly insisting on what he calls the threat of a takeover by Russia or China. The two rival powers have both stepped up activity in the Arctic, where ice is melting due to climate change, but neither claims Greenland, which is home to 57,000 people.",

      "summary_orig": "The PTI on Wednesday strongly condemned the police action against its protesters outside the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi yesterday, terming it “oppression” and “injustice”. The condemnation comes a day after the police dispersed a sit-in staged by PTI supporters and party founder Imran Khan’s sisters at Factory Naka near the prison after the authorities did not allow them to meet the incarcerated former prime minister. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the party said it condemned the “government’s oppression, use of force through police, and unlawful actions” outside Adiala in the “strongest terms”. Detailing the alleged arrests, the PTI said 11 men were detained at the Rawat police station and three women — Zuleikha, Dr Asma and Sanaya Safeer — were taken into custody by the Rawalpindi police. “Similarly, Advocate Raja Yasir, [MNA] Shahid Khattak’s brother Adil, and Tanveer have also been arrested,” it added. In a list of demands, the PTI sought the immediate release of “all arrested men and women”. It added that “immediate criminal proceedings should be initiated against the responsible police officials”. The PTI asserted that Imran’s family and party workers were exercising their constitutional and legal right when they had gathered outside the prison to meet him. “[However], the government used force, violence and harassment to crush this peaceful and lawful activity,” it added. The party alleged that the baton charge, pushing and mistreatment continued late into the night “without any regard for women and children”. Furthermore, it alleged that the Rawalpindi police set up a checkpoint at Bahria Town on the route returning from Adiala, where they “snatched mobile phones from citizens, forcibly seized women’s vehicles and smashed the windshields of several cars”. According to the PTI, the mobile phones and vehicles were returned after “taking money” from the citizens, while those who “refused to pay bribes” had their vehicles impounded. The PTI claimed that “several citizens’ vehicles remained illegally impounded” at the Bahria Town checkpoint, with no first information report (FIR) registered so far. It demanded the return of all vehicles and mobile phones allegedly seized, and called for judicial inquiries into the “open extortion, vandalism and violations of human rights”. “This fascist conduct by the Rawalpindi police has been continuing in the same manner for the past many weeks,” the party lamented. “This is not merely political victimisation, but organised government hooliganism, looting and violation of law by the Maryam-led government,” it said, referring to the Punjab chief minister. It insisted that the aim of such actions was to “deprive Imran Khan and his family of their constitutional right to meetings and spreading fear among the public”. In the end, the PTI also demanded that Imran’s family members and lawyers be allowed to meet him without any obstruction. The PTI, in their statement, assured the public that the voice would be raised against this “oppression, injustice and government-backed strong-arm tactics at every constitutional, legal and democratic forum”. “This country is not the personal fiefdom of any police officer or authoritarian government, but a trust of the people, and those who plunder this trust will be held accountable,” the party said. PTI begins street mobilisation in AJK Separately, the PTI also announced that its Azad Kashmir president and former prime minister of the region, Sardar Abdul Qayyum, has launched a street movement from his constituency of Sehnsa. In December last year, the PTI announced it was launching a fresh countrywide street movement under Imran’s directives. The party initiated the movement from Lahore, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s visit. On Monday, he concluded his four-day visit to Sindh for the same purpose, announcing that his next stop will be areas in KP. The street mobilisation is aimed at garnering momentum in the lead-up to the opposition’s planned February 8 protests , which would mark two years since the general elections that the opposition claims were rigged.",

      "title": "‘Oppression, injustice’: PTI condemns latest police action outside Adiala jail",
      "summary": "The PTI on Wednesday strongly condemned the police action against its protesters outside the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi yesterday, terming it “oppression” and “injustice”. The condemnation comes a day after the police dispersed a sit-in staged by PTI supporters and party founder Imran Khan’s sisters at Factory Naka near the prison after the authorities did not allow them to meet the incarcerated former prime minister. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the party said it condemned the “government’s oppression, use of force through police, and unlawful actions” outside Adiala in the “strongest terms”. Detailing the alleged arrests, the PTI said 11 men were detained at the Rawat police station and three women — Zuleikha, Dr Asma and Sanaya Safeer — were taken into custody by the Rawalpindi police. “Similarly, Advocate Raja Yasir, [MNA] Shahid Khattak’s brother Adil, and Tanveer have also been arrested,” it added. In a list of demands, the PTI sought the immediate release of “all arrested men and women”. It added that “immediate criminal proceedings should be initiated against the responsible police officials”. The PTI asserted that Imran’s family and party workers were exercising their constitutional and legal right when they had gathered outside the prison to meet him. “[However], the government used force, violence and harassment to crush this peaceful and lawful activity,” it added. The party alleged that the baton charge, pushing and mistreatment continued late into the night “without any regard for women and children”. Furthermore, it alleged that the Rawalpindi police set up a checkpoint at Bahria Town on the route returning from Adiala, where they “snatched mobile phones from citizens, forcibly seized women’s vehicles and smashed the windshields of several cars”. According to the PTI, the mobile phones and vehicles were returned after “taking money” from the citizens, while those who “refused to pay bribes” had their vehicles impounded. The PTI claimed that “several citizens’ vehicles remained illegally impounded” at the Bahria Town checkpoint, with no first information report (FIR) registered so far. It demanded the return of all vehicles and mobile phones allegedly seized, and called for judicial inquiries into the “open extortion, vandalism and violations of human rights”. “This fascist conduct by the Rawalpindi police has been continuing in the same manner for the past many weeks,” the party lamented. “This is not merely political victimisation, but organised government hooliganism, looting and violation of law by the Maryam-led government,” it said, referring to the Punjab chief minister. It insisted that the aim of such actions was to “deprive Imran Khan and his family of their constitutional right to meetings and spreading fear among the public”. In the end, the PTI also demanded that Imran’s family members and lawyers be allowed to meet him without any obstruction. The PTI, in their statement, assured the public that the voice would be raised against this “oppression, injustice and government-backed strong-arm tactics at every constitutional, legal and democratic forum”. “This country is not the personal fiefdom of any police officer or authoritarian government, but a trust of the people, and those who plunder this trust will be held accountable,” the party said.

      "summary_orig": "A crane at a China-backed high-speed rail project in Thailand collapsed onto a passenger train on Wednesday and caused it to derail, killing at least 32 people, authorities said. The massive crane’s broken structure was left resting on giant concrete pillars, while smoke rose from the wreckage of the train below, footage from the scene verified by AFP showed. The company contracted to build the section of the high-speed rail where the crane fell, Italian-Thai Development — one of Thailand’s biggest construction firms — has seen a series of deadly accidents at its sites in recent years. The firm expressed condolences for those killed and the dozens injured, saying in a statement it would “take responsibility for compensating the victims’ families and covering medical expenses for those injured”. The Thai health ministry said 32 people were killed, three were missing and 64 were hospitalised, including seven in serious condition. Dozens of rescuers worked into the evening, using other cranes to remove wreckage and searching for missing people in the tilted carriages in Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeast of the capital Bangkok. Mitr Intrpanya, who was at the scene, said he heard a loud noise “like something sliding down from above, followed by two explosions”. “When I went to see what had happened, I found the crane sitting on a passenger train with three carriages,” the 54-year-old told AFP. “The metal from the crane appeared to strike the middle of the second carriage, slicing it in half.” ‘Only company in charge’ The accident happened at a construction site that is part of a more than $5 billion project backed by China to build a high-speed rail network in Thailand. It aims to connect Bangkok to Kunming in China via Laos by 2028 as part of Beijing’s vast Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Engineering consultant Theerachote Rujiviphat, an adviser on the high-speed project, told AFP that Italian-Thai Development was solely responsible for the crane collapse. Theerachote, from the China Railway Design Corporation, said the launching crane that fell onto the existing rail tracks also belonged to Italian-Thai. “It is the only company in charge. A similar accident also happened a few years ago under their responsibility,” Theerachote added. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said authorities must determine the cause of the crane collapse and hold those responsible to account. “These kind of incidents happen very regularly,” he told reporters in Bangkok. “I have heard that it is the same company [involved in previous accidents]. It is time to change the law to blacklist construction companies that are repeatedly responsible for accidents.” Deadly accidents The Nakhon Ratchasima provincial public relations department said on Wednesday that the crane collapsed onto a train travelling from Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani province, “causing it to derail and catch fire”. Transport Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said 195 people were on board. Italian-Thai Development and its director were among more than 20 people and firms indicted in August last year in a case linked to the collapse of a Bangkok high-rise in an earthquake . The collapse killed around 90 people, mostly construction workers. Five people were killed and 24 others were injured in March when a crane collapsed at a highway construction site, a joint venture including Italian-Thai. In 2017, a crane used in the construction of Bangkok’s elevated rail system by the firm collapsed in front of a Buddhist temple, killing three construction workers, according to local media. In a similar incident two years earlier, an Italian-Thai crane fell and crushed two cars in front of a Bangkok railway station, injuring one person. Wreckage at the site where a train was derailed when a construction crane collapsed and fell onto its carriages, causing several casualties, in Sikhio district, Nakhon Ratchasima province, Thailand on Jan 14, 2026. — Reuters Thailand has around 5,000 kilometres (3,107 miles) of railway but the run-down network has long driven people to favour travel by road. Upon completion of the 600km high-speed railway, Chinese-made trains will run from Bangkok to Nong Khai, on the Mekong River border with Laos, at up to 250 kilometres per hour. In 2020, then-Thai prime minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha, who pushed closer ties with Beijing, signed a deal for Thailand to cover all expenditures for the project, while using China-advised technology. China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Wednesday that Beijing “attaches great importance to the safety of this project and its personnel”, and expressed the nation’s condolences.",

      "summary_orig": "The PPP on Wednesday continued questioning the government on the recent deforestation in Islamabad, expressing dissatisfaction with the answers given by the government in a session of the National Assembly (NA) a day earlier. In the past few days, there has been widespread criticism over the cutting of thousands of mature trees in various locations of the federal capital, including the levelling of acres of tree cover around Shakarparian. On Tuesday, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had informed lawmakers that 29,115 trees had been removed from the Islamabad Capital Territory region (ICT), but that more than this number would be planted in the coming months. PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri, addressing a press conference, said that the issue had been raised in the NA as “all parliamentarians were concerned”, hoping that they would receive answers to the “questions that have been flying about”. However, she said, the response by the state minister for interior during Tuesday’s NA session had only raised more questions. “Sometimes it is said that it is because of pollen allergies … yesterday another impression was given, that there are some brown districts and some green districts — so you have to keep some brown and some green,” Marri said. “At what cost? At the cost of your environment? At the cost of urban planning? At the cost of biodiversity in your urban areas? At what cost?” She pointed out that not only were political parties asking these questions, but also civil society, adding that the World Wide Fund of Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) had also shown serious concern about the way the trees were being cut down. “It is not just cutting,” she said. “It is an action that is challenging your environmental governance; it raises questions on transparency.” Marri particularly took exception to the lack of transparency shown by the government in its response to the outcry. “You tell us: for however many trees you have cut, how many have you planted? We are not being shown this. We are only shown trees being cut, not planted.“ “We don’t know how many trees are being planted — we are only told that these many thousands have been planted. But what proof is there of this?” she added. The lawmaker further said, “To give them some benefit of the doubt: if you cut the trees and there was some good reason for it, then why are you running from giving answers?” Marri added that Chaudhry “should have given a patient answer” in the NA session yesterday. “He felt that maybe the CDA [Capital Development Authority] was being attacked; it was not like that.” She further said, “If you’re going to cut trees by the thousands in Pakistan’s capital — that is the face of your country — and so boldly, then the question will be raised… and will not just be asked to you by political parties, by the PPP, but the public will ask, civil society will ask, journalists will ask. They ask you and you get upset — that is not appropriate.” “If there is indeed purity in this action of yours, then share it. Tell us,” she added. Marri regretted that the government had not given a press conference on the matter of the trees, saying, “There’s a press conference on everything. But why did the government not take the public into confidence on the cutting of trees, through a press conference or a media briefing? This should have happened, and I regret to say it did not.” The CDA has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed, as they had been causing pollen allergies . However, social media users had alleged that, besides paper mulberry, indigenous trees were also chopped down, making Shakarparian look like barren land. Climate Change Minister Musadiq Malik has defended the move , stating that paper mulberry was an invasive and “life-threatening” species. Load shedding concerns At the same press conference, Marri slammed the state of load shedding in Pakistan, particularly focusing on Sindh. She said that if one called their sub-divisional officer, they would be told that the load shedding was because a household had not paid their electricity bill: “If one house didn’t pay the electricity bill, then you’ll cut electricity for the whole neighbourhood? … If not paying the bill is illegal, then cutting the electricity of those who do pay the bill is also illegal.” Marri lamented that this was the state of affairs in winter, wondering what would happen in summer. She also condemned gas load shedding and the lack of gas provided to Sindh, including Karachi, although it was a natural resource found in Sindh. She added that according to Article 158 of the Constitution, the first right to gas went to the people of the wellhead region. However, she said, people were being deprived of gas and when gas was available, they were being sold imported gas at high prices.",
