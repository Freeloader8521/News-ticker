      "title_orig": "Trump says ‘considering’ strike on Iran as Tehran says draft deal to be ready in next ‘two, three days’",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran after ordering a major naval buildup in the Middle East aimed at heaping pressure on Tehran to cut a deal to curb its nuclear programme. The latest threat came after Iran’s foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week. Trump had suggested on Thursday that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, which he subsequently extended to 15. Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump answered: “The most I can say — I am considering it.” After the talks in Geneva, Tehran said the two sides had agreed to submit drafts of a potential agreement, which Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told US media would be the “next step”. “I believe that in the next two, three days, that would be ready, and after final confirmation by my superiors, that would be handed over to Steve Witkoff,” he said, referring to Trump’s main Middle East negotiator. Araghchi also said US negotiators had not requested that Tehran end its nuclear enrichment programme, contradicting statements from American officials. “We have not offered any suspension, and the US side has not asked for zero enrichment,” he said in an interview released Friday by US TV network MS NOW . “What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear programme, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever,” he added. His comments stand in contrast to information relayed by high-ranking US officials, including Trump, who has repeatedly said Iran must not be allowed to enrich uranium at any level. Western countries accuse the Islamic republic of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes. Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy. Economic hardships sparked protests in December that evolved into a nationwide anti-government movement last month, prompting a crackdown from authorities. ‘No ultimatum’ The two foes held an initial round of discussions on February 6 in Oman, the first since previous talks collapsed during the 12-day Iran-Israel war last June, which the US joined by striking Iranian nuclear facilities. Washington has pursued a major military build-up in the region in tandem with the talks, and both sides have traded threats of military action for weeks. On Thursday, Trump again suggested the US would attack Iran if it did not make a deal within the timeframe he laid out. “We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen,” Trump told the inaugural meeting of the “Board of Peace”, his initiative for the post-war Gaza Strip. Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be “legitimate targets” if the United States followed through on its threats. Araghchi, however, insisted that “there is no ultimatum”. “We only talk with each other how we can have a fast deal. And a fast deal is something that both sides are interested about,” he said. “We are under sanctions, (so) obviously any day that sanctions are terminated sooner it would be better for us,” he said, adding Iran had “no reason to delay”. Washington has repeatedly called for zero enrichment, but has also sought to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its alleged support for militant groups in the region — issues which Israel has pushed to include in the talks. The Israeli army said on Friday that it was on “defensive alert” regarding the situation with Iran, but that its guidelines for the public remained unchanged. Ratcheting up the pressure, Trump has deployed a significant naval force to the region. After sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and escort battleships to the Gulf in January, he ordered a second carrier, the Gerald Ford, to depart for the Middle East. Subsequently, the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier was seen entering the Mediterranean Sea on Friday. The carrier was seen transiting the Strait of Gibraltar — which links the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean — in a photo taken from the Gibraltar side of the strait. Iranian naval forces also conducted military drills this week in the Gulf and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz in their own show of force.",

      "title": "Trump says ‘considering’ strike on Iran as Tehran says draft deal to be ready in next ‘two, three days’",
      "summary": "US President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran after ordering a major naval buildup in the Middle East aimed at heaping pressure on Tehran to cut a deal to curb its nuclear programme. The latest threat came after Iran’s foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week. Trump had suggested on Thursday that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, which he subsequently extended to 15. Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump answered: “The most I can say — I am considering it.” After the talks in Geneva, Tehran said the two sides had agreed to submit drafts of a potential agreement, which Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told US media would be the “next step”. “I believe that in the next two, three days, that would be ready, and after final confirmation by my superiors, that would be handed over to Steve Witkoff,” he said, referring to Trump’s main Middle East negotiator. Araghchi also said US negotiators had not requested that Tehran end its nuclear enrichment programme, contradicting statements from American officials. “We have not offered any suspension, and the US side has not asked for zero enrichment,” he said in an interview released Friday by US TV network MS NOW . “What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear programme, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever,” he added. His comments stand in contrast to information relayed by high-ranking US officials, including Trump, who has repeatedly said Iran must not be allowed to enrich uranium at any level. Western countries accuse the Islamic republic of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes. Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy. Economic hardships sparked protests in December that evolved into a nationwide anti-government movement last month, prompting a crackdown from authorities. ‘No ultimatum’ The two foes held an initial round of discussions on February 6 in Oman, the first since previous talks collapsed during the 12-day Iran-Israel war last June, which the US joined by striking Iranian nuclear facilities. Washington has pursued a major military build-up in the region in tandem with the talks, and both sides have traded threats of military action for weeks. On Thursday, Trump again suggested the US would attack Iran if it did not make a deal within the timeframe he laid out. “We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen,” Trump told the inaugural meeting of the “Board of Peace”, his initiative for the post-war Gaza Strip. Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be “legitimate targets” if the United States followed through on its threats. Araghchi, however, insisted that “there is no ultimatum”. “We only talk with each other how we can have a fast deal. And a fast deal is something that both sides are interested about,” he said. “We are under sanctions, (so) obviously any day that sanctions are terminated sooner it would be better for us,” he said, adding Iran had “no reason to delay”. Washington has repeatedly called for zero enrichment, but has also sought to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its alleged support for militant groups in the region — issues which Israel has pushed to include in the talks. The Israeli army said on Friday that it was on “defensive alert” regarding the situation with Iran, but that its guidelines for the public remained unchanged. Ratcheting up the pressure, Trump has deployed a significant naval force to the region. After sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and escort battleships to the Gulf in January, he ordered a second carrier, the Gerald Ford, to depart for the Middle East. Subsequently, the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier was seen entering the Mediterranean Sea on Friday. The carrier was seen transiting the Strait of Gibraltar — which links the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean — in a photo taken from the Gibraltar side of the strait. Iranian naval forces also conducted military drills this week in the Gulf and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz in their own show of force.",

      "summary_orig": "Batting great Babar Azam was moved down the batting order for Pakistan’s final T20 World Cup group game against Namibia for scoring too slowly, said head coach Mike Hesson on Friday. Azam, who is the highest run-scorer in T20 international history with 4,571 runs, was moved down the order for the must-win game against Namibia as Pakistan racked up 199-3 and secured a place in the Super Eights by 102 runs. The 2009 champions face New Zealand in Colombo on Saturday in the opening match of the second phase. “I think Babar is well aware that his strike rate in the power play in the World Cup is less than 100 and that’s clearly not the role we think we need,” Hesson told reporters after Pakistan’s final practice session on Friday was washed out by rain. Pakistan left out Azam for the same reason at last year’s Asia Cup and even after a dismal showing in the Big Bash League, he was still selected for the T20 World Cup. “We brought Babar back in for a specific role post the Asia Cup,” said Hesson. “We’ve got plenty of other options who can come in and perform that role towards the end. “Babar is actually the first to acknowledge that. “He knows that he’s got a certain set of skills that the team requires and there are certain times where other players can perform that role more efficiently.” Hesson also defended dropping pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi after he conceded 101 runs in three matches, including 31 in two overs against India . “We made a call that Salman Mirza was coming in for Shaheen, and he bowled incredibly well,” said Hesson. “To be fair, he was probably really unlucky not to be playing the second and third games.” Hesson was wary of Pakistan’s opponents on Saturday. “New Zealand have played a huge amount in the subcontinent in recent times, so we have to play at our best. “",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday, with the two sides discussing cooperation in critical minerals, energy, counter-terrorism and prospects for increased American investment, according to a State Department statement. The State Department said the US secretary thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for joining the first meeting of the “Board of Peace” as a founding member. He also offered condolences over the Jan 31 attacks in Balochistan and the Feb 6 bombing in Islamabad and reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counter-terrorism. The talks covered Pakistan’s participation in the recent Critical Minerals Ministerial in Washington, with the United States welcoming Islamabad’s engagement and discussing cooperation in developing Pakistan’s energy and mineral resources, as well as commercial opportunities for American companies. Separately, as per a press release issued by the Press Information Department (PID), during his meeting with Rubio, the premier congratulated him and US President Donald Trump on the “successful” inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness to “work with the Board of Peace for the implementation of the Gaza peace plan”. It added that during the meeting, “both sides underscored the importance of Pakistan-US strategic relations and expressed satisfaction over the momentum and positive trajectory of the partnership, under the leadership of President Trump”. Both leaders also agreed to improve bilateral trade, economic activities, and mutual cooperation in counter-terrorism efforts, it further added. During the meeting, the premier “emphasised the importance of continued high-level engagement between Pakistan and the US to advance common goals in a rapidly evolving global environment,” the statement said. Meanwhile, in a post on X, Rubio reiterated his appreciation for Pakistan’s support for the Gaza Peace Plan and for joining the board. “In our meeting, we discussed the importance of our strategic relationship on critical minerals development and counterterrorism,” he further said. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar responded to Rubio’s post and thanked him. He said Pakistan valued its “longstanding relationship with the United States”. The foreign minister added that the two diplomats had “meaningful discussions” on advancing peace, cooperation in fighting against terrorism, and expanding bilateral economic and trade ties. “We look forward to further strengthening our strategic partnership in all areas of shared interest,” said Dar. Shehbaz stresses need to end ceasefire violations in Gaza Earlier, addressing the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace — formally established last month after being proposed in September 2025 — Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for an end to ceasefire violations in Gaza, calling it “very important” for achieving durable peace in the war-torn territory. “The people of Palestine have long endured the illegal occupation and immense suffering. And, to achieve long-lasting peace, it is very important that ceasefire violations must end to preserve life and advance reconstruction efforts,” he said, adding that Palestinians must exercise full control over their land and future in line with UN Security Council resolutions. Praising Trump’s role, the prime minister said that through his “untiring support and great efforts, long-lasting peace in Gaza will be achieved” and that it would remain his legacy. Under its charter, the US government serves as the board’s depository and the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace has been designated as its headquarters. A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November last year authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to help establish an International Stabilisation Force in Gaza following the October ceasefire under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas. The truce, however, has remained fragile with repeated violations. In his remarks, Prime Minister Shehbaz also credited Trump with defusing the four-day Pakistan-India crisis in May 2025, saying his intervention had “potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people” and describing him as “a man of peace” and “a saviour of South Asia”. Speaking before the Pakistani leader, Trump recalled his contacts with both Islamabad and New Delhi during the conflict, saying he had warned the two countries that the United States would halt trade negotiations and could impose 200 per cent tariffs if the fighting continued. “I called them and said I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up,” he said, adding that the threat of economic consequences helped bring about a de-escalation. Trump also referred to his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, and praised the Pakistani leader for publicly acknowledging his role in stopping the conflict. The prime minister, in turn, lauded what he called Trump’s “bold diplomacy” and “dynamic leadership” in resolving international crises and bringing calm to global hotspots. The Washington engagements underscored Pakistan’s effort to expand economic cooperation with the United States — particularly in the energy and minerals sectors — while aligning with a US-led diplomatic initiative on Gaza and highlighting Trump’s mediation role in South Asia. PM Shehbaz meets global leaders The prime minister also held informal meetings in Washington with global leaders who had arrived to attend the inaugural session of the Board of Peace, said a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The premier met with the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, President of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and President of Indonesia Prabowo Subianto. The statement added that “important regional and global issues” were discussed during the meeting. “Pakistan’s participation in the Board of Peace reflects its efforts toward establishing peace in Gaza, reconstruction initiatives, global peace, and the growing success of Pakistan’s diplomatic policy,” said the statement. Separately, state-run APP reported that he also held a meeting with International Development Finance Corporation Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Black on Friday. An APP post on social media platform X said PM Shehbaz praised the corporation’s portfolio of over $1 billion and pointed to the synergies between the economic priorities of Pakistan and the US, which “present mutually beneficial opportunities to enhance B2B engagement”. For his part, Black briefed the prime minister on the agency’s strategic initiatives, priorities and project pipeline in Pakistan, and showed interest in enhancing DFC’s footprint in Pakistan, the post said.",

      "summary_orig": "When the Shibuya Arc concluded with Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 in late 2023, it posed many questions. What did Kenjaku really do? What were his true intentions? What would happen now that thousands of sorcerers were awakened? This article will be a comprehensive guide to all these answers and everything else you need to know before diving into the third and latest season of Jujutsu Kaisen . By neutralising Gojo Satoru within the prison realm, Kenjaku (or faux Geto) was free to set his master plan into motion — unleashing the age of cursed energy. Using Mahito’s “Idle Transfiguration” technique, Kenjaku altered two groups of people he had previously marked. The first group rapidly awakened innate cursed techniques and became jujutsu sorcerers, while the second had been fed sealed cursed objects over the years. When Kenjaku released the seals at the end of the Shibuya Arc , these humans’ bodies were permanently overtaken by the ancient entities inhabiting them, essentially reviving elite sorcerers from hundreds of years ago. Unfortunately for the protagonists, Megumi’s older sister, Tsumiki, was revealed to be among the ones who were marked by Kenjaku. As a result, she, alongside everyone else, was forcibly entered into the “Culling Game”. What is the Culling Game? After awakening hundreds of new and old sorcerers across Japan, the next step in Kenjaku’s plan was to enter everyone into the “Culling Game”, a brutal jujutsu battle royale, forcing newly awakened and ancient sorcerers to fight to the death. By pitting players against one another, Kenjaku aims to unlock their full potential and accelerate their growth in strength. In the jujutsu world, this forced slaughter constitutes one of the most heinous acts of terrorism imaginable. To ensure his plan proceeds without any sort of external interference or protests, Kenjaku established a strict set of rules governing the game. The rules of the Culling Game The Culling Game Arc is notorious for its heavy exposition dumps, much of which stems from the complex mechanics of the game itself. Kenjaku establishes eight rules in total, starting with a requirement for players to enter one of ten designated arenas within 19 days of their awakening. This effectively ensures no one can dodge the start of the game by any means, as failure to comply will likely lead to death, as stated in the second rule. The third rule opens the Culling Game to all jujutsu sorcerers, even those who were not recently awakened by Kenjaku. It states that non-players would become players upon entering one of the designated arenas, with their willing entry signalling their pledge to participate in the game. The fourth rule is what makes this game such a transgression: the game will award players points if they can end the life of another player. However, as rule five states, not all kills will be awarded the same number of points. Instead, the game master reserves the jurisdiction to award whatever value they see fit to someone’s life. The sixth rule is what Itadori and co. are truly after. It states that once players accumulate 100 points, they can negotiate with the game master to add an additional rule to the game. The Jujutsu High team aims to enter the game and subsequently exploit this rule to allow Tsumiki and the other innocent people to freely exit the game. However, the seventh rule places certain restrictions on the creation of new rules, stating that the game master can nullify any and all new conditions that directly contradict any of the previous rules or tamper with the continuation of the Culling Game as a whole. The eighth and final rule is simple but effective in making sure that each and every awakened sorcerer takes part in the games: if a player’s points do not increase by the first 19 days of the game’s commencement, they will likely face death.",

Unfortunately for the protagonists, Megumi’s older sister, Tsumiki, was revealed to be among the ones who were marked by Kenjaku. As a result, she, alongside everyone else, was forcibly entered into the “Culling Game”. What is the Culling Game? After awakening hundreds of new and old sorcerers across Japan, the next step in Kenjaku’s plan was to enter everyone into the “Culling Game”, a brutal jujutsu battle royale, forcing newly awakened and ancient sorcerers to fight to the death. By pitting players against one another, Kenjaku aims to unlock their full potential and accelerate their growth in strength. In the jujutsu world, this forced slaughter constitutes one of the most heinous acts of terrorism imaginable. To ensure his plan proceeds without any sort of external interference or protests, Kenjaku established a strict set of rules governing the game. The rules of the Culling Game The Culling Game Arc is notorious for its heavy exposition dumps, much of which stems from the complex mechanics of the game itself. Kenjaku establishes eight rules in total, starting with a requirement for players to enter one of ten designated arenas within 19 days of their awakening. This effectively ensures no one can dodge the start of the game by any means, as failure to comply will likely lead to death, as stated in the second rule. The third rule opens the Culling Game to all jujutsu sorcerers, even those who were not recently awakened by Kenjaku. It states that non-players would become players upon entering one of the designated arenas, with their willing entry signalling their pledge to participate in the game. The fourth rule is what makes this game such a transgression: the game will award players points if they can end the life of another player. However, as rule five states, not all kills will be awarded the same number of points. Instead, the game master reserves the jurisdiction to award whatever value they see fit to someone’s life. The sixth rule is what Itadori and co. are truly after. It states that once players accumulate 100 points, they can negotiate with the game master to add an additional rule to the game. The Jujutsu High team aims to enter the game and subsequently exploit this rule to allow Tsumiki and the other innocent people to freely exit the game. However, the seventh rule places certain restrictions on the creation of new rules, stating that the game master can nullify any and all new conditions that directly contradict any of the previous rules or tamper with the continuation of the Culling Game as a whole. The eighth and final rule is simple but effective in making sure that each and every awakened sorcerer takes part in the games: if a player’s points do not increase by the first 19 days of the game’s commencement, they will likely face death.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Police on Friday arrested the builder in connection with the deaths of 15 people in a building collapse triggered by a gas explosion in Soldier Bazaar a day earlier. Soldier Bazaar Station House Officer (SHO) Rizwan Patel confirmed that the owner-cum-builder Mohammed Irshad had been arrested after the registration of a first information report (FIR). He said the held suspect had rented out the building to the victims. The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn , was registered on the complaint of sub-inspector Khalid Mehmood at the Soldier Bazar police station under sections 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab ), 288 (negligent conduct with building), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 337-A (punishment of shajjah ) of the Pakistan Penal Code. According to the FIR, police received information on early Thursday morning about the collapse of a building in Gul Rana Colony, in which several people were killed and injured. Upon reaching the spot, the complainant said that one portion of the structure had completely collapsed. He said that the building, spread over 40 square yards, had been constructed using heavy-duty steel channels and nylon sheets. He further said that the building was a ground plus three-storey structure. The sub-inspector said that a man named Shahid Rasool lived on the first floor with his family. He said that at around 3:30am, Rasool’s wife lit a match to prepare Sehr, adding that the room was already full of gas due to a leakage. This led to the explosion, which caused the whole building to collapse, he said. The complainant further said that the rescue officials recovered at least 15 dead bodies from the rubble, while 15 others were injured in the incident. The official stated that the owner of the building had constructed the structure “illegally” in approximately 2007/2008. He said that the gas connection was also provided “illegally through pipes installed in a haphazard and unsafe manner, leading to the unfortunate incident. According to the FIR, the suspect committed negligence by installing substandard gas lines in an “illegally” constructed building. The complainant further said that the Bomb Disposal Unit had examined the destroyed building and submitted their report. He said that according to the unit, the gas leakage occurred because of substandard gas pipelines, which led to a gas leak and ultimately triggered an explosion when a match was lit.",

      "summary_orig": "PPP stalwart and former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani on Friday said that the deal inked with the United States to redevelop the Roosevelt Hotel in New York “must be placed” in Parliament. In a press release, Rabbani said, “The strategic economic initiative, including collaboration with the US General Services Administration, regarding the operation, maintenance, renovation and redevelopment of the Roosevelt Hotel has been signed without taking the people into confidence.” Rabbani said the hotel was “prime property” in New York and dealings pertaining to it must be transparent. “Parliament should have been taken into confidence before signing such memoranda of understanding (MoUs),” he said. He further highlighted that earlier, a deal with the US relating to minerals in Balochistan was “broken by international media”. “Till date, the details of this deal have not been made public,” he said. Rabbani further said that the PPP should move a private members’ bill, wherein all foreign agreements, once signed, would need ratification in Parliament. “I had moved such a bill when in the Senate,” he said. The remarks come a day after Pakistan and the US signed an MoU to launch a structured framework for cooperation on the future of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, marking a key development in Islamabad’s efforts to secure maximum value for the landmark property under its privatisation strategy. According to the finance ministry, the agreement was finalised in Washington and executed by US General Services Administration (GSA) Administrator Edward C. Forst and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff witnessed the signing. “It establishes a structured, time-bound framework for joint evaluation of the technical, commercial, and economic parameters of cooperation, reflecting a shared commitment to transparent, disciplined, and mutually beneficial progress,” the ministry said. The statement noted the Roosevelt Hotel’s prime location in Manhattan and the complexity of New York zoning and municipal process, saying the “institutional coordination aims to reduce execution risk, enhance regulatory clarity, and maximise transaction value”. “Such facilitative frameworks are consistent with international practice in cross-border real estate and infrastructure projects,” it added. “The objective remains to secure maximum value for this property in alignment with the government’s privatisation strategy while strengthening Pakistan-United States economic ties,” the statement concluded. Named after former US president Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a migrant shelter . The hotel is located near marquee New York destinations such as Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and Fifth Avenue, placing it in one of Manhattan’s most valuable commercial zones.",

      "summary_orig": "Five incarcerated senior leaders of the PTI urged the party to halt protest activities during the holy month of Ramazan, according to a joint letter sent to the media on Friday. The letter was written by Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed, all incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore. It was sent via their lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassar Umar. The letter also criticised President Asif Ali Zardari’s recent comments on incarcerated PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan. Last week, President Zardari had said it was the duty of leaders to fight and go to jail to protect their party and safeguard the people. Without naming Imran, he added that they had already started complaining about conditions in jail after an 18-month detention, while he himself had spent 14 years in prison without losing courage. “We strongly condemn Asif Ali Zardari’s recent rhetoric on the founder of the PTI,” the letter said, adding that Imran was currently serving his jail term “in difficult conditions” with dignity. “The government should stop politicising the health of the PTI founder,” it added. The letter further stated that Imran’s sisters and personal doctors should be taken into confidence and that he should be treated. The PTI leaders requested the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) to “fully engage in politics” in Parliament. The PTI leaders, in the letter, further said that “officials at all levels of PTI should reorganise the party”, taking the organisation to the grassroots level for local body elections across the country. The letter called for the issues of rising terrorism in the country, rising inflation, unemployment, out-of-school children and corruption to be highlighted “everywhere”. On February 12, Imran, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. The opposition alliance, TTAP, had staged a six-day sit-in at Parliament House over Imran’s health. It also doubled down on its earlier demands , including the PTI founder’s “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan and copies of his medical tests and diagnostic reports. In January, the five PTI leaders had written another open letter demanding that the government provide proper medical treatment to Imran when it was reported that he was suffering from an eye infection. The inmates also appealed to the chief justice to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment was given as soon as possible.",

      "title_orig": "King Charles’ brother Andrew released after arrest over misconduct relating to Epstein",
      "summary_orig": "King Charles’ younger brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was released from police custody on Thursday evening after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, had been questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police. Earlier this month, the police force said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy. The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times. “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement. A Reuters witness saw the former prince leaving a police station in Aylsham, eastern England, where he was met by a small group of photographers and television crews, just after 1900 GMT. A Reuters photograph taken after his release shows him seated inside a car, appearing visibly shaken. Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britainâ€™s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, leaves Aylsham Police Station on a vehicle, on the day he was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Aylsham, Britain, February 19, 2026. —Reuters Thames Valley Police said later on Thursday that “the arrested man” had been “released under investigation.” ‘The law must take its course’ Although Buckingham Palace was not informed in advance about the arrest, Charles said the authorities had the family’s “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”. “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” the monarch said in his statement. “Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” The king visited a fashion show in London on Thursday, making no further public comment. Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship. His office did not respond to a request for comment and he has not spoken publicly since the release of more than 3 million pages of documents by the US government relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Members of the media work outside the entrance to the Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate, which is reported to be serving as interim accommodation for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britain’s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, who was arrested this morning on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Norfolk, Britain, February 19, 2026. Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had in 2010 forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips as the government’s Special Representative for Trade and Investment. He was forced to step down from that role in 2011 after his close links to Epstein first emerged. “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement. “We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.” The arrest marks a new low for the former prince, who was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honours last October amid further revelations about their relationship. Unmarked police cars Earlier, six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothes officers were pictured at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England where Mountbatten-Windsor now resides. Thames Valley Police officers were also searching the mansion on the king’s Windsor estate where Mountbatten-Windsor lived until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations. While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt. A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which deal with the most serious criminal offences. Police have previously said misconduct in public office, which is a ‘common law’ offence and is not covered by written statute legislation, involved “particular complexities”. Giuffre lawsuit in 2022 The king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by the late Virginia Giuffre who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates. The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety. “Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” the family of Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, said in a statement. A van drives to enter the Royal Lodge, a property on the estate surrounding Windsor Castle and a former residence of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britainâ€™s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, in Windsor, Britain, February 19, 2026. —Reuters In response to Mountbatten-Windsor’s earlier arrest, US President Donald Trump said it was a “shame.” “I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family,” Trump told reporters. “It’s very, very sad to me… to see what’s going on with his (King Charles’) brother.” Were Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offences. His elder sister Princess Anne was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children. King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649 towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty and beheaded. The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking. Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic has reported him over allegations he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said it was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently. US lawmakers have also said he should testify before committees in the United States over what he knew about Epstein. Meanwhile former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein trafficking women without proper checks by the authorities through London’s Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mountbatten-Windsor. Essex Police said on Wednesday it was looking into the issue.",

Giuffre lawsuit in 2022 The king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by the late Virginia Giuffre who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates. The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety. “Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” the family of Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, said in a statement. A van drives to enter the Royal Lodge, a property on the estate surrounding Windsor Castle and a former residence of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britainâ€™s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, in Windsor, Britain, February 19, 2026. —Reuters In response to Mountbatten-Windsor’s earlier arrest, US President Donald Trump said it was a “shame.” “I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family,” Trump told reporters. “It’s very, very sad to me… to see what’s going on with his (King Charles’) brother.” Were Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offences. His elder sister Princess Anne was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children.

The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking. Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic has reported him over allegations he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said it was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently. US lawmakers have also said he should testify before committees in the United States over what he knew about Epstein. Meanwhile former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein trafficking women without proper checks by the authorities through London’s Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mountbatten-Windsor. Essex Police said on Wednesday it was looking into the issue.",
      "title": "King Charles’ brother Andrew released after arrest over misconduct relating to Epstein",
      "summary": "King Charles’ younger brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was released from police custody on Thursday evening after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, had been questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police. Earlier this month, the police force said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy. The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times. “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement. A Reuters witness saw the former prince leaving a police station in Aylsham, eastern England, where he was met by a small group of photographers and television crews, just after 1900 GMT. A Reuters photograph taken after his release shows him seated inside a car, appearing visibly shaken. Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britainâ€™s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, leaves Aylsham Police Station on a vehicle, on the day he was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Aylsham, Britain, February 19, 2026. —Reuters Thames Valley Police said later on Thursday that “the arrested man” had been “released under investigation.” ‘The law must take its course’ Although Buckingham Palace was not informed in advance about the arrest, Charles said the authorities had the family’s “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”. “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” the monarch said in his statement. “Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” The king visited a fashion show in London on Thursday, making no further public comment. Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship. His office did not respond to a request for comment and he has not spoken publicly since the release of more than 3 million pages of documents by the US government relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Members of the media work outside the entrance to the Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate, which is reported to be serving as interim accommodation for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britain’s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, who was arrested this morning on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Norfolk, Britain, February 19, 2026. Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had in 2010 forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips as the government’s Special Representative for Trade and Investment. He was forced to step down from that role in 2011 after his close links to Epstein first emerged. “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement. “We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.” The arrest marks a new low for the former prince, who was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honours last October amid further revelations about their relationship. Unmarked police cars Earlier, six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothes officers were pictured at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England where Mountbatten-Windsor now resides. Thames Valley Police officers were also searching the mansion on the king’s Windsor estate where Mountbatten-Windsor lived until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations. While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt.

      "summary_orig": "GENEVA: Israel’s increased attacks and forcible transfers of Palestinians “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing” in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, the United Nations said on Thursday. The cumulative impact of Israel’s military conduct during the conflict in Gaza and blockade of the territory, has inflicted living conditions “increasingly incompatible with Palestinians’ continued existence as a group in Gaza”, said the UN human rights office. “Intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the denial of humanitarian assistance appeared to aim at a permanent demographic shift in Gaza,” the office said in a report. “This, together with forcible transfers, which appear to aim at a permanent displacement, raise concerns over ethnic cleansing in Gaza and the West Bank.” The report covered Nov 1, 2024 to Oct 31, 2025. It highlighted the Israeli security forces’ “systematic use of unlawful force” in the occupied West Bank and annexed East Jerusalem. The report also pointed to “widespread” arbitrary detention and the “extensive unlawful demolition” of Palestinian homes. The aim, it said, was to “systematically discriminate, oppress, control and dominate the Palestinian people”. These actions are altering “the character, status and demographic composition of the occupied West Bank, raising serious concerns of ethnic cleansing”, it added. ‘Inhumane choice’ In Gaza, the report condemned the continued killing and maiming of “unprecedented numbers of civilians”, the spread of famine, and destruction of the “remaining civilian infrastructure”. During the 12 months covered in the report, at least 463 Palestinians, including 157 children, had starved to death in Gaza, it said. “Palestinians faced the inhumane choice of either starving to death or risking being killed while trying to get food,” it added. The famine, the malnutrition and the “foreseeable and repeatedly foretold” deaths directly resulted from actions taken by the Israeli government, said the report. Any use of starvation of civilians as a method of war constitutes a war crime, it said — and depending on the intent, it could also constitute genocide. During the period covered by the report, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups continued to hold Israeli and foreign hostages seized during the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel — dead or alive — as “bargaining tools”. The rights office said the treatment of the hostages amounted to war crimes. “Israeli forces, Hamas, and other Palestinian armed groups committed serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza, gross violations and abuses of international human rights law, and atrocity crimes,” the report concluded. On Tuesday, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich vowed to encourage “emigration” from the Palestinian territories. The West Bank would form the largest part of any future Palestinian state, but many on Israel’s religious right view it as Israeli land. Published in Dawn, February 20th, 2026",

Renewing his threats towards Tehran, President Donald Trump indicated on Thursday that the country has around 10 days to reach a deal with Washington, or “bad things will happen”. CNN and CBS reported on Wednesday that the US military would be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet. White House Press Secretary Karoline Lea­vitt warned on Wednesday there were “many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran”. “Iran would be very wise to make a deal with Pre­sident Trump,” she said. Trump’s comments came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued his own warning to Iran saying, “If the ayatollahs make a mistake and attack us, they will receive a response they cannot even imagine”. The Wall Street Journal , meanwhile, reported that Trump had been briefed on his military options with “all of them designed to maximise damage”, including a campaign to “kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government”, unnamed US officials told the newspaper. The US has, meanwhile, been building up its military forces near Iran, incl­uding warships, fighter jets, and refuelling aircraft, laying the foundation for a potentially sustained campaign against Iran — should Trump give the order. Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed. Speaking at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting , Trump even praised the “magnificent” B-2 bombers that “totally decimated the nuclear potential” of Iran last summer, saying they helped bring peace to the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years. Iran has also sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps holding war games earlier this week in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran’s joint exercise with Russia came days into an extended series of Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, with Iranian state television showing special forces units deployed on helicopters and ships. Amid the escalating warnings, Poland on Thursday ordered all its citizens in Iran to “leave immediately”. Germany meanwhile moved troops out of northern Iraq, reducing its footprint to the minimum necessary to keep its base there functional, citing escalating regional tensions. Dozens of German soldiers have been relocated away from the base in Erbil, capital of Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan region. Russia has also called for restraint, with a Kremlin spokesperson saying, “We are currently witnessing an unprecedented escalation of tension in the region, but we still hope that political and diplomatic means and negotiations will continue to prevail in the search for a settlement”.

      "title": "War clouds loom as US amasses military hardware in Middle East",
      "summary": "(LEFT) Iran and Russia carry out a joint military exercise; while (right) US Air Force planes are seen on the tarmac at the Sofia airport in Bulgaria.—Reuters • Trump says Tehran has ‘10 days’ to make a deal with Washington, or ‘bad things will happen’ • Kremlin urges restraint; Germany pulls troops out of Iraq; Poland tells citizens to leave Iran WASHINGTON: War clouds are looming over the Middle East, as US warplanes and aircraft carriers head toward Iran in preparation for possible military action. Renewing his threats towards Tehran, President Donald Trump indicated on Thursday that the country has around 10 days to reach a deal with Washington, or “bad things will happen”. CNN and CBS reported on Wednesday that the US military would be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet. White House Press Secretary Karoline Lea­vitt warned on Wednesday there were “many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran”. “Iran would be very wise to make a deal with Pre­sident Trump,” she said. Trump’s comments came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued his own warning to Iran saying, “If the ayatollahs make a mistake and attack us, they will receive a response they cannot even imagine”. The Wall Street Journal , meanwhile, reported that Trump had been briefed on his military options with “all of them designed to maximise damage”, including a campaign to “kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government”, unnamed US officials told the newspaper. The US has, meanwhile, been building up its military forces near Iran, incl­uding warships, fighter jets, and refuelling aircraft, laying the foundation for a potentially sustained campaign against Iran — should Trump give the order. Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed. Speaking at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting , Trump even praised the “magnificent” B-2 bombers that “totally decimated the nuclear potential” of Iran last summer, saying they helped bring peace to the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years. Iran has also sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps holding war games earlier this week in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran’s joint exercise with Russia came days into an extended series of Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, with Iranian state television showing special forces units deployed on helicopters and ships. Amid the escalating warnings, Poland on Thursday ordered all its citizens in Iran to “leave immediately”. Germany meanwhile moved troops out of northern Iraq, reducing its footprint to the minimum necessary to keep its base there functional, citing escalating regional tensions. Dozens of German soldiers have been relocated away from the base in Erbil, capital of Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan region. Russia has also called for restraint, with a Kremlin spokesperson saying, “We are currently witnessing an unprecedented escalation of tension in the region, but we still hope that political and diplomatic means and negotiations will continue to prevail in the search for a settlement”.
