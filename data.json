      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi arrived in Lahore on Friday evening, where the PTI plans to launch a fresh street movement and is expected to stage a public event at Liberty Roundabout this evening. A video shared by the PTI on X at 6pm showed the CM‘s vehicle showered with flowers by party workers and supporters as he arrived at PTI leader Latif Khosa’s residence. An earlier video shared by the party at 4:33pm showed Afridi’s vehicle entering Lahore through a toll plaza, while vehicles belonging to workers and supporters were halted and the toll plaza was subsequently closed. Speaking to reporters after crossing Ravi Toll Plaza, the CM noted that while he had been granted entry, at least seven accompanying vehicles had been stopped. “Workers from Mandi Bahauddin were stopped from travelling to Lahore through Bhera,” he said, claiming that roads were blocked and party workers had been arrested. A reporter informed him that media vehicles had also been denied entry. “Democratic governments do not do things like this,” he added. When asked if he wanted to convey a message to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz Sharif, he said, “The CM does not understand that by taking these actions, she is worsening tensions between two provinces.” When asked about his response to claims that PTI founder Imran Khan is a “security threat”, CM Afridi replied, “My message is this: Imran Khan is a symbol of national unity and guarantees political and economic stability.” CM Afridi is also expected to visit the Punjab Assembly during his time in the provincial capital. To that end, the Opposition Leader in the Punjab Assembly Moeen Riaz Qureshi wrote a letter to the speaker — a copy of which is available with Dawn — to prepare for the CM’s visit. Meanwhile, the PTI posted a video on X of opposition lawmakers gathering at the Punjab Assembly to greet the KP chief minister. “During the visit, he (CM Afridi) will hold a meeting with the opposition members and will also interact with representatives of the media. The [honourable] chief minister will remain in the Assembly until 8pm,” the letter read. “In view of the above, you are kindly requested to make the necessary administrative and security arrangements for the said visit, including seating, protocol and media coordination, to ensure that the program is conducted smoothly.” Earlier today, KP Minister Meena Khan Afridi said CM Maryam should be “ashamed for trampling on Punjab’s traditions” by blocking roads and closing down restaurants. “I want to tell her that she cannot stop us from moving on our path or thwart our mission,” he said in a video posted by the party on X. “This is only practice, but the full match is coming.” Moreover, the CM’s aide on information and public relations Shafiullah Jan said that the “tsunami” would reach Lahore, despite “hurdles” he claimed were placed to stop the PTI march. “We are crossing these hurdles and moving forward. The convoy is moving. When we reach Lahore, God willing, Section 804 will be in place,“ he said, referring to Imran’s prisoner number. According to an update posted on PTI’’s official X account at 2:24pm, the KP CM had reached Bhera by then in Punjab. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had earlier said that CM Afridi, his cabinet members and members of the provincial assembly would make their first stop in Punjab at Bhera during their journey to Lahore. She had asked ticket-holders and party office-bearers from the Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin divisions to welcome Afridi at that location. An update shared by PTI‘s Central Punjab account at 1pm said that CM Afridi’s convoy had reached Chakri at the time after making its way through “blockades by police ”. Another post on the account said policemen in large numbers had been deployed at the site. Sharing a video, where PTI supporters were seen engaging with police, the party alleged that law enforcers had tried to block the CM’s convoy from moving forward at Chakri Interchange. PTI MPAs from Punjab have gathered at the provincial assembly to welcome and meet the KP CM. The PTI has also alleged that police arrested scores of party leaders and workers late on Thursday night. “The Punjab government is scared to the extent that police began carrying out raids on Thursday night and picked hundreds of party workers,” stated PTI MPA Farrukh Javed Moon in a video message. Instead, he said, the Punjab government should act democratically and welcome the KP CM. Sohail Afridi on Thursday had said that the PTI would launch a street movement in line with the directives of its founder, Imran Khan, with “ full force ”. Meanwhile, Malik had said that the PTI would follow party founder Imran Khan’s directives to launch a “mass protest movement” in Pakistan’s largest province by population. She said it would be a “historic moment” to convert Lahore’s main boulevard into a march for the release of Khan. The chief organiser instructed all ticket-holders, office-bearers, workers, and lawyers in the Lahore division to ensure their presence at Liberty Roundabout to welcome CM Afridi. More to follow",

FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the UK high commissioner was summoned and issued a démarche. “The demarche was issued after provocative statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership from British soil,” the FO spokesperson said. The FO urged the UK to “hold responsible elements accountable in accordance with the law”. Earlier, two ministers of state from the PML-N said that the Pakistan government had written a letter to the UK authorities, seeking action against over “inciteful” statements, particularly in reference to a video that iwas circulating on social media. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani confirmed that development to Geo News , with the latter particularly mentioning that “the head of armed forces was threatened” in the video. Kayani also mentioned the opposition PTI‘s involvement in the matter, naming the party, which Chaudhry didn’t. In the video, a woman appears to be wishing ill on a person without taking any name, saying that they should be “blown up in a car”. The woman can be seen surrounded by people holding PTI flags. When asked about the video, Chaudhry said, “Pakistan has formally written to the UK, expecting them to act according to their laws and justice system.“ He maintained that Pakistan had the right to take legal action against those “targeting its institutions”. Chaudhry recalled that there had been complaints before as well regarding the “use of social media platforms to incite hatred against state institutions and political figures”. “The footage of the incident is available,” he added, referring to the video being discussed. He added, “This is not a political matter, nor one pertaining to the freedom of speech.” It was a clear violation of international law and the UK law, he said, particularly mentioning the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006. “Every state is responsible for ensuring its citizens, or those who have taken asylum, or those residing there, don’t act against to incite rebellion or violence against other sovereign states,” he stressed. Chaudhry further noted: “What’s concerning is the specific mention of a car bomb blast, making it a targeted issue; it is not something generalised, it seems to be carefully planned.“ “Pakistan has raised these concerns,” he said. “It appears as if there is a larger plan involved, and Pakistan has raised these concerns,” Chaudhry said. He maintained that “inciting terrorism or provoking people was not akin to freedom of expression”. “You can not have people in one state promoting terrorism against another sovereign state,” he reiterated. He hoped that the British government would take action, adding that in case of non-compliance, “Pakistan has other options as well“. Minister of State for Finance Kayani termed the incident shown in the video “unacceptable” and “unfortunate”. “We have repeatedly said that PTI spreads violence and threats under the guise of politics, justifies threats, and misuses freedom of speech,” Kayani said. He added that the party had “crossed a limit” by “threatening the armed forces’ chief with murder under the guise of political protest”. “That’s not politics[..] it’s unacceptable,” he said. He termed PTI a “national security threat”, alleging that it had always used politics to cover for “violence”. “Whether on May 9, using KP police to attack soldiers, and threatening the army chief […] if that’s not a national security threat, what is?” he said. In response to a question on whether the Pakistani government would take action in the matter, he said, “First, we will urge the UK government to take immediate legal action and investigate the matter”. However, he added that the government was open to “exploring other legal options”. Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had said that the government would repatriate from the UK those (YouTubers) involved in targeting the state institutions. When asked about criticism directed towards the army chief, Naqvi had said: “The state is clear. We will not spare them.“ On Dec 4, the interior minister, in a meeting with the UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott, submitted extradition papers for former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja, who Naqvi said were involved in spreading “anti-Pakistan propaganda” online.",

      "summary_orig": "Fourteen people were injured in a stabbing attack in a factory in central Japan during which an unspecified liquid was also sprayed, an emergency services official said on Friday. “Fourteen people are subject to transportation by emergency services,” Tomoharu Sugiyama, a firefighting department official in the city of Mishima in the Shizuoka region, told AFP . He said a call was received at about 4.30pm (12:30pm PKT) from a nearby rubber factory saying “five or six people were stabbed by someone” and that a “spray-like liquid” had also been used. Japanese media, including public broadcaster NHK , reported that police had arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder. The seriousness of the injuries was unknown, although NHK said all victims remained conscious. Sugiyama said at least six of the 14 victims had been sent to a hospital in a fleet of ambulances. The exact nature of the injuries was also unclear. The factory in Mishima is run by Yokohama Rubber Co., whose business includes manufacturing tyres for trucks and buses, according to its corporate website. Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan, which has a low murder rate and some of the world’s toughest gun laws. However, there are occasional stabbing attacks and even shootings, including the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022. A Japanese man was sentenced to death in October for a shooting and stabbing rampage that killed four people, including two police officers, in 2023. A 43-year-old man was also charged with attempted murder in May over a knife attack at Tokyo’s Toda-mae metro station.",

      "title_orig": "Paradise lost: Kashmir, orientalism, and the politics of belonging",
      "summary_orig": "Kashmir has long occupied a curious space in the European imagination. For centuries, travellers, merchants, and colonial administrators produced narratives that constructed this Himalayan valley as a mythical ‘Paradise of the Indies’ — a land of extraordinary beauty whose inhabitants, strangely, were deemed unworthy of it. This paradox, celebrating the land while denigrating its people, did not die with colonialism. It found new life in the ideological project of Hindu nationalism, which has weaponised these orientalist tropes to justify the ongoing colonisation of India-Kashmir and the systematic othering of its Muslim majority. The question of who belongs in Kashmir, and who gets to define it, has never been merely academic. It is a question written in blood, displacement, and the language of competing nationalisms. Annexed by India in 1947 through the contested Instrument of Accession, Jammu and Kashmir was granted ‘special status’ under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, a status effectively dismantled in 2019 amid heavily militarised conditions. Today, as New Delhi strips Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and Bollywood produces films that either sanitise or demonise Kashmiri Muslims, tracing the genealogy of these representations becomes an urgent political task. The colonial gaze and the ‘paradise’ myth European fascination with Kashmir began with travellers like François Bernier, a French physician who accompanied Aurangzeb’s entourage to the valley in the 17th century. Bernier likened Kashmir’s mountains to Mount Olympus and its meadows to European gardens, “enamelled with our European flowers and plants, and covered with our apple, pear, plum”. The language of possession — ‘our’ fruits in ‘their’ land — reveals the European impulse to claim Kashmir as a distant reflection of itself, a space of familiarity amid the strangeness of the Orient. This fascination with places and people perceived as similar to Europe created a substantial readership for travel writing as a genre. The European identity was affirmed through encounters with distant lands that could be made familiar, comprehensible, and available for appropriation. As scholar Kim Phillips has argued , travel writing operates through a “referential pact”, whereby readers trust that their craving for knowledge about exotic places will be satisfied. These narratives became canonised over time, each new account building on previous ones, generating an ever-increasing interest in Kashmir. This construction of Kashmir as a mirror of European beauty was paired with a troubling ethnographic curiosity about its people. George Forster, an East India Company employee who disguised himself as a Turkish merchant to enter the valley in the 1780s, described Kashmiris as possessing “stout, well-formed, European likeness”. Other travellers went further, comparing Kashmiris to Jews — Europe’s internal other — and tracing their origins to the lost tribes of Israel. Charles von Hugel, an Austrian explorer, wrote in 1845 that Kashmiris had “almost Jewish features,” with their “white skin” and “colourless complexion” marking them as somehow out of place in the Subcontinent. This preoccupation with denying Kashmiris their indigeneity — locating them elsewhere, whether in ancient Israel or in some European prehistory — served a colonial purpose. If Kashmiris were never truly native, then the land could be claimed, administered, and imagined by others. The beauty of the valley was severed from the people who inhabited it and made available for appropriation. As author Rafiq Ahmad in his study notes , such representations sought to attribute the creation of Kashmiri “traditions and customs to cultures more familiar to Europeans”, providing the civilisational basis through which orientalism continually reinforced its power and authority. Yet alongside claims of ethnic kinship came harsh moral judgments. Edward Knight, a British officer who travelled through Kashmir in 1891, initially found Kashmiris “clever, cheery and civil” , before dismissing them as “among the most despicable creatures on earth, incorrigible cheats and liars, and cowardly to an inconceivable degree”. William Moorcroft and George Trebeck, writing earlier in the century, described them as “selfish, superstitious, ignorant, supple, intriguing, dishonest and false”. The valley’s beauty, in this logic, was God-given and majestic; its people deserved no credit for it. Indeed, their very presence disrupted the Orientalist fantasy of Kashmir as an earthly paradise waiting to be discovered and possessed by more worthy inhabitants. This aesthetic approach within colonial travelogues consistently portrayed the inhabitants as incompatible with their own topography. All anxieties around encounters with the unfamiliar were resolved by defining the European self through confrontation with the ‘other’. For Phillips, travel and its associated cultural practices must be located within larger formations in which “inscriptions of power and privilege are made clearly visible”. The presence of Kashmiris was represented as an “unregulated threat” waiting to spill over, to effectively ruin Kashmir’s beauty — a sentiment that has persisted well beyond the colonial period. Rewriting history: from Firishta to Hindutva The orientalist framework did not merely produce aesthetic judgments; it rewrote history. As historian Manan Ahmed has shown , colonial scholars drew selectively on Persianate sources such as Muhammad Qasim Firishta’s Tarikh-i-Firishta, to construct narratives of Muslim tyranny and Hindu victimhood. Firishta himself, writing in the early 17th century, presented a nuanced picture of Kashmir’s rulers — praising Zainul ’Abidin, for instance, for recalling exiled Brahmins, abolishing discriminatory taxes, commissioning translations of the Mahabharata into Persian, and patronising both Sanskrit and Persian literature. But colonial readings flattened this complexity, extracting episodes of religious conflict and presenting them as evidence of inherent Muslim despotism and “foreignness to Hindustan”. Kashmir’s complicated history of invasions and rulers — from the Buddhist chief Rinchana who converted to Islam under Sufi instruction, to Shah Mir who established the first Muslim dynasty, to the Mughal emperors who built lavish retreats there, to the brutal Dogra rulers of the 19th century — was reduced to a simple morality tale. The region that had produced Habba Khatun, who gave Kashmiri its literary form and encouraged the synthesis of Persian and Indian music, was recast as a site of eternal religious conflict. The European imperialist instinct demanded “extended and extensive ethnographic descriptions of the inherent oppression of Hindus at the hands of Muslims,” as Ahmed notes , and these descriptions were duly provided. This selective historiography has found eager inheritors in the Hindu nationalist movement. For the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological parent organisations, Kashmir represents both a territorial claim and a civilisational wound. The region is viewed through an India/Hindu versus Pakistan/Muslim framework, and its Muslim majority population is seen as evidence of historical injury against the ‘rightful’ Hindu inheritors of the land. The departure of Kashmiri Pandits from the valley in the early 1990s — a genuine tragedy deserving serious engagement — has been instrumentalised as proof of Muslim barbarism, disconnected from the complex political history of the armed insurgency, Indian military occupation, and Pakistani intervention that produced it. In 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that “Kashmir humara hai ” (Kashmir is ours) and promised to transform it into “swarg” (heaven) once again, he was drawing on centuries of representation that imagined the valley as a paradise stolen, corrupted, or held hostage by Muslim inhabitants. The rhetoric of restoration implies that its current population has somehow desecrated it, that their removal or subjugation is necessary for the land’s redemption. This is presented not as partisan ideology but as the “iccha” (wish) of 130 crore Indians, reflecting the national stake every citizen is encouraged to have in ‘protecting’ Kashmir. From romance to revenge Hindi cinema has served as a powerful vehicle for these narratives, translating political ideology into emotional spectacle. For decades, India-held Kashmir functioned as Bollywood’s scenic backdrop — a place of snow-capped romance, safely depoliticised, its conflicts invisible. But as academic Julia Szivak has highlighted , the 1990s insurgency transformed Kashmir into a site of nationalist melodrama, where the “fight for survival of the Indian nation” was dramatised against the valley’s picturesque landscape. Kashmiri insurgents were portrayed as Pakistan-supported religious zealots, while heroes served as instructive guides establishing appropriate patriotic norms for Indian citizens. Kunal Kohli’s Fanaa (2006) offers a relatively moderate version of this formula. Its Kashmiri heroine, Zooni, embodies ideal Indian citizenship: she salutes the flag, delivers patriotic speeches comparing Kashmir’s beauty to all of India, and ultimately sacrifices her love for her country by killing her militant husband to prevent a terrorist attack. The film distinguishes between ‘good’ Muslims — loyal, self-sacrificing, aligned with the state — and ‘bad’ Muslims whose desire for azadi (freedom) marks them as threats. It offers a conditional belonging: Kashmiri Muslims may be accepted if they perform their allegiance enthusiastically enough. Vivek Agnihotri’s The Kashmir Files (2022) dispenses with such niceties. Claiming to expose the ‘truth’ of the Pandit exodus, the film presents Kashmiri Muslims as uniformly bloodthirsty, deceitful, and sexually predatory. Characters are named after Hindu deities — Krishna, Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu — anchoring their indigeneity to ancient mythology, while Muslims are depicted as foreign invaders. The film’s protagonist delivers a speech tracing Kashmir’s glory to pre-Islamic sages like Rishi Kashyap and Shankaracharya, describing the valley as the ‘Silicon Valley of the first millennium,’ before presenting its corruption as beginning with Muslim arrival — a narrative that mirrors colonial historiography almost exactly. What’s striking is how these films reproduce orientalist tropes almost unchanged. The beautiful land defiled by unworthy inhabitants; the ancient civilisation destroyed by foreign invaders; the need for civilisation, order, and redemption from outside. The British claimed this role for themselves; Hindu nationalism claims it for the Indian state. The target remains the same: the Kashmiri Muslim, constructed as eternally alien, perpetually threatening, fundamentally incompatible with the paradise they inhabit. The politics of paradise To trace these representations is not to deny the genuine suffering of Kashmiri Pandits, nor to minimise the violence that has marked the valley’s recent history. It is, rather, to insist that this violence cannot be understood outside the longer history of how Kashmir has been imagined, claimed, and fought over. The ‘paradise’ myth was never innocent. From colonial travelogues to contemporary cinema, it has served to separate the land from its people, to make the valley available for possession by others. Jawaharlal Nehru, himself a Kashmiri Pandit, described the valley in 1940 as “some supremely beautiful woman, whose beauty is almost impersonal and above human desire”. The feminisation of landscape and the language of desire and possession are tropes that have structured Kashmir’s representation for centuries. As Emmanuela Mangiarotti argues , the Indian state has worked to fix a specific historical narrative through Kashmir that anchors “specific imaginings of community and the nation to a recognisable cultural repository”. Today, as the Indian state imposes unprecedented levels of military control, as communication blackouts silence Kashmiri voices, as demographic changes threaten to transform the valley’s character, these representations take on urgent political significance. The question is not merely how India-held Kashmir has been represented, but whose representations count, whose stories are told, whose belonging is recognised. Colonial officers, Hindu nationalists, and Bollywood filmmakers have all claimed the right to define Kashmir, to determine who belongs there and on what terms. Kashmiri Muslims, however, have not just been passive observers, but have actively written back: in protests met with pellet guns , in poems circulated despite censorship, and in testimonies recorded before each communication blackout . The orientalist tropes of the past, therefore, have found a new home in modern state policy and popular cinema. While the tools of representation have changed, they still rely on the old conviction that Kashmir’s landscape is a national treasure and its inhabitants, specifically the Kashmiri Muslims, are a threat to its perfection. The colonial equation remains intact: the land is everything, its people an inconvenience.",

      "summary_en": "Kashmir has long occupied a curious space in the European imagination. For centuries, travellers, merchants, and colonial administrators produced narratives that constructed this Himalayan valley as a mythical ‘Paradise of the Indies’ — a land of extraordinary beauty whose inhabitants, strangely, were deemed unworthy of it. This paradox, celebrating the land while denigrating its people, did not die with colonialism. It found new life in the ideological project of Hindu nationalism, which has weaponised these orientalist tropes to justify the ongoing colonisation of India-Kashmir and the systematic othering of its Muslim majority. The question of who belongs in Kashmir, and who gets to define it, has never been merely academic. It is a question written in blood, displacement, and the language of competing nationalisms. Annexed by India in 1947 through the contested Instrument of Accession, Jammu and Kashmir was granted ‘special status’ under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, a status effectively dismantled in 2019 amid heavily militarised conditions. Today, as New Delhi strips Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and Bollywood produces films that either sanitise or demonise Kashmiri Muslims, tracing the genealogy of these representations becomes an urgent political task. The colonial gaze and the ‘paradise’ myth European fascination with Kashmir began with travellers like François Bernier, a French physician who accompanied Aurangzeb’s entourage to the valley in the 17th century. Bernier likened Kashmir’s mountains to Mount Olympus and its meadows to European gardens, “enamelled with our European flowers and plants, and covered with our apple, pear, plum”. The language of possession — ‘our’ fruits in ‘their’ land — reveals the European impulse to claim Kashmir as a distant reflection of itself, a space of familiarity amid the strangeness of the Orient. This fascination with places and people perceived as similar to Europe created a substantial readership for travel writing as a genre. The European identity was affirmed through encounters with distant lands that could be made familiar, comprehensible, and available for appropriation. As scholar Kim Phillips has argued , travel writing operates through a “referential pact”, whereby readers trust that their craving for knowledge about exotic places will be satisfied. These narratives became canonised over time, each new account building on previous ones, generating an ever-increasing interest in Kashmir. This construction of Kashmir as a mirror of European beauty was paired with a troubling ethnographic curiosity about its people. George Forster, an East India Company employee who disguised himself as a Turkish merchant to enter the valley in the 1780s, described Kashmiris as possessing “stout, well-formed, European likeness”. Other travellers went further, comparing Kashmiris to Jews — Europe’s internal other — and tracing their origins to the lost tribes of Israel. Charles von Hugel, an Austrian explorer, wrote in 1845 that Kashmiris had “almost Jewish features,” with their “white skin” and “colourless complexion” marking them as somehow out of place in the Subcontinent. This preoccupation with denying Kashmiris their indigeneity — locating them elsewhere, whether in ancient Israel or in some European prehistory — served a colonial purpose. If Kashmiris were never truly native, then the land could be claimed, administered, and imagined by others. The beauty of the valley was severed from the people who inhabited it and made available for appropriation. As author Rafiq Ahmad in his study notes , such representations sought to attribute the creation of Kashmiri “traditions and customs to cultures more familiar to Europeans”, providing the civilisational basis through which orientalism continually reinforced its power and authority. Yet alongside claims of ethnic kinship came harsh moral judgments. Edward Knight, a British officer who travelled through Kashmir in 1891, initially found Kashmiris “clever, cheery and civil” , before dismissing them as “among the most despicable creatures on earth, incorrigible cheats and liars, and cowardly to an inconceivable degree”. William Moorcroft and George Trebeck, writing earlier in the century, described them as “selfish, superstitious, ignorant, supple, intriguing, dishonest and false”. The valley’s beauty, in this logic, was God-given and majestic; its people deserved no credit for it. Indeed, their very presence disrupted the Orientalist fantasy of Kashmir as an earthly paradise waiting to be discovered and possessed by more worthy inhabitants. This aesthetic approach within colonial travelogues consistently portrayed the inhabitants as incompatible with their own topography. All anxieties around encounters with the unfamiliar were resolved by defining the European self through confrontation with the ‘other’. For Phillips, travel and its associated cultural practices must be located within larger formations in which “inscriptions of power and privilege are made clearly visible”. The presence of Kashmiris was represented as an “unregulated threat” waiting to spill over, to effectively ruin Kashmir’s beauty — a sentiment that has persisted well beyond the colonial period.

      "summary_orig": "Five people were killed in an armed clash on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Tajik state media said on Thursday. Citing a statement by the Border Troops of the Tajik State Committee for National Security, state news agency Khovar reported that three people crossed into the country late on Tuesday in the Shamsiddin Shohin district of the country’s southwestern Khatlon region, and were later located on Wednesday. “The terrorists refused to obey orders from Tajik border guards to surrender and offered armed resistance. They intended to carry out an armed attack on one of the border posts of the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan,” the statement said. “As a result of the combat operation, all three terrorists were neutralised,” the statement said, adding that two Tajik border officers were killed during the clashes. According to the statement, this was the third “armed attack, terrorist act, and border crossing” from Afghanistan in the past month. It also accused the Afghan government of “demonstrating serious and repeated irresponsibility and non-commitment in fulfilling its international obligations and consistent promises to ensure security and stability” on the Tajik-Afghan border. The Tajik statement additionally expressed hope that the Afghan administration will “apologise to the people of Tajikistan and take additional effective measures to ensure security on the border with Tajikistan”. Afghanistan did not immediately comment on the development. Earlier this month, Tajikistan said five people were killed and five others injured in two previous cross-border attacks from Afghanistan. On Wednesday, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon commissioned four new border outposts, as well as a training range for tanks at the Harb-Maidon training ground near the Tajik-Afghan border, as part of efforts to bolster border security amid growing concerns over cross-border attacks.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has condemned the recent surge of violence, vandalism, and arson targeting media houses in Bangladesh. A joint statement issued by PFUJ President Afzal Butt, and Secretary General Arshad Ansari on Friday said, “Silencing the press through physical intimidation is a direct violation of the constitutional right to freedom of expression and the rule of law.” The statement comes days after Bangladesh saw violent protests following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka on December 16 while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He died in Singapore on December 18. Following his death, violent protests broke out and several buildings, including those housing leading newspapers Prothom Alo and The Daily Star , were set on fire and vandalised. Protesters accused the newspapers of enabling Hadi’s killing, calling them “Delhi’s lapdog” and “Sheikh Hasina’s enabler,” claims the newspapers denied. The PFUJ statement denounced these “targeted attacks”,  as well as the “deplorable physical assault“ on Nurul Kabir, the veteran editor of New Age newspaper and president of  Editors’ Council of Bangladesh. The PFUJ also expressed deep concern over reports that more than 100 journalists in Bangladesh remain detained without trial, demanding their immediate and unconditional release. Moreover, the statement highlighted a “disturbing regional trend”, pointing to similar violence in Nepal. “Just months ago, mob attacks targeted the Kantipur Group , Annapurna Post , and Image TV ,” the statement said, adding that the PFUJ leadership also paid tribute to photojournalist Suresh Rajak of Avenews TV , who tragically died in an arson attack on March 28, 2025, in Kathmandu. The PFUJ noted with “regret that perpetrators of these crimes remain unaccountable”. It called upon the governments concerned to conduct fair, impartial, and speedy investigations into all incidents of arson and violence; identify and bring the perpetrators to justice to end the culture of impunity; and ensure the safety of journalists as they perform their professional duties. “Violence and harassment aimed at silencing the media are unacceptable in any democratic society,” the statement concluded.",

      "summary_orig": "President Donald Trump said US forces conducted “powerful and deadly” strikes on Thursday against Islamic State (IS) militants in northwestern Nigeria, weeks after he warned against any systemic assault on Christians in the country. The Nigerian foreign ministry early on Friday confirmed the air strikes, describing them as “precision hits on terrorist targets” in the country. The Department of Defence’s US Africa Command said “multiple ISIS terrorists” were killed in an attack in Sokoto state conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities, but few details were provided and it was not clear how many people died. The strikes hit IS targets on Christmas Day, according to Trump. “I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “May God Bless our Military,” he said, adding provocatively, “MERRY CHRISTMAS to all, including the dead Terrorists, of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues.” The attacks mark the first by US forces in Nigeria under Trump, and come after the Republican leader unexpectedly berated the west African nation in October and November, saying Christians there faced an “existential threat” that amounted to “genocide” amid Nigeria’s myriad armed conflicts. That diplomatic offensive was welcomed by some but interpreted by others as inflaming religious tensions in Africa’s most populous country, which has seen bouts of sectarian violence in the past. Nigeria’s government and independent analysts reject framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution — a narrative long used by the Christian right in the United States and Europe. But Trump, spotlighting what his administration says is global persecution of Christians, stressed last month that Washington was ready to take military action in Nigeria — with “guns-a-blazing” — to counter such killings. ‘Grateful’ for cooperation The Nigerian foreign ministry said the country was engaged with international partners against terrorism. “Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorism and violent extremism,” the ministry said in a statement on Friday. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth took to X to say he was “grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation.” The United States this year placed Nigeria back on the list of countries of “particular concern” regarding religious freedom, and has restricted the issuance of visas to Nigerians. Trump last month also threatened to stop all aid to Abuja if it “continues to allow the killing of Christians“. Nigeria is almost evenly divided between a Muslim-majority north and largely Christian south. Its northeast has been in the grip of violence for more than 15 years by the Boko Haram group, which has claimed more than 40,000 lives and displaced two million people. At the same time, large parts of the country’s northwest, north and centre have been hit by criminal gangs known as “bandits” who attack villages, killing and kidnapping residents. On Wednesday, an explosion ripped through a mosque in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, killing at least seven worshippers. No armed groups immediately claimed responsibility.",

Earlier this week a Hindutva mob tried to storm the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi, while attacks on Bangladeshi diplomatic missions in other Indian cities have also been reported. Extremist groups in India such as the VHP are using the tragic lynching of a Bangladeshi Hindu man in Mymensingh as an excuse to target Dhaka’s missions in India. Bangladesh’s interim authorities had summoned the Indian high commissioner in Dhaka to protest against attacks on their missions in India, while Dhaka’s representative in Delhi was similarly summoned in a tit-for-tat exchange. Bangladesh’s interim foreign minister has said his country’s top diplomat in India had received death threats. The Indian state, meanwhile, has tried to downplay the events, particularly attempts by extremist mobs to target Bangladeshi missions. During Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s rule, Dhaka and Delhi were very much on the same page. However, anti-India feeling in Bangladesh has erupted after Ms Wajed’s government was toppled last year, with many seeing Delhi as supporting her authoritarian rule. The fact that Sheikh Hasina fled to India after last year’s uprising has done little to dispel this impression. Moreover, reports that Osman Hadi’s suspected killer escaped to India have further added to the anger. Perhaps the key reason behind the fraying of ties between both states is India’s patronising attitude towards its neighbours. Delhi should cooperate with Dhaka to trace Hadi’s killers, and should refrain from meddling in Bangladesh’s internal affairs and fanning communal fires. The fact is that for there to be peace and amity in South Asia, the sovereignty of all states must be respected, and no state must act as if it is the regional hegemon, free to throw its weight around and bully others.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: China continues to strengthen its position as a major global arms supplier, with Pakistan emerging as its most significant and trusted partner in the air combat domain, according to a Pentagon report sent to the US Congress this week. The report states that as of December 2024, China remained the world’s fourth-largest arms exporter, relying primarily on state-owned defence companies such as the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and North Industries Corporation (Norinco). It notes that China’s arms exports are closely linked to its broader foreign policy and development outreach, including initiatives associated with the Belt and Road framework, and are particularly attractive to developing countries due to affordability and flexible terms. According to this report, Pakistan figures prominently in China’s aviation exports. Beijing currently offers three fixed-wing combat aircraft for export: the fifth-generation FC-31 stealth fighter, the fourth-generation J-10C multirole combat aircraft, and the JF-17 Thunder, which is jointly developed and produced by China and Pakistan. Importantly, the report confirms that Pakistan is the only country to which China has exported the J-10C. As of May 2025, China had delivered 20 J-10C aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force under two orders placed since 2020, with total orders amounting to 36 aircraft. While several other countries — including Egypt, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, Iran and Bangladesh — have expressed interest, no J-10C exports beyond Pakistan have taken place. Pentagon report says Beijing has strengthened its position as major arms supplier The report also highlights the JF-17 programme as a successful example of defence collaboration between two developing countries. Jointly produced by Pakistan and China, the aircraft is already in service with multiple air forces. As of 2024, Azerbaijan, Myanmar and Nigeria were operating the JF-17, while Iraq was reported to be in discussions. For Pakistan, the aircraft remains a central component of its air force as well as an important defence export. In addition to manned aircraft, the Pentagon report notes that China has supplied Pakistan with advanced, strike-capable unma­nned aerial vehicles, including the Caihong and Wing Loong series. These systems have also been exported to several other countries, reflecting China’s growing role in the global UAV market. Beyond aviation, the report says China exports a wide range of military equipment across land, air defence and naval domains. Pakistan is identified as a long-standing recipient of Chinese naval platforms, including four frigates delivered in 2017 and 2018. The report adds that China is expected to expand its naval exports in the coming years, with Pakistan remaining among its core partners. The Pentagon assessment attributes China’s growing appeal in the global arms market to competitive pricing, flexible financing and the absence of restrictive political conditions. For Pakistan, the defence relationship with China is not limited to arms purchases but reflects a mature partnership encompassing joint development, production and long-term strategic cooperation, the report notes.

      "summary_orig": "ISTANBUL: More than 100 suspected members of the militant Islamic State (IS) group, who were allegedly planning attacks during Christmas and New Year celebrations, have been arrested in Turkiye, a prosecutor general said on Thursday. The prosecutor’s office said arrest warrants were issued for 137 suspects, of whom 115 have so far been detained, following intelligence indicating that the IS terrorist organisation was planning attacks during the holiday period. The operation launched after police received intelligence that ISIL members were “planning attacks in Turkiye against non-Muslims in particular”, during the holiday period, it added. Officers seized firearms, ammunition and what officials described as organisational documents during the sweeps, Al Jazeera reported on Thursday. Efforts are continuing to locate the remaining 22 suspects. That sweep, coordinated between intelligence services, police and military forces, netted individuals involved in financing the group’s activities and spreading its propaganda. The prosecutor’s office said those arrested were in contact with IS operatives outside Turkiye, underscoring the transnational nature of the threat. Turkiye shares a 900-kilometre (559-mile) border with Syria, where militant groups are still active. IS leader ‘killed’ in Syria Also on Thursday, Syr­ian authorities claimed to have killed a senior IS leader in coordination with the US-led coalition, hours after the arrest near Damascus of another leader. Syrian security and intelligence forces, working in coordination with the international coalition, conducted what the interior ministry described as a “precise security operation”. “The operation resulted in neutralising the terrorist Mohammad Shahada, known as Abu Omar Shaddad, who is considered one of the prominent IS leaders in Syria,” it added. “This operation comes as confirmation of the effectiveness of joint coordination between the national security agencies and international partners.” Hours earlier, authorities said they captured Taha al-Zoubi, also known as Abu Omar Tabiya, an IS leader in Damascus, along with several of his men on Wednesday. High-value arrest Earlier this week, in a major operation along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, a Turkish national, who allegedly held a senior role within the IS group, was also captured. The suspect was identified as Mehmet Goren, who reportedly served in the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) province, Anadolu Agency reported. According to the report, Goren had been tasked with organising suicide attacks targeting civilians in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkiye and Europe. The Turkish National Intelligence Organisation (MIT) said that Goren travelled from Turkiye to the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, where he operated in IS camps and rose through the ranks to a leadership position. IS-K, the regional affiliate of the IS group, has claimed responsibility for some of the worst attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and beyond in recent years, many of them targeting civilians. In March 2024, IS-K gunmen killed more than 140 people at a Moscow concert hall, and the group has carried out a series of deadly attacks in both Afghanistan and Pakistan since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Goren allegedly worked alongside Ozgur Altun, known by the code name “Abu Yasir al-Turki”, who was previously arrested, transferred to Turkiye and jailed for facilitating the movement of militants from Turkiye to the region.

      "summary_orig": "• Also curbs powers to place names on passport control list for five years or more • Authority deemed beyond scope of parent law; Centre gets 30 days to revise rules LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has set aside the federal government’s power to inactivate a citizen’s passport and imp­ose a travel ban of five years or more by placing a person on the Passport Control List (PCL) — adjudicating that this authority was beyond the scope of the parent law. However, Justice Asim Hafeez upheld the government’s powers to cancel, impound, or confiscate passports, subject to the fulfilment of statutory requirements. The judgement was delivered at the Multan bench while allowing a petition filed by citizen Farhan Ali, who took up two grievances before the court. First, he sought the setting aside of an order that dismissed his representation against the placement of his name on the PCL as premature. Second, he questioned the legality and constitutionality of the power to inactivate a passport under Rule 23 of the Passports Rules, 2021, contending that such power was not provided under Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974 , which authorised only cancellation, impounding, or confiscation of a passport. The judge noted that the petitioner’s request for removal of name from the PCL had been dec­lined under clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 22 of the Passports Rules , 2021, which prescribed a normal retention period of five years or more. He observed that a person placed in Category ‘B’ might be omitted even before the completion of five years while an appeal was under consideration. Under category ‘B’, the list includes individuals refused passports for reasons other than anti-state activities. Names may also be placed in this category on the recommendations of government agencies or departments. ‘Lacking statutory backing’ Justice Hafeez held that clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 22 lacked statutory backing, describing it as arbitrary, disproportionate, and beyond the scope of the parent law. He noted that the provision offered no categorisation or guidelines for determining proportionate restraint and conferred unstructured discretion upon the executive. On the issue of passport inactivation, the judge held that Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974, did not provide for inactivation. Declaring the clause substantially ultra vires the law, the judge directed the federal government to rationalise restraint periods in proportion to the nature of violations, noting that illegal overstay could not be equated with migrant smuggling, human trafficking, or criminal conduct abroad. Justice Hafeez explained that inactivation was an informal action — wrapped in obscurity — often used to avoid procedural requirements and due-process obligations under the law. He noted that “surreptitious inactivation” had caused travellers to find themselves in unexpected and humiliating situations at airports despite holding valid passports and visas. Justice Hafeez ruled that Rule 23 of the Passports Rules, 2021, conflicted with the scheme of the parent law, and that the delegated legislation failed when it exceeded statutory limits or replaced legislative judgement with executive discretion. “Inactivation of a passport manifests denial of the right to travel in a covert manner not envisaged by the Act,” the judge observed. “I hold that power to inactivate passport under Rule 23 of the Rules 2021 is beyond the scope of Section 8 of the Act 1974 and same is declared ultra vires — only the power to inactivate is declared invalid and powers to cancel, impound or confiscate are intact and exercisable subject to the existence of conditions and fulfilment of requirements,” the judge wrote in the verdict. ‘30 days’ The judge ordered that the verdict would take effect after 30 days to allow the federal government to revise the rules in conformity with Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974.

      "summary_en": "• Also curbs powers to place names on passport control list for five years or more • Authority deemed beyond scope of parent law; Centre gets 30 days to revise rules LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has set aside the federal government’s power to inactivate a citizen’s passport and imp­ose a travel ban of five years or more by placing a person on the Passport Control List (PCL) — adjudicating that this authority was beyond the scope of the parent law. However, Justice Asim Hafeez upheld the government’s powers to cancel, impound, or confiscate passports, subject to the fulfilment of statutory requirements. The judgement was delivered at the Multan bench while allowing a petition filed by citizen Farhan Ali, who took up two grievances before the court. First, he sought the setting aside of an order that dismissed his representation against the placement of his name on the PCL as premature. Second, he questioned the legality and constitutionality of the power to inactivate a passport under Rule 23 of the Passports Rules, 2021, contending that such power was not provided under Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974 , which authorised only cancellation, impounding, or confiscation of a passport. The judge noted that the petitioner’s request for removal of name from the PCL had been dec­lined under clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 22 of the Passports Rules , 2021, which prescribed a normal retention period of five years or more. He observed that a person placed in Category ‘B’ might be omitted even before the completion of five years while an appeal was under consideration. Under category ‘B’, the list includes individuals refused passports for reasons other than anti-state activities. Names may also be placed in this category on the recommendations of government agencies or departments. ‘Lacking statutory backing’ Justice Hafeez held that clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 22 lacked statutory backing, describing it as arbitrary, disproportionate, and beyond the scope of the parent law. He noted that the provision offered no categorisation or guidelines for determining proportionate restraint and conferred unstructured discretion upon the executive. On the issue of passport inactivation, the judge held that Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974, did not provide for inactivation. Declaring the clause substantially ultra vires the law, the judge directed the federal government to rationalise restraint periods in proportion to the nature of violations, noting that illegal overstay could not be equated with migrant smuggling, human trafficking, or criminal conduct abroad. Justice Hafeez explained that inactivation was an informal action — wrapped in obscurity — often used to avoid procedural requirements and due-process obligations under the law. He noted that “surreptitious inactivation” had caused travellers to find themselves in unexpected and humiliating situations at airports despite holding valid passports and visas. Justice Hafeez ruled that Rule 23 of the Passports Rules, 2021, conflicted with the scheme of the parent law, and that the delegated legislation failed when it exceeded statutory limits or replaced legislative judgement with executive discretion. “Inactivation of a passport manifests denial of the right to travel in a covert manner not envisaged by the Act,” the judge observed. “I hold that power to inactivate passport under Rule 23 of the Rules 2021 is beyond the scope of Section 8 of the Act 1974 and same is declared ultra vires — only the power to inactivate is declared invalid and powers to cancel, impound or confiscate are intact and exercisable subject to the existence of conditions and fulfilment of requirements,” the judge wrote in the verdict. ‘30 days’ The judge ordered that the verdict would take effect after 30 days to allow the federal government to revise the rules in conformity with Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974. He allowed the petition and the impugned order dated Oct 6, 2025, was set aside. The government was directed to decide the petitioner’s representation afresh in light of the judgement.
