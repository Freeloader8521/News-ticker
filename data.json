      "summary_orig": "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the start of nuclear talks with the United States, as his counterpart Donald Trump threatened “bad things” if no deal with the Islamic republic was struck. Following the Iranian authorities’ response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, the US president has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East. Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will “work something out” with Iran, but also warned late on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal is reached. Tehran has insisted it wants diplomacy, while vowing an unbridled response to any aggression. Iranian state media reported on Monday that President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of nuclear talks with Washington. Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of nuclear talks. “I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” Pezeshkian said in a post on X. The talks will be held “within the framework of our national interests”, he said. A meeting is likely to take place in Turkiye on Friday, following interventions by Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Oman, an Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. US news site Axios cited two unnamed sources as saying Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal on the nuclear issue. Trump had warned “time is running out” for Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb, a claim Tehran has repeatedly denied. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” adding that, “in return, we expect sanctions lifting”. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said earlier on Monday that Tehran was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players. ‘Police the world’ Turkiye has led a diplomatic push to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and speaking with other regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Jordan’s top diplomat, Ayman Safadi, assured Araghchi on Monday that the kingdom would “not be a battleground in any regional conflict or a launching pad for any military action against Iran”. Iranian authorities, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have warned any US attack would trigger a “regional war”. In Tehran, pensioner Ali Hamidi told AFP he was a veteran and “not afraid of war”, but that “America should mind its own business, why does it want to police the world?” But, the 68-year-old added, “Iranian officials are also at fault for not providing for the people. The economic troubles are back-breaking… The officials should do something tangible, not just talk.” The protests were sparked in late December by economic strain and exploded in size and intensity over several days in early January. Authorities have said the protests were “riots” inflamed by its arch-foes US and Israel, with Khamenei likening them to a “coup” attempt. Ambassadors summoned Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday the presidency published the names of 2,986 people out of the 3,117 whom authorities said were killed in the unrest. Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”. Young Iranian Selina, who would not give her full name, travelled to Iraqi Kurdistan seeking some relief from “living in fear”. “It’s not safe for us” in Iran, the 25-year-old told AFP . “We don’t even dare to go out after 6:00 pm because soldiers are everywhere.” The crackdown prompted the European Union to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation, with Iranian lawmakers retaliating on Sunday by slapping the same designation on European armies. The EU also issued fresh sanctions on Iranian officials, including the interior minister, a move echoed on Monday by Britain, which announced sanctions on 10 individuals over the “brutality against protesters”. Baqaei said on Monday the foreign ministry had summoned all the EU member state ambassadors in Tehran over the designation, and that other responses were to come. Iranian state television also announced four foreigners had been arrested in Tehran for “participation in riots”, without specifying their nationalities. Authorities have continued to announce arrests, with rights groups estimating at least 40,000 people have been detained over the protests.",

Whether moving independently or embedded with troops, Guardian reporters witnessed the violence on the ground The allied attack on Iraq began on 20 March 2003. The Guardian’s 4am edition on Friday 21 March carried the headline : “Land, sea and air assault.” The report was by Julian Borger in Washington and Rory McCarthy in Camp As Sayliyah, on the outskirts of Doha, the capital of Qatar. It opened: “The ground war began in Iraq last night as British and American marines stormed beaches on the Gulf coast in an assault on the south-eastern city of Basra, while explosions lit up Baghdad under a heavy bombardment by cruise missiles.” The first British fatalities came shortly afterwards when a US helicopter crashed in Kuwait, killing all on board.

A Guardian leader stated that the plain fact was this first “surgical strike” had missed its mark.

      "summary_orig": "ON Aug 1, 1990, when much of Iraq was observing Ashura, the 10th of Muharram, to mark the martyrdom of Imam Husain in Karbala in 680 AD, Saddam Hussein was massing his troops along the border with Kuwait. On Aug 2, Iraq invaded the tiny emirate over a festering oil resource-sharing dispute. Saddam believed he had the approval of April Glaspie, the US ambassador in Baghdad. She had met him a week before the invasion. Controversy arose from reports that she told Hussein the US had “no opinion” on Arab-Arab conflicts, interpreted as a ‘green light’ to invade. She later defended her actions, claiming the transcript was misleading and she had warned against violence. In other words, Glaspie gave Saddam Hussein a go-ahead for conflict but without violence. Figure that out. That year, a journalist friend requested some footage of the Muharram procession in my ancestral qasbah of Mustafabad about 100 kilometres from Lucknow. It so happened that Ashura in 1990 coincided in India with the Aug 2 invasion of Kuwait, the variation in date caused by a near routine difference of opinion among the clergy in the sighting of the new moon. I remember the date because the tension in the Middle East was a major discussion for radio addicts in Mustafabad. I took a friendly cameraman to film the Ashura procession replete with the tazias , zuljinah , horse depicting Imam Husain’s loyal and wounded steed, and a very high standard, the alam , held by a muscular adult and controlled by three others with the help of ropes. The cameraman found a perch on a balcony from where elite womenfolk usually got a clear view of the maatam . The practice involved copious bloodletting with self-flagellation. A sharp knife or qama was handed to willing adults to lacerate their scalps with turn by turn. The cameraman was a genial Nair Hindu from Kerala. He was steeped in his work for a few short minutes. Then suddenly there was commotion in the balcony. The camera on the tripod was working, but the man was nowhere in sight. It turned out he had fainted, and some of the women were fanning him hard. I first thought it was the blazing sun and the humidity of August, which may have caused him to faint. But he had passed out, he told me later, after taking close-ups of the gushing blood that was mixed with rosewater by the procession’s monitors. The rosewater water is considered a healing agent. Tatbir or ritual self-flagellation with blades has been officially banned in Iran since the mid-1990s by state authorities. While some Shias in India and Pakistan still practise this form of maatam , it is not common in Iran. Perhaps Iran can still be wrecked as Donald Trump has threatened to do, but it’s difficult to see how. Ayatollah Khomeini frowned on the qama zani or striking the head with swords and knives. His successor Ali Khamenei banned it, citing the harm it causes to the body and the negative image created by the practice. Mourning in Iran in memory of Imam Husain and his family focuses on emotional lamentation and seena zani or beating of the chest. The cameraman’s fear was writ large. Iran’s detractors including Donald Trump or Benjamin Netanyahu would do well to understand this aspect of the faith. It’s practised in Iran by teeming followers of the revolution. Over the years and particularly in the early days of the revolution, Iran successfully endured major assaults from groups within the country largely due to its religious cohesion. The faux Marxist Mujahideen-i-Khalq (MEK) militants staged devastating attacks in the heart of Tehran without significantly denting the government’s hold on its supporters. They blew up prime minister Mohammad Javad Bahonar’s office killing him and president Mohammad Ali Rajai and several eminent members of the regime. The closest MEK came to targeting the highest echelon of the revolution was their being linked to the assassination of Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti, Khomeini’s charismatic confidante and potential successor. They then exploded a bomb that crippled the current Supreme Leader’s right hand. All this was happening when Iran was fighting a bitter war with the US-backed army of Saddam Hussein over eight years. What threat can work against a culture that celebrates grief, annually, perpetually? Recent violence against the clerical regime spurred on by the US and Israel also leaned on the MEK, the communists turned CIA’s catspaw. Israel’s nearly successful attempt to decapitate Iran saw the country take the hit and bounce back to turn the tables on Israel. Perhaps the country can still be wrecked as Donald Trump has threatened to do, but it’s difficult to see how. What Trump may benefit from knowing a little more laterally is the frequently doubted but steadily articulated Iranian doctrine against producing a nuclear weapon. There is indeed a conversation going on in the country about the merits of having or shunning nuclear weapons, but who are the interlocutors in case they are talking to each other, which they are probably not? The silent tiff has terrifying implications for the region, not least for Israel. A fatwa by Ayatollah Khamenei is cited as the basis for Iran forsaking nuclear weapons. In a religiously conservative country, who could challenge the Supreme Leader’s authority? One group does; the Hojjatiyeh, a traditionalist, largely conservative Shia lay organisation in Iran, founded in the 1950s by cleric Mahmoud Halabi. Formed to target Bahais, the Hojjatiyeh believe in creating circumstances for the early return of Imam Mahdi. “ Bia Bia Mahdi Bia, Ya Waaris-i-Khana-i-Khuda. ” The chant implicitly beckons the early end of the world. Khomeini was wary of the group and got some vocal leaders arrested. A change of guard in Iran, something that Saddam Hussein attempted unsuccessfully, would only strengthen those that see themselves as destined for paradise as soon as a nuclear exchange is enabled. Which is neither good for the world nor the cameraman. The writer is Dawn’s correspondent in Delhi. jawednaqvi@gmail.com Published in Dawn, February 3rd, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "BALOCHISTAN witnessed a series of coordinated attacks on the weekend. Though details continue to be sketchy, a number of cities in the province were targeted, including Quetta, Gwadar and Noshki. It was reported that the attacks were repulsed and over 100 terrorists killed (the number continues to rise). Nonetheless the multiple events on Saturday morning have once again drawn attention to a conflict in our midst that everyone prefers to overlook. Around a year ago, the province had experienced a similar spate of coordinated attacks in August 2024 on Akbar Bugti’s death anniversary. And for this reason for most of August 2025, there was a security clampdown in the province, with little to no internet coverage to prevent a repeat. The government ensured August passed quietly, only for January to turn explosive. The attack had apparently begun much earlier than it was reported on the mainstream media, which is understandable at one level. The security organisations want to get the situation under control before it is reported so that the spread of misinformation and disinformation is limited. But in this day and age, the downside was that for a few hours, the information flow was dominated by the other side (on social media) while mainstream media in Pakistan kept running routine news of politicians and their speeches. The latter was of little interest to those who were busy scrolling on their phones. The attacks have again set off a debate in which one side views the attacks as the desperate acts of externally supported militants who achieve very little eventually. On the other side is the view that such attacks show the weakening of the state’s writ and its ability to maintain normalcy in territory (which is different from losing it) and its ‘ability’ to win over the people. The insurgency has been ongoing for 20 years now, the longest of any in Balochistan. The province’s chief minister was on a talk show on Sunday evening where he argued that the attacks were an act of desperation because the terrorists had suffered considerable losses in the past year. He claimed that operations in the past year had eliminated around 1,000 of them and added that the total number of terrorists and facilitators was not more than 5,000 to 6,000. At a later stage, he said, according to a survey by the government, only two or three per cent of the ordinary people supported the militants. He also described the insurgency as the swings of the pendulum and explained that appeasement in the near past had led to the terrorists becoming stronger; the appeasement was blamed on past civilian governments which did not support the military. But the pendulum argument does not explain how this crisis will end — after all, this insurgency has been ongoing for 20 years now, the longest of any in Balochistan. And neither does it explain the increasing lethality of the attacks; most experts agree the militants are becoming more lethal and better trained with time. And neither does it throw light on their increasing success in recruiting educated, middle-class youth. Perhaps this is why the insurgency has continued for so long; instead of being led by individual tribal sardars, it is now being fuelled by a class which is proving more resilient. This educated class includes women some of whom are now seen as involved in the fighting as well. These issues will need to be explored in more detail than simply focusing on the external support being provided. It is not enough to rejoice in the terrorists’ inability to hold on to territory but to ask why there is no normalcy in large swathes of the province, including its seat of government in Quetta. From one angle, instead of a pendulum swing, it might appear to be a steep decline. Here, it is also important to address two more difficult questions. One is to ask how the imprisonment of women protesters, such as Mahrang Baloch , has helped with the security situation as it sends out the message that peaceful protests are not acceptable — leading many to conclude that for those who feel their voices are not being heard, violence is the only option. Second, is the issue of genuine representation in the province, which is also inextricably linked to the popularity of women protesters. For there is a connection between the people of Balochistan opting for peaceful protests (and more) and the perceived unfairness of the elections in the province. The widespread disillusionment with the electoral process has led many people to look at protests and violence as a means of influencing the state. And regardless of how legitimate or illegitimate the methods are seen to be, and the way to deal with them, it is essential that people be enticed back to the electoral process. And this is a problem that has become a widespread crisis of faith. This was brought home last year when I was able to visit Quetta with the HRCP. It was evident that nearly every political party complained of unfair elections. From ethno-based political parties, which represented the Baloch as well as those which dominated the Pakhtun areas to the Hazaras, conversations with most of them were punctuated by the phrase ‘Form 45’. It is noteworthy that the representatives of the Hazaras did not speak of security but unfair elections. This is something that should worry us all; just as much as we fret about the interference of external forces and their support for terrorism. It is important the citizens of Balochistan need to be convinced of the options available to them in order to influence the state — and these options need to be more credible than simply holding a meaningless election.

      "summary_orig": "PAKISTAN’S boycott of its T20 World Cup match against India raises two fundamental questions: why the PCB took this decision, and what it hopes to achieve by it. The fact that neither answer is particularly clear invites a deeper concern, whether this dramatic gesture was fully thought through at all. To begin with, let’s be clear on a few points. The ICC is controlled by India. It is a governing body that behaves like a wholly owned subsidiary of the BCCI. The ICC does not run international cricket, the BCCI — and therefore the Indian government — does. This is realpolitik. The rule of “might is right”. India is in charge, both as policymaker and paymaster, however you describe it. India’s malign dictatorship of international cricket is to be condemned, just as the previous dominance of England and Australia had been condemned. Today, India is the Pied Piper of cricket, playing a seductive tune that brings the rats of the world’s cricket boards under its control. Something does need to be done, namely ICC’s power and independence must be restored. But is this what Pakistan’s unilateral boycott will achieve? India has a political dispute with Pakistan, which it chooses to operationalise by “boycotting” bilateral series with Pakistan and refusing to set foot in the country. No other nation would be allowed to behave in this despotic manner. We’ve just seen what has happened to Bangladesh . Despotic rule is hypocritical. It is self-serving, and it is brutish. India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole where its money and friends should be The next tier of cricket nations, when it comes to financial might, England and Australia, are reliant on India for their revenues. They have sold their integrity and independence for Indian rupees. The remaining countries are too weak and irrelevant when it comes to tackling the excesses of India’s cricketing hegemony. The same applies to the corporations and the broadcasters who invest in cricket. Without India’s billion-plus population, they don’t have a big enough market. In the world of cricket commerce, India’s gravitational pull is too great. Fans might care about some of these hypocrisies and inequalities, but the global audience doesn’t care enough about whether Bangladesh is expelled or Pakistan boycotts. There is, of course, value in a Pakistan-India contest in a major tournament, otherwise why else would it be a manufactured feature of every single major competition. The match is a money spinner; it is good for India’s coffers. And given the fact that Pakistan seems unable to compete on these occasions, it is a perfect morale booster for the Indian nation, with profit built in. Therefore, Pakistan’s boycott of the India match will hurt India a little. India will feel the pinch in its pocket, and so too will the other ICC members. But that pinch will only be a pinch. India will pocket the points instead and move closer to the next round of the tournament. Pakistan will lose valuable revenue and the points. Would Bangladesh have done the same for Pakistan? It hasn’t in the past. Indeed, considering the long history of India’s unfair sidelining of Pakistan, we know other nations have not and would not do the same for Pakistan. Pakistan is now a middle nation, at best, in the world of international cricket. It does not have financial muscle and it is not good enough on the field to pull other nations to its side. India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole in its pocket where its money and its friends should be. In the language of Donald Trump, Pakistan has no cards. All this leaves Pakistan in a mess. It cannot genuinely hope to achieve anything meaningful as a result of its boycott. The deck is stacked against Pakistan. Principle, then, is all that Pakistan has left. But what is the principle here? If the principle is taking a stand in support of Bangladesh, then it is an empty gesture, admittedly a noisy one. If the principle is to protest India’s long history of mistreatment of Pakistan, the mistreatment will continue. If the principle is to protest India’s unconstitutional rule of international cricket, the cause is just but the means of protest amateurish. What Pakistan really wants here is a shift in the balance of power in international cricket. It is entirely fair to think that must happen by freeing international cricket from India’s grip. But to achieve this, Pakistan requires a long-term strategy with two primary objectives: to become commercially and politically powerful in international cricket, and to become a force again on the field. It might feel good to shout about a boycott, to savour a perceived blow to India’s giant ego, but this is no more than a captive shouting into a straitjacket, or an opiate for the masses. If Pakistan is serious about a reset in cricket’s international order, it must begin by working out how it can become a cricketing superpower again, a superpower that is financially strong and independent of India. Do that and others might follow. Sadly, for the current leaders of Pakistan and its cricket, doing just that seems to be too much like hard thinking. Published in Dawn, February 3rd, 2026",

India has a political dispute with Pakistan, which it chooses to operationalise by “boycotting” bilateral series with Pakistan and refusing to set foot in the country. No other nation would be allowed to behave in this despotic manner. We’ve just seen what has happened to Bangladesh . Despotic rule is hypocritical. It is self-serving, and it is brutish. India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole where its money and friends should be The next tier of cricket nations, when it comes to financial might, England and Australia, are reliant on India for their revenues. They have sold their integrity and independence for Indian rupees. The remaining countries are too weak and irrelevant when it comes to tackling the excesses of India’s cricketing hegemony. The same applies to the corporations and the broadcasters who invest in cricket. Without India’s billion-plus population, they don’t have a big enough market. In the world of cricket commerce, India’s gravitational pull is too great. Fans might care about some of these hypocrisies and inequalities, but the global audience doesn’t care enough about whether Bangladesh is expelled or Pakistan boycotts. There is, of course, value in a Pakistan-India contest in a major tournament, otherwise why else would it be a manufactured feature of every single major competition. The match is a money spinner; it is good for India’s coffers. And given the fact that Pakistan seems unable to compete on these occasions, it is a perfect morale booster for the Indian nation, with profit built in. Therefore, Pakistan’s boycott of the India match will hurt India a little. India will feel the pinch in its pocket, and so too will the other ICC members. But that pinch will only be a pinch. India will pocket the points instead and move closer to the next round of the tournament. Pakistan will lose valuable revenue and the points. Would Bangladesh have done the same for Pakistan? It hasn’t in the past. Indeed, considering the long history of India’s unfair sidelining of Pakistan, we know other nations have not and would not do the same for Pakistan. Pakistan is now a middle nation, at best, in the world of international cricket. It does not have financial muscle and it is not good enough on the field to pull other nations to its side. India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole in its pocket where its money and its friends should be. In the language of Donald Trump, Pakistan has no cards. All this leaves Pakistan in a mess. It cannot genuinely hope to achieve anything meaningful as a result of its boycott. The deck is stacked against Pakistan. Principle, then, is all that Pakistan has left. But what is the principle here? If the principle is taking a stand in support of Bangladesh, then it is an empty gesture, admittedly a noisy one. If the principle is to protest India’s long history of mistreatment of Pakistan, the mistreatment will continue. If the principle is to protest India’s unconstitutional rule of international cricket, the cause is just but the means of protest amateurish. What Pakistan really wants here is a shift in the balance of power in international cricket. It is entirely fair to think that must happen by freeing international cricket from India’s grip. But to achieve this, Pakistan requires a long-term strategy with two primary objectives: to become commercially and politically powerful in international cricket, and to become a force again on the field. It might feel good to shout about a boycott, to savour a perceived blow to India’s giant ego, but this is no more than a captive shouting into a straitjacket, or an opiate for the masses. If Pakistan is serious about a reset in cricket’s international order, it must begin by working out how it can become a cricketing superpower again, a superpower that is financially strong and independent of India. Do that and others might follow. Sadly, for the current leaders of Pakistan and its cricket, doing just that seems to be too much like hard thinking. Published in Dawn, February 3rd, 2026",

      "summary": "PAKISTAN’S boycott of its T20 World Cup match against India raises two fundamental questions: why the PCB took this decision, and what it hopes to achieve by it. The fact that neither answer is particularly clear invites a deeper concern, whether this dramatic gesture was fully thought through at all. To begin with, let’s be clear on a few points. The ICC is controlled by India. It is a governing body that behaves like a wholly owned subsidiary of the BCCI. The ICC does not run international cricket, the BCCI — and therefore the Indian government — does. This is realpolitik. The rule of “might is right”. India is in charge, both as policymaker and paymaster, however you describe it. India’s malign dictatorship of international cricket is to be condemned, just as the previous dominance of England and Australia had been condemned. Today, India is the Pied Piper of cricket, playing a seductive tune that brings the rats of the world’s cricket boards under its control. Something does need to be done, namely ICC’s power and independence must be restored. But is this what Pakistan’s unilateral boycott will achieve?

Despite a November 2024 truce that sought to end more than a year of hostilities including two months of all-out war between Israel and the group, Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon and has maintained troops in five areas it deems strategic. Justifying the destruction, the Israeli military claimed that it was targeting “weapons storage facilities”. It further attempted to legitimise the bombing of residential neighbourhoods by reciting its standard claims, saying fighters hiding among “civilian infrastructure”. The Israeli army had previously sent evacuation warnings for the towns of Kfar Tibnit and Ain Qana in southern Lebanon. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported strikes on the targeted buildings in both towns. Earlier on Monday, the Lebanese health ministry said an Israeli strike on Ansariyeh in southern Lebanon killed one person and wounded four others. Another strike on Qleileh, elsewhere in the south, also wounded four people, according to the ministry. The NNA reported Israeli strikes on vehicles near both areas, which came without warning. Lebanon has repeatedly protested Israeli strikes on Lebanon as violations of the ceasefire. More than 360 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon since the ceasefire.

      "summary_orig": "• Achakzai terms murder of innocents ‘inhuman act’; says sense of deprivation has fuelled terrorism • Khawaja Asif rejects disparity narrative, says it is being used to exploit sympathies of Baloch youth • PPP’s Ashraf suggests parties should avoid confrontation on issues of national import • Senate adopts resolution against terror attacks • Sana insists on calling spade a spade ‘without ifs or buts’ ISLAMABAD: As lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in the lower house of parliament exhibited rare unity on Monday in condemning the deadly terror attacks in Balochistan, with varying opinions on the way of tackling the menace, Def­e­nce Minister Khawaja Asif asserted that backwardness of any area was no justification to stand against the state. Suggestions came from across the aisles that instead of a mere debate on the grave issue of terrorism, the government should take decisive action to eliminate terrorists with full force so that the life of a common man could be safeguarded. However, when proceedings concluded, only 10 members were sitting in the house, indicating the seriousness of lawmakers in addressing one of the biggest challenges confronting Pakistan. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who was presiding over the NA session, earlier suspended its agenda and confined its proceedings to the issue of fresh terror attacks in Balochistan. In his speech on the floor of the house, the defence minister said a total of 177 terrorists were killed within a few days following the deadly attacks in Balochistan that claimed the lives of 10 policemen, one Levies man, six FC personnel and as many as 33 civilians. The defence minister warned that political polarisation and fragmented national narratives were undermining Pakistan’s fight against terrorism, cautioning that internal divisions only served the interests of militant groups and hostile foreign actors. He said the country continued to pay a heavy price for past policy decisions, particularly those linked to regional conflicts, adding that the burden of those choices was being borne by civilians and security personnel rather than by those who had made the decisions decades ago. He urged parliamentarians to demonstrate unity on matters of national security, saying a divided political discourse weakened public confidence and emboldened hostile forces. Highlighting the human cost of terrorism, the defence minister said civilians in affected areas faced daily threats, while members of the armed forces continued to make sacrifices to safeguard national security. He ruled out the narrative of disparity and backwardness in Balochistan, saying that banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which he described as India-sponsored, exploited this narrative to gain the sympathy of Baloch youth. While presenting a comparison between the current situation and that at the time of independence in 1947, he said, “In 1947, there were only 114 schools in Balochistan, whereas today there are 1,596. There was no university in the province at that time, but now there are 12 universities. Today, Balochistan has five medical colleges, 145 other colleges, 13 cadet colleges, 21 technical institutions, 13 hospitals, 18 teaching hospitals, 23 district headquarters hospitals, 756 basic health units, 841 dispensaries, four cardiac centres and 24 dialysis centres,” he added. But Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai rejected the claims and figures presented by the defence minister, saying Mr Asif had no understanding of the situation in the province. He said the unjust distribution of resources had created a sense of deprivation among the people, which fuelled terrorism. “The first right over resources rests with the people of the areas from where those resources are extracted. We can overcome terrorism in a short time by giving due rights to the people,” he added. An ‘inhuman’ act Mr Achakzai, however, condemned the attacks and said the killing of innocent labourers, teachers and people from other provinces in Balochistan was an inhuman act and could not be justified. He urged the National Assembly speaker to hold a marathon session on terrorism lasting two days and to allow all members to speak on the issue. Tracing the history of Balochistan since the British Raj, the opposition leader claimed that the Pashtun population was equal to the Baloch population in the province. When Mr Achakzai held the country’s intelligence agencies responsible for failing to prevent the attacks, Speaker Sadiq commended the role of the security forces and intelligence agencies and urged the defence minister to provide details of how many terrorist attacks had been thwarted in the recent past. A critical moment Taking part in the debate, senior PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf said political disagreements were a part of democratic life, but should not overshadow issues of terrorism, national integrity and security. He cautioned against targeting national institutions for political gain, saying such actions damaged morale and could be exploited by hostile neighbours. He warned that political infighting and confrontational narratives were weakening the country at a critical moment. Referring to the sacrifices of soldiers deployed along the borders and in terrorism-affected areas, the PPP lawmaker said any impression that their sacrifices were being undermined could have serious consequences for national resolve. He urged all political parties, including the opposition parties, to rise above partisan interests and present a united front on matters of national security. The PPP leader called for comprehensive parliamentary engagement on security challenges, proposing that the House hold full debates and form committees to examine the situation and present concrete recommendations. He stressed that Balochistan’s stability must remain a national priority and should be addressed through consensus rather than political confrontation. The debate was held following the adoption of a motion to discuss the prevailing law and order situation in the country. During their speeches, Mehmood Achakzai and Barrister Gohar demanded the release of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and called for him to be allowed to meet his doctors and family particularly in light of reports that he was suffering from ‘a serious medical condition’.

      "title_orig": "4 Punjab districts allowed to manufacture kite-flying material to meet Basant demand",
      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday gave approval for the manufacture of permissible kite-flying material in four more districts of the province owing to the increasing demand and soaring prices of these commodities ahead of the much-anticipated Basant festival in Lahore. Basant will be celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, albeit under tight curbs , following the Punjab government’s move to lift the ban on the festival after a hiatus of 18 years. Celebrations, however, will remain restricted to the provincial capital, which until now was the only district where the manufacture of permissible kite-flying material was allowed. According to a February 1 letter by the Punjab Home Department to deputy commissioners (DC) concerned, the provincial cabinet has given approval for manufacturing the kite-flying material in Faisalabad, Kasur, Multan and Sheikhupura as well. The letter, seen by Dawn , said that the manufacturers should register themselves with the relevant DCs and through the Punjab government’s e-Biz digital portal and manufacture only “permissible kite-flying material”. According to the Punjab government’s instructions , only cotton string is allowed to be sold for kite-flying on Basant whereas the manufacturing of metallic string material and kites exceeding fixed sizes is strictly prohibited. Under the code of conduct, the sizes for a 1.5 Tawa Gudda (width 40 inches, length 34 inches) and a 4.5 Guddi Kite (width 35 inches, length 30 inches) have been fixed, and the manufacturing or flying of kites larger than these will not be permitted at all. The provincial government has also imposed a ban on the manufacturing of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party. The Home Department’s letter also said that registered manufacturers in Faisalabad, Kasur, Multan and Sheikhupura should only sell their products to sellers and traders registered with the Lahore DC “for use in the district of Lahore on Feb 6, 7 and 8, 2026 […] and not in any other district”. “Sale of permissible kite-flying material by registered manufacturers of these four districts to any person or entity, other than the registered traders and sellers in Lahore, shall be strictly prohibited,” the letter read. Punjab Home Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi told Dawn that the provincial cabinet gave the approval in light of soaring prices and to bridge the demand-supply gap. In addition to manufacturing, traders and sellers in Lahore had also been allowed to procure “permissible” kite flying material from other provinces, he further said, adding that material was already being procured from Peshawar, Haripur and Abbottabad. The traders and sellers, however, are required to get permission from the Lahore DC to procure these items from other provinces. In a post on X, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said every pinna (twine ball) would be QR-coded, “allowing it to be tracked from the manufacturer to the seller, and ultimately to the buyer”. “All manufacturers are registered with the government and are fully compliant with approved safety regulations and specifications. In view of the increased demand for kites and strings, supplies from outside Punjab have been permitted strictly for products that meet the prescribed safety standards,” she said. Ban around Lahore Airport Qazi also told Dawn that the provincial cabinet had approved the exclusion of several areas, identified by the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA), from kite-flying during Basant. He added that the Lahore DC would notify Section 144 for those areas under Section 6(1) of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Act 2025. The PAA had written a letter to the Punjab additional chief secretary last month, requesting that a complete ban on kite-flying be imposed in certain areas during Basant for the safety of flight operations. The PAA had requested that the Nadrabad, Gulshan Ali Colony, Nishat, Bhatta Chowk and DHA’s R, S, P and Q blocks be declared no kite-flying zones, as they fall in the aircraft approach path at the Allama Iqbal International Airport. Similarly, the PAA had sought a ban on kite-flying in Al-Faisal Town, Joray Pul, Canal Bank Road and Tajpura, located along the aircraft take-off path. The PAA further requested, “Impose Section 144 in the identified areas to ban kite flying on the rooftops of houses, as kites and kite-strings can be ingested into aircraft engines or strike critical aircraft surfaces, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences”.",

In addition to manufacturing, traders and sellers in Lahore had also been allowed to procure “permissible” kite flying material from other provinces, he further said, adding that material was already being procured from Peshawar, Haripur and Abbottabad. The traders and sellers, however, are required to get permission from the Lahore DC to procure these items from other provinces. In a post on X, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said every pinna (twine ball) would be QR-coded, “allowing it to be tracked from the manufacturer to the seller, and ultimately to the buyer”. “All manufacturers are registered with the government and are fully compliant with approved safety regulations and specifications. In view of the increased demand for kites and strings, supplies from outside Punjab have been permitted strictly for products that meet the prescribed safety standards,” she said. Ban around Lahore Airport Qazi also told Dawn that the provincial cabinet had approved the exclusion of several areas, identified by the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA), from kite-flying during Basant. He added that the Lahore DC would notify Section 144 for those areas under Section 6(1) of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Act 2025. The PAA had written a letter to the Punjab additional chief secretary last month, requesting that a complete ban on kite-flying be imposed in certain areas during Basant for the safety of flight operations. The PAA had requested that the Nadrabad, Gulshan Ali Colony, Nishat, Bhatta Chowk and DHA’s R, S, P and Q blocks be declared no kite-flying zones, as they fall in the aircraft approach path at the Allama Iqbal International Airport. Similarly, the PAA had sought a ban on kite-flying in Al-Faisal Town, Joray Pul, Canal Bank Road and Tajpura, located along the aircraft take-off path. The PAA further requested, “Impose Section 144 in the identified areas to ban kite flying on the rooftops of houses, as kites and kite-strings can be ingested into aircraft engines or strike critical aircraft surfaces, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences”.",

      "title_orig": "Govt rules out talks with terrorists as Senate condemns spate of attacks in Balochistan",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday ruled out talks with terrorists as the upper house of Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the spate of terrorist attacks in Balochistan , while also urging the government to ensure a transparent investigation into the incidents. Speaking in the Senate, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah ruled out talks with terrorists. He urged all political forces to adopt a unified national stance against terrorism, fully support law enforcement agencies and the armed forces, and honour the sacrifices of martyrs and their families. Responding to the points raised by opposition leader Raja Nasir Abbas, he said: “No one is angry in Balochistan; there is no issue of rights. They are taking action against Pakistan on the instructions of the enemy.” He said that terrorists should be called terrorists without any ifs or buts and that action should be taken against them without any ambiguity. He pointed out that the enemy was humiliated during Marka-i-Haq and these terrorists would also face a similar fate. He went on to say that criminal and terrorist activities could be carried out anywhere by small armed groups, even in relatively secure areas, but the pattern of violence witnessed in Balochistan reflected organised terrorism rather than isolated criminal acts. Sanaullah said terrorists in Balochistan had repeatedly stopped passenger buses, checked travellers’ identity cards and executed innocent citizens in front of their families, including women and children. He said such brutality had also been witnessed in attacks on trains, including the Jaffar Express. “These are acts of extreme savagery that no sane human being can justify,” he said, questioning the narrative that such groups were merely “disgruntled”. He said the terrorists were acting as the operatives of a hostile country, seeking to avenge the defeat suffered by enemy forces during Marka-i-Haq. He said security forces had thwarted attempts to breach the Quetta Red Zone and neutralised the terrorists wherever they attempted to operate. “They could not withstand direct engagement with the forces and were forced to flee back to their hideouts,” he added. He rejected any linkage between terrorism and political demands such as elections, saying the terrorists had no public mandate, no political agenda and no belief in the democratic system. Meanwhile, in his speech, the Senate opposition leader called for moving toward the rule of law to steer the country out of crisis. He also called for initiating dialogue and taking everyone on board. “We should have talked to the angry people; Those who talk about the Constitution, talk about Pakistan, hold sit-ins — their words are not heard. And, when their women come to Islamabad, they are treated badly,” he noted. He said most of the sitting lawmakers were not true representatives of the people and therefore cannot represent them. Referring to the attacks in Balochistan, he said, “They (terrorists) freely moved around for three or four hours, and security was breached. Banks were blown up … no one stopped them.” He questioned whether anyone had resigned in the wake of the incidents. He said Rs 80 billion were spent annually on security in the province but regretted there was no government writ at night. He said that those responsible should be held accountable. Meanwhile, PTI’s parliamentary leader Ali Zafar rejected attempts to create the impression that the party was siding with terrorists, declaring that the enemies of Pakistan were also the enemies of the party. He said those who kill, set the national flag on fire and damage state property were enemies of the country and should be treated as terrorists. He, however, said the PTI supported all peaceful movements for rights. He noted that people’s support was essential to effectively tackle the menace of terrorism, for which incarcerated party founder Imran Khan must be taken on board. He regretted that the government was labelling the PTI as a terrorist organisation and was not ready to give political space to it. “You will meet the fate of failure if you do not include the PTI in your national plan. You need us because we have the true public mandate”, he remarked. Senate passes resolution Meanwhile, the Senate passed a resolution condemning the attacks in Balochistan. Moved by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the resolution urged the government to ensure a transparent, swift and conclusive investigation into the incidents, and bring the perpetrators, facilitators, and local and international sponsors of terrorism to justice in accordance with the law. It also called upon the federal and provincial governments to further strengthen intelligence coordination, border security, and counter-terrorism mechanisms, with a special focus on Balochistan. The resolution condemned the attacks and offered condolences to the families of the martyrs. It also lauded the courage and sacrifices of the security forces and law enforcement agencies, and reiterated the nation’s resolve to foil terrorist attempts. “The unity of the state and the will of the people will prevail over all forces of violence, extremism, and terrorism,” the resolution said. It also reaffirmed the Senate’s commitment to peace, development and political inclusion in Balochistan, recognising that “sustainable security is inseparable from socio-economic progress, good governance, and respect for constitutional rights”. As many as 92 terrorists were killed on Saturday as security forces repulsed coordinated attacks by members of banned organisations in parts of the provincial capital and around a dozen other cities and towns across Balochistan, the military’s media wing said. In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR said that at the “behest of their foreign masters, these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the lives of the local populace and the development of Balochistan”. It said that said 15 security personnel were martyred while repulsing the attacks, while 18 civilians also lost their lives. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had held India responsible for the spate of attacks. Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said: “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.” He said that authorities would go after every single one of those involved and the “masters behind them”.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed 22 more terrorists during the ongoing security sweeps in Balochistan, taking the tally of terrorists killed over the past two days to 177, said security officials. Terrorists carried out a large-scale coordinated attack in the province on Saturday. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan on Saturday, responding to which the security forces killed more than 150 terrorists. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The terrorists were killed overnight as security sweeps continued across the province following Saturday’s attack, with security officials adding that the “noose is tightening”. Mobile internet services remain suspended Residents of Quetta and other cities in Balochistan continued to face difficulties on Monday as mobile internet services remained suspended for the third day in a row. Mobile phone data was suspended in Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Khuzdar, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan and other cities on Saturday. Balochistan’s Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Hamza Shafqaat told Dawn that the services would remain suspended today, but were expected to be restored tomorrow. This is not the first time that the government has suspended internet services in Balochistan for security reasons: in November, it suspended mobile internet services in all 36 districts of the province for about a week. Attacks on Saturday During the early morning hours on Saturday, multiple terrorist cells attacked more than 10 cities and towns in Balochistan. The targets were primarily security and government installations. Suicide bombers, including female attackers, were part of the assault force. Security forces engaged the terrorists in gun battles across the province. During the skirmishes, 15 security personnel were martyred and 18 civilians lost their lives. As the attacks subsided, security forces launched a series of cordon-and-sweep operations to clear towns, cities, and the countryside of terrorist presence. Addressing the media on Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti expressed firm resolve to eliminate terrorists. Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that peace has been established in Balochistan after Saturday’s attacks and security forces were now “engaged in a mopping-up operation”.",
