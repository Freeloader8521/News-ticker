The case has exposed gaps in how Korea protects the rights of international students, with Hanshin University students and lawyers warning that prolonged prosecutorial delays have left victims in a legal limbo. In November 2023, Hanshin University put 23 Uzbek students enrolled in its Korean language institute on a bus after telling them they were going to an immigration office to receive their residence cards. The school is a private four-year university with campuses in Osan, Gyeonggi Province and Seoul.

      "summary_orig": "WITH the threat of a new American attack on Iran persisting, many of the Islamic Republic’s neighbours have said they will not allow their territory to be used against Tehran. This is significant as a number of Iran’s neighbours host thousands of American troops, and these states realise that if their territory is used to mount fresh aggression, regional US bases will become targets for Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian have discussed the situation , with the latter saying that Iran welcomes any process that will avoid war. The prince, on the other hand, reiterated that Saudi territory will not be used against Iran. Earlier, the UAE had also said that it will not allow its facilities to be used against its neighbour across the Gulf. Meanwhile, the Turkish foreign minister has observed that a new American war would be “wrong”, while calling for a diplomatic resolution of the crisis. But diplomacy does not seem to be on top of US President Donald Trump’s agenda, as his pugnacious remarks on Wednesday indicate. He observed that unless Iran comes to the table, “the next attack will be far worse” than last year’s US-Israeli aggression. The uneasiness of Iran’s neighbours at the thought of fresh hostilities is understandable. Iranian authorities have said several times that if targeted by foreign aggression, they will reply with full force. They have also said that if neighbouring countries allow their land or airspace to be used, “they will be considered hostile”. There is clearly no appetite for a new war in the region, apart from the Israelis. Therefore, the US should abandon its threatening posture and regime change plans, and adopt a more conciliatory tone with Iran. The Iranians are willing to talk, but as their foreign minister said yesterday, negotiations “under threat cannot succeed”. There may still be time to pull back and stop a destructive new war. Mr Trump should listen to regional voices, and approach Iran with respect if he is serious about peace. However, the Zionist and neocon members of his inner circle appear to be egging on the American leader towards confrontation with the Islamic Republic. If these warmongers have their way, a devastating conflagration may be on the horizon, as the Iranian establishment will consider this an existential battle. Published in Dawn, January 29th, 2026",

Trading activity hit a volume of 413.82 million shares and a total traded value of Rs52.45 billion. All commercial banks, fertiliser, automobile assemblers, close-end mutual funds, leather and tanneries, oil and gas exploration companies, synthetic and rayon companies, tobacco, transportation, vanaspati and allied industries, along with woolen industries, were trading in the red. Maaz Mulla, vice president equity sales at Topline Securities, noted that “the sharp decline was primarily triggered by Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited’s result, which disappointed the market as earnings came in below industry expectations due to lower-than-anticipated gross margins”. Top decliners included Kohinoor Power Company Limited, which dropped to Rs44.60 followed by Said Textile Mills Limited, which fell to Rs36.61, and Kohinoor Industries Limited, which dropped to Rs63.06. Mulla also noted that “market rumors had built expectations of a stock split or bonus announcement, which did not materialise”. He overall stated that there was a “mismatch between expectations and outcomes led to panic selling, prompting investors to book recent gains and intensifying the sell-off”. Amid rising geopolitical tensions, Reuters reported that oil prices rose 1.5pc on Thursday, extending gains for a third day, on increasing concerns the US may carry out a military attack on Iran that could disrupt supply from the region.",

He overall stated that there was a “mismatch between expectations and outcomes led to panic selling, prompting investors to book recent gains and intensifying the sell-off”. Amid rising geopolitical tensions, Reuters reported that oil prices rose 1.5pc on Thursday, extending gains for a third day, on increasing concerns the US may carry out a military attack on Iran that could disrupt supply from the region.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: At least three terrorists were killed on Thursday after security forces launched a large-scale operation in the Domel tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district. A police statement said several terrorists were also injured in clashes with security forces. The operation was launched in the tehsil’s Sperka and Kotka Akbar Ali Khan area. During the operation, security forces have targeted militant hideouts with more than 25 quadcopter strikes, while a heavy exchange of fire continues in the area. The operation is being supervised by senior police and security officials who are also present in the field. Security forces have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to arrest terrorists attempting to flee, which is still ongoing. Continuous surveillance by drones and helicopters is being carried out in the region, indicating the sensitive nature and importance of the operation. The objective, security forces said, is to completely clear the area and restore law and order. Meanwhile, local sources said that amid intense firing and fierce clashes, three civilians were killed, including two women. Due to the severity of the fighting, public access to the area remains restricted, and as a result, the bodies are still lying inside their homes. Separately, MTI spokesperson Muhammad Noman told Dawn that four injured persons were brought to Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital, Bannu Township, including two women and two children. Earlier this week, two terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire with police in Domel area. The police also recovered weapons and ammunition from the possession of the killed militants. On January 13, armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee in the district. The incident took place in the Gulbadin Landi Dak area of Bannu district. According to a senior official of the district police, the victims were all travelling in the same vehicle when armed men opened “indiscriminate fire” on them. The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence. Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.",

      "summary_orig": "Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the armed forces were “undergoing major transformation in multiple domains”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday. According to an ISPR press release , the army chief made the remarks while addressing troops of the Bahawalpur Garrison at Khairpur Tamewali (KPT) in Punjab, where he witnessed a high-intensity field exercise ‘Steadfast Resolve’. The corps, based at Bahawalpur Garrison, is a key strike formation of the Pakistan Army. Its area of responsibility includes the southern Punjab desert zone and its order of battle includes multiple divisions. It focuses on modern, technology-enabled, multi-domain operations, often conducting exercises in areas like Khairpur Tamewali. “COAS & CDF highlighted that Pakistan Armed Forces are undergoing major transformation in multiple domains,” the military’s media affairs wing said. “Character of war has evolved massively, with technological advancements driving the evolution, dictating huge mental transformation at all tiers,” the army chief observed. He added: “In the future, technological manoeuvres will replace physical manoeuvres and will fundamentally alter the way offensive and defensive operations are undertaken.” “Therefore, Pakistan armed forces are embracing and absorbing technology at a rapid pace. In this process, innovation, indigenisation and adaptation shall remain fundamental.” CDF Munir also lauded the troops’ high morale, professional competence and operational preparedness. He reaffirmed that the armed forces remain fully prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity “against all threats, emphasising the need to maintain optimum readiness to meet the requirements of future battlefield and security challenges”, the ISPR added. The ‘Steadfast Resolve’ exercise encompassed the “integration of niche technologies like unmanned aerial systems (drones), advanced surveillance assets, electronic warfare assets and modern command-and-control mechanisms, reflecting the armed forces’ focus on technology-enabled multi-domain operations”, the statement said. CDF and COAS Field Marshal Asim Munir visits Khairpur Tamewali in Punjab’s Bahawalpur in this photo released on Jan 29, 2026. — ISPR During his visit to Bahawalpur Garrison, Field Marshal Munir was also briefed on “various operational, training and administrative aspects of the Corps, with special focus on preparations for multi-domain warfare”. Upon his arrival at the garrison, the CDF was received by the Bahawalpur Corps commander. He also laid a floral wreath at the Martyrs’ Monument and offered prayers for the martyrs, paying tribute to their sacrifices. Earlier, COAS Munir inaugurated the “ROHI eSkills Learning Hub (STP) aimed at promoting digital skills and learning opportunities for students, particularly from southern Punjab and across the country”. He also inaugurated the APS Abbasia Campus, reaffirming the army’s commitment to “quality education and character building”, the ISPR said. Field Marshal Munir also visited the EME Regional Workshop, where he was briefed on the maintenance regime to sustain modern platforms through advanced technologies, indigenisation, and other combat support measures. In August 2025, the Army Rocket Force Command was established to bolster the country’s conventional strike capability. As part of it, the army successfully conducted a training launch of the Fatah-4 cruise missile in September. The army chief has emphasised the importance of technological advancements in modern warfare on multiple occasions. In December, he highlighted that the multi-domain operations conducted during the conflict with India in May 2025 had now become a textbook example and case study for future warfare. He also noted that the country needed to keep up with emerging spheres in warfare, such as cyberspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, outer space, information operations, and quantum computing. Earlier this month, CDF Munir addressed officers at the Lahore Garrison , where he witnessed a “specialised field training exercise showcasing the latest technologies”. Last week, the army chief visited the National Police Academy in Islamabad, where he stressed that a strong and people-centric police force was indispensable for ensuring internal security and the rule of law.",

      "title_orig": "Trump weighs Iran strikes to inspire renewed protests, sources say",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, multiple sources said, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the government. Two US sources familiar with the discussions said Trump wanted to create conditions for “regime change” after a crackdown crushed a nationwide protest movement earlier this month. To do so, he was looking at options to hit commanders and institutions that Washington holds responsible for the violence, to give protesters the confidence that they could overrun government and security buildings, they said. One of the US sources said the options being discussed by Trump’s aides also included a much larger strike intended to have a lasting impact, possibly against the ballistic missiles that can reach US allies in the Middle East or its nuclear enrichment programmes. The other US source said Trump has not yet made a final decision on a course of action, including whether to take the military path. The arrival of a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East this week has expanded Trump’s capabilities to potentially take military action, after he repeatedly threatened intervention over Iran’s crackdown. Four Arab officials, three Western diplomats, and a senior Western source whose governments were briefed on the discussions said they were concerned that instead of bringing people onto the streets, such strikes could weaken a movement already in shock after the crackdown. Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute, said that without large-scale military defections, Iran’s protests remained “heroic but outgunned.” The sources in this story requested anonymity to talk about sensitive matters. Iran’s foreign office, the US Department of Defense and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The Israeli Prime Minister’s office declined to comment. Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons, warning that any future US attack would be more severe than a June bombing campaign against three nuclear sites. He described the ships in the region as an “armada” sailing to Iran. A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was “preparing itself for a military confrontation, while at the same time making use of diplomatic channels.” However, Washington was not showing openness to diplomacy, the official said. Iran, which says its nuclear program is civilian, was ready for dialogue “based on mutual respect and interests” but would defend itself “like never before” if pushed, Iran’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on X on Wednesday. Trump has not publicly detailed what he is looking for in any deal. His administration’s previous negotiating points have included banning Iran from independently enriching uranium and restrictions on long-range ballistic missiles and on Tehran’s network of armed proxies in the Middle East. Limits of air power A senior Israeli official with direct knowledge of planning between Israel and the United States told Reuters that Israel does not believe airstrikes alone can topple the Islamic Republic, if that is Washington’s goal. “If you’re going to topple the regime, you have to put boots on the ground,” he said, noting that even if the United States killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran would “have a new leader that will replace him.” Only a combination of external pressure and an organised domestic opposition could shift Iran’s political trajectory, the official said. The Israeli official said Iran’s leadership had been weakened by the unrest but remained firmly in control despite the ongoing deep economic crisis that sparked the protests. Multiple US intelligence reports reached a similar conclusion: that the conditions that led to the protests were still in place, weakening the government, but without major fractures, two people familiar with the matter said. The Western source said they believed Trump’s goal appeared to be to engineer a change in leadership, rather than “topple the regime,” an outcome that would be similar to Venezuela, where US intervention replaced the president without a wholesale change of government. Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand deaths during the protests. He blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel and what he called “seditionists.” Khamenei retains control but less visible At 86, Khamenei has retreated from daily governance, reduced public appearances and is believed to be residing in secure locations after Israeli strikes last year decimated many of Iran’s senior military leaders, regional officials said. Day-to-day management has shifted to figures aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including senior adviser Ali Larijani, they said. The powerful Guards dominate Iran’s security network and big parts of the economy. However, Khamenei retains final authority over war, succession and nuclear strategy — meaning political change is very difficult until he exits the scene, they said. Iran’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about Khamenei. In Washington and Jerusalem, some officials have argued that a transition in Iran could break the nuclear deadlock and eventually open the door to more cooperative ties with the West, two of the Western diplomats said. But, they cautioned, there is no clear successor to Khamenei. In that vacuum, the Arab officials and diplomats said they believe the IRGC could take over, entrenching hard-line rule, deepening the nuclear standoff and regional tensions. Any successor seen as emerging under foreign pressure would be rejected and could strengthen, not weaken the IRGC, the official said. Across the region, from the Gulf to Turkey, officials say they favour containment over collapse — not out of sympathy for Tehran, but out of fear that turmoil inside a nation of 90 million, riven by sectarian and ethnic fault lines, could unleash instability far beyond Iran’s borders. A fractured Iran could spiral into civil war as happened after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, two of the Western diplomats warned, unleashing an influx of refugees, fueling Islamist militancy and disrupting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a global energy chokepoint. The gravest risk, analyst Vatanka warned, is fragmentation into “early-stage Syria,” with rival units and provinces fighting for territory and resources. Regional blowback Gulf states — long‑time US allies and hosts to major American bases — fear they would be the first targets for Iranian retaliation that could include Iranian missiles or drone attacks from the Tehran-aligned Houthis in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt have lobbied Washington against a strike on Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran. “The United States may pull the trigger,” one of the Arab sources said, “but it will not live with the consequences. We will.” Mohannad Hajj-Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre said the US deployments suggest planning has shifted from a single strike to something more sustained, driven by a belief in Washington and Jerusalem that Iran could rebuild its missile capabilities and eventually weaponise its enriched uranium. The most likely outcome is a “grinding erosion — elite defections, economic paralysis, contested succession — that frays the system until it snaps,” analyst Vatanka said. EU set to add Iran’s Guards to terror list after France U-turn Meanwhile, the European Union is poised to include Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist organisations after France said on Wednesday it would now support the move. EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests. “France will support the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X. With France, Italy and Germany now on board, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday, although it does need unanimity among the bloc’s 27 members. Earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU’s terrorist organisation list, joining the United States. “The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain,” Barrot said. The French presidency had earlier announced the decision. Set up after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes. Cutting ties, fears for citizens in Iran While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU’s terrorist list, others, led by France, have been more cautious. They feared such a move could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran, impacting diplomatic missions, and also hurting negotiations to release European citizens held in Iranian prisons. Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year. Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal, given the IRGC’s role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said were tantamount to terrorist activity. “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck, and it’s good to call that out,” said one senior EU diplomat.",

Iran, which says its nuclear program is civilian, was ready for dialogue “based on mutual respect and interests” but would defend itself “like never before” if pushed, Iran’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on X on Wednesday. Trump has not publicly detailed what he is looking for in any deal. His administration’s previous negotiating points have included banning Iran from independently enriching uranium and restrictions on long-range ballistic missiles and on Tehran’s network of armed proxies in the Middle East. Limits of air power A senior Israeli official with direct knowledge of planning between Israel and the United States told Reuters that Israel does not believe airstrikes alone can topple the Islamic Republic, if that is Washington’s goal. “If you’re going to topple the regime, you have to put boots on the ground,” he said, noting that even if the United States killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran would “have a new leader that will replace him.” Only a combination of external pressure and an organised domestic opposition could shift Iran’s political trajectory, the official said. The Israeli official said Iran’s leadership had been weakened by the unrest but remained firmly in control despite the ongoing deep economic crisis that sparked the protests. Multiple US intelligence reports reached a similar conclusion: that the conditions that led to the protests were still in place, weakening the government, but without major fractures, two people familiar with the matter said. The Western source said they believed Trump’s goal appeared to be to engineer a change in leadership, rather than “topple the regime,” an outcome that would be similar to Venezuela, where US intervention replaced the president without a wholesale change of government. Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand deaths during the protests. He blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel and what he called “seditionists.” Khamenei retains control but less visible At 86, Khamenei has retreated from daily governance, reduced public appearances and is believed to be residing in secure locations after Israeli strikes last year decimated many of Iran’s senior military leaders, regional officials said. Day-to-day management has shifted to figures aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including senior adviser Ali Larijani, they said. The powerful Guards dominate Iran’s security network and big parts of the economy. However, Khamenei retains final authority over war, succession and nuclear strategy — meaning political change is very difficult until he exits the scene, they said. Iran’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about Khamenei. In Washington and Jerusalem, some officials have argued that a transition in Iran could break the nuclear deadlock and eventually open the door to more cooperative ties with the West, two of the Western diplomats said. But, they cautioned, there is no clear successor to Khamenei. In that vacuum, the Arab officials and diplomats said they believe the IRGC could take over, entrenching hard-line rule, deepening the nuclear standoff and regional tensions. Any successor seen as emerging under foreign pressure would be rejected and could strengthen, not weaken the IRGC, the official said. Across the region, from the Gulf to Turkey, officials say they favour containment over collapse — not out of sympathy for Tehran, but out of fear that turmoil inside a nation of 90 million, riven by sectarian and ethnic fault lines, could unleash instability far beyond Iran’s borders. A fractured Iran could spiral into civil war as happened after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, two of the Western diplomats warned, unleashing an influx of refugees, fueling Islamist militancy and disrupting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a global energy chokepoint. The gravest risk, analyst Vatanka warned, is fragmentation into “early-stage Syria,” with rival units and provinces fighting for territory and resources. Regional blowback Gulf states — long‑time US allies and hosts to major American bases — fear they would be the first targets for Iranian retaliation that could include Iranian missiles or drone attacks from the Tehran-aligned Houthis in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt have lobbied Washington against a strike on Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran. “The United States may pull the trigger,” one of the Arab sources said, “but it will not live with the consequences. We will.” Mohannad Hajj-Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre said the US deployments suggest planning has shifted from a single strike to something more sustained, driven by a belief in Washington and Jerusalem that Iran could rebuild its missile capabilities and eventually weaponise its enriched uranium. The most likely outcome is a “grinding erosion — elite defections, economic paralysis, contested succession — that frays the system until it snaps,” analyst Vatanka said. EU set to add Iran’s Guards to terror list after France U-turn Meanwhile, the European Union is poised to include Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist organisations after France said on Wednesday it would now support the move. EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests. “France will support the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X. With France, Italy and Germany now on board, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday, although it does need unanimity among the bloc’s 27 members. Earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU’s terrorist organisation list, joining the United States. “The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain,” Barrot said. The French presidency had earlier announced the decision. Set up after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes. Cutting ties, fears for citizens in Iran While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU’s terrorist list, others, led by France, have been more cautious. They feared such a move could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran, impacting diplomatic missions, and also hurting negotiations to release European citizens held in Iranian prisons. Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year. Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal, given the IRGC’s role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said were tantamount to terrorist activity. “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck, and it’s good to call that out,” said one senior EU diplomat.",

      "summary_orig": "Sri Lanka will deploy elite armed units to protect teams at next month’s T20 World Cup, part of enhanced security measures with a special emphasis on matches between perennial rivals India and Pakistan, officials have told AFP . The island is co-hosting the biennial cricket tournament with India and will hold 20 games between February 7 and March 8. The Indian and Pakistani teams will play each other at least once, in their Group A clash in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo on February 15. Cricket matches have long been a stage for expressing political tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, which fought a four-day conflict last year. Sri Lanka has given the “highest priority” to ensuring the tournament runs smoothly and is “paying special attention to the India-Pakistan matches”, sports minister Sunil Kumara Gamage told AFP late on Wednesday. Elite commando units, usually assigned to guard visiting heads of state, will be deployed to protect all participating teams, police and security officials said. “From the time they step out of the airport till they return to their aircraft, they will be protected by armed guards,” an official said, asking not to be named. India and Pakistan have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, opting to play on neutral ground via a hybrid model instead. Hence, for the T20 World Cup, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has shifted their matches to Sri Lanka. Bangladesh also tried to have their matches moved out of India due to security fears, but the ICC rejected the request. An angry Bangladesh then withdrew from the tournament, and Scotland were drafted in as their replacement. Pakistan has indicated that it may yet boycott the event in solidarity with Bangladesh. Sri Lanka maintained a studious silence throughout the India-Bangladesh row. Cricket Secretary Bandula Dissanayake told AFP Colombo wanted to avoid being drawn into regional disputes. “In these disputes among India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, we are remaining neutral, all of these are friendly nations,” he said. But he added that Sri Lanka would be willing to host future tournaments for any of the countries if asked. Sri Lanka has also used the T20 World Cup as an opportunity to upgrade its international venues. It has commissioned new floodlights at the Singhalese Sports Club, one of two stadiums in Colombo. The Pallekele Stadium in Kandy was unaffected by a deadly cyclone that damaged buildings in the region in November, and will host a T20 international between Sri Lanka and England from Friday.",

      "summary_orig": "KHYBER: As the government doubled down on its claim that no military operation was being planned or currently underway in the Tirah Valley, civil society in Bara criticised federal ministers for what they termed “derogatory and humiliating remarks” about displaced families. Taking umbrage at the assertion about ‘seasonal migration’ by Tirah residents, Bara Tehsil Chairman Mufti Kafeel argued that no such event had taken place since 2015, when residents were allowed to return to their homes after completion of a military operation. Some questioned why registration centres were established for these families when they were supposedly going to Bara on a ‘joy ride’, as the ministers seemed to claim. Former MNA Hameedullah Jan Afridi said the defence minister’s statement was tantamount to rubbing salt in the wounds of the people of Tirah and Bara. Talal Chaudhry accuses PTI of concocting narrative to ‘hide their corruption’; says any military action will only be launched ‘after informing everyone’ Talking to Dawn , he said that these statements were “unbearable, shameful and completely opposite” to the facts about the displacement of residents. “We reject this baseless and misleading statement and want to clarify that the residents of Tirah have not left their homes voluntarily nor is this a seasonal migration,” he insisted. He claimed these people were forced to leave their houses in inhospitable conditions in the name of eradicating terrorism. He reminded the federal ministers that displacement from Tirah started only after an agreement was reached between government officials and a representative jirga of local elders, in which all modalities about transport fare and compensation for damages were sorted out prior to the start of a planned military operation. Another former parliamentarian from Bara, Shafeeq Afridi, said the statement made a mockery of the sufferings of thousands of children, women and elderly residents of Tirah, who were made to wait in lines for long hours in order to get themselves registered. He said that describing the current displacement in light of a book written by an English author in 1880 was tantamount to twisting historical facts and misleading the people. “The federal government cannot absolve itself of its constitutional responsibilities towards its law-abiding citizens by simply referring to history books written by foreigners, as we live in a different Pakistan now,” he stated. He also questioned the rationale behind the ban on taking edibles to the restive valley, as well as the strict monitoring of the movement of residents in the entire valley. He said women and children were not even allowed to venture out of their homes prior to their displacement. Bara Siyasi Ittehad President Hashim Khan Afridi, meanwhile, held both the federal and provincial governments responsible for the miseries of the displaced families and insisted that the plan to conducting a military operation and prior evacuation of families was finalised with the mutual consent of both governments. ‘Concocted narrative’ Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, however, continued to point the finger squarely at the government in Peshawar, claiming that it was concocting a false narrative to “hide its corruption” in the reported Rs4 billion approved for the Tirah residents’ temporary relocation. “As soon as people were relocated to other places from Tirah, and they [KP govt] were paid Rs4bn, due to which there was noise, and it was found out that their own people had retained more than half of the money for some other purpose, so a baseless narrative was created after that to hide it,” he said in televised remarks on Wednesday. “Whenever an operation is planned, we will issue a notification and conduct it after informing everyone. We will take everyone onboard. Any kind of new operation or any operation is not taking place in Tirah Valley currently.” However, the minister added, “If any action is underway in the entire country, from Quetta to Gilgit and Gilgit to Karachi, it is under the National Action Plan (NAP).” “Each action, each IB (intelligence-based) operation or other action — the KP government is a full participant and onboard with each action taken in KP or any process carried out under the National Action Plan,” he asserted. The PML-N leader remarked that the “issue is that [the provincial government] wants to do it, but they are scared”. Published in Dawn, January 29th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Temperatures drop below -15°C in the region in wake of snowfall • Residents protest against prolonged power outages GILGIT / ISLAMABAD: The difficulties of Gilgit-Baltistan residents intensified on Wednesday as snowfall disconnected road access to remote areas, with temperatures dropping below minus 15 degrees Celsius in the region. As freezing temperatures persisted, people took to the streets to protest prolonged power outages. A patient in Astore allegedly died due to the unavailability of transportation facilities for treatment. A fresh spell of snowfall on Monday and Tuesday brought life to a standstill across parts of GB amid freezing temperatures, power outages and road closures. The suffering of residents due to snow, harsh weather, lack of electricity and other basic facilities continued in remote areas on Wednesday. Police said up to six inches of snow was recorded in parts of Skardu, Astore, Ghanche, Shigar, Kharmang, Hunza, Nagar and Ghizer, disrupting routine life and making travel hazardous. Locals said a patient from the Mirmalik area of Astore was being shifted on foot to Rattu hospital after roads were blocked by snowfall, but he died before reaching the hospital. According to a statement issued by the Astore assistant commissioner, locals attempted to shift a patient from Chamriot to a nearby hospital. Following the information, a rescue team comprising the Astore Disaster Management District assistant director, two doctors and a snow-cutter machine was dispatched. The team reached Dadujil after clearing the road, but doctors confirmed that the patient had died four to five hours earlier. Officials of the GB Communications and Works Department said the Karakoram Highway, Ghizer-Shandur road, Astore Valley road and Baltistan road were opened for traffic in the evening. Travellers were advised to exercise caution as snowfall had made roads slippery and hazardous. KHARMANG (Gilgit-Baltistan): Women and children trek down a snow-covered mountainside to fetch drinking water from a spring, after water pipes froze due to subzero temperatures.—Jamil Nagri Confined to homes Residents in remote areas remained confined to their homes due to blocked roads, freezing temperatures and unavailability of electricity and firewood. Shafqat Hussain, a resident of Astore, said there was fear of food shortages in snow-hit areas if roads were not opened urgently. Upper areas of Skardu, Ghanche, Ghizer, Hunza, Nagar and Shigar were also facing communication disruptions, road closures and electricity shortages. Residents were facing water shortage as pipelines and streams froze, forcing people, particularly women, to fetch water from distant places. In the border area of Dansar Thang in Kharmang district, heavy snowfall created a severe drinking water crisis. Locals said women were forced to fetch water from dangerous mountain routes four kilometres away. They demanded emergency provision of clean drinking water and basic health facilities. Residents in the Nilt area of Nagar district staged a protest by blocking the Karakoram Highway for several hours. Protesters said the area had been without electricity for several days. They added that residents already faced daily power outages of up to 20 hours, but electricity had been completely unavailable for the last few days. Similar demonstrations were held in Gilgit’s Basin area, as well as in Ghanche, Ghizer and Diamer. The Provincial Emergency Operation Centre, GB, issued an alert warning of widespread rain, thunderstorms and snowfall from Jan 30 to Feb 2. It cautioned about extremely cold temperatures, avalanche risks, landslides, road closures and hazardous travel conditions, advising residents to remain alert and travellers to avoid non-essential travel during heavy snowfall. Meanwhile, temperatures in major urban centres of the country varied on Wednesday morning. Islamabad and Pesha­war recorded five degrees Cels­ius, while Lahore was at 10 degrees. In the south, Karachi’s temperature was 12 degrees Celsius. Colder conditions prevailed in northern areas, with Quetta recording minus five degrees Celsius, Murree minus one and Muzaffarabad zero degrees Celsius.

The department updated its travel advisory for Pakistan on Jan 26, advising travellers to think twice before visiting due to crime, civil unrest, terrorism, and the risk of kidnapping. Pakistan has been placed under a Level 3 advisory, a category that indicates a high risk where terrorist attacks may occur without warning. According to the State Department, typical targets include “transportation hubs, hotels, markets, shopping malls, military and security sites, airports, trains, schools, hospitals, places of worship, tourist locations, and government buildings”. Some regions, including parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have been designated Level 4: Do Not Travel areas. The advisory urges US citizens not to travel to Level 4 areas “for any reason”, warning that assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, particularly against government officials and private citizens. The warning also applies to US citizens of Pakistani origin. The State Department noted that local laws prohibit demonstrations without a permit and warned that “US citizens have been detained for participating” in such activities. A Level 3 advisory indicates “serious risks to safety”, and travelers are advised to reconsider their travel plans. Level 4 is the highest advisory level and discourages all travel.
