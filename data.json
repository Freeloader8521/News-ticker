      "summary_orig": "Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar on Tuesday remarked that the Supreme Court’s regular and constitutional benches (CBs) were “branches of one tree” as an eight-member CB heard arguments on petitions challenging the 26th Amendment . The Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate , with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment . The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. Retired Justice Syed Shabbar Raza Rizvi, a former Lahore High Court judge, concluded his arguments today. Dr Adnan Khan, counsel for Anas Ahmed, also presented his contentions. The hearing was adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow. During yesterday’s hearing , senior lawyer Muhammad Akram Sheikh and retired Justice Rizvi, sought a full court comprising all 24 current SC judges, as opposed to multiple petitioners’ requests for a bench of 16 judges present in the apex court when the Amendment was passed. The hearing As Rizvi continued his arguments, Justice Mandokhail said, “Even if we accept your stance that the Supreme Court and the bench are separate, then this shows that the bench’s suo motu power is maintained but has been taken away from the Supreme Court.” However, Rizvi replied that while the CB had been given some powers under the 26th Amendment, none were taken away from the apex court. Referring to the provision that was introduced through the 26th Amendment, Justice Hilali observed, “The amendment has been made in the Constitution. Article 191A has come into existence and constitutional benches have been made under it. “Now you are saying there should be a full bench. So will we need to go into the pre-Amendment era […] and suspend the 26th Amendment for it?” she asked, adding that how Article 191A can be “bypassed”. Rizvi responded that Article 191A should be read in conjunction with other provisions, not on its own. He argued that Article 191A had not “ended the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 184(3) ” (original jurisdiction). At this, Justice Mazhar observed that the powers under Article 184(3) had been transferred to the CB under Article 191A, adding that the latter provision “clearly mentioned” the same. Rizvi then proceeded to cite several past judgments to support his arguments, adding that Article 191A should be read with Article 176, which provides the constitution of the SC. The retired judge noted that despite having special powers, the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) was a part of SC and could also use powers vested in the apex court under Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution. He termed Article 187 a “helpful provision to enact complete justice ”. “The Constitutional Bench can also use powers provided under Article 187. The Constitutional Bench was also made within the Supreme Court, right?” Justice Mazhar said. Justice Aminuddin remarked that the question at hand was not about the CB’s powers, but rather how to “make judges of non-constitutional benches” part of the CB. Rizvi, echoing Sheikh’s arguments from yesterday, contended that the CB judges had two roles: “You are the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Bench as well.” At this, Justice Mazhar remarked, “Regular bench and Constitutional Bench, both are two branches of one tree. […] Nobody is saying it (CB) is not the Supreme Court, or above or below it.” Justice Mandokhail wondered whether Rizvi meant that benches could not hear the case, but a full court had the powers to do so. Justice Mazhar, pointed out that even in India, whose example Rizvi cited, cases before constitutional benches were not referred to regular ones. He further noted that while the neighbouring country still had the concept of the chief justice being the “Master of the Roster” , Pakistan no longer had the same, as committees had been formed to fix cases for hearing. At one point, Rizvi suggested that the CB be considered a constitutional court . “This was being established as a constitutional court, but it became a constitutional bench,” he said, referring to the proposals mulled as part of the 26th Amendment last year. “The advice you are giving is good,” Justice Mandokhail remarked. Rizvi said, “The confusion is that instead of ‘court’, the term ‘bench’ was used.” The petitions Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan , Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s counsel Munir A. Malik , and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners. The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request . The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself. The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

      "summary_orig": "Three lesser-known opposition parties on Tuesday withdrew an application filed with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking to be registered as an alliance under the name of Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), while also distancing themselves from the request itself. The matter gained traction as the proposed name is already the name of an opposition alliance led by Mehmood Khan Achakzai. The applicants, who also sought the allocation of a joint election symbol, included Pakistan Aman Tehreek Chairman Ali Sher Yousafzai, Pakistan Falahi Tehreek Chairman Fazal Aman Khan, and Pakistan Welfare Party Chairman Muhammad Farooq. The TTAP — which saw the move as an attempt to take away its title and sabotage its resistance movement — had formed a legal team to defend its position before the ECP, with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar appearing before the commission today. The matter was heard by a three-member ECP bench headed by the member from Balochistan, Shah Mohammad Jatoi. During the hearing, the Pakistan Falahi Tehreek chairman told the ECP that the parties had not applied for the registration of the alliance. “We were informed that we had filed an application through a notice issued by the election commission,” he said. At this, the ECP member from Punjab, Babar Hassan Bharwana, remarked, “We did not issue a notice ourselves; someone must have applied.” He also called for a forensic analysis of the application, saying, “You should consult your legal adviser and apologise if you have applied by mistake.” The ECP told the three parties to withdraw the application, warning that action would be taken against them otherwise. For his part, Khokhar filed a request seeking the provision of records. Khokhar said that an opposition alliance had been formed under Achakzai’s leadership called the TTAP. He urged the ECP to not entertain the plea. The ECP then sought detailed statements from the three applicants and said it would issue and appropriate order. Later, the applicants submitted handwritten requests seeking the withdrawal of their application. Veteran politician Achakzai, who also heads his own Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), was made chairman of the TTAP, weeks after the February 8 general elections . The PTI, PkMAP and Balochistan National Party-Mengal are among the major parties of the alliance. The alliance alleges that the mandate of PTI was stolen and it does not acknowledge the present government as a genuine representative of the voters. The opposition alliance recently put on hold its countrywide public meetings and protests, mainly, in the wake of floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. ‘Space for opposition getting narrower’ Speaking to the media outside the ECP, Khokhar termed the application a “childish thought”. “Space for the opposition in this country is growing narrower and narrower,” Khokhar said, decrying the move to steal the TTAP’s name. Speaking about the opposition alliance, he said, “This has been underway for a long time … the largest opposition party, PTI is a part of it; the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen is also a part of it; Balochistan National Party’s Akhtar Mengal is also a part of it; other parties and civil society individuals are also a part of it.” He also went on to say that such requests should not be entertained. “If we want to run this country in a better way, in an acceptable way where the rule of law governs, then we should refrain from these kind of requests,” he said. “The three parties that came today — we didn’t even know who they were — they submitted their withdrawal application. But for the future … we are also clever, and we will not back off in the face of such efforts. We will continue to defend and promote our right to political opposition,” he said.",

      "summary_en": "Three lesser-known opposition parties on Tuesday withdrew an application filed with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking to be registered as an alliance under the name of Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), while also distancing themselves from the request itself. The matter gained traction as the proposed name is already the name of an opposition alliance led by Mehmood Khan Achakzai. The applicants, who also sought the allocation of a joint election symbol, included Pakistan Aman Tehreek Chairman Ali Sher Yousafzai, Pakistan Falahi Tehreek Chairman Fazal Aman Khan, and Pakistan Welfare Party Chairman Muhammad Farooq. The TTAP — which saw the move as an attempt to take away its title and sabotage its resistance movement — had formed a legal team to defend its position before the ECP, with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar appearing before the commission today. The matter was heard by a three-member ECP bench headed by the member from Balochistan, Shah Mohammad Jatoi. During the hearing, the Pakistan Falahi Tehreek chairman told the ECP that the parties had not applied for the registration of the alliance. “We were informed that we had filed an application through a notice issued by the election commission,” he said. At this, the ECP member from Punjab, Babar Hassan Bharwana, remarked, “We did not issue a notice ourselves; someone must have applied.” He also called for a forensic analysis of the application, saying, “You should consult your legal adviser and apologise if you have applied by mistake.” The ECP told the three parties to withdraw the application, warning that action would be taken against them otherwise. For his part, Khokhar filed a request seeking the provision of records. Khokhar said that an opposition alliance had been formed under Achakzai’s leadership called the TTAP.

Senior Civil Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti presided over the proceedings and directed that Gandapur — who did not show up today — be arrested and presented before the court. The hearing was adjourned till October 28. The case dates back to October 30, 2016, when Islamabad police said they had recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located. The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on November 2. Gandapur had rejected police claims, saying that two of the five assault rifles found on him were licensed while the others were official weapons provided to his security guards. He had also claimed that the teargas launcher and bottles of liquor were not his and that he had been carrying honey in the liquor bottle. Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the capital’s Bhara Kahu police station. Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024 , September 4, 2024 , July 19, 2025 and Sept 10, 2025 .",

Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024 , September 4, 2024 , July 19, 2025 and Sept 10, 2025 .",
      "title": "Liquor and arms recovery case: Islamabad court issues arrest warrant for Gandapur over persistent no-shows",
      "summary": "An Islamabad district and sessions and court on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur on a 2016 liquor and weapons recovery case over his continued absence from the proceedings. Senior Civil Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti presided over the proceedings and directed that Gandapur — who did not show up today — be arrested and presented before the court. The hearing was adjourned till October 28. The case dates back to October 30, 2016, when Islamabad police said they had recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located. The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on November 2. Gandapur had rejected police claims, saying that two of the five assault rifles found on him were licensed while the others were official weapons provided to his security guards. He had also claimed that the teargas launcher and bottles of liquor were not his and that he had been carrying honey in the liquor bottle. Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the capital’s Bhara Kahu police station. Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024 , September 4, 2024 , July 19, 2025 and Sept 10, 2025 .",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Newly-elected Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mohammad Sohail Afridi on Monday said he believed in the supremacy of the law and would confront the Centre’s every unlawful and unconstitutional step. “A narrative is being built that I will go for confrontation with the federal government. Yes, I will, if anything is done by it against the Constitution. I will continue to speak for the supremacy of the Constitution,” he told a provincial assembly session chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati here. The chief minister said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even petitioned the Islamabad High Court for ensuring his meeting with detained founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan but to no avail. He said he would challenge the federal government over the continued denial of his meeting with Imran and would boycott meetings called by it. Informs assembly that there won’t be any political arrests under MPO in province Mr Afridi said that after exhausting all legal options for the purpose, he would place his case before the people to devise the future course of action. He said that the law and order situation was worsening as the decisions were taken behind closed doors. “Our [PTI’s] stand is that policies for KP should be made by the province’s government and its residents only,” he said, vowing to resist any decisions taken behind closed doors. The chief minister said his government welcomed peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban in Doha but had reservations about it as elders and public representatives from KP should be part of the dialogue as advocated by the PTI founder. He announced that no political worker would be arrested under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order in the province, while the police won’t register FIR against any student leader. Mr Afridi also announced the establishment of police stations for women across the province. He said that the meeting called by the prime minister was about Afghan refugees and food security and not the law and order situation, so he sent the chief secretary as the province’s representative besides Muzammil Asalam who was aware of the situation in KP. “Our stand on Afghan refugees is clear. Those, who have lived here for over 40 years, should be sent back in a dignified way. Those stationed on the border should not create issues about the repatriation of Afghan refugees,” he said. The chief minister said that the police and the counter-terrorism department were leading the fight against terrorists from the front. “The vehicles gifted by the federal government to our police force have become outdated, so we have decided to return them,” he said. Earlier, Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Dr Ibadullah said working for peace in the province was the top priority of every MPA. He urged the chair to call a meeting of the house’s peace committee. Dr Ibadullah said that the opposition would never allow any action that went against the interest of the province. “The opposition will stand with the government in case of any positive step taken in the interest of the province,” he said. The opposition leader vowed to highlight the government’s weak performances. He insisted that the opposition never opposed Mr Afridi’s meeting with Mr Imran. Mr Swati observed that the first meeting of the house’s peace committee would be held soon after the finalisation of its terms of references, with all relevant government officers being asked to show up. Treasury lawmaker Adnan Qadri said Mr Afridi’s victory in the chief minister’s election was the victory of the people and the defeat of all “other powers.” He said people from tribal districts thanked the PTI founder for nominating Mr Afridi from among them as the province’s chief executive. ”Those who held news conferences against the new chief minister disheartened the tribesmen,” he said. Mr Qadri also condemned the alleged killing of TLP workers during street protests in Punjab and demanded their names be made public. MPA Dr Amjad Ali said if the Pakistan Army could take over 34 posts on Pak-Afghan border, why they didn’t eliminate 500 terrorists from Bajaur district in the last three months. He said Pakistan wanted talks with India after border clashes but never held negotiations with Pakhtuns. The MPA said he, as the minister for mines and minerals, was denied access to mines in merged tribal districts by security forces citing the delicate law and order situation as the reason. “The Katlang area where a drone strike was carried out, has vast pink topaz reserves. Pink topaz is found in Brazil or Katlang only,” he said. Mohammad Nisar of the opposition ANP said for the first time, he felt the house was serious about discussing the issues of merged tribal districts. He said terrorists were identified in some villages but even then, 13 civilians, including women, children and elderly, were martyred with no body of the terrorists found. “We are not aliens. We want an end to the buffer zone. We want developmental funds to be spent in our merged areas,” he said. The lawmaker said efforts were under way for the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, to get control of KP’s mines and minerals and declare the merged districts federal territory,” he said. The speaker congratulated Hindu community’s members on diwali, the festival of lights. The house also passed a resolution by a majority vote, urging the provincial government to inform the United Nations that the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa do not accept Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the nation’s representatives nor does they recognise Israel. The resolution was tabled by Abdul Salam Afridi, whose another resolution seeking medical facilities for Imran and his wife in jail, was also adopted. The chair later adjourned the sitting until 2 pm today (Tuesday). Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "IT has been some years since Anatol Lieven called Pakistan a ‘hard country’, a phrase which didn’t really get much traction. It just didn’t carry enough negative connotations; the rest of the world preferred sobriquets such as ‘failed state’ or ‘the most dangerous country in the world’. It left most of us who live in Pakistan with the sense that we had a tendency to attract attention for all the wrong reasons. And whatever our image, it wasn’t going to be one highlighting our softer attributes. Now, it seems, we ourselves are trying to create a tough brand. Of being known as hard, a powerful state which no one can ride roughshod over, be it enemies within Pakistan or external. These are not mere words. Just over the recent week, a protest originating from Lahore was not allowed to make its way to Islamabad , a destination which has been overrun by many others in the past. This was followed by a crackdown on the TLP, which had announced the protest, combined with allegations of state violence leading to loss of life. And while, the TLP itself has been guilty of violence on more than one occasion, the pattern of the state’s reaction has now become familiar. In the past couple of years, there have been protests in different parts of the country where political parties such as the PTI as well as citizen rights movements such as the PTM or BYC have all alleged loss of life. Religio-political organisations such as the TLP were treated a bit differently but not anymore. Those who convey the master’s message claim that the party will now be disbanded. Around the same time, Islamabad’s relations with Kabul are also at an all-time low. It seems as if the time for playing nice is over and if the terrorist attacks in Pakistan continue, Islamabad will inflict pain on Afghanistan to change its big, bad ways. If earlier the pain was inflicted through refugee repatriation or border controls, now there will be more — the targeting of terrorists based there and skirmishes on the border. Over the weekend, these tensions led to our Gulf brethren entering the fray to soothe the two neighbours . What a turnaround; once seen as the patrons of the Afghan Taliban, Pakistan now needs intermediaries to make nice with them. Picking so many battles leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time. And these battles are being fought at a time when there are reports aplenty of another aggression from India. Be it official or unofficial voices, or even some from across the border, there are warnings enough of unfinished business on the eastern border. And what if this happens at a time when the western border is also tense? Especially as it’s not just the borders which can pose a threat? The tensions with both the neighbours are closely linked to the deteriorating security situation in two provinces — Balochistan and KP. Pakistan’s view is that the eastern and western neighbours are encouraging infiltration of terrorists and providing them with the finances. And so serious is this external factor that the debate over how the discontent in these provinces has been feeding into the violence has been abandoned. In the tough posturing with aggressive neighbours and militant groups, there is confidence that Punjab and Sindh are under control. At this time and age, the absence of a mass people’s movement and violence means all is well. And if in one province, the water issue has led to simmering anger and in the other the government’s legitimacy is under question, these are smaller problems, for repression or concessions (as in Sindh on the water issue and in Azad Kashmir) can lead to a sense of quiet. So much so that the state felt confident in cracking down on the TLP. Success has been declared, for there was no pushback and the street remained quiet. And there is so much applause that few are brave enough to ask what this will mean for the PML-N, whose members may have to face a backlash in their constituencies, as they did in 2018. This security threat will be an additional burden for them. But overall, between the crackdowns on the people, parties, rights movements, militants and angry neighbours, it is difficult not to wonder whether the tough posturing or the effort at shaping a hard state may also be one that is overstretched. At odds with forces within as well as enemies without, what if the burden proves too much? This is not to say it can’t win all these battles. Perhaps it can, though it is worth cautioning against excessive confidence. But there is another downside. Picking so many battles, especially with genuine grassroots movements or mainstream political parties, leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time. Indeed, it is so busy fearing and controlling the people in general that it has no space and goodwill left to push through any reform which is politically hard. If an election has been managed in order to impose unpopular leaders, who is going to push the traders to pay taxes? It is easier to keep them happy and burden others. If a right-wing organisation has to be brought down, who will plan to improve the education sector and take on the wrath of the teachers who may take to the streets? One can only imagine decisions that have been postponed because Imran Khan and Ali Wazir have to be kept behind bars. The list can go on and on. There is a price to be paid for this tough posturing. And what it really cost the hapless people of Pakistan will continue to be calculated for long after this period is over. For the moment, we can only guess what the eventual burden might be.

Over the weekend, these tensions led to our Gulf brethren entering the fray to soothe the two neighbours . What a turnaround; once seen as the patrons of the Afghan Taliban, Pakistan now needs intermediaries to make nice with them. Picking so many battles leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time. And these battles are being fought at a time when there are reports aplenty of another aggression from India. Be it official or unofficial voices, or even some from across the border, there are warnings enough of unfinished business on the eastern border. And what if this happens at a time when the western border is also tense? Especially as it’s not just the borders which can pose a threat? The tensions with both the neighbours are closely linked to the deteriorating security situation in two provinces — Balochistan and KP. Pakistan’s view is that the eastern and western neighbours are encouraging infiltration of terrorists and providing them with the finances. And so serious is this external factor that the debate over how the discontent in these provinces has been feeding into the violence has been abandoned. In the tough posturing with aggressive neighbours and militant groups, there is confidence that Punjab and Sindh are under control. At this time and age, the absence of a mass people’s movement and violence means all is well. And if in one province, the water issue has led to simmering anger and in the other the government’s legitimacy is under question, these are smaller problems, for repression or concessions (as in Sindh on the water issue and in Azad Kashmir) can lead to a sense of quiet. So much so that the state felt confident in cracking down on the TLP. Success has been declared, for there was no pushback and the street remained quiet. And there is so much applause that few are brave enough to ask what this will mean for the PML-N, whose members may have to face a backlash in their constituencies, as they did in 2018. This security threat will be an additional burden for them. But overall, between the crackdowns on the people, parties, rights movements, militants and angry neighbours, it is difficult not to wonder whether the tough posturing or the effort at shaping a hard state may also be one that is overstretched. At odds with forces within as well as enemies without, what if the burden proves too much? This is not to say it can’t win all these battles. Perhaps it can, though it is worth cautioning against excessive confidence. But there is another downside. Picking so many battles, especially with genuine grassroots movements or mainstream political parties, leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time. Indeed, it is so busy fearing and controlling the people in general that it has no space and goodwill left to push through any reform which is politically hard. If an election has been managed in order to impose unpopular leaders, who is going to push the traders to pay taxes? It is easier to keep them happy and burden others. If a right-wing organisation has to be brought down, who will plan to improve the education sector and take on the wrath of the teachers who may take to the streets? One can only imagine decisions that have been postponed because Imran Khan and Ali Wazir have to be kept behind bars. The list can go on and on. There is a price to be paid for this tough posturing. And what it really cost the hapless people of Pakistan will continue to be calculated for long after this period is over. For the moment, we can only guess what the eventual burden might be.

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least eight alleged terrorists were gunned down by security forces in an operation on Monday, after a team from Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) came under attack near the Kot Lalu area in Daraban, Dera Ismail Khan. The action came in an apparent response to an attack on the SNGPL team, in which security forces reportedly also suffered casualties. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) or other security agencies about their losses until going to press. Sources said the militants were killed after intelligence reports were received about their presence in a nearby jungle, prompting the security forces to launch an offensive in which eight suspects were gunned down. Following the action, the forces cordoned off the area and initiated wide-ranging search-and-clearance operations in the surrounding terrain. Reinforcements were dispatched to secure the site and to pursue the fleeing suspects. Two suspects killed in Swabi encounter; attack on Bannu police station repulsed Officials told reporters that the slain militants allegedly were members of a cell that had been planning a direct attack on the pipeline project. They said the group intended to sabotage the installation — a project of national importance aimed at providing energy, employment and improved services to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Investigations were ongoing and local authorities said they would share further details as the clearance operation and forensic work proceeded. Two killed in Swabi Separately, two militants were killed in a joint operation conducted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Mardan and the Swabi district police before midnight, Ziauddin Ahmad, the district police officer, said on Monday. The incident took place three days after a hand grenade was hurled at the Kalabat police post by unidentified men, in which a constable was martyred. According to a separate press release, the CTD and Swabi police were engaged in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in mountainous Maini village when four alleged militants riding two motorcycles opened fire on the law enforcers. “The CTD operation party retaliated with full vigour. As a result, terrorists were killed on the spot, and their two accomplices escaped, taking advantage of darkness,” said DPO Ahmad. Soon after the incident, a search and strike operation was launched in the area. The slain men allegedly belonged to the TTP Tayyip Akbar Group and were wanted in numerous cases, including attacks on the police. Attack repelled Separately, an attack targeting the police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu district late Sunday night was thwarted by the police. A police official said that a group of militants attacked the police station with advanced light and heavy weapons in a bid to breach the building. “But the personnel deployed there were fully alert as they had noticed the terrorists’ movements with the help of thermal vision cameras,” he said, adding that the law enforcers countered the attack vigorously and forced the assailants to flee. The official said that after hearing about the attack on the police station, local residents armed with weapons also came out of their houses and assisted police in their action against terrorists. He said that all policemen remain safe in the attack. Meanwhile, two policemen who had been kidnapped from the Peepal Bazaar in Bannu on Monday were freed by their captors. A police official said that two police officials, including Naheedullah and Eid Muhammad, were kidnapped by unknown armed men when they were returning to their duty place after performing their duty with the polio teams.

      "title_orig": "Pakistan-Afghanistan peace hinges on Taliban halting incursions: Defence Minister Asif",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that the ceasefire agreement between Islamabad and Kabul was linked to the Afghan Taliban’s ability to rein in terrorists attacking Pakistan from neighbouring soil. The two countries agreed to a ceasefire in Doha at the weekend after days of border clashes that killed dozens, the worst such violence since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021. Ground fighting between the one-time allies and Pakistani airstrikes across their contested 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control terrorists it says operate from safe havens in Afghanistan. “Anything coming from Afghanistan will be [a] violation of this agreement,” Asif said in his office at Parliament in Islamabad. “Everything hinges on this one clause.” The Taliban administration and Afghanistan’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “In the agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkiye and Qatar, it was clearly spelled out that there would not be any incursions,” the minister said. “We have a ceasefire agreement as long as there is no violation of the agreement which is already in force.” The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group operated out of Afghanistan to attack Pakistan “in connivance” with the Taliban, the defence minister said. Kabul has previously denied such accusations. In a separate interview to Al-Jazeera Arabic , he said the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement was to “eliminate the menace of terrorism”. Asif added that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years. He elaborated that both countries concluded that the immediate eradication of terrorism was essential. The two sides, he added, would make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats. Asif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that both countries’ presence served as a guarantee for the accord. The defence minister also appreciated the role played by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in facilitating the agreement. Asif maintained that another meeting would be held next week in Istanbul to finalise the details of the agreement, and an effective mechanism would also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries. He further said that his Afghan counterpart had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which would now be addressed. The defence czar stated that Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years due to terrorism. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalise. As a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities would resume, enabling the latter to use the former’s ports once again. Asif also added that Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents would be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees would continue to be repatriated, he added. The minister said it was premature to claim satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. “We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,” he said. In a separate interview to Arab News , he ruled out the notion that Pakistan had conducted the airstrikes in Kabul on the urging of the United States, saying: “It is total nonsense and nothing else.” He questioned why Pakistan would do so, saying the country had had enough of its involvement in Afghanistan for the past few decades. “We want to stay away and live like decent neighbours. We don’t want to have any involvement in Afghan affairs,” Asif said, adding that Pakistan had “no business” in Afghanistan’s relationship with India or any other country. “Absolutely not. Whatever they want to do in their own territory and doesn’t spill over to our territory, doesn’t become our business.” Doha talks and press release controversy Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said the Doha talks were not held in a bitter atmosphere and credited the Qatari and Turkish officials for it. “Not even an opportunity for confrontation was provided on any conflicting point,” he said, adding that all talk of amendments and additions or deletions was done through the Qatari and Turkish officials. “Direct interaction only happened at the opening, where both sides talked … but all of the engagement was done through Qatar and Turkiye.” Asif added the draft agreement was only one page, contrary to a longer version he said was circulating on social media. He added that an upcoming meeting in Turkiye would further refine the details, such as the mechanism to implement the deal’s aspects. Questioned about his own thoughts about whether the ceasefire would hold, the defence minister said: “I have guarded optimism on the matter; I am hopeful but also remain cautious. Can only say something conclusively given the circumstantial evidence. It is too early at the moment, we must remain hopeful of course.” The minister added that he hoped that the Afghan Taliban would act as a “unified government” and conclude the matter with Pakistan instead of returning tomorrow and saying that separate factions were behind the tensions. He elaborated that in the case of any violation, Qatar and Turkiye would be asked to play their role. Asif added that the mechanism for this entire process would be decided in the meeting on the October 25. The defence minister also stated that the entire TTP leadership was present in Afghanistan, adding that the matter would be taken up in Istanbul as well. He further said that the talks should not be taken to mean that Pakistan would negotiate or hold talks with the TTP, dismissing such a notion. Questioned about changes in Qatar’s press releases on the ceasefire with “tensions on the border” removed in a subsequent statement, Asif acknowledged that there was debate on wherever the word was used, but ultimately Qatar’s press release had nothing to do with the draft of the agreement, adding that he could not divulge its contents. “It is between them. It has absolutely no effect on the agreement,” he said, adding that the incident had no particular implications as were being derived by others.",

Kabul has previously denied such accusations. In a separate interview to Al-Jazeera Arabic , he said the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement was to “eliminate the menace of terrorism”. Asif added that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years. He elaborated that both countries concluded that the immediate eradication of terrorism was essential. The two sides, he added, would make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats. Asif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that both countries’ presence served as a guarantee for the accord. The defence minister also appreciated the role played by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in facilitating the agreement. Asif maintained that another meeting would be held next week in Istanbul to finalise the details of the agreement, and an effective mechanism would also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries. He further said that his Afghan counterpart had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which would now be addressed. The defence czar stated that Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years due to terrorism. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalise. As a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities would resume, enabling the latter to use the former’s ports once again. Asif also added that Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents would be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees would continue to be repatriated, he added. The minister said it was premature to claim satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. “We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,” he said. In a separate interview to Arab News , he ruled out the notion that Pakistan had conducted the airstrikes in Kabul on the urging of the United States, saying: “It is total nonsense and nothing else.” He questioned why Pakistan would do so, saying the country had had enough of its involvement in Afghanistan for the past few decades. “We want to stay away and live like decent neighbours. We don’t want to have any involvement in Afghan affairs,” Asif said, adding that Pakistan had “no business” in Afghanistan’s relationship with India or any other country. “Absolutely not. Whatever they want to do in their own territory and doesn’t spill over to our territory, doesn’t become our business.” Doha talks and press release controversy Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said the Doha talks were not held in a bitter atmosphere and credited the Qatari and Turkish officials for it. “Not even an opportunity for confrontation was provided on any conflicting point,” he said, adding that all talk of amendments and additions or deletions was done through the Qatari and Turkish officials. “Direct interaction only happened at the opening, where both sides talked … but all of the engagement was done through Qatar and Turkiye.” Asif added the draft agreement was only one page, contrary to a longer version he said was circulating on social media. He added that an upcoming meeting in Turkiye would further refine the details, such as the mechanism to implement the deal’s aspects. Questioned about his own thoughts about whether the ceasefire would hold, the defence minister said: “I have guarded optimism on the matter; I am hopeful but also remain cautious. Can only say something conclusively given the circumstantial evidence. It is too early at the moment, we must remain hopeful of course.” The minister added that he hoped that the Afghan Taliban would act as a “unified government” and conclude the matter with Pakistan instead of returning tomorrow and saying that separate factions were behind the tensions. He elaborated that in the case of any violation, Qatar and Turkiye would be asked to play their role. Asif added that the mechanism for this entire process would be decided in the meeting on the October 25. The defence minister also stated that the entire TTP leadership was present in Afghanistan, adding that the matter would be taken up in Istanbul as well. He further said that the talks should not be taken to mean that Pakistan would negotiate or hold talks with the TTP, dismissing such a notion. Questioned about changes in Qatar’s press releases on the ceasefire with “tensions on the border” removed in a subsequent statement, Asif acknowledged that there was debate on wherever the word was used, but ultimately Qatar’s press release had nothing to do with the draft of the agreement, adding that he could not divulge its contents. “It is between them. It has absolutely no effect on the agreement,” he said, adding that the incident had no particular implications as were being derived by others.",

      "summary": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that the ceasefire agreement between Islamabad and Kabul was linked to the Afghan Taliban’s ability to rein in terrorists attacking Pakistan from neighbouring soil. The two countries agreed to a ceasefire in Doha at the weekend after days of border clashes that killed dozens, the worst such violence since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government. The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations , which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements . Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan . A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil. In his first official high-level meeting since he assumed the role of the KP CM on October 15, Afridi presented “important policy directives and announcements”, a post on his office’s X account said. “Terrorism has returned to the province due to the federal government’s wrong policy,” the post quoted CM Afridi as saying. He further claimed that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other Constitutional rights”. “The Centre should realise our sacrifices and release our funds on time. We can only strengthen our police and combat terrorism once we get our funds,” the chief minister said, lauding the KP police’s “unparalleled sacrifices” to eradicate terrorism. “The bulletproof cars provided by the interior minister (Mohsin Naqvi) are defective and old. This is a mockery of KP Police. These vehicles should be recalled,” Afridi said. Affirming that law and order were the provincial government’s top priority, he vowed there would be no compromise on it. “The police would not face a shortage of funds. All required resources will be provided on a priority basis. The police will be equipped with modern equipment and arms.” Responding to the KP chief minister later in the day, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry alleged that funds provided by the federal government were not appropriately used by the provincial government in the fight against terrorism. He asserted that the vehicles dismissed as being inferior by the chief minister were of international standards and the same as those used by federal ministers, institutional officers and anti-terror operations. “Losses are close to zero wherever these vehicles are used.” The state minister alleged that the provincial police was being thrown before terrorists with the move and nothing was being made available to it. He said the move reflected CM Afridi’s “immature thinking”, proved his detractors right and increased the threat to law enforcement agencies. “This is a highly unfortunate decision.” Afridi vows no MPO detention or ‘political’ cases CM Afridi also vowed that “no political individual” will be detained in KP under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, which gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected individuals to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order. In a petition to the Supreme Court last year, PTI founder Imran Khan sought a bar on “indiscriminate and unlawful use of detention orders” under the MPO against political workers, rights activists and political opponents. “Freedom of expression and constructive criticism is a fundamental Constitutional right of everyone,” Afridi was quoted as saying in the post. He further said that no one will be arrested under a “political” first information report (FIR). “These FIRs were registered due to political vendetta. The province has its own specific political culture; we will not let it be ruined. The [KP] police will never subject anyone to political vendettas. No FIR should be registered against any student,” said Afridi, who has remained the provincial president of the PTI’s student wing, the Insaf Students Federation (ISF). “The situation of KP Police should under no circumstances be like that of Punjab Police,” the chief minister quipped, ordering strictly that there should be no torture of prisoners. While vowing there would be no political interference in the police, the KP CM also warned that there should be no public complaints against it. He further said there should be separate enclaves for the police and the media in the provincial government’s housing schemes. ‘Strict action against those who succumbed to pressure’ While alleging that there was an attempt to “steal the public mandate” during the 2024 general elections in KP, Afridi hailed the provincial bureaucracy and police for “protecting the mandate of the province’s people”. “However, unfortunately, some government officials could not bear the pressure and did not protect the public mandate,” the PTI leader said. He vowed to reward those who stood with the people during last year’s elections and to take “strict action” against those who did not do so, directing the chief secretary to identify such people. CM Afridi further asserted, “Zero-tolerance policy against corruption is our party’s most important agenda. […] Strict action will be taken against whoever engages in corruption.” The chief minister also warned that if the public was not satisfied with any government official’s performance, that official would be removed from their role. “I have not come to work in the traditional way. We will have to work outside the traditional manner,” Afridi was quoted as saying. He also announced the establishment of Tribal Medical College and Tribal University of Modern Sciences for the merged districts, adding that playgrounds will be built on the tehsil level in all merged districts (erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas). A Safe City project aimed at reducing crime was also announced for these areas. The PTI leader said a “University of Investigation and Modern Journalism” dedicated to slain journalist Arshad Sharif will be built, while announcing another Revival Plan for Peshawar’s development. The chief minister also pledged to end the “reference culture” for postings and transfers of government employees and to ensure implementation of the two-year policy for these.",
