      "summary_orig": "Eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Wednesday. A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that last night, security forces conducted an IBO in Orakzai district on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khawarij . Fitna Al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of operation, 19 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the ISPR said. It added that during the exchange of fire, 39-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq, who was leading his troops from the front, and his second-in-command, 33-year-old Major Tayyab Rahat, embraced martyrdom along with nine of their men. The soldiers were identified as 38-year-old Naib Subedar Azam Gul, 35-year-old Naik Adil Hussain, 34-year-old Naik Gul Ameer, 31-year-old Lance Naik Sher Khan, 32-year-old Lance Naik Talish Faraz, 32-year-old Lance Naik Irshad Hussain, 28-year-old Sepoy Tufail Khan, 23-year-old Sepoy Aqib Ali and 24-year-old Sepoy Muhammad Zahid. The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area. It further stated that security forces were “determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve”. Funeral prayers were offered for the two officers in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala district, which were attended by Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, federal ministers and military and civic officials, the ISPR said in a later statement. “The prime minister, while paying tribute to the 11 shuhadas (martyrs) of [the] Orakzai incident, resolved that [the] Pakistani nation stands resolute and firm against this menace of terrorism and the shuhadas’ ultimate sacrifice is a reminder of the unwavering resolve of the nation to defend the motherland at all costs,” the statement read, adding that the remaining nine martyrs would be laid to rest in their native towns with full military honours. Military and civilian officials offer funeral prayers for two officers martyred during an operation in KP’s Orakzai area in Rawalpindi on October 10. — Photo courtesy ISPR PM Shehbaz paid tributes to the country’s security forces for killing 19 terrorists and also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the soldiers, including Lieutenant Colonel Arif and Major Rahat, according to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office. “The sacrifices of the fearless sons of security forces will never go in vain,” he said. “We will crush the nefarious intentions of Indian-backed terrorists. We will not allow elements that harm Pakistan’s integrity to succeed,” he added. PM Shehbaz said the government was determined to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country. A statement issued by the presidency said President Asif Ali Zardari had paid tributes to the “courageous action of security forces in the Orakzai district”. It added, “[The] president expressed satisfaction over the elimination of 19 terrorists of the Indian-backed khwarij . The President declared Lt. Col. Junaid Tariq shaheed, Major Tayyab Rahat and other martyrs as heroes of the nation,” the statement read. It added that Zardari expressed heartfelt sympathy with the families of the martyrs, praying that they bear their loss with patience and courage. The president said that the brave sons set an eternal example by sacrificing their lives while defending their country. “The sacrifices of the martyrs are a symbol of the nation’s resolve and unity.” He reiterated the “resolve to completely eliminate Indian-backed terrorism from the soil of Pakistan”. “The entire nation stands as a lead wall with its armed forces,” the statement quoted him as saying. A statement issued by the PPP said party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the 11 security personnel and paid them tributes. The statement posted on the PPP’s X account said Bilawal extended condolences to the families of the martyred and expressed solidarity with them. “Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the martyrs,” the statement said, adding that he reaffirmed his “unwavering support for the security forces during the ongoing operation for the elimination of terrorists”. National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, expressing grief over the martyrdom of the security personnel and paying tributes to them, reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate the threat of terrorism, state-run APP reported. “The sacrifices of our armed forces and security personnel in the war against terrorism will never go in vain. Terrorist […] will never succeed in fulfilling their nefarious designs,” the APP quoted him as saying. Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam said in a statement that he was “extremely dejected” to learn of the martyrdom of the personnel. “In this moment of profound grief, I extend my heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the government, armed forces and the people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families who have lost their loved ones,” the statement read. “May Allah Almighty grant eternal peace to the souls of the departed and bestow strength and patience upon their families.” Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Two reports , issued last week by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.",

National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, expressing grief over the martyrdom of the security personnel and paying tributes to them, reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate the threat of terrorism, state-run APP reported. “The sacrifices of our armed forces and security personnel in the war against terrorism will never go in vain. Terrorist […] will never succeed in fulfilling their nefarious designs,” the APP quoted him as saying. Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam said in a statement that he was “extremely dejected” to learn of the martyrdom of the personnel. “In this moment of profound grief, I extend my heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the government, armed forces and the people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families who have lost their loved ones,” the statement read. “May Allah Almighty grant eternal peace to the souls of the departed and bestow strength and patience upon their families.” Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Two reports , issued last week by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.",
      "title": "Lt col, major among 11 personnel martyred in KP’s Orakzai IBO: ISPR",
      "summary": "Eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Wednesday. A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that last night, security forces conducted an IBO in Orakzai district on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khawarij . Fitna Al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of operation, 19 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the ISPR said. It added that during the exchange of fire, 39-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq, who was leading his troops from the front, and his second-in-command, 33-year-old Major Tayyab Rahat, embraced martyrdom along with nine of their men. The soldiers were identified as 38-year-old Naib Subedar Azam Gul, 35-year-old Naik Adil Hussain, 34-year-old Naik Gul Ameer, 31-year-old Lance Naik Sher Khan, 32-year-old Lance Naik Talish Faraz, 32-year-old Lance Naik Irshad Hussain, 28-year-old Sepoy Tufail Khan, 23-year-old Sepoy Aqib Ali and 24-year-old Sepoy Muhammad Zahid. The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area. It further stated that security forces were “determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve”. Funeral prayers were offered for the two officers in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala district, which were attended by Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, federal ministers and military and civic officials, the ISPR said in a later statement. “The prime minister, while paying tribute to the 11 shuhadas (martyrs) of [the] Orakzai incident, resolved that [the] Pakistani nation stands resolute and firm against this menace of terrorism and the shuhadas’ ultimate sacrifice is a reminder of the unwavering resolve of the nation to defend the motherland at all costs,” the statement read, adding that the remaining nine martyrs would be laid to rest in their native towns with full military honours. Military and civilian officials offer funeral prayers for two officers martyred during an operation in KP’s Orakzai area in Rawalpindi on October 10. — Photo courtesy ISPR PM Shehbaz paid tributes to the country’s security forces for killing 19 terrorists and also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the soldiers, including Lieutenant Colonel Arif and Major Rahat, according to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office. “The sacrifices of the fearless sons of security forces will never go in vain,” he said. “We will crush the nefarious intentions of Indian-backed terrorists. We will not allow elements that harm Pakistan’s integrity to succeed,” he added. PM Shehbaz said the government was determined to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country. A statement issued by the presidency said President Asif Ali Zardari had paid tributes to the “courageous action of security forces in the Orakzai district”. It added, “[The] president expressed satisfaction over the elimination of 19 terrorists of the Indian-backed khwarij . The President declared Lt. Col. Junaid Tariq shaheed, Major Tayyab Rahat and other martyrs as heroes of the nation,” the statement read. It added that Zardari expressed heartfelt sympathy with the families of the martyrs, praying that they bear their loss with patience and courage. The president said that the brave sons set an eternal example by sacrificing their lives while defending their country. “The sacrifices of the martyrs are a symbol of the nation’s resolve and unity.” He reiterated the “resolve to completely eliminate Indian-backed terrorism from the soil of Pakistan”. “The entire nation stands as a lead wall with its armed forces,” the statement quoted him as saying. A statement issued by the PPP said party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the 11 security personnel and paid them tributes. The statement posted on the PPP’s X account said Bilawal extended condolences to the families of the martyred and expressed solidarity with them. “Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the martyrs,” the statement said, adding that he reaffirmed his “unwavering support for the security forces during the ongoing operation for the elimination of terrorists”.

      "summary_orig": "Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first footballer to reach billionaire status, according to the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index , which has valued the Portugal great’s net worth at an estimated $1.4 billion. The 40-year-old striker’s financial ascent comes after he signed a new contract with Saudi side Al-Nassr in June reportedly worth more than $400 million. Bloomberg said that Ronaldo earned more than $550m in salary between 2002 and 2023, supplemented by a decade-long Nike deal worth nearly $18m annually, and lucrative endorsements with Armani, Castrol and others that added more than $175m to his fortune. Ronaldo’s move to Al-Nassr from Manchester United in 2023 had already made him the highest-paid player in football history, with an annual salary of 177m pounds ($237.52m), plus bonuses and a reported 15 per cent share in his Saudi Arabia club. Argentina and Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi has earned more than $600m in pre-tax salary during his career. Ronaldo’s billionaire status places him among a rare group of athletes that includes basketball greats Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James, golfer Tiger Woods and tennis player Roger Federer. Ronaldo suggested he is not considering retirement any time soon. “I still have a passion for this,” he said at the Portugal Football Globes gala on Tuesday. “My family says it’s time to quit and they ask me why I want to score 1000 goals if I’ve already scored 900-something. But I don’t think that way inside. “I’m still producing good things, I’m helping my club and the national team. Why not continue? I am sure that when I finish I will leave full because I gave everything of myself. I know I don’t have many years left to play, but the few I have left, I have to enjoy them to the fullest.”",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Wednesday announced that he would step down from his office and the PTI confirmed that party founder Imran Khan had given the direction to do so along with nominating Sohail Afridi for the provincial top slot. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar said Gandapur would send his resignation to the governor on Thursday. Gandapur assumed the office of chief minister after he was administered his oath by then-KP governor Haji Ghulam Ali on March 3, 2024. His tenure as chief minister was not without controversy, either involving the federal government or criticism from within his own party. In fact, it has been a tight-rope walk for the chief minister, from his first day in office, to balancing politics with realpolitik. He had to do business with the federal government, as KP is heavily dependent on its resources and the real power brokers. Government officials said that in the initial few months, Gandapur struggled to balance between focusing on governance and the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the province, and demands from the hawkish group within the party to launch protest caravans against Islamabad, at times giving marching orders without even bothering to check with him. Dawn.com unpacks five major controversies from his 19-month tenure: Corruption allegations Allegations of corruption and financial irregularity have plagued the Gandapur administration since its first year. Imran had sent a stern message from his prison cell to members of the KP government in August 2024 that they would be held accountable for corruption and governance issues in their departments. Shakeel Ahmad Khan, the former minister for communication and works, was subsequently removed from his position. In September 2024, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi alleged that Gandapur was involved in massive corruption in the province. In May 2025, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) said a preliminary probe revealed that officials of the communication and works department, Upper Kohistan, in connivance with officials of district accounts office of Upper Kohistan and a branch of National Bank of Pakistan, had misappropriated more than Rs30 billion from different projects through bogus withdrawal of funds from the national treasury in the name of several contractors, who didn’t carry out any civil work. The bureau claimed that the district accounts office of Upper Kohistan, without carrying out any verification of the alleged work done by the said contractors, passed the cheques amounting to billions of rupees, which were deposited by those contractors in their bank accounts. Direct communication with Afghanistan Another area of Gandapur’s policy that often landed him in direct confrontation with the federal government was his pursuit of a direct line of communication with the interim Afghan Taliban government as per Imran’s instructions. In September 2024, Gandapur said he had requested the ‘authorities’ for permission to hold talks with the Afghan government for peace in the province on Imran’s instructions , warning that he would proceed on his own if the request was not considered. The response was swift as the federal government and its allies lambasted Gandapur for his comments about unilaterally leading peace talks with Afghanistan, accusing him of exceeding his authority. The Foreign Office also jumped into the fray and unequivocally stated that conducting diplomatic negotiations with foreign governments was the sole domain of the federal government. The issue resurfaced in January when Gandapur announced plans to send a delegation to Afghanistan for dialogue on bilateral issues. The provincial government also said it would engage cross-border tribesmen to curb militancy and ensure regional peace . That led to Minister for States and Frontier Regions, Kashmir Affairs, and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam stating that negotiations with Afghanistan fell outside the provincial government’s jurisdiction. Backing down from his earlier assertiveness, Gandapur said in March that he was waiting for the federal government’s approval regarding the terms of reference for a jirga to negotiate with the Afghan government and last month, he disclosed that his passport had been blocked since May 9, 2023, so he couldn’t travel to Afghanistan for holding peace talks. The disclosure came after Imran directed Gandapur to visit Afghanistan and hold discussions with authorities regarding “mutual issues and peace and security to prevent the situation from deteriorating further”. Role in PTI protests Gandapur has also been the frequent victim of criticism by PTI supporters, particularly on social media, regarding his contribution and role in advocating for Imran’s release. The most challenges Gandapur faced emanated from within his own party. The PTI staged a protest in Islamabad in October last year that saw clashes between its supporters and the police. Gandapur also reached the federal capital and went to KP House. Confusion subsequently emerged as the party initially claimed but then retracted the claim that he was arrested from KP House. His decision to leave party workers in Islamabad and move to KP House had surprised many and also elicited criticism from the PTI’s political committee. In a surprising turn of events, he resurfaced and entered the KP Assembly chamber on Oct 6 after the PTI demanded he be produced within 24 hours. Reacting to Gandapur’s sudden reappearance, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had said that he had “staged a drama” through his disappearance. In a repeat occurrence during the party’s November 2024 protest, government ministers had alleged that Gandapur had again fled the party’s protest and abandoned its supporters. There was something amiss , according to those in attendance. Ganda­pur, who was originally to lead the caravan to D-Chowk — was trailing far behind. The events that unfolded on November 26 not only deeply polarised the party that still rallies around its incarcerated chief, but also triggered and intensified a tug of war and jockeying for power bet­ween different groups within the PTI. Former first lady Bushra Bibi had heaped scorn on Gandapur for abandoning her at D-Chowk — enough of a cue for the party’s social media warriors to start trolling the chief minister. Those who are closely associated with Gandapur had blamed some party figures from Punjab for poisoning the party founder against him. The acrimony was witnessed at a core committee meeting, where, according to some who sat through the proceedings, the two sides exchanged barbs after KP objected to being left alone to do the heavy-lifting while the Punjab chapter was nowhere to be seen when push came to shove. But that acrimony, some party insiders had said, was just part of a larger issue — Gandapur’s inability to make any significant headway in their quest for some kind of relief for his jailed leader and his spouse. The chief minister’s suggestions to convince power brokers to relocate the former prime minister and his wife and place them either under house arrest at their home in Banigala, or at a host of locations in KP, such as the Governor’s House, Nathiagali or the CM House in Peshawar, did not really cut any ice with those who actually wield power in the country. His own party’s social media warriors, who once adored and called him ‘Khan sahib’s tiger’, then began trolling him. The difficult balancing act that he was trying to perform seemed to be becoming too heavy a burden for his shoulders to bear. For perhaps the first time in his political career, ever since his entry into power corridors, Gandapur seemed to be under pressure. In a similar turn of events in July 2025, Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by Imran, which was expected to climax on August 5, marking two years of the former PM’s imprisonment. At a press conference where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’. Flanked by PTI leaders who had arrived in Lahore to launch their movement for the release of Imran and his spouse, Gandapur had said that the 90-day countdown had already begun. However, the mixed messages had left party workers questioning whether this meant a postponement of the Aug 5 protest plan, or something else altogether. The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to prohibit his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters. He himself had decried the lack of any “meaningful momentum” for the party’s planned Aug 5 protest and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences. The result was a muted turnout on Aug 5 that saw the party alleging that its plans were thwarted by the state’s crackdown. Feud with Aleema Khanum The latest controversy to embroil Gandapur came when a split between him and Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum came to the fore. He met Imran on September 29 for over two hours, discussing differences in the party, with Imran ordering strict action against “those creating issues within the party”. The very next day, Gandapur accused Aleema of creating a divide within the party and alleged that she was being facilitated by the Military Intelligence (MI) and “establishment”. He confirmed there was a rift in the party and Aleema, with the help of some vloggers, was trying to provoke the party workers against him and to discredit the party leaders. He said he told the party founder that the factions were working for their vested interests and that had hurt the campaign for his release. For six months, Gandapur weathered a storm. Not from a weak opposition but from his own party, backed by an unbridled overseas social media brigade, clamouring for his head. He was called a ‘traitor’, ‘compromised’ and ‘establishment tout’. The noise reached such a fever pitch that some within his own cabinet began to wonder loudly about the prospects of replacing him. Many in officialdom were left puzzled and wondering whether the mustachioed, long-locked strongman was indeed on his way out. “I never felt so weak,” Gandapur narrated to his jailed party leader. For months, he said, he was trolled for refusing the chairman’s orders not to present and pass the provincial budget, hold direct negotiations with the Afghan Taliban to put an end to militancy in the volatile province and, more crucially, refuse support for military operations and drone attacks in the tribal districts. Political action against PTI wishes The sardar from Kulachi, Dera Ismail Khan, hardly had smooth sailing as KP’s eighteenth chief minister. For the first eight months, he was required to launch one protest march after another as the party attempted to pressure the powerful military establishment to eke out concessions for his leaders. Governance, at the time, was placed firmly on the back burner. Furthermore, the times he took political action that seemingly went against Imran and the PTI’s wishes, such as supporting military operations to legislative actvity, further incensed the party’s supporters. His political challenges became compounded after the D-Chowk fiasco last November, and were further exacerbated by subsequent events, beginning with the abortive attempt to pass the mines and minerals bill, which the party’s social media activists claimed was being sponsored by the military establishment. The chief minister had to relent, however, when his incarcerated leader conveyed his own opposition to the bill. Then came the budget. Orders from Adiala said the incarcerated leader should be consulted before it is presented to the house. Efforts were made to share the draft proposals and seek his nod, but things didn’t work out. Then came another order, ‘Don’t pass the budget’. Barrister Saif, self-acclaimed ‘Pindi boy’ and adviser to the chief minister, was dispatched to brief the leader that passing the budget was a constitutional requirement, and failure to do so would technically knock out the government. This time, Imran relented. The unforgiving internet activists, however, trolled Gandapur again when the worsening security situation warranted a military response. The problem was further compounded by incidents involving drone attacks that resulted in civilian casualties. The political storm was gathering, and the chief minister’s fate seemed to have been sealed when Imran’s frustration with him seemed to boil over, triggered by his “failure to stop” military operations in the province.",

In a surprising turn of events, he resurfaced and entered the KP Assembly chamber on Oct 6 after the PTI demanded he be produced within 24 hours. Reacting to Gandapur’s sudden reappearance, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had said that he had “staged a drama” through his disappearance. In a repeat occurrence during the party’s November 2024 protest, government ministers had alleged that Gandapur had again fled the party’s protest and abandoned its supporters. There was something amiss , according to those in attendance. Ganda­pur, who was originally to lead the caravan to D-Chowk — was trailing far behind. The events that unfolded on November 26 not only deeply polarised the party that still rallies around its incarcerated chief, but also triggered and intensified a tug of war and jockeying for power bet­ween different groups within the PTI. Former first lady Bushra Bibi had heaped scorn on Gandapur for abandoning her at D-Chowk — enough of a cue for the party’s social media warriors to start trolling the chief minister. Those who are closely associated with Gandapur had blamed some party figures from Punjab for poisoning the party founder against him. The acrimony was witnessed at a core committee meeting, where, according to some who sat through the proceedings, the two sides exchanged barbs after KP objected to being left alone to do the heavy-lifting while the Punjab chapter was nowhere to be seen when push came to shove. But that acrimony, some party insiders had said, was just part of a larger issue — Gandapur’s inability to make any significant headway in their quest for some kind of relief for his jailed leader and his spouse. The chief minister’s suggestions to convince power brokers to relocate the former prime minister and his wife and place them either under house arrest at their home in Banigala, or at a host of locations in KP, such as the Governor’s House, Nathiagali or the CM House in Peshawar, did not really cut any ice with those who actually wield power in the country. His own party’s social media warriors, who once adored and called him ‘Khan sahib’s tiger’, then began trolling him. The difficult balancing act that he was trying to perform seemed to be becoming too heavy a burden for his shoulders to bear. For perhaps the first time in his political career, ever since his entry into power corridors, Gandapur seemed to be under pressure. In a similar turn of events in July 2025, Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by Imran, which was expected to climax on August 5, marking two years of the former PM’s imprisonment. At a press conference where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’. Flanked by PTI leaders who had arrived in Lahore to launch their movement for the release of Imran and his spouse, Gandapur had said that the 90-day countdown had already begun. However, the mixed messages had left party workers questioning whether this meant a postponement of the Aug 5 protest plan, or something else altogether. The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to prohibit his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters. He himself had decried the lack of any “meaningful momentum” for the party’s planned Aug 5 protest and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences. The result was a muted turnout on Aug 5 that saw the party alleging that its plans were thwarted by the state’s crackdown. Feud with Aleema Khanum The latest controversy to embroil Gandapur came when a split between him and Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum came to the fore. He met Imran on September 29 for over two hours, discussing differences in the party, with Imran ordering strict action against “those creating issues within the party”. The very next day, Gandapur accused Aleema of creating a divide within the party and alleged that she was being facilitated by the Military Intelligence (MI) and “establishment”. He confirmed there was a rift in the party and Aleema, with the help of some vloggers, was trying to provoke the party workers against him and to discredit the party leaders. He said he told the party founder that the factions were working for their vested interests and that had hurt the campaign for his release. For six months, Gandapur weathered a storm. Not from a weak opposition but from his own party, backed by an unbridled overseas social media brigade, clamouring for his head. He was called a ‘traitor’, ‘compromised’ and ‘establishment tout’. The noise reached such a fever pitch that some within his own cabinet began to wonder loudly about the prospects of replacing him. Many in officialdom were left puzzled and wondering whether the mustachioed, long-locked strongman was indeed on his way out. “I never felt so weak,” Gandapur narrated to his jailed party leader. For months, he said, he was trolled for refusing the chairman’s orders not to present and pass the provincial budget, hold direct negotiations with the Afghan Taliban to put an end to militancy in the volatile province and, more crucially, refuse support for military operations and drone attacks in the tribal districts. Political action against PTI wishes The sardar from Kulachi, Dera Ismail Khan, hardly had smooth sailing as KP’s eighteenth chief minister. For the first eight months, he was required to launch one protest march after another as the party attempted to pressure the powerful military establishment to eke out concessions for his leaders. Governance, at the time, was placed firmly on the back burner. Furthermore, the times he took political action that seemingly went against Imran and the PTI’s wishes, such as supporting military operations to legislative actvity, further incensed the party’s supporters. His political challenges became compounded after the D-Chowk fiasco last November, and were further exacerbated by subsequent events, beginning with the abortive attempt to pass the mines and minerals bill, which the party’s social media activists claimed was being sponsored by the military establishment. The chief minister had to relent, however, when his incarcerated leader conveyed his own opposition to the bill. Then came the budget. Orders from Adiala said the incarcerated leader should be consulted before it is presented to the house. Efforts were made to share the draft proposals and seek his nod, but things didn’t work out. Then came another order, ‘Don’t pass the budget’. Barrister Saif, self-acclaimed ‘Pindi boy’ and adviser to the chief minister, was dispatched to brief the leader that passing the budget was a constitutional requirement, and failure to do so would technically knock out the government. This time, Imran relented. The unforgiving internet activists, however, trolled Gandapur again when the worsening security situation warranted a military response. The problem was further compounded by incidents involving drone attacks that resulted in civilian casualties. The political storm was gathering, and the chief minister’s fate seemed to have been sealed when Imran’s frustration with him seemed to boil over, triggered by his “failure to stop” military operations in the province.",

      "summary": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Wednesday announced that he would step down from his office and the PTI confirmed that party founder Imran Khan had given the direction to do so along with nominating Sohail Afridi for the provincial top slot. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar said Gandapur would send his resignation to the governor on Thursday. Gandapur assumed the office of chief minister after he was administered his oath by then-KP governor Haji Ghulam Ali on March 3, 2024. His tenure as chief minister was not without controversy, either involving the federal government or criticism from within his own party. In fact, it has been a tight-rope walk for the chief minister, from his first day in office, to balancing politics with realpolitik. He had to do business with the federal government, as KP is heavily dependent on its resources and the real power brokers. Government officials said that in the initial few months, Gandapur struggled to balance between focusing on governance and the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the province, and demands from the hawkish group within the party to launch protest caravans against Islamabad, at times giving marching orders without even bothering to check with him. Dawn.com unpacks five major controversies from his 19-month tenure: Corruption allegations Allegations of corruption and financial irregularity have plagued the Gandapur administration since its first year. Imran had sent a stern message from his prison cell to members of the KP government in August 2024 that they would be held accountable for corruption and governance issues in their departments. Shakeel Ahmad Khan, the former minister for communication and works, was subsequently removed from his position. In September 2024, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi alleged that Gandapur was involved in massive corruption in the province. In May 2025, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) said a preliminary probe revealed that officials of the communication and works department, Upper Kohistan, in connivance with officials of district accounts office of Upper Kohistan and a branch of National Bank of Pakistan, had misappropriated more than Rs30 billion from different projects through bogus withdrawal of funds from the national treasury in the name of several contractors, who didn’t carry out any civil work. The bureau claimed that the district accounts office of Upper Kohistan, without carrying out any verification of the alleged work done by the said contractors, passed the cheques amounting to billions of rupees, which were deposited by those contractors in their bank accounts. Direct communication with Afghanistan Another area of Gandapur’s policy that often landed him in direct confrontation with the federal government was his pursuit of a direct line of communication with the interim Afghan Taliban government as per Imran’s instructions. In September 2024, Gandapur said he had requested the ‘authorities’ for permission to hold talks with the Afghan government for peace in the province on Imran’s instructions , warning that he would proceed on his own if the request was not considered. The response was swift as the federal government and its allies lambasted Gandapur for his comments about unilaterally leading peace talks with Afghanistan, accusing him of exceeding his authority. The Foreign Office also jumped into the fray and unequivocally stated that conducting diplomatic negotiations with foreign governments was the sole domain of the federal government. The issue resurfaced in January when Gandapur announced plans to send a delegation to Afghanistan for dialogue on bilateral issues. The provincial government also said it would engage cross-border tribesmen to curb militancy and ensure regional peace . That led to Minister for States and Frontier Regions, Kashmir Affairs, and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam stating that negotiations with Afghanistan fell outside the provincial government’s jurisdiction. Backing down from his earlier assertiveness, Gandapur said in March that he was waiting for the federal government’s approval regarding the terms of reference for a jirga to negotiate with the Afghan government and last month, he disclosed that his passport had been blocked since May 9, 2023, so he couldn’t travel to Afghanistan for holding peace talks. The disclosure came after Imran directed Gandapur to visit Afghanistan and hold discussions with authorities regarding “mutual issues and peace and security to prevent the situation from deteriorating further”. Role in PTI protests Gandapur has also been the frequent victim of criticism by PTI supporters, particularly on social media, regarding his contribution and role in advocating for Imran’s release. The most challenges Gandapur faced emanated from within his own party. The PTI staged a protest in Islamabad in October last year that saw clashes between its supporters and the police. Gandapur also reached the federal capital and went to KP House. Confusion subsequently emerged as the party initially claimed but then retracted the claim that he was arrested from KP House. His decision to leave party workers in Islamabad and move to KP House had surprised many and also elicited criticism from the PTI’s political committee. In a surprising turn of events, he resurfaced and entered the KP Assembly chamber on Oct 6 after the PTI demanded he be produced within 24 hours.

The Aussies were staring down the barrel at 76-7 and then 115-8 after being asked to bat first with the Pakistan bowlers causing mayhem, left-arm spinner Nashra Sandhu finishing with 3-37 from her 10 overs. But a record ninth-wicket stand between Mooney, who was dismissed off the final ball of the innings for 109, and Alana King, who made 51 not out, turned the tide. The pair dragged their side from the doldrums to a competitive 221-9 and that proved plenty as Pakistan’s brittle batting folded meekly for 114 all out in 36.3 overs.

But a record ninth-wicket stand between Mooney, who was dismissed off the final ball of the innings for 109, and Alana King, who made 51 not out, turned the tide. The pair dragged their side from the doldrums to a competitive 221-9 and that proved plenty as Pakistan’s brittle batting folded meekly for 114 all out in 36.3 overs. Sidra Amin was the only Pakistan batter to put up a fight with 35 while opening bowler Kim Garth, who used to compete for Ireland, was the pick of the Australian attack with 3-14. In the end it was a comfortable win for the Australians but it hadn’t looked like that a little earlier. After a top order collapse that left the dugout stunned, Australia needed a saviour and up stepped the ever reliable Mooney. The left-hander produced her fifth ODI hundred while King played the perfect foil, matching grit with gumption in a 106-run partnership off 97 balls that breathed new life into the innings. It was not just a rescue act, it was record breaking. The partnership eclipsed Australia’s previous best for the ninth wicket — 77 between Garth and Ashleigh Gardner — and also set a new Women’s World Cup benchmark, surpassing South Africa’s 66-run effort by Yulandi van der Merwe and Kim Price back in 2000. Mooney’s innings was a masterclass in temperament, a classic backs-to-the-wall knock. She farmed the strike smartly, ran fast between the wickets and only unfurled the big shots towards the end. “It was a pretty tricky situation. We wanted to get a partnership going and really had to grind to reach 221,” said Mooney. “Alana King was incredible tonight. We’ve seen her do it before and it was nice to share that stand with her.” Having rebuilt brick by brick, Mooney brought up her century with a nudge to mid-on off Fatima Sana, while King capped her maiden fifty in style, hoisting the Pakistan captain for six as Australia plundered 21 runs off the final over. Mooney’s 109 off 114 deliveries, laced with 11 boundaries, ended when she holed out to cover off the final ball of the innings. King remained unbeaten on 51 off 49, peppered with three fours and as many sixes, the highest score ever made by a number 10 or lower in women’s ODIs. Pakistan never found their footing in reply, undone by Australia’s relentless discipline with the ball. The seven-time world champions climbed back to the top of the points table, while Pakistan’s third straight defeat leaves their knockout hopes hanging by a thread.",

      "summary_orig": "PTI’s Ali Amin Gandapur said on Wednesday that he will resign from his role as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister shortly after the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the role of provincial chief executive. At just 35, Afridi has emerged as one of the most prominent young faces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s political paradigm. Representing PK-70 Bara for the first time as an MPA, Afridi’s political struggle reflects a steady rise from student activism to a cabinet position. Born in 1989 in Khyber district’s Bara tehsil, Afridi’s roots lie deep in the tribal heartland, an area that has seen immense transformation in recent years. A graduate in economics, his early years were marked by his involvement in student politics — a platform that paved the way for his future in provincial governance. Afridi served as the provincial president of the Insaf Students Federation (ISF), the student wing of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), where he gained recognition for mobilising youth and advocating for educational reforms. His tenure in the ISF helped him establish a grassroots political base, particularly among first-time voters and students. Elected to the KP Assembly from PK-70 Bara in 2024, Afridi made his legislative debut with a strong mandate from his native constituency. Later that year, he was inducted into the provincial cabinet as special assistant to the chief minister on communications, a role in which he contributed to the province’s connectivity and infrastructure agenda. Last week, in a reshuffle within the provincial cabinet, Afridi was elevated to the post of minister for higher education, a portfolio that aligns closely with his academic background and early political activism. Irfan Saleem, PTI’s additional general secretary and the party president in Peshawar, told Dawn.com that Afridi has been a party loyalist since student life, adding that whenever Imran Khan made a call for protest, he stood in the front row. “He saw hardship and jails for the party,“ Saleem said. “We expect that he will take Imran Khan’s cause ahead.“ “When there were drone attacks, the Bara Khyber incident or other issues , he raised his voice,” he added. “He knows the party well and will handle it to end polarisation.” Another PTI leader in KP, Deputy Information Secretary and social media head Ikram Katahna, told Dawn.com , “We welcome this decision as we stand with Khan and his decisions.” Katahna added that Afridi is a grassroots worker and “a common man like us and he came to this stage”. “The PTI is a party of common people and Sohail Afridi’s nomination proves it,” he added.",

      "title_orig": "SC Constitutional Bench mulls formation of full court while hearing pleas against 26th Amendment",
      "summary_orig": "An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday began its deliberations on the petitioners’ request to form a full court to hear a set of pleas challenging the 26th Amendment . The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy. It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment. The legislation had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The CB is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. It resumed proceedings yesterday after over eight months , and unanimously allowed live-streaming of the case upon some petitioners’ request. The pleas taken up also seek the formation of a full court to hear the matter. Hence, before proceeding further, the court will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB. During today’s hearing, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan requested the formation of a 16-member bench to hear the pleas, as per the number of SC judges at the time of the 26th Amendment. Several judges, including Justice Aminuddin, observed that the 26th Amendment was currently part of the Constitution. Some judges questioned whether the CB had the power to form a full court, while Justice Malik noted there was no restriction on issuing a judicial order for that. The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow. Requests to form a full court bench and to live stream the case dominated yesterday’s hearing, with the state lawyer expressing no objection to live stream the proceedings. Commenting on today’s hearing, Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, who is one of the petitioners , said: “Justice Ayesha stood out with her observations, while her colleagues appeared to take refuge in Article 5 ’s ‘loyalty to the state’ clause”. The hearing At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Hamid came to the rostrum and said the 26th Amendment was introduced in an “unusual” manner and passed by the parliament at night . Hamid recalled that there were 17 judges present in the SC at the time the legislation was passed, including then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa, who later retired. Therefore, he contended, a 16-judge “full court” bench as of then should hear the pleas and pointed out that all eight judges in the current CB would be part of that bench as they were already serving as SC judges in October last year. As per the SC’s website, there are currently a total of 24 judges in the SC, including CJP Yahya Afridi, after six new judges were appointed in February. “This Amendment is against the very basic features of the Constitution,” he asserted, at which Justice Mandokhail said that the matter will be deliberated upon later and asked him whether the Amendment was currently a part of the Constitution. In response to Hamid’s arguments, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “We depend on the Constitution. Lawyers also depend on the Constitution. Unless the Constitution is [further] amended, we will have to depend on the current Constitution.” Justice Hilali also observed that whether the 26th Amendment was “right or wrong”, the court had not suspended it yet. “You consider the 26th Amendment a part of the Constitution, which is why you have challenged it.” Here, Justice Mazhar noted that the CB was at the moment not considering the main question of the legislation’s legality, but the request for a full court and sought arguments on that. Hamid responded that he was not detailing how the 26th Amendment was unconstitutional, but on the “effects of its powers”. He said it was for the first time after the legislation that the “authority to form benches was taken away from the chief justice”. Noting that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) existed prior to last year’s constitutional tweaks, the LHCBA counsel said the 26th Amendment impacted the JCP’s formation as “judges became a minority” after the number of its members was increased . “After the Amendment, the majority in the Judicial Commission went to the administrative side, which affected judicial independence,” Hamid said. Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Hamid whether he was acknowledging the 26th Amendment or not, the lawyer replied in the negative. At this point during the hearing, Justice Mazhar wondered whether a bench constituted after the 26th Amendment could decide a plea seeking the formation of a full court. Justice Mandokhail, however, remarked that the Amendment was part of the Constitution for now. At Justice Afghan pointing out that Hamid had not specified in his petition that “to whom should the bench send the case”, the lawyer said the matter should be referred to the CJP. Justice Hilali also asked whether the LHCBA counsel had made any request to the authority responsible for constituting the benches. To this, Hamid replied, “We are challenging the bench formation, which was constituted under the influence of the 26th Amendment.” Here, Justice Aminuddin observed, “Right now, [we are] not at such a stage to consider who will hear the case. Possibly, there might be hearings for a month on the matter of who will hear the case,” he added. “On what basis are you saying that we cannot hear the case?” the CB head questioned Hamid, remarking that it was not in the judges’ control to “go back to before the 26th Amendment”. At this point during the hearing, Justice Malik said, “Whether a full court hears or a bench, no one is stopping any judicial order. The process continues after a judicial order. “Where under the 26th Amendment is a full court being barred?” she asked, to which Hamid replied that the legislation did not do so. Justice Malik observed, “When there is a request for forming a bench, we do not question the procedure. We give directions, after which the process is initiated.” Here, Justice Aminuddin wondered under what authority the CB would constitute a full court, following which Justice Malik said there was “no restriction on forming a full court under a judicial order”. “Where in the 26th Amendment is it written that a judicial order cannot be issued? Such is being done in ordinary cases, then why not in this case?” she countered. Justice Afghan again raised the issue of Hamid not mentioning the said request in his petition. Upon Justice Mazhar asking whether the CB could use Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution to issue the order for a full court, Hamid replied in the affirmative. At one point during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the CB was not conceptualised by the SC but by the parliament. When Hamid said the bench should “forget” Article 191A, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the apex court, Justice Aminuddin said if that was forgotten, the SC would not exist anymore. “A full court was always formed whenever questions were raised about the Constitution,” Hamid emphasised. At this, Justice Mandokhail wondered if a “point decided by 17 judges in the past” can be reversed, to which the lawyer replied in the negative. “Will you not be glad if the previous decision is upheld and now a smaller bench hears the case?” the judge asked. However, Justice Afghan noted that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 did not exist in the past. He remarked that CJPs in the past “kept using their powers to constitute full courts ”, but now that authority lied with the SC Practice and Procedure Committee “as per the Constitution and the law”. The petitions The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued. The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",

Requests to form a full court bench and to live stream the case dominated yesterday’s hearing, with the state lawyer expressing no objection to live stream the proceedings. Commenting on today’s hearing, Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, who is one of the petitioners , said: “Justice Ayesha stood out with her observations, while her colleagues appeared to take refuge in Article 5 ’s ‘loyalty to the state’ clause”. The hearing At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Hamid came to the rostrum and said the 26th Amendment was introduced in an “unusual” manner and passed by the parliament at night . Hamid recalled that there were 17 judges present in the SC at the time the legislation was passed, including then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa, who later retired. Therefore, he contended, a 16-judge “full court” bench as of then should hear the pleas and pointed out that all eight judges in the current CB would be part of that bench as they were already serving as SC judges in October last year. As per the SC’s website, there are currently a total of 24 judges in the SC, including CJP Yahya Afridi, after six new judges were appointed in February. “This Amendment is against the very basic features of the Constitution,” he asserted, at which Justice Mandokhail said that the matter will be deliberated upon later and asked him whether the Amendment was currently a part of the Constitution. In response to Hamid’s arguments, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “We depend on the Constitution. Lawyers also depend on the Constitution. Unless the Constitution is [further] amended, we will have to depend on the current Constitution.” Justice Hilali also observed that whether the 26th Amendment was “right or wrong”, the court had not suspended it yet. “You consider the 26th Amendment a part of the Constitution, which is why you have challenged it.” Here, Justice Mazhar noted that the CB was at the moment not considering the main question of the legislation’s legality, but the request for a full court and sought arguments on that. Hamid responded that he was not detailing how the 26th Amendment was unconstitutional, but on the “effects of its powers”. He said it was for the first time after the legislation that the “authority to form benches was taken away from the chief justice”. Noting that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) existed prior to last year’s constitutional tweaks, the LHCBA counsel said the 26th Amendment impacted the JCP’s formation as “judges became a minority” after the number of its members was increased . “After the Amendment, the majority in the Judicial Commission went to the administrative side, which affected judicial independence,” Hamid said. Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Hamid whether he was acknowledging the 26th Amendment or not, the lawyer replied in the negative. At this point during the hearing, Justice Mazhar wondered whether a bench constituted after the 26th Amendment could decide a plea seeking the formation of a full court. Justice Mandokhail, however, remarked that the Amendment was part of the Constitution for now. At Justice Afghan pointing out that Hamid had not specified in his petition that “to whom should the bench send the case”, the lawyer said the matter should be referred to the CJP. Justice Hilali also asked whether the LHCBA counsel had made any request to the authority responsible for constituting the benches. To this, Hamid replied, “We are challenging the bench formation, which was constituted under the influence of the 26th Amendment.” Here, Justice Aminuddin observed, “Right now, [we are] not at such a stage to consider who will hear the case. Possibly, there might be hearings for a month on the matter of who will hear the case,” he added. “On what basis are you saying that we cannot hear the case?” the CB head questioned Hamid, remarking that it was not in the judges’ control to “go back to before the 26th Amendment”. At this point during the hearing, Justice Malik said, “Whether a full court hears or a bench, no one is stopping any judicial order. The process continues after a judicial order. “Where under the 26th Amendment is a full court being barred?” she asked, to which Hamid replied that the legislation did not do so. Justice Malik observed, “When there is a request for forming a bench, we do not question the procedure. We give directions, after which the process is initiated.” Here, Justice Aminuddin wondered under what authority the CB would constitute a full court, following which Justice Malik said there was “no restriction on forming a full court under a judicial order”. “Where in the 26th Amendment is it written that a judicial order cannot be issued? Such is being done in ordinary cases, then why not in this case?” she countered. Justice Afghan again raised the issue of Hamid not mentioning the said request in his petition. Upon Justice Mazhar asking whether the CB could use Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution to issue the order for a full court, Hamid replied in the affirmative. At one point during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the CB was not conceptualised by the SC but by the parliament. When Hamid said the bench should “forget” Article 191A, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the apex court, Justice Aminuddin said if that was forgotten, the SC would not exist anymore. “A full court was always formed whenever questions were raised about the Constitution,” Hamid emphasised. At this, Justice Mandokhail wondered if a “point decided by 17 judges in the past” can be reversed, to which the lawyer replied in the negative. “Will you not be glad if the previous decision is upheld and now a smaller bench hears the case?” the judge asked. However, Justice Afghan noted that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 did not exist in the past. He remarked that CJPs in the past “kept using their powers to constitute full courts ”, but now that authority lied with the SC Practice and Procedure Committee “as per the Constitution and the law”. The petitions The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued. The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",

      "summary": "An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday began its deliberations on the petitioners’ request to form a full court to hear a set of pleas challenging the 26th Amendment . The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy. It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment. The legislation had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The CB is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. It resumed proceedings yesterday after over eight months , and unanimously allowed live-streaming of the case upon some petitioners’ request. The pleas taken up also seek the formation of a full court to hear the matter. Hence, before proceeding further, the court will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB. During today’s hearing, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan requested the formation of a 16-member bench to hear the pleas, as per the number of SC judges at the time of the 26th Amendment. Several judges, including Justice Aminuddin, observed that the 26th Amendment was currently part of the Constitution. Some judges questioned whether the CB had the power to form a full court, while Justice Malik noted there was no restriction on issuing a judicial order for that.

At this point during the hearing, Justice Malik said, “Whether a full court hears or a bench, no one is stopping any judicial order. The process continues after a judicial order. “Where under the 26th Amendment is a full court being barred?” she asked, to which Hamid replied that the legislation did not do so.

      "title_orig": "Why are PPP and PML-N currently feuding?",
      "summary_orig": "What started as a difference in opinion over how to aid flood-affected people has now spiralled into a full-blown feud between the PML-N and the PPP, the two main partners in the ruling coalition. The spat, termed a ghar ka mamla by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Sept 30, has devolved into a public spectacle threatening the alliance between the two parties. The bad blood has escalated to the point that leaders from both sides hold daily press conferences to take potshots at the other side. And now, President Asif Ali Zardari appears to be making overtures to smooth over the situation. But how did the whole thing begin? Here’s what we know. How to help flood victims? It appears that differences developed between the PML-N and the PPP last month as the two bickered on how to help flood victims. Several PPP leaders, including Sherry Rehman , called for the utilisation of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) to aid flood victims in Punjab, while the provincial government insisted it would use its own resources to do so. BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women. During this time, PML-N lea­der Rana Sanaullah also called for a complete overhaul of the BISP. He also stated that the BISP could not be continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be completely revamped. In response to Sanaullah’s comments, PPP leader Humayun Khan criticised the PML-N’s approach, stressing that “this is not the time for political point-scoring. It is a time for solidarity and action.“ Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari then took a jibe at the PPP-led Sindh government over its insistence on the BISP, refusing to take advice from “those who turned Sindh into archaeological ruins”. At one point, PPP’s Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, the first lady and an MNA, also joined the discourse and said that the BISP was the “most effective way” to distribute aid to flood-affected people, adding that it would be “irresponsible to not utilise it”. On September 25, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asserted that the BISP was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the floods in the country, while PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz — who is also the Punjab chief minister — accused his party of “politicising” the issue. “The PPP is our ally and I respect them, but unfortunately, they have been politicising the floods in Punjab,” the Punjab CM said. “I don’t know their agenda, but I want to tell [President] Asif Zardari and [PPP Chairman] Bilawal … please help your party’s spokesperson understand that if, Gob forbid, there is a disaster in Sindh, Punjab would stand with it.” CM Punjab went on to question the efficiency of BISP, calling it a “very simplistic solution” to an otherwise complicated problem. “What will people who have lost their homes, cattle, and crops do with just Rs10,000?” ‘My water, my money’ However, tensions finally boiled over when, on September 29, Maryam resurrected the issue of the Cholistan canals project . The Cholistan water project has been a bone of contention between the Sindh and Punjab governments ever since the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) gave its nod on Jan 17, 2024 on the issuance of a water availability certificate for the controversial project. Cholistan canal — also known as Cholistan Flood Feeder in papers — aims to develop a new command area, though in a phased manner, in southern Punjab, depending on flows from the Sutlej River, besides flood supplies. Sutlej flows, according to Sindh’s position, depend on surplus releases from India ever since it was surrendered to India under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960. In April, the government had announced that it was halting the contentious canals project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the Council of Common Interests (CCI). In her fiery speech , Maryam had said, “If Punjab wants to construct canals for its water, why are you bothered? It is Punjab’s water. It belongs to the people, farmers and fields of Punjab. “If I want to create canals, why do you object to it?” she questioned. “I wouldn’t have stolen water. I would have [used] them to create waterways and developed Cholistan,” she continued. She said that India had also done something similar, adding, “So why can’t I? It is my water, my money, everything is mine.” Reiterating her argument that funds given under the BISP were insufficient for flood relief, she also rejected the PPP’s proposition to seek international assistance to help people affected by recent floods in Punjab. “Keep your advice to yourself,” she rebuked. “Punjab never interferes in your matters, so you don’t interfere in Punjab’s matters,” she said. PPP takes offence, walks out of Parliament The next day, PPP’s Naveed Qamar stood up in the National Assembly to record his party’s protest against Maryam’s speech and summarily walked out of the lower house of Parliament. The PPP also stayed away from the Senate session held the same day. In his speech, PPP’s Qamar termed Maryam’s usage of words “regrettable”. “She [Maryam] says it is our water and we will make a canal. What does it mean?” asked Qamar, adding that “the River Indus water is for all the people” living in the country. “If you do not want to act on our advice, then it’s okay, but we (PPP) are being taunted for providing support to this government, which we are doing in the national interest,” he said. “It is becoming difficult for us to sit on the treasury benches,” he said amid sloganeering by some of the opposition PTI members. “The way things are moving, we will soon be there [opposition benches],” Qamar said while addressing the PTI lawmakers. Subsequently, Law Minister Tarar, in a bid to diffuse the tension, offered an “apology” for Maryam’s remarks. He insisted that differences between the PML-N and the PPP were internal matters and expressed the hope that their alliance would remain intact. This led to a meeting between PPP and PML-N bigwigs in Islamabad on Oct 1, where the former asked Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights and Sindh’s ruling party. Maryam doubles down Unfazed by apparent cracks in the ruling alliance, Maryam — who at this point was appearing on television screens daily — asserted on October 3 that she would “never apologise” for her remarks. “I am not going to leave my people alone,” Maryam said. “If you talk, I’ll respond befittingly […] Think 100 times over before talking negatively about Punjab.” During this time, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also allegedly discussed the situation between the two parties with his elder brother and Maryam’s father, Nawaz Sharif, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers. “The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government, bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn . Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar stated in the National Assembly that differences between the PPP and the PML-N would be resolved within a few days, while also adding that verbal attacks from both sides should stop. PPP walks out of Parliament again as president gets involved Parliamentary proceedings were once again affected on October 6 as both houses of Parliament were adjo­urned without any agenda items being taken up following walkouts by PPP lawmakers. During the Senate session, PPP’s Sherry Rehman, without naming the Punjab chief minister, expressed her concerns over the “divisive rhetoric emerging from Punjab towards Sindh”. “The ongoing war of words between Punjab and Sindh is obviously affecting the unity and the coalition,” she said. However, she said, it became difficult “when someone crosses the red line and plays the Punjab card”. “A coalition cannot be run by insulting others,” she said. The same day, President Asif Ali Zardari called Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Karachi for an urgent meeting regarding the escalating row. “President Zardari spoke to Interior Minister Naqvi over the phone to discuss the recent tensions between the Sindh and Punjab governments. The president has called the interior minister to Karachi for an urgent meeting in this regard,” the presidency said on X. PPP escalates, Maryam deflects On Tuesday, it appeared that the involvement of others had borne fruit as there appeared to be a slight shift in tone from both sides. While the PPP stepped up its criticism of the Punjab government, Maryam avoided direct broadsides against the PPP, instead shifting her focus to their common foe, the PTI. PPP’s Sherry Rehman warned the coalition ally of difficulties in the Senate without the former’s “clear support”. “If you don’t need [us] then that’s your choice, but let me remind you we are the biggest party in the Senate and it will become very difficult for you without the PPP’s clear support,“ she said. On the other hand, Maryam was more guarded in her remarks. However, she did allude to the ongoing rift, saying: “I am also cleaning the minds of those who are jealous of Punjab’s development. I am the chief minister of this province. If I don’t speak for Punjab, who will?” Friends again? As of now, reconciliation does not appear to be on the horizon, even though efforts may be underway to secure a truce. An insider has told Dawn that Interior Minister Naqvi could ask the relevant quarters to intervene and get the warring sides to stand down. According to him, the PPP’s grouse in Punjab is not limited to the flood issue. “The flood and canal issues have increased the already existing distrust between the two parties on this matter,” the source said.

      "title": "Why are PPP and PML-N currently feuding?",
      "summary": "What started as a difference in opinion over how to aid flood-affected people has now spiralled into a full-blown feud between the PML-N and the PPP, the two main partners in the ruling coalition. The spat, termed a ghar ka mamla by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Sept 30, has devolved into a public spectacle threatening the alliance between the two parties. The bad blood has escalated to the point that leaders from both sides hold daily press conferences to take potshots at the other side. And now, President Asif Ali Zardari appears to be making overtures to smooth over the situation. But how did the whole thing begin? Here’s what we know. How to help flood victims? It appears that differences developed between the PML-N and the PPP last month as the two bickered on how to help flood victims. Several PPP leaders, including Sherry Rehman , called for the utilisation of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) to aid flood victims in Punjab, while the provincial government insisted it would use its own resources to do so. BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women. During this time, PML-N lea­der Rana Sanaullah also called for a complete overhaul of the BISP. He also stated that the BISP could not be continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be completely revamped. In response to Sanaullah’s comments, PPP leader Humayun Khan criticised the PML-N’s approach, stressing that “this is not the time for political point-scoring. It is a time for solidarity and action.“ Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari then took a jibe at the PPP-led Sindh government over its insistence on the BISP, refusing to take advice from “those who turned Sindh into archaeological ruins”. At one point, PPP’s Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, the first lady and an MNA, also joined the discourse and said that the BISP was the “most effective way” to distribute aid to flood-affected people, adding that it would be “irresponsible to not utilise it”. On September 25, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asserted that the BISP was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the floods in the country, while PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz — who is also the Punjab chief minister — accused his party of “politicising” the issue. “The PPP is our ally and I respect them, but unfortunately, they have been politicising the floods in Punjab,” the Punjab CM said. “I don’t know their agenda, but I want to tell [President] Asif Zardari and [PPP Chairman] Bilawal … please help your party’s spokesperson understand that if, Gob forbid, there is a disaster in Sindh, Punjab would stand with it.” CM Punjab went on to question the efficiency of BISP, calling it a “very simplistic solution” to an otherwise complicated problem. “What will people who have lost their homes, cattle, and crops do with just Rs10,000?” ‘My water, my money’ However, tensions finally boiled over when, on September 29, Maryam resurrected the issue of the Cholistan canals project . The Cholistan water project has been a bone of contention between the Sindh and Punjab governments ever since the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) gave its nod on Jan 17, 2024 on the issuance of a water availability certificate for the controversial project. Cholistan canal — also known as Cholistan Flood Feeder in papers — aims to develop a new command area, though in a phased manner, in southern Punjab, depending on flows from the Sutlej River, besides flood supplies. Sutlej flows, according to Sindh’s position, depend on surplus releases from India ever since it was surrendered to India under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960. In April, the government had announced that it was halting the contentious canals project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the Council of Common Interests (CCI). In her fiery speech , Maryam had said, “If Punjab wants to construct canals for its water, why are you bothered? It is Punjab’s water. It belongs to the people, farmers and fields of Punjab. “If I want to create canals, why do you object to it?” she questioned. “I wouldn’t have stolen water. I would have [used] them to create waterways and developed Cholistan,” she continued. She said that India had also done something similar, adding, “So why can’t I? It is my water, my money, everything is mine.” Reiterating her argument that funds given under the BISP were insufficient for flood relief, she also rejected the PPP’s proposition to seek international assistance to help people affected by recent floods in Punjab. “Keep your advice to yourself,” she rebuked. “Punjab never interferes in your matters, so you don’t interfere in Punjab’s matters,” she said. PPP takes offence, walks out of Parliament The next day, PPP’s Naveed Qamar stood up in the National Assembly to record his party’s protest against Maryam’s speech and summarily walked out of the lower house of Parliament. The PPP also stayed away from the Senate session held the same day. In his speech, PPP’s Qamar termed Maryam’s usage of words “regrettable”. “She [Maryam] says it is our water and we will make a canal. What does it mean?” asked Qamar, adding that “the River Indus water is for all the people” living in the country. “If you do not want to act on our advice, then it’s okay, but we (PPP) are being taunted for providing support to this government, which we are doing in the national interest,” he said. “It is becoming difficult for us to sit on the treasury benches,” he said amid sloganeering by some of the opposition PTI members. “The way things are moving, we will soon be there [opposition benches],” Qamar said while addressing the PTI lawmakers. Subsequently, Law Minister Tarar, in a bid to diffuse the tension, offered an “apology” for Maryam’s remarks. He insisted that differences between the PML-N and the PPP were internal matters and expressed the hope that their alliance would remain intact. This led to a meeting between PPP and PML-N bigwigs in Islamabad on Oct 1, where the former asked Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights and Sindh’s ruling party. Maryam doubles down Unfazed by apparent cracks in the ruling alliance, Maryam — who at this point was appearing on television screens daily — asserted on October 3 that she would “never apologise” for her remarks. “I am not going to leave my people alone,” Maryam said. “If you talk, I’ll respond befittingly […] Think 100 times over before talking negatively about Punjab.” During this time, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also allegedly discussed the situation between the two parties with his elder brother and Maryam’s father, Nawaz Sharif, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers. “The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government, bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn . Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar stated in the National Assembly that differences between the PPP and the PML-N would be resolved within a few days, while also adding that verbal attacks from both sides should stop. PPP walks out of Parliament again as president gets involved Parliamentary proceedings were once again affected on October 6 as both houses of Parliament were adjo­urned without any agenda items being taken up following walkouts by PPP lawmakers. During the Senate session, PPP’s Sherry Rehman, without naming the Punjab chief minister, expressed her concerns over the “divisive rhetoric emerging from Punjab towards Sindh”. “The ongoing war of words between Punjab and Sindh is obviously affecting the unity and the coalition,” she said. However, she said, it became difficult “when someone crosses the red line and plays the Punjab card”. “A coalition cannot be run by insulting others,” she said. The same day, President Asif Ali Zardari called Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Karachi for an urgent meeting regarding the escalating row. “President Zardari spoke to Interior Minister Naqvi over the phone to discuss the recent tensions between the Sindh and Punjab governments. The president has called the interior minister to Karachi for an urgent meeting in this regard,” the presidency said on X. PPP escalates, Maryam deflects On Tuesday, it appeared that the involvement of others had borne fruit as there appeared to be a slight shift in tone from both sides. While the PPP stepped up its criticism of the Punjab government, Maryam avoided direct broadsides against the PPP, instead shifting her focus to their common foe, the PTI. PPP’s Sherry Rehman warned the coalition ally of difficulties in the Senate without the former’s “clear support”. “If you don’t need [us] then that’s your choice, but let me remind you we are the biggest party in the Senate and it will become very difficult for you without the PPP’s clear support,“ she said. On the other hand, Maryam was more guarded in her remarks. However, she did allude to the ongoing rift, saying: “I am also cleaning the minds of those who are jealous of Punjab’s development. I am the chief minister of this province. If I don’t speak for Punjab, who will?” Friends again? As of now, reconciliation does not appear to be on the horizon, even though efforts may be underway to secure a truce. An insider has told Dawn that Interior Minister Naqvi could ask the relevant quarters to intervene and get the warring sides to stand down. According to him, the PPP’s grouse in Punjab is not limited to the flood issue. “The flood and canal issues have increased the already existing distrust between the two parties on this matter,” the source said.

      "summary_orig": "A local journalist, Tufail Rind, was shot dead by unidentified armed men in the Mirpur Mathelo area of Sindh’s Ghotki district on Wednesday morning, according to the police. The attack took place when he was on his way to drop his children off at school. According to a police press release, the shooting occurred on the Jerwar Road near Maso Wah, where the assailants riding a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire at his car. “Rind died on the spot, while his children miraculously escaped unharmed,” the police said. Witnesses added that the attackers fled the scene after the assault, spreading panic across the area. The police later transported the body to the District Headquarters Hospital of Mirpur Mathelo for medico-legal formalities. The police statement said that upon receiving the information, Ghotki’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anwar Khetran immediately reached the crime scene, inspected the site, and met with the victim’s family, issuing “strict orders to the concerned officers for prompt action”. “The SSP Ghotki assured the victim’s family that all individuals involved in the murder would be arrested soon and brought to justice,” the statement added. The police said that multiple angles are being investigated and evidence is being collected to determine the motive behind the attack. According to a relative of the victim, Rind was associated with Mehran Newspaper and Royal News , and also served as an office-bearer of the Mirpur Mathelo Press Club. He had survived an earlier assassination attempt in which he had requested security from the local administration, but no effective measures were taken. SSP Khetran confirmed in a statement that Rind had complained a few months ago about an incident of gunfire at his home, saying that police had made arrests at that time. “We also arrested one person in connection with that on Oct. 4 (Saturday),” he added. “Rind was in contact with us and appreciated that the arrests were made.” A few hours after the murder, another tragedy struck when Rind’s eight-year-old niece fainted upon hearing the news of the killing. She was rushed to Mirpur Mathelo Hospital and later referred to Sukkur due to her critical condition, but died on the way. Her body was handed over to the family after medico-legal procedures. Suspects arrested Ghotki’s SSP Khetran has said that two suspects have already been arrested in connection with Rind’s murder. “The slain journalist had a dispute with members of his own community for the past four years, during which two people had previously been killed,” said SSP Khetran. He said that individuals from both sides of the rival groups were already in jail, and that this was the third murder linked to the same dispute. “All those involved in the murder of journalist Tufail Rind will be arrested,” the SSP added. Sindh’s Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and sought an urgent report from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon. In his statement, the chief minister said, “Attacks on journalists are attacks on press freedom, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.” Murad directed the police to conduct an impartial investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest. He also expressed condolences to the victim’s family and assured them that justice would be ensured. Locals in Ghotki and Mirpur Mathelo described Rind as a courageous journalist who always stood for the downtrodden. His funeral was attended by a large number of citizens, journalists, and political leaders. Condemnations pour in Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also condemned the killing, calling it a “tragic and deplorable incident”. He said the Sindh government stood with the bereaved family, adding, “Such attacks are equivalent to assaults on freedom of expression.“ Deputy Parliamentary Leader of Sindh Assembly and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) Pakistan’s representative, Taha Ahmed Khan, strongly condemned the “brutal murder”. In a statement, Khan said that MQM Pakistan stood in solidarity with Rind’s family as well as with the journalist community during this difficult time. Sindh Government Spokesperson and Mayor of Sukkur, Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh, expressed sorrow and regret over the incident, calling it highly condemnable. “Attacks on journalists are actually tantamount to attacks on freedom of expression, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Mayor Sukkur said in a statement. Journalist, press associations demand justice Rind’s murder sparked widespread grief and anger across the journalist community in Pakistan. Journalists across Sindh staged protests, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits and the introduction of effective laws to protect journalists. The protests included a sit-in observed in front of the SSP’s office. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Karachi Press Club, Hyderabad Union of Journalists, Umerkot Press Club, Ghotki Press Club, and Mirpur Mathelo Press Club jointly condemned the killing, saying, “Another voice has been silenced — punished for speaking the truth.” They urged the Sindh government to provide financial and legal assistance to Rind’s family and to formulate a clear security policy for journalists to prevent further bloodshed. PFUJ’s Vice President Akbar Jafri said in a statement that the incidents of attacks, threats, kidnappings and brutal killings of journalists across the country were “clear evidence of the complete failure and indifference of the government and administration”. He said that Rind’s murder was “proof that there is no effective policy for the protection of journalists across the country, including Sindh.” Jafri pointed out that Rind had appealed on social media a few days ago regarding the threat to his life, but the government and administration ignored this appeal, which “resulted in the loss of another precious life”. “The journalistic community is united and will continue to struggle for its rights and protection, because remaining silent now will be tantamount to waiting for more sacrifices,” he said. Journalist Mazhar Abbas also posted on X, saying that the killing of journalists was “on rise again in Sindh”. “Following Imtiaz Mir’s murder , another journalist Tufail Rind, has been killed within two weeks,” Abbas said. “Rind’s alleged killer has also shared his confessional statement’s video. This is quite alarming.” Last month, anchorperson Imtiaz Mir was shot and wounded in Karachi’s Malir area, succumbing to his injuries few days later, according to his family and police. Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation . Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists. According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”. In August last year, unknown armed men shot dead another Ghotki journalist, Muhammad Bachal Ghuniyo, who was associated with a private Sindhi TV channel. Another Ghotki journalist, Nasrullah Gadani, who worked for a Sindhi newspaper, was shot at and seriously wounded in an attack in May 2024.

      "summary_en": "A local journalist, Tufail Rind, was shot dead by unidentified armed men in the Mirpur Mathelo area of Sindh’s Ghotki district on Wednesday morning, according to the police. The attack took place when he was on his way to drop his children off at school. According to a police press release, the shooting occurred on the Jerwar Road near Maso Wah, where the assailants riding a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire at his car. “Rind died on the spot, while his children miraculously escaped unharmed,” the police said. Witnesses added that the attackers fled the scene after the assault, spreading panic across the area. The police later transported the body to the District Headquarters Hospital of Mirpur Mathelo for medico-legal formalities. The police statement said that upon receiving the information, Ghotki’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anwar Khetran immediately reached the crime scene, inspected the site, and met with the victim’s family, issuing “strict orders to the concerned officers for prompt action”. “The SSP Ghotki assured the victim’s family that all individuals involved in the murder would be arrested soon and brought to justice,” the statement added. The police said that multiple angles are being investigated and evidence is being collected to determine the motive behind the attack. According to a relative of the victim, Rind was associated with Mehran Newspaper and Royal News , and also served as an office-bearer of the Mirpur Mathelo Press Club. He had survived an earlier assassination attempt in which he had requested security from the local administration, but no effective measures were taken. SSP Khetran confirmed in a statement that Rind had complained a few months ago about an incident of gunfire at his home, saying that police had made arrests at that time. “We also arrested one person in connection with that on Oct. 4 (Saturday),” he added. “Rind was in contact with us and appreciated that the arrests were made.” A few hours after the murder, another tragedy struck when Rind’s eight-year-old niece fainted upon hearing the news of the killing. She was rushed to Mirpur Mathelo Hospital and later referred to Sukkur due to her critical condition, but died on the way. Her body was handed over to the family after medico-legal procedures. Suspects arrested Ghotki’s SSP Khetran has said that two suspects have already been arrested in connection with Rind’s murder. “The slain journalist had a dispute with members of his own community for the past four years, during which two people had previously been killed,” said SSP Khetran. He said that individuals from both sides of the rival groups were already in jail, and that this was the third murder linked to the same dispute. “All those involved in the murder of journalist Tufail Rind will be arrested,” the SSP added. Sindh’s Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and sought an urgent report from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon. In his statement, the chief minister said, “Attacks on journalists are attacks on press freedom, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.” Murad directed the police to conduct an impartial investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest. He also expressed condolences to the victim’s family and assured them that justice would be ensured. Locals in Ghotki and Mirpur Mathelo described Rind as a courageous journalist who always stood for the downtrodden. His funeral was attended by a large number of citizens, journalists, and political leaders. Condemnations pour in Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also condemned the killing, calling it a “tragic and deplorable incident”. He said the Sindh government stood with the bereaved family, adding, “Such attacks are equivalent to assaults on freedom of expression.“ Deputy Parliamentary Leader of Sindh Assembly and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) Pakistan’s representative, Taha Ahmed Khan, strongly condemned the “brutal murder”. In a statement, Khan said that MQM Pakistan stood in solidarity with Rind’s family as well as with the journalist community during this difficult time. Sindh Government Spokesperson and Mayor of Sukkur, Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh, expressed sorrow and regret over the incident, calling it highly condemnable. “Attacks on journalists are actually tantamount to attacks on freedom of expression, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Mayor Sukkur said in a statement. Journalist, press associations demand justice Rind’s murder sparked widespread grief and anger across the journalist community in Pakistan. Journalists across Sindh staged protests, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits and the introduction of effective laws to protect journalists. The protests included a sit-in observed in front of the SSP’s office. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Karachi Press Club, Hyderabad Union of Journalists, Umerkot Press Club, Ghotki Press Club, and Mirpur Mathelo Press Club jointly condemned the killing, saying, “Another voice has been silenced — punished for speaking the truth.” They urged the Sindh government to provide financial and legal assistance to Rind’s family and to formulate a clear security policy for journalists to prevent further bloodshed. PFUJ’s Vice President Akbar Jafri said in a statement that the incidents of attacks, threats, kidnappings and brutal killings of journalists across the country were “clear evidence of the complete failure and indifference of the government and administration”. He said that Rind’s murder was “proof that there is no effective policy for the protection of journalists across the country, including Sindh.” Jafri pointed out that Rind had appealed on social media a few days ago regarding the threat to his life, but the government and administration ignored this appeal, which “resulted in the loss of another precious life”. “The journalistic community is united and will continue to struggle for its rights and protection, because remaining silent now will be tantamount to waiting for more sacrifices,” he said. Journalist Mazhar Abbas also posted on X, saying that the killing of journalists was “on rise again in Sindh”. “Following Imtiaz Mir’s murder , another journalist Tufail Rind, has been killed within two weeks,” Abbas said. “Rind’s alleged killer has also shared his confessional statement’s video. This is quite alarming.” Last month, anchorperson Imtiaz Mir was shot and wounded in Karachi’s Malir area, succumbing to his injuries few days later, according to his family and police. Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation . Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists. According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.

More than 10,000 PTI supporters surged into the city on Nov 26 last year, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. As the demonstrators inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk, the police and security troops employed intense teargas shelling to disperse them. Aleema was to be indicted in the November 26 protest case registered at Sadiqabad Police Station during today’s hearing, but she did not appear before the court. During the hearing, the prosecutor objected that the person applying on Aleema’s behalf was not her lawyer, and therefore was not authorised to file an application without a power of attorney. On this basis, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah dismissed Aleema’s application for exemption and issued bailable arrest warrants for her. The other 10 suspects in the case appeared in court, while the hearing was adjourned until October 11 (Saturday). Early in September, the Rawalpindi police booked Aleema, party lawyer Naeem Panjutha and 40 other PTI-linked activists for alleged violence against a journalist outside Adiala Jail. In October last year, Aleema, her sister Uzma, and other PTI supporters were arrested from Islamabad’s D-Chowk for clashing with the police and violating Section 144,  a legal provision that restricts gatherings of four or more people in an area to prevent public disorder or unrest. A few days later, they were released from the Jhelum District Jail after a judge granted them bail.",

      "summary_orig": "Visa issues surrounding Afghanistan’s football team being able to play in Pakistan have been sorted out, allowing the team to travel to Islamabad for Thursday’s AFC Asian Cup qualifier at the Jinnah Stadium, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Pakistan Football Federation president Mohsen Gilani said that its Afghanistan counterpart had failed to ensure the presence of its full travelling squad at the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul for biometric verification, as most of the players were not living in the country. The Afghanistan Football Federation was quoted by the Afghan Voice Agency as stating that it had sent the initial list of team members to the Pakistan Embassy on September 18, but “despite repeated follow-ups and official contacts, visas have not been issued to the players and officials”. Today, Minister Naqvi took to X to announce the issue had been sorted out. “Issued now,” he said in response to journalist Faizan Lakhani’s post saying the minister has ordered to sort out the visa issue of the Afghanistan football team. “Thank you for highlighting it,” Naqvi added. Uncertainty surrounded the qualifier due to the latter failing to secure visas for its players earlier. Reports from Afghanistan said that all of its national team players had gathered in Dubai on Tuesday evening, and they were awaiting visa clearance. Both Pakistan and Afghanistan are pointless after losing their opening two matches in Group ‘E’ against Syria and Myanmar.  The two sides have a double-header in this international window, with Afghanistan to host Pakistan in Al Ardiya, Kuwait, for the return game on October 14. The winner of the group advances to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup in Saudi Arabia.",

      "summary_orig": "SHIKARPUR: Four bog­ies of the Jaffar Expr­ess derailed following an explosion on the track near the town of Huma­yoon, in the Shikarpur district, injuring seven passengers on Tuesday morning. Railways Minister Ha­nif Abbasi alleged foreign involvement, stating that India was behind the repeated attacks on the Jaffar Express. He affir­med that railway operations would continue desp­ite the incident. The train was en route from Peshawar to Quetta when the blast occurred at around 8:15am, said Shik­a­rpur Deputy Commis­sioner Shakeel Ahmed Abro while speaking to the media on the scene soon after the incident. He said there were no fatalities, and the seven injured passengers were promptly transported to Shikarpur Civil Hospital. The injured included Muh­ammad Shafique, son of Abdul Azziz, a railway official, Muhammad You­nis, Hawaldar Javed, constable Abdul Rahman, con­­­s­table Azhar Jameel, besides two unidentified passengers. Four of the more seriously injured were later shifted to the military hospital for further treatment. Later, the deputy commissioner made it clear that all seven injured were in stable condition and that arrangements were being made to safely transport all remaining passengers to their destinations. He also confirmed that repair work on the damaged track was currently underway. Tuesday’s blast is reportedly the seventh attack on Jaffar Express so far this year, starting with the deadliest episode in March, when terrorists killed 21 passengers after hijacking the train. Since then, the train has been attacked at least six times. Talking to Dawn , Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi blamed India for the repeated attacks on Jaffar Express. However, he declared that the train’s operation to and from Balochistan would continue despite such cowardly attacks “The terrorists targeting Jaffar Express again and again are, in fact, proxies of India that is not ready to digest and bear its defeat it faced during operation Bunyan Al Marsoos ,” he said. “These incidents are cowardly act of India that is still feeling the pain of wounds it received during the May war,” he added. In response to a question, Mr Abbasi said this time the terrorists selected the railway track near Shikarpur (Sindh). He said such cowardly attacks could not stop Pakistan Railways to cease the operations of Jaffar Express. “The train will continue operating as per routine, as we will never afraid of such attacks,” he said, adding that the security of the track and train would be tightened further. He praised “brave drivers, guards and other crew members who continue to perform duties in this train despite such horrible incidents. I also salute our brave passengers who continue to travel by this train, giving a message to the coward terrorists that Pakistani people are a brave and great nation that would never surrender before such proxies. I also salute our armed forces that are endeavoring to eliminate such terrorists for the protection of citizens of Pakistan”. Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah condemned the incident and sought an inquiry report from the police chief. He directed the Larkana commissioner to provide best medical assistance to the injured passengers. Later, Sindh lawmaker Imtiaz Sheikh, along with DC Abro, visited Civil Hospital to inquire after the condition of the injured passengers, including Muhammad Younis and Muhammad Shafique. Khalid Hasnain in Lahore also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, October 8th, 2025",
