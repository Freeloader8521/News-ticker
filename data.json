      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The upper house of Parliament on Friday unanimously adopted a resolution that condemned the unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban, and demanded that the neighbouring country immediately cease all hostile actions and prevent the use of its soil for terrorism or aggression against Pakistan The House, through the resolution moved by PPP Parliamentary Leader Sherry Rehman, condemned the recent unprovoked aggression and hostile cross-border actions from Afghanistan, describing them as blatant violations of international law, established diplomatic norms, and the principles of peaceful neighbourly relations. The Senate declared that any attempt to challenge the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or national security of Pakistan constituted a direct affront to the dignity of the nation and would be met with a firm, proportionate, and decisive response. “For over forty years, Pakistan has borne extraordinary economic, social, and security burdens in hosting millions of Afghan nationals, extending humanitarian assistance, facilitating peace efforts, and consistently advocating for Afghanistan’s stability in international forums often at immense cost to its own national development and internal security,” it said. It expressed deep disappointment that instead of reciprocal goodwill, Pakistan continued to face hostile rhetoric, cross-border violations, and the persistent presence of anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil, reflecting a troubling pattern of ingratitude and disregard for bilateral understandings. “While Pakistan remains committed to constructive engagement, regional peace, and mutually respectful relations, its patience must not be misconstrued as weakness, nor its desire for stability mistaken for inability to respond decisively,” the resolution said. It demanded that the Afghan Taliban regime immediately cease all hostile actions, prevent the use of Afghan soil for terrorism or aggression against Pakistan, and honour their international obligations and commitments to peaceful coexistence. The Senate also called upon the international community to take serious note of these developments and to urge the Afghan Taliban regime to adhere to international norms and prevent further destabilisation of the region. Speaking in the Senate, Rehman said that Pakistan had exercised maximum restraint and upheld all diplomatic avenues, but recent hostile actions from Afghan soil had compelled the state to respond within the framework of the international law. “The agreements that the Afghan Taliban signed in Doha have now been forgotten. Everyone can see the level of adherence to the commitments made in the presence of important stakeholders,” she remarked. She emphasised that “Pakistan did not close the door on diplomacy at any stage, but was forced to respond”. “Under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, every country has the right to defend itself,” she said. “A fundamental question before Afghanistan is whether it accepts responsibility for its own territory or not.” She strongly rejected the mischaracterisation of Pakistan’s defensive measures. Meanwhile, PTI Parliamentary Leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said, “Pakistan always comes first and that the entire Pakistani nation stands united against terrorism.” He further stated: “In case of aggression, the nation has both the right and the resolve to respond decisively in defence of its sovereignty.” Senator Zafar said that since the birth of Pakistan, two countries — India and Israel had tried to damage it. “These two nations came together and decided a long time ago that they would use Afghanistan’s soil to destabilise Pakistan,” he said. “Today, two well-known criminals of the world, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have again gotten together,” he said. “One is committing genocide in Gaza while the other is committing genocide in occupied Kashmir. Both have declared that they will use Afghan soil for their nefarious designs against Pakistan,” he stated. “If any country commits terrorism on Pakistani soil, then it deserves full and mighty retaliation. No aggressor can be spared,” he said. He said the Senate should use its collective wisdom and go beyond merely passing resolutions and propose practical regional long-term solutions. “This is the Senate’s real job,” he added. Senator Zafar also suggested establishing a permanent regional body, comprising neighbouring and regional stakeholder states, like China, to ensure compliance with a collective security framework addressing terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Such a mechanism, he said, would facilitate coordinated regional action, intelligence sharing, and monitoring of counter-terrorism commitments to effectively address cross-border security threats. He also cited Article 4, which guarantees protection of law and due process, and Article 9, which protects the right to life and liberty. Speaking on PTI founder’s health, Senator Zafar said, “The life, health, safety and release of former premier Imran are matters of paramount importance for the entire nation. “The issues affecting Imran’s health directly relate to his right to life,” he said. Senator Zafar emphasised that it was the state’s constitutional obligation to ensure the proper medical treatment and well-being of a former prime minister. Addressing Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah’s calls for political dialogue, Senator Zafar said that meaningful dialogue required the government to fulfil its constitutional obligations first by allowing the PTI founder’s trusted doctors and legal representatives to be involved in his medical treatment. “If the government maintains that proper treatment was already being provided, there should be no objection to permitting independent doctors chosen by Imran to participate in the process, particularly at a time when national unity is essential,” he said. What is wrong with this request?” he asked. Zafar stressed that adherence to constitutional principles, protection of fundamental rights, and national unity were essential for effectively confronting terrorism and safeguarding Pakistan’s future.",

      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Friday that the Afghan Taliban had to choose between standing with Pakistan or with terrorist organisations. “I want to make one thing clear: the oppressive Afghan Taliban regime has to make a clear choice. The choice is to choose between Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Baloch Liberation Army, Daesh, Al Qaeda, the terrorists and terrorist organisations and Pakistan,” he said while giving a briefing on security forces’ response to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban on Thursday. “They have to make this choice. It has been made clear by the government of Pakistan. It is not something new I am saying … They have to make this choice. Whether they choose terrorists and terrorism or Pakistan. We are clear … Let it be known that our choice is absolutely clear. It will always be Pakistan over everything,” he said. “The Pakistan Army and the people of Pakistan have never hesitated in making any sacrifice for this choice and they never will,” he asserted. At the outset of the briefing, the DG ISPR gave a breakdown of the security forces’ response. “The Afghan Taliban regime, which is the master proxy of all these terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan … that master proxy … came into action last night … along with the terrorists of Fitna al Khawarij ,” he said. Fitna al Khawarij is a term that the state used for banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The DG ISPR said that Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij opened fire and carried out physical raids on 53 locations along the Pak-Afghan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “This aggression was done by this master proxy in coordination, in collusion and in support of a terrorist organisation. That’s what happened last night,” he said. Talking about Pakistan’s response to the aggression, he said: “We were ready.” He said that Pakistan’s armed forces responded “immediately and effectively”, adding that the attack was repulsed at all 53 locations. “They came with armed quadcopters [and] big and small weapons. We shot down their quadcopters and silenced their weapons,” he said. He added that not only were the attacks effectively repulsed, but Pakistan, exercising self-defence, responded and gave a “befitting reply”. Giving details of Operation Ghazab lil-Haq — which was launched in response to the attacks by Afghan Taliban — he said so far 274 Taliban regime personnel and khawarij had been killed and more than 400 were injured. “Seventy-three posts of the Afghan Taliban along the Pak-Afghan border have been totally destroyed. Eighteen posts have been captured,” he said. As per conservative estimates, 115 tanks, armoured vehicles, and artillery pieces of the Afghan Taliban forces had been destroyed, he said. He further said that the headquarters and military installations — which were providing support to terrorist organisations and helped them plan — were targeted and hit. In these airstrikes, 22 locations in Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia, Nangarhar, Khost, and Paktika were targeted, he said. “All these targets were very carefully selected based on intelligence. They are military targets, and great care was exercised so that there is no civilian collateral damage,” he asserted. He said that these targets included corps headquarters, brigade headquarters, battalion headquarters, sector headquarters, ammunition depots, logistics bases, and places providing shelter to terrorists and their supporters. He further said that at several places, the “cowardly Afghan Taliban forces and the khawarij with them” not only fled but also abandoned the dead bodies of their accomplices, which had been “secured” in accordance with the Geneva protocols. He said that 12 Pakistan Army soldiers had been martyred, while 27 were injured and one soldier was missing in action. He then played several video clips of the action undertaken against the Afghan Taliban. He further stated that Afghan media and their proxies were floating lies on social media regarding the targeting of civilians. “At no place was any civilian infrastructure targeted. These are all military targets. These are all the infrastructure from where Pakistan was attacked,” he asserted. He also played a clip showing Pakistan Army soldiers taking down the Afghan flag and hoisting Pakistan’s flag at a checkpost along the Pak-Afghan border. “The nation is proud of these soldiers who have rendered their lives, their sweat and their blood for the protection of the land and the honour of the people of Pakistan,” he said. “Whether on ground or in the air, the armed forces of Pakistan gave an effective, immediate and brutal response; a well-deserved response to the terrorists and their facilitators,” he said. He went on to say that the Afghan Taliban were threatening that they would respond to Pakistan. “We saw that they also tried to use some rudimentary sort of drones for attacking Sibi, Abbottabad and Nowshera. However, the anti-drone system over there and the effective deployment took them out,” he said. He added that this “again showed” how Afghan Taliban had become a “master proxy”. “It is difficult to distinguish where the Taliban regime ends and where the terrorism starts. The lines have blurred. Therefore, it is necessary to make it clear that if anyone tries to carry out any terrorist activity in Pakistan … its response will be given to terrorists, their guardians, and those who protect them. No place will be safe for them as we also have equal rights,” he said.",

He said that 12 Pakistan Army soldiers had been martyred, while 27 were injured and one soldier was missing in action. He then played several video clips of the action undertaken against the Afghan Taliban. He further stated that Afghan media and their proxies were floating lies on social media regarding the targeting of civilians. “At no place was any civilian infrastructure targeted. These are all military targets. These are all the infrastructure from where Pakistan was attacked,” he asserted. He also played a clip showing Pakistan Army soldiers taking down the Afghan flag and hoisting Pakistan’s flag at a checkpost along the Pak-Afghan border. “The nation is proud of these soldiers who have rendered their lives, their sweat and their blood for the protection of the land and the honour of the people of Pakistan,” he said. “Whether on ground or in the air, the armed forces of Pakistan gave an effective, immediate and brutal response; a well-deserved response to the terrorists and their facilitators,” he said. He went on to say that the Afghan Taliban were threatening that they would respond to Pakistan. “We saw that they also tried to use some rudimentary sort of drones for attacking Sibi, Abbottabad and Nowshera. However, the anti-drone system over there and the effective deployment took them out,” he said. He added that this “again showed” how Afghan Taliban had become a “master proxy”. “It is difficult to distinguish where the Taliban regime ends and where the terrorism starts. The lines have blurred. Therefore, it is necessary to make it clear that if anyone tries to carry out any terrorist activity in Pakistan … its response will be given to terrorists, their guardians, and those who protect them. No place will be safe for them as we also have equal rights,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "Multiple Indian and Afghan users on social media platform X shared visuals on February 27, claiming that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet amid the current conflict between the two countries. However, the visuals are doctored. The iVerify Pakistan team investigated this content and determined that it is false. To reach this conclusion, iVerify Pakistan analysed the visuals for discrepancies, verified aircraft serial records and ran the content through multiple AI-detection tools. Multiple Indian and Afghan users on social media platform X shared visuals on February 27, claiming that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet amid the current conflict between the two countries. However, the visuals are doctored. Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban, after the neighbouring country opened fire on multiple locations across the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on February 26. Authorities in Kabul had called it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend. On Feb 27, a pro-Afghan account shared an alleged video showing a downed Pakistani F-16 engulfed in flames on X with the following caption: “Big breaking news. This is a Pakistani military F-16, American-made, that Afghan defensive forces have shot down.” The post gained 773,700 views. The video with similar claims was subsequently shared by other propaganda — both pro-Afghan and pro-Indian — accounts, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . These accounts also shared still images of the alleged fighter jet. A pro-Afghan account shared the image with the following caption: “Security sources reported that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani jet that had entered Afghan territory. Security sources have confirmed this news to several media outlets.” That post gained 257,600 views. Other shares can be seen here , here , here and here . Another video of the same downed F-16 aircraft was also shared on X with the following caption: “Here’s his latest video.” The post gained 80,200 views. A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the current conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan. A keyword search was conducted to corroborate whether any credible mainstream international or Pakistani media outlets had reported any such alleged downing of an F-16 jet, but yielded no results. A close analysis of the viral videos and images revealed discrepancies in the aircraft’s markings. The serial number visible on the tail of the jet in the viral video is “85510”. The same serial number is also printed on the body of the aircraft in the viral video, whereas the body of the original F-16 aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) does not contain any serial number. Additionally, the size and proportions of the aircraft appear inconsistent when compared to verified images of an F-16. Furthermore, in the viral video, a structure appears to be protruding from the tail of the aircraft and sits above the exhaust. However, upon closer inspection of actual F-16 aircraft images, this particular feature is noticeably absent, with the exhaust instead jutting out from the body. Running the video through multiple AI-detection tools flagged it as being AI-generated. Attestiv.video gave it a 61 per cent suspicion rate, while AI or Not indicated the video was 70pc AI-generated and flagged the text in the video as 100pc AI-generated. When iVerify Pakistan contacted a Pakistan Air Force officer for comment, they too identified key discrepancies about the viral F-16 aircraft video and said the exhaust appeared disproportionately large compared to genuine F-16 models. The officer also said that the tail number did not match any existing F-16 aircraft in the air force. Contacted for comment, Dawn news editor Ali Osman said the jet’s dimensions were “distorted”, adding that the burn marks on the tail fin also looked irregular. A search of aircraft records on the f-16.net database shows that the serial number “85510” belongs to a United States F-16 aircraft that crashed in Arizona in 1990. The viral circulating image was also analysed using AI-detection tools, with Fake Image Detector flagging it as computer-generated or modified. The image presents the same discrepancy of a protruding part above the jet’s exhaust, unlike what a real jet looks like. The serial number is different as well, showing “85610” instead of “85510”. The image also features a random and unexplained grey block at the top. The second video of the same alleged crash was also analysed via Attestiv.video , which returned an 83pc suspicion rate. It also presented the inconsistency of a different serial number from the first video. Moreover, the flames and smoke clouds in the video also appeared unnatural and looked inconsistent. Therefore, the fact check determined that the claim that viral visuals show a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet allegedly shot down by Afghanistan amid the current conflict between the two countries is false. The visuals are doctored, as evidenced by being flagged by AI-detection tools, and present numerous discrepancies from what an actual F-16 jet looks like. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

This is a Pakistani military F-16, American-made, that Afghan defensive forces have shot down.” The post gained 773,700 views. The video with similar claims was subsequently shared by other propaganda — both pro-Afghan and pro-Indian — accounts, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . These accounts also shared still images of the alleged fighter jet. A pro-Afghan account shared the image with the following caption: “Security sources reported that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani jet that had entered Afghan territory. Security sources have confirmed this news to several media outlets.” That post gained 257,600 views. Other shares can be seen here , here , here and here . Another video of the same downed F-16 aircraft was also shared on X with the following caption: “Here’s his latest video.” The post gained 80,200 views. A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the current conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan. A keyword search was conducted to corroborate whether any credible mainstream international or Pakistani media outlets had reported any such alleged downing of an F-16 jet, but yielded no results. A close analysis of the viral videos and images revealed discrepancies in the aircraft’s markings. The serial number visible on the tail of the jet in the viral video is “85510”. The same serial number is also printed on the body of the aircraft in the viral video, whereas the body of the original F-16 aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) does not contain any serial number. Additionally, the size and proportions of the aircraft appear inconsistent when compared to verified images of an F-16. Furthermore, in the viral video, a structure appears to be protruding from the tail of the aircraft and sits above the exhaust. However, upon closer inspection of actual F-16 aircraft images, this particular feature is noticeably absent, with the exhaust instead jutting out from the body. Running the video through multiple AI-detection tools flagged it as being AI-generated. Attestiv.video gave it a 61 per cent suspicion rate, while AI or Not indicated the video was 70pc AI-generated and flagged the text in the video as 100pc AI-generated. When iVerify Pakistan contacted a Pakistan Air Force officer for comment, they too identified key discrepancies about the viral F-16 aircraft video and said the exhaust appeared disproportionately large compared to genuine F-16 models. The officer also said that the tail number did not match any existing F-16 aircraft in the air force. Contacted for comment, Dawn news editor Ali Osman said the jet’s dimensions were “distorted”, adding that the burn marks on the tail fin also looked irregular. A search of aircraft records on the f-16.net database shows that the serial number “85510” belongs to a United States F-16 aircraft that crashed in Arizona in 1990. The viral circulating image was also analysed using AI-detection tools, with Fake Image Detector flagging it as computer-generated or modified. The image presents the same discrepancy of a protruding part above the jet’s exhaust, unlike what a real jet looks like. The serial number is different as well, showing “85610” instead of “85510”. The image also features a random and unexplained grey block at the top. The second video of the same alleged crash was also analysed via Attestiv.video , which returned an 83pc suspicion rate. It also presented the inconsistency of a different serial number from the first video. Moreover, the flames and smoke clouds in the video also appeared unnatural and looked inconsistent. Therefore, the fact check determined that the claim that viral visuals show a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet allegedly shot down by Afghanistan amid the current conflict between the two countries is false. The visuals are doctored, as evidenced by being flagged by AI-detection tools, and present numerous discrepancies from what an actual F-16 jet looks like. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran said on Friday that in order to reach a deal, the United States will have to drop its “excessive demands”, tempering the optimism expressed after talks seen as a last-ditch bid to avert war. The Oman-mediated talks follow repeated threats from US President Donald Trump to strike Iran, and with the United States conducting its biggest military build-up in the region in decades. Trump, on February 19, gave Iran 15 days to reach a deal, and while Iran has insisted the discussions focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran’s missile programme and its support for armed groups curtailed. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Trump’s negotiating team would demand that Iran dismantle its three main nuclear sites and hand over all its remaining enriched uranium to the United States. Without specifying what demands he was referring to, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Friday told his Egyptian counterpart that “success in this path requires seriousness and realism from the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands”. Following the talks in Geneva on Thursday, Araghchi told state TV that the negotiations “made very good progress and entered into the elements of an agreement very seriously, both in the nuclear field and in the sanctions field”. He said the next round would take place in “perhaps less than a week”, with technical talks at the UN’s nuclear agency to begin in Vienna on Monday. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi also announced technical discussions were to be held next week in Vienna. “We have finished the day after significant progress in the negotiation between the United States and Iran,” he said in a post on X. Araghchi, in a post on X, called the latest round of talks “the most intense so far”. “It concluded with the mutual understanding that we will continue to engage in a more detailed manner on matters that are essential to any deal — including sanctions termination and nuclear-related steps,” he wrote. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi joined the negotiations, a source close to the talks told AFP. ‘Big lies’ US President Donald Trump said in his State of the Union address that Iran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”. He also accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes. The accusations were delivered in the same forum in which then-President George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Iran is “not enriching right now, but they’re trying to get to the point where they ultimately can”, adding that Tehran “refuses” to discuss its ballistic missile programme and “that’s a big problem”. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic Republic was not “at all” seeking a nuclear weapon. US Vice President JD Vance told the Washington Post on Thursday there was “no chance” that a long-threatened strike on Iran would result “in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight”. Parallel to the talks is a dramatic US military buildup in the region, with the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week. Washington currently has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier — the USS Abraham Lincoln — nine destroyers, and three other combat ships. It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers in the region. The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed. However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000 km — less than a third of the distance to the continental United States. A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that the US briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. In January, Tehran launched a mass crackdown on nationwide protests . Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.",

      "summary_orig": "When states escalate, they are usually clear about their capacity and objectives. The Afghan Taliban, however, appeared to abandon that principle at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border last night, triggering an intense military confrontation — including airstrikes and artillery exchanges — across the Durand Line as well as deep into Afghan territory. The immediate backdrop of these tensions is not new. Islamabad has for years maintained that the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a Pakistani terrorist group affiliated with the Afghan Taliban, operated from Afghan soil because of the official patronage it enjoys there. Only hours before the latest crisis erupted, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi plainly stated that Pakistan’s quarrel was not with the Afghan people but with terrorist safe havens that threaten Pakistani lives. That was the political setting; it emphasised the need for patient engagement and discreet signalling. The Afghan Taliban, however, chose to announce what it described as “large-scale offensive operations” along multiple border towns, in a language that was both public and declaratory. A miscalculation by Kabul? There may have been reasons why the Taliban regime opted for that course. Firstly, the border remains, in the Afghan political imagination, a colonial imposition. Secondly, the Taliban leadership sought to signal that it would not acquiesce to cross-border action, especially after Islamabad’s February 22 strikes against terrorist sanctuaries on the Afghan territory, and frame the move as a defence of territorial integrity. However misplaced that logic may be, given that the initial breach of Afghan sovereignty occurred when terrorist groups were allowed sanctuary there, the public mobilisation still serves a domestic purpose as it projects resolve to constituencies that expect the regime to defend Afghan soil. Another calculation may have been that the escalation would remain contained. There is precedent. In October last year, after intense clashes , back channels and Qatari-Turkiye mediation produced a ceasefire . Though the understanding was uneasy, it worked. Kabul may have assumed that another round of tit-for-tat exchanges would similarly be cooled by intermediaries once tempers had flared. But that assumption proved risky. Pakistan responded not with ambiguity but with a named operation — “ Ghazab lil-Haq ” or “Righteous Fury” — and carried out airstrikes that reached deep into Afghan territory, including targets around Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia and Nangarhar. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif spoke in unusually blunt terms , saying patience had reached its limit and characterised the situation as open war. Pakistan’s logic was clear. Terrorism inside the country surged after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021, and even more sharply over the past year and a half. As a result, there is zero tolerance in Islamabad for threats perceived to be emanating from Afghan soil. In that context, a declared offensive by Afghan forces against Pakistani positions was unlikely to go unanswered because any perception of restraint in the face of a televised provocation would have carried both morale and political costs. Resultantly, there was a spiral which neither side could easily control. Casualty figures differ widely, with claims and counterclaims dominating the official messaging. Beyond the battlefield But far from the borders and the war zones lies the question of strategic arithmetic. The Taliban’s strengths are rooted in unconventional and guerrilla-style warfare, whereas Pakistan’s advantages lie in its conventional force structure, air power and deterrent capability. It implies that a head-on military contest would therefore never favour Kabul. That is where the Taliban appear to have misstepped; by shifting the theatre from deniable sub-conventional activity to overt interstate confrontation, they exposed themselves to costs they were ill-equipped to absorb. Yet, force alone will not settle the underlying grievance. Islamabad’s central complaint is neither territorial expansion nor ideological contest; rather, it is the presence of terrorists who strike inside Pakistan while operating from Afghan soil. The concern is not merely rhetorical. Year after year, United Nations Security Council monitoring reports have documented the continued presence and activity of the TTP in Afghanistan and described linkages between the group and the Taliban regime. The international record, therefore, is also clear. Now that the issue is terrorist sanctuaries, the remedy cannot be spectacle. It has to be structural. First, Kabul will need to address, credibly and verifiably, the question of armed groups operating from its soil; mere denials will not suffice. Secondly, regional stakeholders with access to both capitals should be re-engaged at senior levels.Qatar and Saudi Arabia facilitated de-escalation in October last year. They are trying again. Others with leverage, including China and Turkey, can play quiet roles. Russia and Iran, too, have offered their good offices. Third, both sides must reduce the temperature of public rhetoric since declarations of open war may satisfy domestic audiences but would complicate compromise, which has to ultimately happen. There is no gainsaying the fact that there are no simple exits in such scenarios. Escalation acquires its own momentum, and each strike invites a reply, narrowing the space for discretion. As a result, economies suffer, border communities absorb the shock, and terrorist groups thrive. For durable security, Islamabad must convert its battlefield advantage into diplomatic leverage rather than allow it to harden into permanent hostility. Meanwhile, this conflict must drive home to Kabul that a policy of hosting terrorist sanctuaries carries strategic costs. If that lesson is not absorbed, what is now a crisis will solidify into a recurring pattern, and hostility will become entrenched.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Pakistan’s security forces carried out a robust retaliatory response following unprovoked aggression by Afghan Taliban in the border areas of South Waziristan Lower, security sources said on Friday. According to officials, an intense exchange of fire continued throughout the night along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. However, the situation has since calmed after the firing subsided by morning. Security sources stated that the Pakistan Army responded swiftly and in a coordinated manner by targeting multiple Afghan Taliban checkposts located across the border in Afghanistan’s Paktia province. During the operation, Pakistani forces reportedly took control of five key Afghan checkposts and raised the national flag at the captured locations. Among the posts brought under control were two opposite Shawal, two facing the Angoor Adda sector, and one located opposite Zarmilan, security sources confirmed. The operation, officials said, was aimed at restoring stability in the sensitive border region and effectively countering hostile activities. Sources further revealed that Pakistani forces also destroyed an Afghan terminal in the Angoor Adda area, which was allegedly being used for military-related purposes. As a result of the strong and coordinated response by Pakistani forces, Afghan Taliban elements reportedly suffered significant losses. Security officials confirmed that the Afghan Charlie Post and Afghan Babri Post in the Angoor Adda sector were completely destroyed during the engagement. Authorities described the military response as a defensive measure intended to safeguard Pakistan’s territorial integrity and preempt any potential threats arising from cross-border hostilities. While the situation remains tense, security forces are said to be on high alert and fully prepared to respond to any further aggression. Officials added that developments in the border belt are being closely monitored to prevent escalation and maintain stability in the region. Guns fall silent in Landi Kotal With guns falling silent on the border, authorities are busy ascertaining any damage caused by last night’s artillery firing from the Afghan side. Residents in Landi Kotal said they spent a sleepless night due to the continuous noise of heavy gunfire, which caused panic among the civilians located in the area. Residents in Landi Kotal also held a demonstration against what they called the unprovoked aggression from the Afghan side, calling for an early ceasefire.",

      "summary_orig": "VISUALS broadcast by state media in the early hours of Friday show Pakistani forces destroying a Taliban position in the Kurram sector. — X / RadioPakistan and PTVNewsOfficial • Govt claims ‘heavy losses inflicted’ on Taliban units that attacked positions in Chitral, Khyber, Mohmand, Kurram and Bajaur sectors • Offensive dubbed ‘Operation Ghazab Lil Haq’; Tarar says two Pakistani soldiers martyred, three injured in line of duty • State media claims 58 Taliban fighters killed, over 100 injured in counterattacks; PAF hits targets in Afghanistan • Civilians in areas along the border injured by Afghan shelling • Those awaiting repatriation at border evacuated to safety; FO says ‘no quarrel’ with ordinary Afghans PESHAWAR: Pakistan’s sec­urity forces swung into action after Afghan Taliban fighters launched unprovoked attacks along the border between both countries under the cover of darkness, the government said on Thursday night. However, they received “an immediate and effective response” from Pakistan’s security forces, the information ministry said in a statement. The action — dubbed ‘Ope­ration Ghazab Lil Haq’ — continued into the early hours of Friday, and by state media reports suggested the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had joined the response, targeting Afghan positions, including an ammunition depot in Nangarhar province, inflicting substantial damage. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) until going to press. Authorities in Kabul had claimed launching a large-scale offensive, calling it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend. Islamabad squarely blames Kabul for allowing terrorists aligned with the outlawed TTP and so-called Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) groups to use its soil as a safe haven. Earlier, in its weekly briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Office had said that the strikes against terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan were carried out to pre-empt imminent attacks inside Pakistan, and that utmost caution was exercised to avoid civilian casualties. ‘Heavy casualties inflicted’ According to the information ministry, Pakistani forces had inflicted heavy losses on the Afghan Taliban in the Chitral, Khyber, Mohmand, Kurram and Bajaur sectors. According to security sources, Afghan Taliban fired at various places on the Pak-Afghan border. A counter-attack saw their positions destroyed, forcing the Afghan fighters to flee, they said. Giving details, sources said that Afghan positions across the border from the Chitral and Bajaur sectors were destroyed, while forces responded with full force to excursions in the Nawagai sector of Bajaur, Tirah in Khyber, Mohmand district and the Arandu sector of Chitral. VISUALS broadcast by state media in the early hours of Friday show a suspected ammunition depot in Nangarhar province, which was reportedly destroyed in a Pakistan Air Force strike.— X / RadioPakistan and PTVNewsOfficial In a late night tweet, Info­rmation Minister Attaullah Tarar said that at least 36 Afghan Taliban attackers had been killed by Pakistani forces. However, subsequent reports by state-run Pakistan Television put the toll at 58. In a post on X, PTV News said over 100 Taliban fighters had been injured, at least 12 Afghan posts had been completely destroyed, while five of their positions had been captured Mr Tarar also said that two Pakistan Army personnel had been martyred, while three were injured, in the line of duty. He accused the Taliban regime of launching attacks in Pakistan’s border regions in defence of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) outlaws, adding that Kabul’s patronage of terrorists had been laid bare for the world to see. The information minister also refuted claims by Afghan and Indian media of killing or capturing dozens of Pakistani soldiers, asserting that the Taliban regime had resorted to “propaganda and lies to cover up its embarrassment”. Ground reports According to reports from areas along the border, Afghan fighters initiated hostilities around Iftar time near Torkham and Landi Kotal. Local sources said that artillery shells were fired from the Afghan side, at least two of which fell in open areas, causing no damage to life or property. In addition, Afghan families cleared by the authorities to return to their country — who were waiting at Zero Point for their departure — had been sent back to the Landi Kotal holding center as the security situation deteriorated at the border crossing point. The Torkham border has been closed since October 12 last year due to the diplomatic row between the two countries. Afghan shelling in Bajaur’s Lowi Mamund tehsil resulted in injuries to five people, including three women. The injured were being treated at DHQ Khar. State-run Pakistan TV also carried visuals from a mosque that was damaged after being targeted by Afghan fire. Witnesses in Mohmand also reported also reported intense fighting, but there was no word on casualties from the area. An exchange of fire was also reported from Kurram and the Angoor Adda border area. No quarrel with ordinary Afghans: FO Earlier, at his weekly media briefing, FO spokesman Tahir Andrabi said that Pakistan’s actions over the weekend “were proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence”. Military officials said the operation destroyed seven terrorist targets and killed between 70 and 80 terrorists. Afghan authorities, however, had alleged civilian casualties and condemned the strikes as a violation of their sovereignty. Responding to questions about civilian harm, Mr Andrabi said the “intelligence-based selective targeting” of these seven terrorist camps and hideouts, located in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, were “primarily to ensure safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions,” he said. Addressing bilateral tensions, he said Pakistan’s dispute was not with the Afghan people. “In terms of people-to-people relations, we have nothing against the people of Afghanistan. The contentious issue is the terrorist outfits that operate in Afghanistan, and the official support and impunity being offered to that terrorism. “As regards the people of Afghanistan, we respect them, and we have traditional historic linguistic ties with them. We do not wish any harm to the Afghan people,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "GENEVA: Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip seem aimed at creating “permanent demographic change”, UN rights chief Volker Turk said on Thursday. “Taken together, Israel’s actions appear aimed at making a permanent demographic change in Gaza and the West Bank, raising concerns about ethnic cleansing”, Turk said in a speech before the UN’s Human Rights Council in Geneva. Turk pointed in particular to an ongoing, year-long Israeli military operation in the West Bank’s north that has caused the displacement of 32,000 Palestinians. Elsewhere in the West Bank, entire Bedouin herder communities have been displaced by increasing harassment and violence from Israeli settlers, including near Mikhmas to the east of Ramallah, and Ras Ein al-Auja, in the Jordan Valley, since the start of the year. In addition to roughly three million Palestinians, more than 500,000 Israelis live in settlements and outposts in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law. Far-right minister Smotrich vows to encourage ‘emigration’ from Palestinian territories Israel has approved a series of initiatives this month backed by far-right ministers, including launching a process to register land in the West Bank as “state property” and allowing Israelis to purchase land there directly, in a move condemned by several countries as well as Hamas. Israel’s current government has accelerated settlement expansion, approving a record 54 settlements in 2025, according to Israeli settlement watchdog NGO Peace Now. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. ‘Maximum land, minimum Arabs’ In the Gaza Strip, most of the territory’s 2.2 million inhabitants have been displaced at least once since the start of the conflict on October 7, 2023. “Intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the denial of humanitarian assistance appeared to aim at a permanent demographic shift in Gaza”, the UN human rights office said in a report last week. Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also vowed to encourage “emigration” from the Palestinian territories in February. “We will finally, formally and in practical terms nullify the cursed Oslo Accords and embark on a path toward sovereignty, while encouraging emigration from both Gaza and Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the Biblical term for the West Bank. “There is no other long-term solution,” added Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank. “They want maximum land and minimum Arabs”, Fathi Nimer, a researcher with Palestinian think tank Al-Shabaka, said, referring to a commonly used phrase used to describe Israeli settlement tactics.

      "summary_orig": "GENEVA/BERLIN: A new decree from Afghanistan’s Taliban government is set to further crush rights and freedoms in the war-torn nation, especially for women, UN human rights chief Volker Turk said on Thursday. The Taliban has restricted women’s movements and barred girls from education beyond primary school since coming to power in 2021, via a series of morality laws that also limit expression and employment. Turk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said a decree signed by Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada last month “defines several crimes and punishments that contravene Afghanistan’s international legal obligations”. “It provides for the use of corporal punishment for numerous offences, including in the home, legitimising violence against women and children,” he told a Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva. Germany deports 20 convicted criminals to Afghanistan “The decree, which is expected to come into effect soon, extends the number of offences that carry the death penalty.” The decree also criminalises criticism of the de facto leadership and its policies, in violation of freedom of expression and assembly, he said. Detailed provisions of the decree have not been officially published by the Taliban’s Ministry of Justice or Supreme Court, and this news agency has not been able to obtain the text from officials. Turk urged the Taliban to rescind the decree, impose a moratorium on executions and end corporal punishment, saying women and girls face persecution under a system he likened to gender apartheid. The Taliban says women’s rights are internal matters and should be addressed locally. Afghans deported Germany on Thursday deported 20 convicted criminals to Afghanistan under a new agreement reached with the Taliban government to allow direct expulsions, the interior ministry said. Berlin had already resumed deporting criminals to Afghanistan in 2024, using Qatar as an intermediary. But the agreement reached to enable Thursday’s flight “creates a reliable basis for direct and permanent deportations to Afghanistan”, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said. Those deported were men who had committed crimes in Germany, including sexual offences, bodily harm and drug offences, according to the interior ministry. “Our society has an interest in ensuring that criminals leave our country. That is why we are acting consistently and expanding deportations step by step,” Dobrindt said. Germany stopped deportations to Afghanistan and closed its embassy in Kabul following the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. But it resumed them as part of efforts to take a tougher line on migration to counter the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Two deportation flights of convicted Afghans have left Germany since 2021: 28 were returned in autumn 2024 and 81 in July last year. Germany’s interior ministry had announced last year that direct discussions were taking place with the Taliban authorities. But the talks are controversial because Berlin does not recognise the Taliban administration in Kabul. Published in Dawn, February 27th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Two key witnesses, who had managed to escape from the deadly Gul Plaza inferno informed a judicial commission on Thursday that the authorities concerned and management of the ill-fated building had not come to the rescue of the people trapped inside the plaza when the blaze erupted. They also testified that no announcement was made about the fire to alert the people present in the shopping centre as the fire engulfed it. One of the survivors also pointed out that apart from one or two gates, the rest of the exit points of the building were closed. The single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court was tasked with probing the devastating blaze and fixing responsibility for any acts of commission or omission committed prior to and subsequent to the tragic incident. Ali Haider turned up and deposed that he was working as a salesman at a luggage shop on the ground floor of Gul Plaza, and his workplace was located near a gate opening towards the M.A. Jinnah Road. Wonder why no fire alarm sounded, most exit points were found closed He stated that he was about to close the shop on Jan 17 at around 10:15pm and suddenly noticed smoke on the floor and thus, he left the shop and saw a fire erupting on the mezzanine floor. The witness also said that he came back to his shop at around 10:30pm to check if things were normal there, as thick smoke was rapidly spreading across the floor. His shop also caught fire in the next 10 minutes, since the luggage / items in it were flammable. Therefore, he further testified, he fell unconscious after two fibre luggage pieces burst close to him, and upon regaining consciousness, he found himself in a hospital. Mr Haider, in his statement, maintained that apart from one or two gates, the rest of the exits were closed, and he had not noticed any fire tenders or rescue agencies on the site before falling unconscious. “It is further added that until the time of my falling conscious, there was no announcement of the fire made, nor did any person come to rescue the trapped people inside the building, either from the management side or from any government agency,” his testimony concluded. Mohammad Junaid deposed that he had been working at a crockery shop on the mezzanine floor of the plaza for the last four years, and they were moving out after closing the shop at 10:15pm. However, the owner of the shop suddenly realised that he had forgotten his cellphone inside the shop, and at the same time they noticed thick smoke spreading in the building and thereafter they realised severity of the smoke and fire, he added. The witness also testified that he, along with two other persons who had worked in the same market / floor, attempted to escape at around 11:15pm and somehow managed to come out of the burning building through a bathroom’s side exit at around 11:30pm as there were no passages visible due to thick smoke. Therefore, he further said, an Edhi ambulance had shifted him to a hospital due to chest congestion and suffocation caused by the smoke. Mr Junaid deposed that no announcement was made about the fire until their evacuation, and nobody came to rescue the stranded people inside the building, either from the building’s management side or any government agency. Around 80 people had lost their lives in the deadly inferno which erupted on the night of Jan 17 and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished. The fire left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some of its sections collapsed. Published in Dawn, February 27th, 2026",

During his visit to the residence of Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz in Mansehra to offer condolences, the PM assured the officer’s family of the government and the Pakistan Army’s full support. “We, the federal government and the Pakistan Army, are with you and will never leave you alone, as Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz Tanoli is our pride and embraced martyrdom while gallantly commanding forces against the country’s enemies,” he assured the family members. The PM said that Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz laid down his life while safeguarding the country, setting an example of bravery and courage. “The entire nation and I are proud of our martyrs and their families and would never forget the sacrifices they rendered for our motherland,” PM Shehbaz added. He also announced the establishment of a Daanish school named after the slain officer to commemorate his martyrdom. He also visited the grave of the fallen officer to offer Fateha. On Feb 21, Lt Col Gul Faraz and sepoy Karamat Shah were martyred in the suicide bombing during an intelligence-based operation in Bannu district, the Inter-Services Public Relations had said. Ramazan package The PM formally launched the Rs38 billion Ramazan package to provide financial support to deserving families across the country. While chairing a meeting on the Ramazan Relief Package, PM Shehbaz termed the assistance package “the largest and most comprehensive”, saying that the amount per household had been increased from Rs5,000 to Rs13,000. According to the premier, the disbursement will follow a “transparent digital system successfully used last year”. Cash assistance is being delivered directly to beneficiaries through digital wallets, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and respect for recipients’ dignity by eliminating long queues, he added. The PM was briefed that 64 per cent of the eligible individuals had received financial assistance eight days into Ramazan, while the verification and distribution of money to the remaining beneficiaries had been underway. The briefing also noted that 12 banks and fintech companies were partnering with the government for distribution, and the beneficiaries had completed 1.1 million digital transactions and over 1.227 million automated calls had been made to inform people about the assistance package. The prime minister praised the performance of departments involved in the disbursement of the package, saying that the digital wallet system provided a convenient and transparent means of reaching beneficiaries.

      "title_orig": "Strikes in Afghanistan carried out to ensure safety of Pakistani citizens, prevent imminent terrorist attacks: FO",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday said that Pakistan’s recent strikes against neighbouring Afghanistan were carried out to ensure the “safety of Pakistani citizens” and to prevent “imminent terrorist attacks”. FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi made the statement while responding to a question during his weekly press briefing . Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year. During Thursday’s press briefing, the FO spokesperson was asked about civilian casualties in the strikes, the total number of terrorists killed, and the locations of the camps targeted. In his response, he said, “Let me begin by reiterating that the intelligence-based selective targeting of these seven terrorist camps and their hideouts in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, was primarily to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions”. Andrabi stressed that the strikes were “proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence and were directed solely against identified terrorist camps and hideouts”. “We exercised utmost caution to prevent any harm to civilians,” the spokesperson said. He recalled statements made by the UN Security Council in reaction to terrorist attacks against Pakistan, with the latest being about the February 6 attack on an imambargah in Islamabad. The spokesperson maintained that the UNSC had “repeatedly underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, abettors, sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”. He further added that the UNSC had also urged states to cooperate with Pakistan in the matter, stressing that Pakistan’s actions must be viewed through the above-mentioned context. He said that Pakistan “remained committed to peace in the region” and called on the Afghan Taliban government to “comply with these obligations”. However, FO maintained that Pakistan would take “all necessary measures in the exercise of the right to self-defence against terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan”. Responding to the third part of the question regarding the location of the terrorist camps, the spokesperson recalled the Feb 21 statement issued by the Ministry of Information in the aftermath of the strikes and said he had “nothing to further add in terms of either the location or numbers of terrorists killed”. During the briefing, the FO spokesperson was also asked about India’s response to the strikes, specifically the statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), wherein it had condemned Pakistan for the move. The FO spokesperson said that Pakistan “rejected” the statement and maintained that the statement vindicated Pakistan’s stance that “India continues to aid and abet terrorism” in the country through its support for Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist organisations in the region. The spokesperson further said that Pakistan held “concrete evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring and abetting terrorism”. The spokesperson maintained that the statement issued by the MEA and another issued after the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan , “reinforce this conclusion”. “These statements provide additional evidence, circumstantial evidence, of India’s complicity in promoting terrorism in Pakistan,” FO said. He maintained that the message that Pakistan “will respond swiftly, strongly in exercise of our right to self-defence” had been put across “through all international stakeholders”. He reiterated Pakistan’s demand for action against “terrorist outfits operating with impunity and with freedom from Afghan soil”. In response to another question, the FO spokesperson also said that he was not aware of “any structured dialogue” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Asked if Qatar was playing any diplomatic role between the two countries, given the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Doha, the FO spokesperson said: “On the role of Qatar, the issue may have come up in a broader context”. Referring to PM Shehbaz’s recent meeting with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, he said that the two leaders exchanged views on regional and national developments, emphasising the importance of dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful resolution of disputes. “To that extent, of course, we would welcome Qatar’s role in settling all these issues, including Afghanistan,” he said. The FO spokesperson was also asked to comment on the strengthening defence ties between India and Israel. In response, Andrabi said, “We remain seized of the defence ties between Israel and India, including systems and platforms used by India against Pakistan. We are alive to the threat that they pose to our security and our sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the regional peace and stability. “Pakistan remains cognisant of these threats. As regards the future threats emanating from India, let me reiterate that we have robust military preparedness to defend and deter any Indian aggression against Pakistan.” Pakistan demands fair trial for perpetrators of Samjhota Express attack In response to being asked to comment on the 19th anniversary of the Samjhota Express attack, the spokesperson said, “We express our severe disappointment at the Indian government’s callousness towards the plight of families of Pakistani nationals and others, including Indian nationals, I believe, who await justice even after the passage of so many years.” On February 18, 2007, two crude incendiary bombs exploded inside the security-sealed Samjhota Express train headed from Delhi to Lahore, killing 68 people, including 44 Pakistanis. Andrabi maintained that the Indian government’s response confirmed its “role as an official and political accomplice in the heinous terrorist attack carried out on its soil against innocent civilians, Pakistanis and others alike”. FO also condemned the “shameless acquittal and exoneration” of the four perpetrators behind the attack. He expressed concern that the “Hindutva extremism and saffron terror had motivated this inhumane attack 19 years ago, has intensified manifold under the current regime in India”. On that note, the spokesperson demanded a “fair trial” of the perpetrators, stressing that the “families of innocent Pakistani nationals mercilessly killed at the hands of the Hindutva-motivated extremists deserve justice”. He further added: “India routinely indulges in anti-Pakistan propaganda, including by exploiting the bogey of terrorism. And in this backdrop, India’s own systemic exoneration of the perpetrators of the Samjhauta terrorist attack is yet another example of Indian duplicity and state sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan.“",

In his response, he said, “Let me begin by reiterating that the intelligence-based selective targeting of these seven terrorist camps and their hideouts in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, was primarily to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions”. Andrabi stressed that the strikes were “proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence and were directed solely against identified terrorist camps and hideouts”. “We exercised utmost caution to prevent any harm to civilians,” the spokesperson said. He recalled statements made by the UN Security Council in reaction to terrorist attacks against Pakistan, with the latest being about the February 6 attack on an imambargah in Islamabad. The spokesperson maintained that the UNSC had “repeatedly underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, abettors, sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”. He further added that the UNSC had also urged states to cooperate with Pakistan in the matter, stressing that Pakistan’s actions must be viewed through the above-mentioned context. He said that Pakistan “remained committed to peace in the region” and called on the Afghan Taliban government to “comply with these obligations”. However, FO maintained that Pakistan would take “all necessary measures in the exercise of the right to self-defence against terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan”. Responding to the third part of the question regarding the location of the terrorist camps, the spokesperson recalled the Feb 21 statement issued by the Ministry of Information in the aftermath of the strikes and said he had “nothing to further add in terms of either the location or numbers of terrorists killed”. During the briefing, the FO spokesperson was also asked about India’s response to the strikes, specifically the statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), wherein it had condemned Pakistan for the move. The FO spokesperson said that Pakistan “rejected” the statement and maintained that the statement vindicated Pakistan’s stance that “India continues to aid and abet terrorism” in the country through its support for Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist organisations in the region. The spokesperson further said that Pakistan held “concrete evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring and abetting terrorism”. The spokesperson maintained that the statement issued by the MEA and another issued after the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan , “reinforce this conclusion”. “These statements provide additional evidence, circumstantial evidence, of India’s complicity in promoting terrorism in Pakistan,” FO said. He maintained that the message that Pakistan “will respond swiftly, strongly in exercise of our right to self-defence” had been put across “through all international stakeholders”. He reiterated Pakistan’s demand for action against “terrorist outfits operating with impunity and with freedom from Afghan soil”. In response to another question, the FO spokesperson also said that he was not aware of “any structured dialogue” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Asked if Qatar was playing any diplomatic role between the two countries, given the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Doha, the FO spokesperson said: “On the role of Qatar, the issue may have come up in a broader context”. Referring to PM Shehbaz’s recent meeting with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, he said that the two leaders exchanged views on regional and national developments, emphasising the importance of dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful resolution of disputes. “To that extent, of course, we would welcome Qatar’s role in settling all these issues, including Afghanistan,” he said. The FO spokesperson was also asked to comment on the strengthening defence ties between India and Israel. In response, Andrabi said, “We remain seized of the defence ties between Israel and India, including systems and platforms used by India against Pakistan. We are alive to the threat that they pose to our security and our sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the regional peace and stability. “Pakistan remains cognisant of these threats. As regards the future threats emanating from India, let me reiterate that we have robust military preparedness to defend and deter any Indian aggression against Pakistan.” Pakistan demands fair trial for perpetrators of Samjhota Express attack In response to being asked to comment on the 19th anniversary of the Samjhota Express attack, the spokesperson said, “We express our severe disappointment at the Indian government’s callousness towards the plight of families of Pakistani nationals and others, including Indian nationals, I believe, who await justice even after the passage of so many years.” On February 18, 2007, two crude incendiary bombs exploded inside the security-sealed Samjhota Express train headed from Delhi to Lahore, killing 68 people, including 44 Pakistanis. Andrabi maintained that the Indian government’s response confirmed its “role as an official and political accomplice in the heinous terrorist attack carried out on its soil against innocent civilians, Pakistanis and others alike”. FO also condemned the “shameless acquittal and exoneration” of the four perpetrators behind the attack. He expressed concern that the “Hindutva extremism and saffron terror had motivated this inhumane attack 19 years ago, has intensified manifold under the current regime in India”. On that note, the spokesperson demanded a “fair trial” of the perpetrators, stressing that the “families of innocent Pakistani nationals mercilessly killed at the hands of the Hindutva-motivated extremists deserve justice”. He further added: “India routinely indulges in anti-Pakistan propaganda, including by exploiting the bogey of terrorism. And in this backdrop, India’s own systemic exoneration of the perpetrators of the Samjhauta terrorist attack is yet another example of Indian duplicity and state sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan.“",

      "summary": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday said that Pakistan’s recent strikes against neighbouring Afghanistan were carried out to ensure the “safety of Pakistani citizens” and to prevent “imminent terrorist attacks”. FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi made the statement while responding to a question during his weekly press briefing . Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year.
