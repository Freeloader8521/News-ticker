      "summary_orig": "Singer-turned-actor Nana is being counter-sued by a man who was arrested last year for breaking into her home and assaulting her mother, her agency said Friday. The suspect, a man in his 30s, was detained in November on charges of armed robbery causing injury after allegedly entering the home Nana shares with her mother in Guri, Gyeonggi Province, while carrying a weapon, according to her agency Sublime. The man reportedly assaulted Nana’s mother after encountering her inside the home. Nana, who was asleep at the time, woke after hearing her mother’s screams and together with her, restrained the suspect and contacted police. Authorities said the suspect sustained a cut to his jaw during the struggle. Police determined that the injuries were inflicted in self-defense and did not charge Nana or her mother. Sublime said the suspect has since filed a separate complaint accusing Nana of attempted murder and aggravated assault. The agency rejected the claims. “Nana and her family suffered serious physical and psychological harm during the attack by an assailant armed with a weapon,” Sub",

The 5th Air Cavalry Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment (5-17 ACS) at Camp Humphreys, a key U.S. base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, ceased its operation on Dec. 15, a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) report said, citing information from the U.S. Army. It had served in Korea to support the 2nd Infantry Division since May 2022. Its deactivation as part of an Army transformation initiative came amid lingering concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration could seek a ground troop reduction of the 28,500-strong U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) as part of an adjustment to better counter threats from an assertive China. 5-17 ACS is known to have had hundreds of personnel, as well as aviation and reconnaissance assets, including AH-64E Apache helicopters and RQ-7B Shadow drones.

      "summary_orig": "MOST conversations on educational issues in Pakistan, sooner than later, come to the topic of ‘values’ in our society — our young people in particular. People lament that values have changed and the change has been for the worse: young people just do not possess the values that older generations held. Empathy, tolerance and community feeling are often mentioned as prime examples of values we need badly but do not have or have lost to a large extent over time. The conversation then focuses on how curricula, textbooks and teaching should be changed to facilitate the inculcation of these values. This is all good — and yes, curricula, textbooks, teachers and teaching should definitely engage with the issue of values. In fact, we have always done that in education. Society has an interest in shaping how young people think and grow up and what they become. This is an essential part of the meaning of the very word ‘education’. But we should also remember that children learn much more from what they see adults doing around them and what they read, hear and watch on television, social media and within their social circles. They are shaped by what they see their parents, family elders and teachers do. Children learn from examples and what they see — far more than from what they might be asked to read/reproduce for assignments and examinations. If the two are not in line, curricula, books, lectures and lessons are likely to fall on deaf ears. Do religious minorities have the rights all citizens should? There are minorities in Pakistan who are even afraid to divulge their identity lest they be punished for just that. Even majorities have difficulty practising their religion freely. People are afraid to talk about religious issues in public and have internalised fear and self-censorship. A look at newspapers from a few months reveals countless reports of incidents where minorities and even individuals from majority communities have been victims. Those in power have decided to use power to secure their own interests (and longevity) rather than those of the public. If a judge or a few judges are deemed to be too independent or are disliked for one reason or another, the Constitution, law, rules, regulations, practice, everything can be changed to ensure that they are sidelined, are made out to be culprits, have their reputations ruined, or are forced to leave or become ineffective. If a journalist is disliked, we have him/her fired. Programmes are taken off-air, columnists are stopped from being able to write in papers. If a paper is deemed too ‘independent’ their advertisement revenue is restricted or other normal operations made difficult. Channels are taken off air. If these have required tightening of the laws, it has been done. But often, a call to the relevant newspaper or channel is enough of a threat given how the state has been handling these issues. Children are shaped by what they see their parents, family elders and teachers do. The state has weaponised the law against the citizens and in many domains. There are new laws against posting on social media, there are new laws against journalists, and laws are tightened around public protests. How the political opposition has been and is being treated is very clear. We need not say more on that. FIRs are used as a weapon. If the state does not like an individual and/or wants to give them a warning, all they have to do is register a case against them under any of the laws mentioned or start an investigation even before an FIR is registered. Even if the investigation is eventually closed or an FIR quashed, there will be months, sometimes years, of appearances before law-enforcement agencies and courts. The expenses and time consumed can be ruinous. The state knows this well but has, sadly, used it and is using it quite effectively against citizens they may not like for some reason. The right to public protest has become almost impossible to exercise and has been nearly criminalised. The use of Section 144 when a protest is expected gives the state the right to register FIRs against those who come out to protest and then face the wrath of the law for months and years. Charges like ‘obstruction of law-enforcement officers’ or ‘resisting law-enforcement officers’, ‘causing public nuisance’, ‘obstruction of traffic’, etc, are easy to weaponise against protesters and they have been weaponised. Every protest is deemed to be anti-state and a violation of the law. Every dissent is seen as dangerous to the integrity and sovereignty of the state. And then we say we should teach our children values like empathy and tolerance through books and classes. Are they not able to see what is happening around them? Do they not hear what is being said on news and chat programmes every day? Do they not have friends, relatives and elders who talk about these issues in their social spaces? How can they take what we give them in books and classes as important when they live in a society that violates these values and norms all the time as a matter of law as well as a matter of pride? As a society we need to think deep and hard about where we are and where we want to go. Some measures might seem desirable to ensure short-term survival but might have a very corrosive impact for us in the medium to long run. Those in power today have taken the state to such a place. This does not bode well for people who are facing all this but, just as importantly if not more so, it does not bode well for what we are likely to give our children and leave them in terms of values, institutions and practices. May 2026 be a year of reflection and course correction for us.

Some measures might seem desirable to ensure short-term survival but might have a very corrosive impact for us in the medium to long run. Those in power today have taken the state to such a place. This does not bode well for people who are facing all this but, just as importantly if not more so, it does not bode well for what we are likely to give our children and leave them in terms of values, institutions and practices. May 2026 be a year of reflection and course correction for us.

The unrest, triggered by soaring inflation and a collapsing currency, has spread from the capital to other major cities. The semi-official Fars news agency reported that two civilians were killed in Lordegan, following confrontations with security services. Meanwhile, state media confirmed that a member of the Basij paramilitary force was killed overnight in the city of Kouhdasht. The violence marks a significant escalation in the demonstrations that began on Sunday, when shopkeepers in Tehran went on strike to protest economic stagnation and high prices. By Tuesday, students from at least 10 universities had joined the movement, which has since expanded to include closing major bazaars across the country. “Some protesters began throwing stones at the city’s administrative buildings, including the provincial governor’s office, the mosque, the Martyrs’ Foundation, the town hall and banks,” Fars reported regarding the situation in Lordegan. The agency stated that police responded with tear gas after the buildings were “severely damaged” and arrested several people described as “ringleaders”. In Kouhdasht, state television cited Said Pourali, the deputy governor of Lorestan Province, reporting the death of a 21-year-old member of the Basij. The channel said the man was killed “by rioters while defending public order”. Mr Pourali noted that “during the demonstrations in Kouhdasht, 13 police officers and Basij members were injured by stone throwing”. However, accounts of the violence vary. The rights group Hengaw repo­r­ted that security forces killed and wounded several people in Lordegan. Regarding the death in Kouh­dasht, the Revolutionary Guards accused demonstrators of taking advantage of the protests. Contrarily, Hengaw identified the deceased as Amirhossam Khodayari Fard and alleged he was a protester killed by security forces. Hengaw also reported that a protester was shot dead on Wednesday in Isfahan province in central Iran. Reuters could not immediately verify these reports. Protests also took place on Thursday in Marvdasht in the southern Fars province, the activist news site HRANA reported. Hengsaw said Wednesday’s events included demonstrations and detentions across Kermanshah, Khuzestan, and Hamedan. The unrest comes at a critical moment for Iran’s clerical rulers. The economy has been hammered by Western sanctions and a currency that has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year. Inflation reached 52 per cent year-over-year in December, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran. The country is also recovering from regional tensions that led to a 12-day air war in June, during which Israeli and US airstrikes targeted the country’s nuclear infrastructure and military leadership. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sought to calm tensions on Thursday, acknowledging the protesters’ “legitimate demands” and calling on the government to improve the economic situation. “From an Islamic perspective … if we do not resolve the issue of people’s livelihoods, we will end up in hell,” Pezeshkian said at an event broadcast on state television. Despite the conciliatory tone, authorities promised to take a “firm” stance against disorder. Iran’s prosecutor general warned on Wednesday that while peaceful economic protests were legitimate, any attempt to create insecurity would be met with a “decisive response”. “Any attempt to turn economic protests into a tool of insecurity, destruction of public property, or implementation of externally designed scenarios will inevitably be met with a legal, proportionate and decisive response,” the prosecutor said. Government spokesperson Fate­meh Mohajerani announced on Thur­sday that authorities would hold a direct dialogue with representatives of trade unions and merchants, though she did not provide further details. The current demonstrations remain smaller than the nationwide uprising in 2022, which was triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini for allegedly violating Iran’s strict dress code. That wave of anger left several hundred people dead. Tasnim news agency reported on Wednesday evening the arrest of seven people allegedly affiliated with “groups hostile to the Islamic Republic based in the United States and Europe”, claiming they were “tasked with turning the demonstrations into violence”. Local media coverage has been mixed, with some outlets highlighting economic hardships while others focus on incidents caused by “troublemakers”. Published in Dawn, January 2nd, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Pak Institute for Peace Studies report counts 699 terrorist attacks in outgoing year • Burden of violence fell on security personnel, constituting over 42pc of fatalities ISLAMABAD: Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year. This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. These are the findings of the “Pakistan Security Report 2025,” released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) on Thursday. Besides rising border violence and militant resurgence, evolving militant tactics from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan fuel a widening security challenge, the report says. The burden of this violence fell disproportionately on the state’s defenders as security and law-enforcement personnel suffered over 42pc of all terrorism-related fatalities, with 437 lives lost, the data shows. The report notes that this stark figure highlights the frontline nature of the conflict and the relentless targeting of army, police and paramilitary forces. Civilians were also heavily affected, with 354 non-combatants losing their lives. Meanwhile, 243 militants were killed, either in suicide attacks they carried out or during retaliatory fire by security forces following some of the terrorist attacks. The PIPS report says that the conflict remained intensely regionalised, with over 95pc of attacks concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan. In KP, a 40pc rise in incidents illustrated the entrenched presence of groups like the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates. The province experienced the highest number of terrorist incidents in the country in 2025, with 413 attacks. These violent incidents claimed a total of 581 lives and left 698 others injured. The province faced not just more frequent attacks, but more complex ones, including a coordinated wave of assaults across 11 districts on Independence Day — a symbolic challenge to state authority, the report says. In Balochistan, the insurgency evolved qualitatively. The province experienced 254 militant attacks in 2025, resulting in 419 deaths and injuries to 607 others. A 26pc increase in attacks was accompanied by a shift towards high-impact, coordinated operations. Militant groups like the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) moved beyond hit-and-run tactics to execute highway blockades, sieges, and hijackings, directly targeting economic infrastructure and state symbols to amplify their political message and disrupt governance. Sindh province recorded 21 terrorist attacks, including 16 in Karachi, two in Shikarpur, and one each in Hyderabad, Jacobabad, and Jamshoro. These incidents resulted in 14 fatalities and left 17 others injured. Punjab witnessed seven terrorist attacks in 2025, a decline from 11 incidents in the previous year. These attacks killed five people including four militants and one policeman, and injured two policemen. A suicide blast outside the judicial complex housing the Islamabad district and sessions courts killed 12 people. Jamaatul Ahrar, a faction of the banned TTP, claimed the attack. In Gilgit-Baltistan, three attacks were reported, including two in Diamir district and one in Gilgit. These incidents claimed the lives of three security personnel, including two Scouts and one Frontier Corps official, and injured six others. Published in Dawn, January 2nd, 2026",

The comments, which were the most categorical since the start of the Saudi-UAE row about Pakis­tan’s role in defusing tensions, came during the weekly media briefing by FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi, who said Islamabad was actively engaging both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to encourage restraint and diplomacy. “We have been advocating peace and diplomacy to reach a solution. So, this is part of our exchanges that is taking place between our leadership and the leadership in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” Mr Andrabi said. Tensions peaked on Dec 30 when Saudi Arabia carried out air stri­kes on Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla, targeting what it said were weapons and armoured vehicles allegedly supplied to the Sou­thern Transitional Council (STC). No casualties were reported. Abu Dhabi later announced a voluntary pullout of its remaining counterterrorism units the same day. Thus far, Pakistan has pursued carefully balanced diplomacy. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Dec 30 in Rahim Yar Khan during the Emirati leader’s private visit, officially focusing on bilateral ties but widely viewed as urging de-escalation. A day later, PM Shehbaz spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan was pursuing the issue through multilateral forums as well, including the UN Security Council. At the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, he added, Pakistan advocated “for peace, dialogue, role for diplomacy, including peace­ful settlement for a Yemeni-led, Yemeni-owned political process”. “So, this is in that spirit that we take our role as a mediator and a facilitator for bringing peace and prosperity for Yemen and for the brotherly people of Yemen,” Mr Andrabi said. Exchange of lists Meanwhile, Pakistan and India on Thursday exchanged lists of nuclear installations and prisoners, a long-standing confidence-building practice that has endured despite unprecedented strains in bilateral ties, which brought relations close to a virtual breakdown. Mr Andrabi confirmed the exchange, saying: “Today, on 1st January, as per our bilateral agreements, Pakistan and India exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody. Accordingly, the government of Pakistan today handed over a list of 257 Indian prisoners (58 civilians and 199 fishermen) in Pakistan to the High Commission of India in Islamabad.” He said the move was in line with existing bilateral commitments. “This step is consistent with the provisions of the Consular Access Agreement between Pakistan and India, signed on May 21, 2008, under which both countries are required to exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody twice a year, on Jan 1 and July 1, respectively,” the spokesman added. India said it shared information about 391 civilian prisoners and 33 fishermen in its custody who are Pakistani or believed to be Pakistani. The two sides also exchanged lists of nuclear installations and facilities that cannot be attacked in the event of hostilities, under a separate agreement aimed at reducing the risk of escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours. “Also, on Jan 1, Pakistan and India exchange the lists of their respective nuclear installations pursuant to the Agreement on Prohibition of Attacks against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between Pakistan and India,” Mr Andrabi said. Dulhasti power project The Foreign Office also urged India to respond to formal queries raised by its Indus Waters Commissioner over India’s proposed Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project, saying New Delhi failed to share prior information as required under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had not been notified in advance about the project, describing the omission as a breach of international obligations. “No prior information or notification was shared with Pakistan with regard to this project (Dulhasti State-II Hydroelectric Project) as mandated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960,” he said. “Such acts of commission and omission yet again exemplify a complete disregard of international law.” The Dulhasti hydropower project is located on the Chenab River in the disputed region of India-held Jammu and Kashmir. Its original 390-megawatt, run-of-the-river Stage I plant was commissioned in 2007 and operated for years without major objections from Pakistan. However, concerns have surfaced following India’s approval last month of a 260MW Stage II extension. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan’s Indus Waters Commissioner has formally sought details from his Indian counterpart. Calling for immediate engagement, Mr Andrabi said: “We therefore call upon India to urgently return to treaty compliance and respond to the queries raised by our Indus Waters Commissioner in his latest as well as earlier communications.” He also stressed that Pakistan considers the treaty legally binding despite India’s position.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said on Thursday that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation. The PTI earlier said that it will not engage in negotiations with the federal government. Party Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan. “Two of them are my leaders, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif. The third is President Asif Ali Zardari, the fourth is [incarcerated PTI leader] Imran Khan, and everyone knows who the fifth is,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News Capital Talk on Thursday. He said the efforts at the level of leaders like him and PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Malik Amir Dogar, would continue, but until confidence among the top leaders is established, the political situation would not see a breakthrough. Sanaullah added that confidence-building measures would be possible only when social media accounts propagating a hate campaign against the army and its leadership are shut down. “The PTI leadership can’t evade responsibility [for these accounts] … They have to disown them,” he said, adding that PTI could instead initiate propaganda against political parties. He further said that the PTI should withdraw its call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, as it would be a “failure” and would further “damage the situation”. In response to Sanaullah, Dogar said the government should arrange a meeting between PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, and incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan. “Hopefully, a path will be made,” he added. “If these five leaders meet the conflict can be resolved,” added Dogar, without specifying which five leaders he was referring to. ‘Outright rejected negotiations’ Separately, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, while speaking on Dawn News Dosra Rukh, denied any contacts with the government regarding negotiations. “We have outright rejected the negotiations,” he said, adding that Imran Khan had stated the PTI would not negotiate with a Form-47 government. “The decision on whether to hold negotiations with the government rests with Achakzai and Abbas, as they welcomed it in the statement issued by the TTAP after the national conference,” he said. In response to another question on PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar’s statement regarding meetings with Imran Khan, Akram said: “PTI is dealing with frustration due to his statement, and this is clearly visible outside Adiala prison, where a crowd gathers every Tuesday. FIRs are lodged, people are arrested, yet workers gather the following week.” Earlier in December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence. The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.",

      "summary_orig": "PTI leaders were once again denied a meeting with incarcerated party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday, as party leaders lamented the restrictions and said the government should have “shown a big heart”. A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 mandated that meetings with Imran will be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. The party has staged sit-ins near the prison to demand a meeting with the party founder, with one earlier this week dispersed with water cannons. “I was hoping that, considering the offer of talks by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the first day of the new year, the government would allow us to meet PTI’s founding chairman,“ said Muhammad Jamal Khan, a member of the National Assembly (MNA) while talking to Dawn . “It could have been the first step towards creating national harmony and ending the tense political environment, but the government lost that chance.” On Wednesday, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja had written a letter to the Superintendent at Adiala jail — where Imran is imprisoned — and shared the names of six people for a meeting with the party founder. The names included Dr Amjad Ali, Sahibzada Sibghatullah, Usman Bhattani, Iqbal Khattak, Shoaib Ameer Awan and Muhammad Jamal Khan. The MNA said he approached the gate of Adiala jail at 2:30 pm and informed the jail staff that his name had been forwarded by Raja for the meeting. “The officials told me that they had noted my name and suggested I return to the check post and wait, where media personnel were also standing,” Jamal added. “They told me that I would be informed if they got the approval for the meeting. I waited there until 4:40 pm, but they kept telling me that they had not received approval to let me in.” When asked why only two people arrived outside Adiala jail, despite the prison administrators having received six names, Jamal said that he and Member of the Provincial Assembly Iqbal Khan Khattak had arrived at the prison together. “There is a possibility that other leaders might have been elsewhere at Adiala jail. I did not have their contact numbers, so I cannot confirm whether they had arrived or not,” he added. Replying to a question, Jamal said that the government had shown weakness. “It should have allowed the meeting to signal that it is serious about negotiations, and the nation would have seen it as a positive message from the government,” he added. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health. In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes. Earlier this month, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards. Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.” A sit-in staged by PTI leaders and the sisters of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan was once again dispersed using water cannons late on Tuesday night.",

      "summary_orig": "Dozens of people were killed and around 100 injured, most of them seriously, after fire tore through a crowded bar during a New Year’s Eve party in the upscale Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, officials said on Thursday. Fire broke out at 1.30am in a bar called “Le Constellation” in the resort in southwestern Switzerland, which locals said was popular with teenagers. The cause of the blaze, which was initially reported as an explosion, remains unclear but authorities said it appeared to be an accident rather than an attack. Swiss police said “tens” of people were presumed dead, with around 100 injured, and the Italian foreign ministry said information from Swiss police indicated about 40 deaths. Swiss officials declined to give a specific figure. View this post on Instagram “There were people screaming, and then people lying on the ground, probably dead,” said 21-year-old local Samuel Rapp, who saw the aftermath of the fire. “They had jackets over their faces, thats what I saw, nothing more.” Ceiling caught fire Video footage showed lines of ambulances queuing and helicopters landing to take victims to nearby hospitals and specialist burns units in other Swiss cities. Two young French women who said they were in the bar told France’s BFM TV that they saw the fire start in the basement section of the club after a bottle containing “birthday candles” was held up too close to the wooden ceiling. “The fire spread across the ceiling super quickly,” one of the two women, who identified themselves as Emma and Albane, told BFM TV. The pair said they were able to climb a narrow staircase to the ground floor and escape the building. Minutes later, the fire had reached the ground floor too, they said. Police officers and rescuers stand next to a firefighters vehicle on the site of an explosion that ripped through the bar Le Constellation in Crans-Montana on January 1, 2026. —AFP BFM showed video of a waitress carrying a champagne bottle with a lit ‘fountain candle’ through the bar, in line with the account, but the video did not show the fire taking hold. Video footage verified by Reuters showed fire spreading from the building, with people outside the club, some of them running and screaming. Victims come from several countries Italy’s ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told Sky TG24 local authorities had told him the blaze was started by someone letting off a firework inside the bar which set fire to the ceiling. He was in Crans-Montana, where he said a number of Italians had gathered seeking information about missing relatives or friends. He declined to say if there were any Italian victims but witnesses said many of those in the bar appeared to be from other countries. Witnesses described the injured being treated in improvised triage centres set up in a nearby bar and in a branch of UBS bank and said many suffered after coming out of the heat of the bar into the freezing night air. “And then it was just ambulances coming back and forth as much as possible,” said Dominic Dubois, who witnessed the frantic scenes as the bodies were brought out. Emergency personnel work outside the “Le Constellation” bar, after an explosion and fire during a New Year’s Eve party where several people died and others were injured. — Reuters A waiter in a restaurant near the bar, who declined to be named, said that first responders approached staff overnight asking for table cloths to cover the bodies to conceal them from onlookers. On Thursday morning, hours after the explosion, footage from the street outside showed the area cordoned off, with forensic tents behind white screens set up in front of the bar, one of many in Crans-Montana, a fashionable ski centre with an array of boutiques, luxury hotels and restaurants. “I know someone who might have been among the victims and I can’t reach her. I’m very worried,” said local resident Karine Spreng. “I’m going to try to contact other people who know this woman to see if she is still alive.” The daytime scene, with small groups of people, some in tears or carrying flowers, was a stark contrast to the panic and confusion that officials said faced first responders who arrived when the alarm was raised. “The first responders - the firefighters and police officers - arrived at a scene of chaos, at a dramatic scene,” Stephane Ganzer, head of security for Valais canton, told reporters. He said some of the victims were from other countries, hundreds of personnel were working on the case and a helpline had been opened for relatives. Officials said the grim task of identifying badly burned bodies would take a considerable time. “I can’t hide from you that we are all shaken by what happened overnight in Crans,” the canton’s head of police, Frederic Gisler, told the press conference. “Our count is about 100 injured, most seriously, and unfortunately tens of people are presumed dead,” he said, adding that patients had been dispatched to hospitals in Sion, Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich. Local prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said a full investigation had been opened into the incident at the bar, which Swiss company records indicated was owned by a French couple. “At the moment we are considering this a fire and we are not considering the possibility of an attack,” she told a press conference. Mourning Swiss Federal President Guy Parmelin expressed shock at the scale of the disaster, which came less than a year after a fire in a club in North Macedonia killed 59 people. “What was meant to be a moment of joy turned, on the first day of the year in Crans-Montana, into mourning that touches the entire country and far beyond,” he said on the social media platform X, expressing condolences. The foreign ministers of neighbouring Italy and Germany and other countries including the United States expressed condolences but there was no immediate confirmation of the nationality of any of the victims. Prosecutor Pilloud said authorities were trying to get the bodies of the victims to their families. “A lot of resources have been put into forensics to identify the victims. These resources are intended to allow us to get the bodies to the families as soon as possible,” she said. Earlier, police said many people were being treated for burns and that the area had been completely closed off, with a no-fly zone imposed over Crans-Montana, which is due to host next year’s Alpine World Ski Championships. Authorities said 10 helicopters and 40 ambulances had been deployed. President Zardari, PM Shehbaz extend condolences President Asif Ali Zardari said he was deeply saddened over the incident and extended condolences to the families of the victims and wished the injured a swift recovery. In a social media post on X, the president said he was “heartbroken by news of the devastating explosion & fire in Crans-Montanaon, Switzerland on New Year’s night“. View this post on Instagram",

      "summary_orig": "An explosion near Chenak Chowk in Balochistan’s Sibi district on Thursday killed one person and injured five others, according to a police official. Station House Officer (SHO) Ghulam Ali Abro, posted in Sibi, told Dawn that the incident was a grenade attack which occurred at 7:05pm. “One person expired and five others were injured,” the SHO said. “Security forces and Edhi ambulances arrived on the scene as soon as they received reports about the incident.” He further told reporters at the site of the attack that six injured people were transported to a hospital, with one of them succumbing to their injuries on the way. Meanwhile, Sibi region Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Barkat Khosa told Dawn that the injured were moved to the Teaching Hospital, while the body of the deceased was handed over to his heirs. “Police have tightened security in the area, and further investigation is underway,” DIG Khosa said. Last month, an eight-year-old child was killed and five other members of a family, including two women, were injured when a grenade exploded inside a house in the Wadh area of Balochistan’s Khuzdar district. Police said two families from Sindh’s Kashmore district were in the house when unidentified assailants hurled a hand grenade into the courtyard. It exploded, killing the child on the spot. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. With an almost 34pc surge in overall violence, 2025 was recorded as the most violent year for Pakistan in a decade, a report from the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) think tank stated. The country has suffered a sustained escalation in violence for five consecutive years since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan; with terrorist violence-linked fatalities among civilians and security officials rising almost 38 per cent in 2021, over 15pc in 2022, 56pc in 2023, nearly 67pc in 2024 and 34pc in 2025.",

The country has suffered a sustained escalation in violence for five consecutive years since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan; with terrorist violence-linked fatalities among civilians and security officials rising almost 38 per cent in 2021, over 15pc in 2022, 56pc in 2023, nearly 67pc in 2024 and 34pc in 2025.",

      "summary": "An explosion near Chenak Chowk in Balochistan’s Sibi district on Thursday killed one person and injured five others, according to a police official. Station House Officer (SHO) Ghulam Ali Abro, posted in Sibi, told Dawn that the incident was a grenade attack which occurred at 7:05pm. “One person expired and five others were injured,” the SHO said. “Security forces and Edhi ambulances arrived on the scene as soon as they received reports about the incident.” He further told reporters at the site of the attack that six injured people were transported to a hospital, with one of them succumbing to their injuries on the way. Meanwhile, Sibi region Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Barkat Khosa told Dawn that the injured were moved to the Teaching Hospital, while the body of the deceased was handed over to his heirs. “Police have tightened security in the area, and further investigation is underway,” DIG Khosa said. Last month, an eight-year-old child was killed and five other members of a family, including two women, were injured when a grenade exploded inside a house in the Wadh area of Balochistan’s Khuzdar district. Police said two families from Sindh’s Kashmore district were in the house when unidentified assailants hurled a hand grenade into the courtyard. It exploded, killing the child on the spot.

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: The Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Thursday suspended the practising licence of Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq for representing TikToker Rajab Butt before a Karachi court despite a strike called by the local bar. The strike had been called in protest against the alleged victimisation of the Karachi Bar Association’s former librarian, Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro. During the strike, judicial proceedings were strictly prohibited within the city courts’ premises. According to an order issued by PbBC Executive Committee’s Chairman Zabiullah Nagra, the action was taken after receiving a letter from the president and general secretary of the Karachi Bar Association. The letter drew the council’s attention to a “video circulating on social media in which Advocate Ashfaq was seen appearing before the Karachi City Courts while representing TikToker Rajab Butt during an ongoing lawyers’ strike,” said Nagra. “It further observed that the advocate appeared before the courts despite the strike, allegedly accompanied by private guards or individuals in clear violation of the strike restrictions and the established canons of the legal profession,” the order stated. It further noted that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”. “These remarks reportedly caused divisions within the legal fraternity, leading to confrontation and discord among lawyers,” it added. As per the order, Advocate Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”. Examining his professional record, the order said that Advocate Ashfaq was registered as an advocate with the PbBC in 2010 and the high court in 2012. “As a practising lawyer,” the council asserted that Advocate Ashfaq was “duty bound to uphold the dignity and high standing of the legal profession at all times”. “The executive committee unanimously decided to suspend Advocate Ashfaq’s licence to practice law with immediate effect,” it said. The committee also referred the matter to the disciplinary committee of the council for further proceedings regarding the permanent cancellation of the licence in accordance with law. Talking to Dawn , Nagra said the PbBC, as a statutory regulatory body, was not required to issue a prior notice before suspending a lawyer’s licence in cases involving professional misconduct. “Every enrolled advocate is presumed to have full knowledge of the code of conduct prescribed under the Bar Council rules and is duty-bound to comply with it,” he said. Council’s executive committee chairman added that the lawyer concerned had been found involved in activities “unbecoming of a member of the legal profession” for quite some time. On Monday, YouTuber Rajab Butt was physically assaulted at a sessions court in Karachi during the hearing of a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. The hearing, during which the Youtuber was represented by Ashfaq, was marred by violence and chaos. Ashfaq has also been appearing as counsel for former spymaster Faiz Hameed in the trial concluded against him before a military court.",

      "summary_orig": "A total of 128 journalists were killed around the world in 2025, more than half of them in the Middle East, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said on Thursday. The grim toll, up from 2024, “is not just a statistic, it’s a global red alert for our colleagues,” IFJ general secretary Anthony Bellanger told AFP. The press group voiced particular alarm over the situation in the Palestinian territories, where it recorded 56 media professionals killed in 2025 as Israel’s war with Hamas ground on in Gaza. “We’ve never seen anything like this: so many deaths in such a short time, in such a small area,” Bellanger said. Journalists were also killed in Yemen, Ukraine, Sudan, Peru, India and elsewhere. Bellanger condemned what he called “impunity” for those behind the attacks. “Without justice, it allows the killers of journalists to thrive,” he warned. Meanwhile, the IFJ said that across the globe, 533 journalists were currently in prison – a figure that has more than doubled over the past half-decade. China once again topped the list as the worst jailer of reporters with 143 behind bars, including in Hong Kong, where authorities have been criticised by Western nations for imposing national security laws quashing dissent. The IFJ’s count for the number of journalists killed is typically far higher than that of Reporters Without Borders, due to different counting methods. This year’s IFJ toll also included nine accidental deaths. Reporters Without Borders said 67 journalists were killed in the course of their work this year. It said in the report that Israel was responsible for nearly half of all journalists killed this year worldwide, with 29 Palestinian reporters slain by Israeli forces in Gaza. In Pakistan, the Pakistan Press Foundation documented at least 137 confirmed incidents targeting journalists and media professionals in 2025, including eight killings. It also reported 35 incidents of physical assault and manhandling, along with two journalists injured while on assignment, five detentions, two abductions and four attacks on property, including raids.",
