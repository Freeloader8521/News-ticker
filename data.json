      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: In a harrowing development, at least 30 bodies were recovered from a gutted shop as rescuers combed through the wreckage of Karachi’s Gul Plaza on Wednesday. Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the remains of 30 humans had been recovered from a shop called “Dubai Crockery” located on the mezzanine floor. He said that earlier in the day, rescue workers had recovered three more bodies, increasing the toll from 28 to 31. He added that with the discovery of the bodies from the gutted shop, the death toll was estimated to have risen to 61. However, he cautioned that a final conclusion about the death toll could only be reached after receiving the DNA reports. He said that the relatives of those missing as well as the shopkeepers had already indicated the possibility of there being a large number of people at the shop. Raza said that as per the last contact with the victims, they had believed they would be safe and the fire would be controlled but had suffocated to death while waiting. Regarding the visit of a bomb disposal squad to the scene of the fire, the South police chief said so far no evidence of mischief had emerged during the initial investigation. A resident of the area, Rasheed, told Dawn that the shop had announced a sale for the wedding season. For this purpose, it had decided to stay open till 2am, even though it usually closed at 10pm. The fire had erupted at the Gul Plaza on Saturday night. While the fire at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards. Inquiry committee visits gutted plaza Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, the convener of an inquiry committee formed by the Sindh government to probe the circumstances of the fire, visited the gutted plaza. Karachi Additional Inspector General Azad Khan, who is also a member of the committee, accompanied the commissioner. Speaking to the media, the Karachi commissioner said the inquiry had just begun. He highlighted the building’s condition, saying the Rimpa Plaza, located adjacent to the plaza, had also been affected. However, he said that Rimpa Plaza had not yet been declared dangerous. Naqvi lamented that the fire safety measures inside the buildings did not adhere to international standards. The additional Karachi IG, meanwhile, said that no evidence of sabotage had emerged so far. “We are investigating the incident thoroughly,” he said. He refuted media reports that two dumper trucks transporting debris from the plaza to KMC ground had disappeared. KMC’s Zafar Khan also spoke to the media, saying the firefighting team was still working on the plaza despite the presence of “extreme heat” while cooling work was also ongoing on two spots. He said one portion of the building had  been cleared while two other portions were in the process of being cleared. “We will try to retrieve the bodies buried under the debris,” he vowed, adding that firemen were being sent to the spots where the building’s structure was still stable. He also refuted claims alleging that the fire brigade had a delayed response to the fire. He said three fire tenders were sent as soon as information was recieved about the fire on Saturday night. He further added that shopkeepers had created a chaos-like situation and were allegedly snatching pipes from firefighters to extinguish the flames at their own shops. He said that the door leading to the buildin’s roof was locked, therefore, people were unable to access it. He said that the market was meant to be closing when the fire erupted which was why all the exits were closed. Rimpa Plaza affected due to blaze According to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), a part of the structure of Rimpa Plaza — another shopping mall adjacent to Gul Plaza — has also been affected due to continued exposure to heat and fire. SBCA Director General Muzammil Halepota told Dawn that three floors of the 13-storey building had been affected, and a SBCA technical committee had visited the site on Tuesday. They found that two pillars had been weakened and the SBCA suggested jacketing to strengthen the pillars by adding a layer of steel supports around them. “An SBCA team has started the process,” Halepota said, adding that a notice had also been issued to the owners of Rimpa Plaza regarding the pillars’ repair. Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi also visited Gul Plaza. Speaking to the media at the site, he said the inquiry into the incident was a complicated one as it had multiple angles. He said the matter would have to be probed from all angles, and the inquiry committee would try to make “long-term and far-reaching recommendations” to the government. Tessori meets delegation of traders Separately, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori met a delegation led by Gul Plaza President Tanveer Pasta and Karachi Chamber of Commerce’s Javed Balwani. A statement issued by the governor’s office said Pasta appreciated Tessori’s efforts for the “timely rescue operation and effective measures” after the fire erupted at Gul Plaza and thanked him for “raising his voice for the victims” of the tragedy at every forum. “During the meeting, Tanveer Pasta agreed, in principle, with the recommendations of the Sindh governor and Karachi Chamber of Commerce,” the statement said, without elaborating on the said recommendations. All Gul Plaza records available, SBCA maintains The SBCA, a day earlier, had rejected reports that the building records for the shopping mall were not available, deeming them “baseless and contrary to facts”. “The impression being given that the records of Gul Plaza are not available with the SBCA is incorrect,” the authority said in a statement. It said that all approved records related to Gul Plaza, including sanctioned plans, completion plans, and construction details, were “preserved and available with the authority”. According to the SCBA, the building was originally constructed in 1979, while a revised plan was approved in 1998. “Thereafter, under the Regularisation Amendment Ordinance 2001, the project was duly regularised in 2003 in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,” SCBA said. “A revised no-objection certificate (NOC) for sale and advertisement was issued in 2005, under which approval was granted for 175 shops in the basement, 355 shops on the ground floor, 188 shops on the first floor, 193 shops on the second floor, and 191 shops on the third floor, making a total of 1,102 approved shops.” The SCBA added that the building had two staircases from the basement to the ground floor, six staircases from the ground floor to the first floor, five staircases from the second floor to the third floor, and 16 exit routes on the ground floor for emergencies. It is worth noting that South DIG Asad Raza told Dawn that out of the 16 exits, 14 were closed at the time of the fire. “The SBCA clarifies that it completely rejects any notion of concealing facts or disappearance of records,” the statement read, maintaining that all legal and technical records related to Gul Plaza were available with the body. “The SBCA believes in full cooperation and transparent investigations, and a fact-based report will be presented to determine responsibility,” the statement added.",

He highlighted the building’s condition, saying the Rimpa Plaza, located adjacent to the plaza, had also been affected. However, he said that Rimpa Plaza had not yet been declared dangerous. Naqvi lamented that the fire safety measures inside the buildings did not adhere to international standards. The additional Karachi IG, meanwhile, said that no evidence of sabotage had emerged so far. “We are investigating the incident thoroughly,” he said. He refuted media reports that two dumper trucks transporting debris from the plaza to KMC ground had disappeared. KMC’s Zafar Khan also spoke to the media, saying the firefighting team was still working on the plaza despite the presence of “extreme heat” while cooling work was also ongoing on two spots. He said one portion of the building had  been cleared while two other portions were in the process of being cleared. “We will try to retrieve the bodies buried under the debris,” he vowed, adding that firemen were being sent to the spots where the building’s structure was still stable. He also refuted claims alleging that the fire brigade had a delayed response to the fire. He said three fire tenders were sent as soon as information was recieved about the fire on Saturday night. He further added that shopkeepers had created a chaos-like situation and were allegedly snatching pipes from firefighters to extinguish the flames at their own shops. He said that the door leading to the buildin’s roof was locked, therefore, people were unable to access it. He said that the market was meant to be closing when the fire erupted which was why all the exits were closed. Rimpa Plaza affected due to blaze According to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), a part of the structure of Rimpa Plaza — another shopping mall adjacent to Gul Plaza — has also been affected due to continued exposure to heat and fire. SBCA Director General Muzammil Halepota told Dawn that three floors of the 13-storey building had been affected, and a SBCA technical committee had visited the site on Tuesday. They found that two pillars had been weakened and the SBCA suggested jacketing to strengthen the pillars by adding a layer of steel supports around them. “An SBCA team has started the process,” Halepota said, adding that a notice had also been issued to the owners of Rimpa Plaza regarding the pillars’ repair. Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi also visited Gul Plaza. Speaking to the media at the site, he said the inquiry into the incident was a complicated one as it had multiple angles. He said the matter would have to be probed from all angles, and the inquiry committee would try to make “long-term and far-reaching recommendations” to the government. Tessori meets delegation of traders Separately, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori met a delegation led by Gul Plaza President Tanveer Pasta and Karachi Chamber of Commerce’s Javed Balwani. A statement issued by the governor’s office said Pasta appreciated Tessori’s efforts for the “timely rescue operation and effective measures” after the fire erupted at Gul Plaza and thanked him for “raising his voice for the victims” of the tragedy at every forum. “During the meeting, Tanveer Pasta agreed, in principle, with the recommendations of the Sindh governor and Karachi Chamber of Commerce,” the statement said, without elaborating on the said recommendations. All Gul Plaza records available, SBCA maintains The SBCA, a day earlier, had rejected reports that the building records for the shopping mall were not available, deeming them “baseless and contrary to facts”. “The impression being given that the records of Gul Plaza are not available with the SBCA is incorrect,” the authority said in a statement. It said that all approved records related to Gul Plaza, including sanctioned plans, completion plans, and construction details, were “preserved and available with the authority”. According to the SCBA, the building was originally constructed in 1979, while a revised plan was approved in 1998. “Thereafter, under the Regularisation Amendment Ordinance 2001, the project was duly regularised in 2003 in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,” SCBA said. “A revised no-objection certificate (NOC) for sale and advertisement was issued in 2005, under which approval was granted for 175 shops in the basement, 355 shops on the ground floor, 188 shops on the first floor, 193 shops on the second floor, and 191 shops on the third floor, making a total of 1,102 approved shops.” The SCBA added that the building had two staircases from the basement to the ground floor, six staircases from the ground floor to the first floor, five staircases from the second floor to the third floor, and 16 exit routes on the ground floor for emergencies. It is worth noting that South DIG Asad Raza told Dawn that out of the 16 exits, 14 were closed at the time of the fire. “The SBCA clarifies that it completely rejects any notion of concealing facts or disappearance of records,” the statement read, maintaining that all legal and technical records related to Gul Plaza were available with the body. “The SBCA believes in full cooperation and transparent investigations, and a fact-based report will be presented to determine responsibility,” the statement added.",

      "summary": "KARACHI: In a harrowing development, at least 30 bodies were recovered from a gutted shop as rescuers combed through the wreckage of Karachi’s Gul Plaza on Wednesday. Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the remains of 30 humans had been recovered from a shop called “Dubai Crockery” located on the mezzanine floor. He said that earlier in the day, rescue workers had recovered three more bodies, increasing the toll from 28 to 31. He added that with the discovery of the bodies from the gutted shop, the death toll was estimated to have risen to 61. However, he cautioned that a final conclusion about the death toll could only be reached after receiving the DNA reports. He said that the relatives of those missing as well as the shopkeepers had already indicated the possibility of there being a large number of people at the shop. Raza said that as per the last contact with the victims, they had believed they would be safe and the fire would be controlled but had suffocated to death while waiting. Regarding the visit of a bomb disposal squad to the scene of the fire, the South police chief said so far no evidence of mischief had emerged during the initial investigation. A resident of the area, Rasheed, told Dawn that the shop had announced a sale for the wedding season. For this purpose, it had decided to stay open till 2am, even though it usually closed at 10pm. The fire had erupted at the Gul Plaza on Saturday night. While the fire at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday granted activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha pre-arrest bail in a case pertaining to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) that dates back to July 2025 and resurfaced a day earlier. The two had filed pre-arrest bail applications in the case. However, their bail pleas could not be taken up on an urgent basis on Tuesday while the couple struggled to avoid arrest. The couple took refuge in the IHCBA president’s office, where they spent the whole night, while a large number of police officials remained outside the premises. During the hearing on Wednesday, Justice Muhammad Azam Khan of the IHC took up the pre-arrest application and approved Mazari and Chattha’s bail against surety bonds of Rs10,000 each. Advocate Kamran Murtaza appeared on behalf of the petitioners, and a large number of lawyers and officials from the IHCBA were present in the courtroom in solidarity with the applicants. Addressing the court, Murtaza said that this was the first time in the country’s judicial history that a woman had to spend the night on court premises, adding that he personally felt responsible for what happened. “If there had been an old case, they would have arrested her first,” he said, adding that the petitioners had been appearing in various cases since July. “You are the custodian of the high court. You must ensure that no one is taken away from here,” the defence counsel pleaded with the judge. “We are not enemies of the country. As much as you have the right, I also have the right to be in this building,” advocate Murtaza said. He requested that the court grant protective bail and sought directions that no arrest should be made in any other case unless it has been formally placed on record. In response to his request, Justice Khan observed, “I am passing orders only to the extent of the FIR that is before me.” Subsequently, Justice Khan granted protective bail to Mazari and Chattha and restrained police from arresting them in the case. Social media posts case July’s first information report (FIR) surfaced a day after the IHC granted Mazari and Chattha one-day protective bail in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts. The two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. It has been registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA). The case is being heard by a trial court in Islamabad, which had issued arrest warrants for the two last week. Subsequently, Mazari and Chattha approached the IHC , challenging the trial court’s January 15 arrest orders. Yesterday, the IHC declared the trial court’s order against them null and void and directed that they be granted four days to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. The IHC categorically clarified that Mazari and Chattha should not be arrested in the case. But, it also stated that if they failed to appear before the trial court, the protection granted under the order would stand automatically terminated. The trial court was further directed that in case of their non-appearance, proceedings may continue in accordance with the law. An Islamabad district and sessions court resumed hearing in the case today, in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. At the hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka expressed displeasure over the continued absence of the accused from the hearings and warned that their right to cross-examination would be terminated if the process was not completed within the court-mandated time. When the proceedings commenced, an assistant counsel representing Mazari and Chattah informed Judge Majoka that the IHC was simultaneously hearing their bail pleas and that they would appear before the trial court after proceedings at the high court. Upon receiving this information, the court adjourned the hearing until 1:30pm. When the hearing resumed, the court directed the prosecution to read out the IHC’s order. Judge Majoka observed that the IHC’s order had been received at 3:28pm on January 20 while the prosecution argued that the high court had upheld the trial court’s order to the extent of the cancellation of Mazari and Chattha’s bail and the issuance of arrest warrants for the accused. The judge observed that the case’s trial had to be completed within four days, in line with the IHC’s directives. Subsequently, the hearing was again adjourned until 2:30pm. However, Mazari and Chattha were still not present when the proceedings resumed, which prompted stern remarks from Judge Majoka. “Despite being granted two-day protective bail, the suspects failed to attend the proceedings, which appears to be a deliberate act intended to delay the trial,” he said. Judge Majoka noted that the high court had directed the trial court to complete the cross-examination within four days, and that the order was received on January 20. Accordingly, the accused had been directed to complete the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses by 3:30pm on January 24, the judge observed, issuing the directives that the accused must complete the cross-examination by the court-mandated time. He warned that no further time would be granted “if the court’s time is wasted”. “If the cross-examination is not completed by 3:30 pm on January 24, the right to cross-examine will stand terminated,” the court stated and adjourned the hearing till Thursday (tomorrow). ‘Legal harassment’ The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), meanwhile, expressed serious concern over what it called the “continued harassment” of Mazari and Chattha. In a statement posted on X, the HRCP noted that the two “now face yet another allegedly fabricated first information report that was filed immediately after the Islamabad High Court reinstated their bail in a previous case on charges under the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016” — a reference to the July 2025 case. “While they have been granted protective bail in this case as well, such a pattern of serial litigation appears designed to punish and intimidate individuals through legal harassment rather than to uphold due process. “We call on the authorities to immediately halt the misuse of the Peca laws, respect the orders of the superior judiciary and ensure that all citizens’ fundamental rights to liberty, fair trial and freedom of expression are fully protected,” the statement said.",

      "title_orig": "Japan restarts world’s biggest nuclear plant 15 years after Fukushima disaster",
      "summary_orig": "The world’s biggest nuclear power plant was restarted on Wednesday for the first time since the 2011 Fukushima disaster , its Japanese operator said, despite persistent safety concerns among residents. The plant was “started at 19:02”, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) spokesman Tatsuya Matoba told AFP of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata prefecture. The regional governor approved the resumption last month, although public opinion remains sharply divided. On Tuesday, a few dozen protesters — mostly elderly — braved freezing temperatures to demonstrate in the snow near the plant’s entrance, whose buildings line the Sea of Japan coast. “It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk? That makes no sense,” Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, told AFP . Around 60 per cent of residents oppose the restart, while 37pc support it, according to a survey conducted in September. TEPCO said on Wednesday it would “proceed with careful verification of each plant facility’s integrity” and address any issues appropriately and transparently. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted. The facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011. However, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has voiced support for the energy source. Fourteen reactors, mostly in western and southern Japan, have resumed operation since the post-Fukushima shutdown under strict safety rules, with 13 running as of mid January. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned. Nearly 15 years after the disaster, “the situation is still not under control in Fukushima, and TEPCO wants to revive a plant? For me, that’s absolutely unacceptable”, said Keisuke Abe, an 81-year-old demonstrator. ‘Anxious and fearful’ The vast Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex has been fitted with a 15-metre-high tsunami wall, elevated emergency power systems and other safety upgrades. However, residents raised concerns about the risk of a serious accident, citing frequent cover-up scandals, minor accidents and evacuation plans they say are inadequate. “I think it’s impossible to evacuate in an emergency,” Chie Takakuwa, a 79-year-old resident of Kariwa, told AFP . On January 8, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority. The petition said the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong quake in 2007. “We can’t remove the fear of being hit by another unforeseen earthquake,” it said. “Making many people anxious and fearful so as to send electricity to Tokyo … is intolerable.” Before the 2011 disaster — which killed around 18,000 people — nuclear power generated about a third of Japan’s electricity. String of scandals Japan’s nuclear industry has also faced a string of scandals and incidents in recent weeks, including data falsification by Chubu Electric Power to underestimate seismic risks. At Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, TEPCO said on Saturday that an alarm system failed during a test. “Safety is an ongoing process, which means operators involved in nuclear power must never be arrogant or overconfident,” TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa said in an interview with the Asahi daily newspaper. Japan is the world’s fifth-largest single-country emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the United States, India and Russia, and is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels. Nearly 70pc of its electricity in 2023 came from coal, gas and oil — a share Tokyo wants to slash to 30-40pc over the next 15 years as it expands renewable energy and nuclear power. Under a plan approved by the government in February, nuclear power will account for around a fifth of Japan’s energy supply by 2040 — up from around 8.5pc in the fiscal year 2023-24. Meanwhile, Japan still faces the daunting task of decommissioning the Fukushima plant, a project expected to take decades.",

      "title": "Japan restarts world’s biggest nuclear plant 15 years after Fukushima disaster",
      "summary": "The world’s biggest nuclear power plant was restarted on Wednesday for the first time since the 2011 Fukushima disaster , its Japanese operator said, despite persistent safety concerns among residents. The plant was “started at 19:02”, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) spokesman Tatsuya Matoba told AFP of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata prefecture. The regional governor approved the resumption last month, although public opinion remains sharply divided. On Tuesday, a few dozen protesters — mostly elderly — braved freezing temperatures to demonstrate in the snow near the plant’s entrance, whose buildings line the Sea of Japan coast. “It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk? That makes no sense,” Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, told AFP . Around 60 per cent of residents oppose the restart, while 37pc support it, according to a survey conducted in September. TEPCO said on Wednesday it would “proceed with careful verification of each plant facility’s integrity” and address any issues appropriately and transparently. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted. The facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011. However, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has voiced support for the energy source. Fourteen reactors, mostly in western and southern Japan, have resumed operation since the post-Fukushima shutdown under strict safety rules, with 13 running as of mid January. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned. Nearly 15 years after the disaster, “the situation is still not under control in Fukushima, and TEPCO wants to revive a plant? For me, that’s absolutely unacceptable”, said Keisuke Abe, an 81-year-old demonstrator. ‘Anxious and fearful’ The vast Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex has been fitted with a 15-metre-high tsunami wall, elevated emergency power systems and other safety upgrades. However, residents raised concerns about the risk of a serious accident, citing frequent cover-up scandals, minor accidents and evacuation plans they say are inadequate. “I think it’s impossible to evacuate in an emergency,” Chie Takakuwa, a 79-year-old resident of Kariwa, told AFP . On January 8, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority. The petition said the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong quake in 2007. “We can’t remove the fear of being hit by another unforeseen earthquake,” it said. “Making many people anxious and fearful so as to send electricity to Tokyo … is intolerable.” Before the 2011 disaster — which killed around 18,000 people — nuclear power generated about a third of Japan’s electricity.

      "summary_orig": "Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted an invitation to join US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” aimed at resolving conflicts, Netanyahu’s office said Wednesday. “Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that he has accepted US President Donald Trump’s invitation and will join as a member of the Board of Peace, which will be composed of leaders of the world,” the office said in a statement. The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of post-war Gaza, but its charter seen by AFP does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory, and members have to pay up to $1 billion for a permanent spot on it. The board “seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”, reads the preamble of the charter sent to countries invited to participate. It will be chaired by Trump himself, who will also “separately serve” as the representative of the United States. Dozens of countries and leaders have said they have received an invitation, including close US allies but also adversaries. A day earlier, the UAE president and Bahrain’s king accepted an invitation to sit on Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’, joining a handful of countries to have endorsed the initiative. Longtime US ally France, however, has indicated it will not join. While announcing the creation of the board last week, Trump also unveiled plans to establish a “Gaza Executive Board” operating under the body. The executive board would include Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi. Netanyahu has strongly objected to their inclusion. Ties between Turkey and Israel have deteriorated since Israel’s Gaza invasion started in October 2023 following an unprecedented attack by Hamas on Israel.",

      "summary_orig": "India will withdraw its diplomats’ families and dependents from Bangladesh in the face of security threats as tension rises ahead of a February 12 general election , an Indian official said on Wednesday. Campaigning begins on Thursday for Bangladesh’s election, which has sparked protests and counter-protests. Ties between the South Asian neighbours soured after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests. India’s past support for Hasina has frayed relations between the two neighbours since her overthrow. India’s withdrawal move was part of “internal readjustments”, the official said, without elaborating. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to Indian media reports of New Delhi’s decision. It was not immediately clear when the families would return. The foreign ministries of India and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In December, India summoned Bangladesh’s high commissioner, or ambassador to voice its concern over what it called a deteriorating security situation there, particularly threats targeting the Indian mission in the capital, Dhaka. Bangladesh’s ex-premier Hasina was sentenced to death in November after a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on the student-led uprising in 2024. The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly sought Hasina’s extradition to Bangladesh, while rejecting New Delhi’s concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community. Meanwhile, a popular student leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 uprising, Sharif Osman Hadi, was wounded in an assassination attempt last month and died after being flown to Singapore for treatment. Hadi was a senior leader of the student protest group Inqilab Mancha and an outspoken critic of India. His death set off violent protests with angry mobs torching several buildings, including two major newspapers deemed to favour India, as well as a prominent cultural institution.",

      "title_orig": "HISTORY: THE FORGOTTEN MASSACRE OF MULTAN",
      "summary_orig": "Illustration by Sarah Durrani On January 2, 1978, Gen Ziaul Haq’s regime ordered security forces to open fire at workers striking at Colony Textile Mills, Multan, allegedly killing 133 people. No first information report (FIR) was registered, no civilian trial was held and, aside from a military inquiry whose contents were never shared, a public acknowledgement of this state atrocity has never been made. Instead, what remains is a carefully managed absence from Pakistani history books. The tragedy that occurred that cold winter afternoon in Multan was a direct response to industrial workers who had emerged as a major political force in 1970s Pakistan. Following the success of the 1969 students’ and workers’ movement that led to the overthrow of Gen Ayub Khan, leftist politics had strengthened demands for more equitable wealth distribution. During the Ayub dictatorship, state loans given to a small circle of elite industrialists had propped up development statistics but, as wealth disparity dramatically increased, Pakistan’s working class was pushed to economic desperation. In January 1978, Gen Zia’s martial law regime mercilessly mowed down striking textile mill workers in the ‘City of Saints.’ Till today, the scale of the killings is disputed and no official account exists of what is widely considered the bloodiest massacre in Pakistan’s labour history… Ayub’s removal and the civil war in East Pakistan, which led to the creation of Bangladesh, forced President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to develop legislation for workers’ rights. In February 1972, his martial law government announced new labour laws for Pakistan. The military, industrialists and even the politicians who had taken their votes were all alarmed at the strength of consolidated worker power. Bhutto’s labour laws, though flawed, dramatically increased the number of labour unions registered in the country and led to regular strike actions by worker groups over fair pay. Yet the new labour reforms only existed on paper. Mere months after they came into effect, on June 7, 1972, police killed at least three workers who were protesting against delayed wages by the owners of Feroz Sultan Textile Mills at SITE, Karachi. During one of the funeral processions, police opened fire again, leading to more deaths. Bhutto showed no sympathy, saying the strikers were being manipulated by anti-Pakistan elements. When Zia took over the country, his martial law framed labour unrest as a threat to public order. This was the most violent act by the state against labourers in Pakistani history — a systematic erasure that reveals the nexus of state-capital power under martial law. Elite Capture Commemorative slab at a graveyard in Frontier Colony in Karachi for labourers killed following protests in June 1972 Understanding the massacre requires understanding who owned the mill — and their proximity to power. The Colony Group, owners of Multan Colony Textile Mills, exemplified the industrial elite that had prospered under the Ayub regime. With its business primarily in textile manufacturing, this Chinioti/ Sheikh family group had been well-established before Partition and gained considerable strength due to limited competition in the nascent state. In 1961, the Colony Group was a part of the big five industrial houses, who each held over Rs50 million — a vast fortune by 1961 standards and equivalent to approximately Rs10 billion today, adjusted for an average annual inflation rate of 8.6 percent — in assets. As with the other industrial groups, it benefitted from the establishment of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) in 1952. Naseer A. Sheikh, the eldest son of the group’s founder Mohammad Ismaeel, served on PIDC’s Board of Directors. Even after the conglomerate split into two, the Colony Naseer Group, which oversaw the mills, was the seventh richest company in Pakistan in 1970, according to economist Rashid Amjad, former vice chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics. Even after Bhutto started nationalisation in 1972, the Colony Naseer Group — despite losing Rs93.9 million or 49.5 percent of its assets — was the sixth richest industrial house in Pakistan. When the tragedy happened in 1978, 13,000 workers were employed at Colony Textile Mills. Media Coverage and the State Story Reporting on the events of January 2, 1978, was carefully managed. The government-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) had been given a handout, and Dawn’s front page on January 3 carried the small headline “Five killed in Multan firing.” International papers reported similar figures, with The New York Times using a United Press International (UPI) wire, stating: “Five Killed and 10 Hurt As Pakistan Police Open Fire at Strikers.” The French publication Le Monde and British daily The Guardian carried the same number. The Times of India, however, reported on January 4 that “at least a dozen people were shot dead… The death toll may be 50.” In Pakistan, the APP report framed workers as unreasonable from its opening line, claiming they “refused to accept” a mutually agreed bonus and “proceeded on illegal strike” from December 29, 1977. The APP report of the incident stated that workers had demanded a bonus of four-and-a-half-months’ pay, which the Colony Group management refused, saying as it was “not commensurate with the margin of profit.” The APP report continued that, on January 2, 1978, the labourers on strike became “unruly and rowdy and thousands of them encircled the police force and started brick-batting, resulting in injuries to eight of the policemen, including one ASI [assistant sub-inspector] and one head constable.” The report concluded that the police had to react in self-defence against a crowd that could not be managed and had turned violent. “The police was ordered to lathi-charge [baton-charge], which they did, and teargas was also used to disperse the unruly mob.” Inquiry and Discipline Memorial for slain labourers, with their graves painted red at Frontier Colony, Karachi | Photos courtesy Piler In the following days, swift administrative action was reported. The mill management announced compensation for the deceased and, within two days of the massacre, the martial law administrator (MLA) for Punjab suspended Multan’s senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chaudhry Niamatullah, assistant commissioner (AC) Jam Jan Mohammad, and the area’s station house officer (SHO), Raja Khizar Hayat. A three-member inquiry committee was also established, with Brig S.M. Ilyas, Col Naeem and Magistrate Sardar Alam, who were going to record “in camera” witness statements. A statement was also taken from Mughis Sheikh, Naseer’s younger brother, who managed the mill. On January 6, 1978, an “official clarification” was issued, in which the commissioner of Multan Division verified that those killed at Colony Textile Mills “are not more than 14.” This clarification also stated that the number of dead included those whose families had taken them to their villages, instead of the city hospital, “which resulted in their ultimate deaths, as they could not get proper medical aid” — a claim that appeared to shift blame from the shooting to delayed medical care. Additionally, it reported that the administration claimed it did not bury any bodies, with all of them handed over to their families — a claim later contradicted by witness testimonies. Even Dawn, in a restrained editorial titled ‘A tragedy in Multan’, could only express that, “It is extremely sad that this major clash should have taken place in the days of a Martial Law regime dedicated to the revival of democratic rule and social harmony.” Merely 13 days after the massacre, on January 15, martial law (ML) authorities ordered workers to return — framing it as an ‘appeal’. Maj Gen Ejaz Azim, Multan’s deputy MLA, along with other officials, visited the factory and claimed that 92 percent of workers were present and the mills were functioning. With attention having rapidly shifted to restoring production, workers were promised a bonus equivalent to three months of basic pay on February 1 and recreation allowance on May 1. However, workers were denied pay for the days they were on strike, from December 29 to January 2. ML administrators were now regularly visiting the factory and, on January 21, Maj Gen Azim addressed workers that Gen Zia himself had expressed “heartfelt sympathies” and gave “assurance that justice will be done.” BEYOND THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT Yet what the martial law administration allowed in reporting differed drastically from what those on the ground — and researchers documenting Gen Zia-era abuses — have recorded. Gen Zia was close to the Sheikh family, having served as Corps Commander Multan right before his appointment as chief of army staff. He had arrived in Multan on January 2 to attend the wedding of Mughis Sheikh’s daughter. Workers reported hearing that the bride’s dowry was 10 times the amount of the bonuses they had demanded. According to Hassan Gardezi and Jamil Rashid in Pakistan: The Roots of Dictatorship, workers had occupied the factory floor since December 29, when the strike started, preventing a lockout by the mill management. Aslam Khwaja in People’s Movement in Pakistan writes that, during the afternoon shift-change on the day of the tragedy on January 2, when workers gathered at the gate for a union meeting, police asked them to end the “illegal” strike. Meanwhile, during the wedding, Gen Zia was allegedly told that workers — having heard of his presence — had gathered in their thousands and were marching towards the event. What followed next remains shrouded in mystery, even after 48 years: large numbers killed with over 400 injured as, according to news accounts, police opened fire. Those involved in the strike and affected by the incident vehemently argue that Gen Zia ordered troops to open fire on the protesters. Mystery also surrounds the number of casualties, with figures varying drastically — from state-reported counts of 14 deaths to union claims exceeding 200. The most widely-accepted figure among researchers and labour activists is 133, collated by the Mazdoor Action Committee, which was formed by local labour organisers in the wake of the massacre. According to political activist and theorist Lal Khan, those desperately trying to escape the bullets were crushed in the ensuing stampede. When the firing began, workers’ families who lived within the mill’s residential compound came outside to get the bodies of their loved ones, but were prevented from retrieving them by law enforcement. The firing continued for three hours; by six in the evening, law enforcement had seized control. The burial site for such a large number also remains disputed, with testimonies suggesting that some victims were still alive when thrown among the dead. Testimonies available today mention two possible locations: one, a sewage drain where bodies were dumped by tractor; another, a hastily dug ditch. Multiple people in Multan, speaking to Eos on condition of anonymity, said that the bodies were buried so badly that scavenger animals picked at limbs protruding from the ground. Aftermath and Denial Soon after the tragedy, the United States Department of State lauded Gen Zia for his human rights record, particularly with reference to arbitrary arrests. In a report issued even a year after the tragedy, the US state department made no mention of the massacre. Instead, it reported that “The labour movement in Pakistan is limited by the relatively small size of the industrial sector.” The report acknowledged that “Martial Law regulations currently prohibit both strikes and political activity by unions.” Meanwhile, accounts of the true scale of the violence, contradicting the state narrative, had emerged from Multan. Urdu dailies Imroze and Mussawat had reported the firing, and the editor of Imroze Multan, Masood Ashar, was transferred to Lahore. The Karachi Workers Coordination Committee (KWCC) observed a week of mourning, and also announced that a fact-finding delegation was being sent to Multan. The Punjab chapter of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) separately announced the formation of a five-member fact-finding committee. Labour unions across Pakistan — including the Muttahida Mazdoor Federation, the National Labour Federation and others — demanded a judicial inquiry. Journalist organisations also condemned the suppression of accurate reporting. Separately, a meeting of journalists at the Karachi Press Club on January 8 asked for a new inquiry over the police firing at workers in SITE in June 1972, which they suspected was also a cover-up. Meanwhile, ML administrators were adamant that knowledge of the event be suppressed. Intensifying pressure on workers at the textile mill, on March 12, a summary military court of Multan sentenced three labour leaders for organising a strike on February 16. Wasl Mohammad received one-and-a-half years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) and 15 lashes. Amir Ali and Abdul Khaliq received nine months RI and seven lashes and one year RI and 10 lashes respectively. No Recognition Despite the scale of the violence, the state’s grip on affairs in Pakistan was such that no FIR was filed. Outside of the military inquiry, whose contents were never shared publicly, no official account exists. The government has never articulated what exactly happened. The state has never accepted that the massacre took place. By contrast, the 1972 killings of labourers in Karachi have some recognition. The Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research (Piler) erected a memorial in Frontier Colony, Karachi, and the graves of the slain workers are painted red. At Colony Textile Mills, Multan, no memorial exists. The cruelty of denial is still starkly present. Mughis Sheikh died in 2024 and former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani paid condolences to the family. Meanwhile, workers from January 2, 1978, still await justice and recognition. Yet on Pakistan’s 75th independence anniversary in 2022 , Punjab’s Labour and Human Resource Department awarded Colony Textile Mills a “Best Employer Award.” This shows that, to this day, state and elite interests remain the same. But there is a way to dispel this notion: by making public the sealed military inquiry and convening an independent investigation to finally establish what really transpired that day.

No first information report (FIR) was registered, no civilian trial was held and, aside from a military inquiry whose contents were never shared, a public acknowledgement of this state atrocity has never been made. Instead, what remains is a carefully managed absence from Pakistani history books. The tragedy that occurred that cold winter afternoon in Multan was a direct response to industrial workers who had emerged as a major political force in 1970s Pakistan. Following the success of the 1969 students’ and workers’ movement that led to the overthrow of Gen Ayub Khan, leftist politics had strengthened demands for more equitable wealth distribution. During the Ayub dictatorship, state loans given to a small circle of elite industrialists had propped up development statistics but, as wealth disparity dramatically increased, Pakistan’s working class was pushed to economic desperation. In January 1978, Gen Zia’s martial law regime mercilessly mowed down striking textile mill workers in the ‘City of Saints.’ Till today, the scale of the killings is disputed and no official account exists of what is widely considered the bloodiest massacre in Pakistan’s labour history… Ayub’s removal and the civil war in East Pakistan, which led to the creation of Bangladesh, forced President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to develop legislation for workers’ rights. In February 1972, his martial law government announced new labour laws for Pakistan. The military, industrialists and even the politicians who had taken their votes were all alarmed at the strength of consolidated worker power. Bhutto’s labour laws, though flawed, dramatically increased the number of labour unions registered in the country and led to regular strike actions by worker groups over fair pay. Yet the new labour reforms only existed on paper. Mere months after they came into effect, on June 7, 1972, police killed at least three workers who were protesting against delayed wages by the owners of Feroz Sultan Textile Mills at SITE, Karachi. During one of the funeral processions, police opened fire again, leading to more deaths. Bhutto showed no sympathy, saying the strikers were being manipulated by anti-Pakistan elements. When Zia took over the country, his martial law framed labour unrest as a threat to public order. This was the most violent act by the state against labourers in Pakistani history — a systematic erasure that reveals the nexus of state-capital power under martial law. Elite Capture Commemorative slab at a graveyard in Frontier Colony in Karachi for labourers killed following protests in June 1972 Understanding the massacre requires understanding who owned the mill — and their proximity to power. The Colony Group, owners of Multan Colony Textile Mills, exemplified the industrial elite that had prospered under the Ayub regime. With its business primarily in textile manufacturing, this Chinioti/ Sheikh family group had been well-established before Partition and gained considerable strength due to limited competition in the nascent state. In 1961, the Colony Group was a part of the big five industrial houses, who each held over Rs50 million — a vast fortune by 1961 standards and equivalent to approximately Rs10 billion today, adjusted for an average annual inflation rate of 8.6 percent — in assets. As with the other industrial groups, it benefitted from the establishment of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) in 1952. Naseer A. Sheikh, the eldest son of the group’s founder Mohammad Ismaeel, served on PIDC’s Board of Directors. Even after the conglomerate split into two, the Colony Naseer Group, which oversaw the mills, was the seventh richest company in Pakistan in 1970, according to economist Rashid Amjad, former vice chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics. Even after Bhutto started nationalisation in 1972, the Colony Naseer Group — despite losing Rs93.9 million or 49.5 percent of its assets — was the sixth richest industrial house in Pakistan. When the tragedy happened in 1978, 13,000 workers were employed at Colony Textile Mills. Media Coverage and the State Story Reporting on the events of January 2, 1978, was carefully managed. The government-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) had been given a handout, and Dawn’s front page on January 3 carried the small headline “Five killed in Multan firing.” International papers reported similar figures, with The New York Times using a United Press International (UPI) wire, stating: “Five Killed and 10 Hurt As Pakistan Police Open Fire at Strikers.” The French publication Le Monde and British daily The Guardian carried the same number. The Times of India, however, reported on January 4 that “at least a dozen people were shot dead… The death toll may be 50.” In Pakistan, the APP report framed workers as unreasonable from its opening line, claiming they “refused to accept” a mutually agreed bonus and “proceeded on illegal strike” from December 29, 1977. The APP report of the incident stated that workers had demanded a bonus of four-and-a-half-months’ pay, which the Colony Group management refused, saying as it was “not commensurate with the margin of profit.” The APP report continued that, on January 2, 1978, the labourers on strike became “unruly and rowdy and thousands of them encircled the police force and started brick-batting, resulting in injuries to eight of the policemen, including one ASI [assistant sub-inspector] and one head constable.” The report concluded that the police had to react in self-defence against a crowd that could not be managed and had turned violent. “The police was ordered to lathi-charge [baton-charge], which they did, and teargas was also used to disperse the unruly mob.” Inquiry and Discipline Memorial for slain labourers, with their graves painted red at Frontier Colony, Karachi | Photos courtesy Piler In the following days, swift administrative action was reported. The mill management announced compensation for the deceased and, within two days of the massacre, the martial law administrator (MLA) for Punjab suspended Multan’s senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chaudhry Niamatullah, assistant commissioner (AC) Jam Jan Mohammad, and the area’s station house officer (SHO), Raja Khizar Hayat. A three-member inquiry committee was also established, with Brig S.M. Ilyas, Col Naeem and Magistrate Sardar Alam, who were going to record “in camera” witness statements. A statement was also taken from Mughis Sheikh, Naseer’s younger brother, who managed the mill. On January 6, 1978, an “official clarification” was issued, in which the commissioner of Multan Division verified that those killed at Colony Textile Mills “are not more than 14.” This clarification also stated that the number of dead included those whose families had taken them to their villages, instead of the city hospital, “which resulted in their ultimate deaths, as they could not get proper medical aid” — a claim that appeared to shift blame from the shooting to delayed medical care. Additionally, it reported that the administration claimed it did not bury any bodies, with all of them handed over to their families — a claim later contradicted by witness testimonies. Even Dawn, in a restrained editorial titled ‘A tragedy in Multan’, could only express that, “It is extremely sad that this major clash should have taken place in the days of a Martial Law regime dedicated to the revival of democratic rule and social harmony.” Merely 13 days after the massacre, on January 15, martial law (ML) authorities ordered workers to return — framing it as an ‘appeal’. Maj Gen Ejaz Azim, Multan’s deputy MLA, along with other officials, visited the factory and claimed that 92 percent of workers were present and the mills were functioning. With attention having rapidly shifted to restoring production, workers were promised a bonus equivalent to three months of basic pay on February 1 and recreation allowance on May 1. However, workers were denied pay for the days they were on strike, from December 29 to January 2. ML administrators were now regularly visiting the factory and, on January 21, Maj Gen Azim addressed workers that Gen Zia himself had expressed “heartfelt sympathies” and gave “assurance that justice will be done.” BEYOND THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT Yet what the martial law administration allowed in reporting differed drastically from what those on the ground — and researchers documenting Gen Zia-era abuses — have recorded. Gen Zia was close to the Sheikh family, having served as Corps Commander Multan right before his appointment as chief of army staff. He had arrived in Multan on January 2 to attend the wedding of Mughis Sheikh’s daughter. Workers reported hearing that the bride’s dowry was 10 times the amount of the bonuses they had demanded. According to Hassan Gardezi and Jamil Rashid in Pakistan: The Roots of Dictatorship, workers had occupied the factory floor since December 29, when the strike started, preventing a lockout by the mill management. Aslam Khwaja in People’s Movement in Pakistan writes that, during the afternoon shift-change on the day of the tragedy on January 2, when workers gathered at the gate for a union meeting, police asked them to end the “illegal” strike. Meanwhile, during the wedding, Gen Zia was allegedly told that workers — having heard of his presence — had gathered in their thousands and were marching towards the event. What followed next remains shrouded in mystery, even after 48 years: large numbers killed with over 400 injured as, according to news accounts, police opened fire. Those involved in the strike and affected by the incident vehemently argue that Gen Zia ordered troops to open fire on the protesters. Mystery also surrounds the number of casualties, with figures varying drastically — from state-reported counts of 14 deaths to union claims exceeding 200. The most widely-accepted figure among researchers and labour activists is 133, collated by the Mazdoor Action Committee, which was formed by local labour organisers in the wake of the massacre. According to political activist and theorist Lal Khan, those desperately trying to escape the bullets were crushed in the ensuing stampede. When the firing began, workers’ families who lived within the mill’s residential compound came outside to get the bodies of their loved ones, but were prevented from retrieving them by law enforcement. The firing continued for three hours; by six in the evening, law enforcement had seized control. The burial site for such a large number also remains disputed, with testimonies suggesting that some victims were still alive when thrown among the dead. Testimonies available today mention two possible locations: one, a sewage drain where bodies were dumped by tractor; another, a hastily dug ditch. Multiple people in Multan, speaking to Eos on condition of anonymity, said that the bodies were buried so badly that scavenger animals picked at limbs protruding from the ground. Aftermath and Denial Soon after the tragedy, the United States Department of State lauded Gen Zia for his human rights record, particularly with reference to arbitrary arrests. In a report issued even a year after the tragedy, the US state department made no mention of the massacre. Instead, it reported that “The labour movement in Pakistan is limited by the relatively small size of the industrial sector.” The report acknowledged that “Martial Law regulations currently prohibit both strikes and political activity by unions.” Meanwhile, accounts of the true scale of the violence, contradicting the state narrative, had emerged from Multan. Urdu dailies Imroze and Mussawat had reported the firing, and the editor of Imroze Multan, Masood Ashar, was transferred to Lahore. The Karachi Workers Coordination Committee (KWCC) observed a week of mourning, and also announced that a fact-finding delegation was being sent to Multan. The Punjab chapter of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) separately announced the formation of a five-member fact-finding committee. Labour unions across Pakistan — including the Muttahida Mazdoor Federation, the National Labour Federation and others — demanded a judicial inquiry. Journalist organisations also condemned the suppression of accurate reporting. Separately, a meeting of journalists at the Karachi Press Club on January 8 asked for a new inquiry over the police firing at workers in SITE in June 1972, which they suspected was also a cover-up. Meanwhile, ML administrators were adamant that knowledge of the event be suppressed. Intensifying pressure on workers at the textile mill, on March 12, a summary military court of Multan sentenced three labour leaders for organising a strike on February 16. Wasl Mohammad received one-and-a-half years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) and 15 lashes. Amir Ali and Abdul Khaliq received nine months RI and seven lashes and one year RI and 10 lashes respectively. No Recognition Despite the scale of the violence, the state’s grip on affairs in Pakistan was such that no FIR was filed. Outside of the military inquiry, whose contents were never shared publicly, no official account exists. The government has never articulated what exactly happened. The state has never accepted that the massacre took place. By contrast, the 1972 killings of labourers in Karachi have some recognition. The Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research (Piler) erected a memorial in Frontier Colony, Karachi, and the graves of the slain workers are painted red. At Colony Textile Mills, Multan, no memorial exists. The cruelty of denial is still starkly present. Mughis Sheikh died in 2024 and former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani paid condolences to the family. Meanwhile, workers from January 2, 1978, still await justice and recognition. Yet on Pakistan’s 75th independence anniversary in 2022 , Punjab’s Labour and Human Resource Department awarded Colony Textile Mills a “Best Employer Award.” This shows that, to this day, state and elite interests remain the same. But there is a way to dispel this notion: by making public the sealed military inquiry and convening an independent investigation to finally establish what really transpired that day.
