      "summary_orig": "PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari highlighted on Sunday the significance of the politics of reconciliation, saying that the ruling party and its allies, as well as the opposition would have to play their role in this regard. Bilawal expressed these views while speaking to the media at the inauguration ceremony of the Sindh Institute of Child Health and Neonatology in Larkana. He recalled that former prime minister Benazir Bhutto had given the message of “truth and reconciliation” and “reconciliation in politics”. Linking it with the country’s progress and economic prosperity, he said the ruling party and its allies would have to play their part for this while the opposition would also have to play a “responsible role”. “If stringent [measures] are taken in response to the politics of extremism, then there should be no complaints,” he remarked, quoting English idiom “if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen”. He added that “if you (the PTI) attack a national institution just because of a small NAB (National Accountability Bureau) case against your leader and because of a small arrest, then don’t complain. Action will be taken against you in accordance with the law and Constitution”. Bilawal maintained had there been PPP in PTI’s place, the consequences it would have had to face would have been more severe. He advised the PTI to let go of the “politics of extremism”, saying that it would not be better for the party itself and its works, but it would also have a positive impact on the country’s politics. The PPP chairperson then went on to say that while Benazir’s philosophy was that of the politics of reconciliation, but President Asif Ali Zardari had played the “biggest role” in its implementation. “From the first day after the election till yesterday in my speech, and even within the party, my stance has been that President Zardari will have to play his role. “President Zardari not just has a [track record] but also the people’s confidence that he is capable of playing a role for reconciliation in politics,” Bilawal said. However, he pointed out, there was a “unique dynamic” that had to be considered in current circumstances. “The situation on frontiers with India and Afghanistan is before you, and internally terrorism is increasing,” he said, adding that in this situation, the role of opposition parties was of most importance. “If they have to operate like an extremist party, then the state’s response would be in accordance with that […] But if they adopt a political attitude, [other] parties may get some political space to play a role in reducing the political division and polarisation in the country.” He said political reconciliation was the way forward and an environment conducive to that would have to be created, else the people and the country would face the consequent loss. In response to a question about Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who recently demanded fresh elections across the country, Bilawal said all political parties should play their role to ensure that free and fair elections were held, whenever they were to be held. “And if any amendments, any changes in the law are required for that — we will have to increase people’s trust in the election commission. “There is no point in holding elections if allegations of rigging are to be made again. So, now that there is time and the writing on the wall is that elections will not be held early, serious political parties should try to bring electoral reforms aimed at increasing the trust of people, as well as the political parties in the election commission,” Bilawal said. Referring to the complaints with regards to the recently held by-elections, he said he wouldn’t want polls, be it by-polls or general elections, to be held in such a situation and become a cause of “more political instability”. Again highlighting the need for opposition to work towards reconciliation, Bilawal said that the government would also have take some measures. “Parliament should be made functional. The [platform] of Parliament should be used — politicians and political workers will have to take several measures for us to be able to create space for tolerance in politics,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in rejecting Israel‘s recognition of self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”. The statement also registered the countries’ rejection of any “potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land”. The joint statement has been issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Iran, Iraq Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye, Yemen and the OIC. Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords. Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy — and relative peace and stability — since 1991, when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country. Israel’s decision could reshape regional dynamics and test Somalia’s longstanding opposition to secession. The Foreign Office (FO) released the joint statement by 21 nations, including Pakistan, and the OIC on Sunday, underscoring their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of the Federal Republic of Somalia. The statement said that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”. The 21 nations and the OIC condemned the measure in the strongest terms, saying that it “constitutes a grave violation of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, which explicitly stipulates the imperative of protecting the sovereignty of states and their territorial integrity, and reflects Israel’s expansionist” policy. They underscored their full support of the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and the unequivocal rejection of any measures that undermine the unity of Somalia, its territorial integrity or its sovereignty over its entire territory. “The recognition of parts of states constitutes a serious precedent and threatens international peace and security, and violates the cardinal principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,” their joint statement read. They registered their “full rejection of any potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land, which is unequivocally rejected in any form as a matter of principle”. In a separate statement on Saturday, the FO termed Israel’s recognition of Somaliland an attempt to undermine Somalia’s sovereignty. “Pakistan strongly condemns any attempts to undermine the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia, and rejects, in this regard, the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” the FO said in a statement. Islamabad called on the international community to step in to reject any such actions, and “prevent and deter Israel from undermining the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the broader region”. For its part, Somalia has declared the Israeli decision a “deliberate attack” on its sovereignty. Meanwhile, the African Union has warned the move risks “setting a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications for peace and stability across the continent”. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said on the social media platform X on Saturday that Israel had previously identified Somaliland “as a destination for the forced displacement of our Palestinian people, particularly from the Gaza Strip”. It warned against any “complicity” with such plans. While several other nations, as well as the European Union, have called for respecting Somalia’s sovereignty, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has characterised the recognition as a continuation of the “spirit of the Abraham Accords”. However, the United States signalled it would not follow Israel’s lead. When asked by the New York Post whether the US planned to recognise Somaliland, President Trump said, “No.” “Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?” Trump said, distancing Washington from the move.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The government has declared YouTuber Adil Farooq Raja, who is also a former Pakistan Army officer and currently resides in the United Kingdom, a proscribed person under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. “The federal government has reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Adil Farooq Raja has been demonstrating his sustained involvement in activities posing a serious threat to the security, integrity, and public order of Pakistan. “He has consistently misused online platforms to promote, facilitate, and amplify anti-state narratives and propaganda associated with proscribed terrorist organisations, thereby acting in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty and defence of Pakistan,” read the notification declaring the YouTuber a proscribed person. The notification was issued by the interior ministry and is dated December 27. It said, “In exercise of powers conferred by Section 11ee of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, the federal government is pleased to direct to list Mr Adil Farooq Raja in the Fourth Schedule to the said Act as a proscribed person for the purposes of the said Act.” The notification was issued after the federal cabinet approved the summary for Raja‘s proscription, the summary for which had been submitted by the interior ministry on December 23. The development came roughly 20 days after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi handed over the extradition papers for Raja — who has positioned himself as a whistleblower — former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar to UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott. Prior to that, Naqvi had announced a crackdown on those involved in fake news, declaring that the government would repatriate from the UK YouTubers involved in this activity or the targeting of state institutions. Raja had reacted to the development in a post on X, saying: “They may call the British High Commissioner to complain, but such a complaint is itself unlawful under UK statutes, as we have committed no wrongdoing.” On December 10, Raja had also been ordered to pay £350,000 in damages and legal costs after a London high court ruled he had defamed a former intelligence officer with unfounded allegations of corruption and electoral interference. In 2023, Raja was handed 14 years of jail sentence following his Field General Court Martial for “inciting sedition” and stripped of his military rank. While the military’s media affairs wing did not directly link the convictions to the events of May 9, Raja and Mehdi had been accused by the Islamabad police of playing a significant role in fomenting rebellion and inciting attacks on military installations during widespread protests that followed PTI leader Imran Khan’s arrest on that day.",

      "title_orig": "Zelensky to meet Trump in Florida for talks on Ukraine peace plan",
      "summary_orig": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump will meet in Florida on Sunday to hammer out a plan to end the war in Ukraine, but face major differences on crucial issues and provocations from Russian air attacks. Russia struck Kyiv and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. Zelensky called it Russia’s response to the ongoing US-brokered peace efforts. Zelensky has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine’s contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump’s Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics. The Ukrainian president and his delegation arrived in Florida late on Saturday, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya said on X. “Good evening, Florida!” Kyslytsya wrote, accompanying the post with a photo of an aircraft bearing the US president’s surname on the fuselage. Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv’s control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday’s talks might produce. The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a US proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelensky said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote. Axios said US officials viewed Zelensky’s willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote. A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan. Zelensky’s in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1pm (11pm PKT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States. Sticking points over territory Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelensky said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90 per cent finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved. While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines. The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms. Zelensky, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km of its territory per day in 2025. Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12pc of its territory, including about 90pc of Donbas, 75pc of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates. Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join Nato. Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack Nato members. The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan , which emerged from talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November. Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and US negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan. Canada, European allies rally behind Kyiv Saturday’s air attacks show that Putin does not want peace, Zelensky said to reporters after arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney said peace “requires a willing Russia”. “The barbarism that we saw overnight — the attack on Kyiv — shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time,” Carney said, pledging C$2.5 billion (US$1.83bn) in additional economic aid to Ukraine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke with Zelensky along with other European leaders on Saturday, said on X that their shared objective remained “a just and lasting peace” that preserved Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strengthening the country’s security and defence capabilities. Zelensky said he would speak with European leaders again after he meets with Trump.",

Zelensky called it Russia’s response to the ongoing US-brokered peace efforts. Zelensky has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine’s contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump’s Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics. The Ukrainian president and his delegation arrived in Florida late on Saturday, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya said on X. “Good evening, Florida!” Kyslytsya wrote, accompanying the post with a photo of an aircraft bearing the US president’s surname on the fuselage. Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv’s control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday’s talks might produce. The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a US proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelensky said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote. Axios said US officials viewed Zelensky’s willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote. A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan. Zelensky’s in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1pm (11pm PKT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States. Sticking points over territory Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelensky said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90 per cent finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved. While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines. The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms. Zelensky, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km of its territory per day in 2025. Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12pc of its territory, including about 90pc of Donbas, 75pc of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates. Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join Nato. Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack Nato members. The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan , which emerged from talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November. Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and US negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan. Canada, European allies rally behind Kyiv Saturday’s air attacks show that Putin does not want peace, Zelensky said to reporters after arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney said peace “requires a willing Russia”. “The barbarism that we saw overnight — the attack on Kyiv — shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time,” Carney said, pledging C$2.5 billion (US$1.83bn) in additional economic aid to Ukraine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke with Zelensky along with other European leaders on Saturday, said on X that their shared objective remained “a just and lasting peace” that preserved Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strengthening the country’s security and defence capabilities. Zelensky said he would speak with European leaders again after he meets with Trump.",

      "summary_orig": "All-rounder Shadab Khan has been recalled to Pakistan’s T20I set-up, while senior players Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi have been left out as the national selectors on Sunday announced a 15-member squad for next month’s three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka. The squad will be led by Salman Ali Agha, who enjoyed a heavy workload in the format this year, featuring in a record 34 T20Is — the most by any Pakistan player in a calendar year. Shadab, 27, last played a T20I for Pakistan in June before undergoing shoulder surgery earlier this year. After completing a successful rehabilitation programme at the National Cricket Academy, the leg-spinning all-rounder is currently in action in Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL), a factor that appears to have aided his return to international contention. While Babar and Shaheen’s omission is notable, both players are also currently featuring in the BBL, and their absence is understood to be part of a broader rotation policy rather than a permanent exclusion. With the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup approaching, the selectors appear keen to assess different combinations and expand the pool of players available for the global event. Another notable inclusion is uncapped wicketkeeper-batter Khawaja Nafay. The 23-year-old, who has been part of the Pakistan Shaheens set-up, has played 32 T20 matches and scored at a strike rate of 132.81, earning his first senior call-up. Pakistan are scheduled to depart for Sri Lanka in the first week of January, with all three T20Is to be played at the Rangiri Dambulla International Cricket Stadium in Dambulla on January 7, 9 and 11. The series forms part of Pakistan’s preparations for the T20 World Cup, which will be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8. Pakistan are set to play all their World Cup fixtures in Colombo. Squad: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abdul Samad, Abrar Ahmad, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Nafay (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan (wicket-keeper), Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Usman Khan (wicket-keeper), Usman Tariq",

      "summary_orig": "KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said on Saturday they were working with neighbouring Tajikistan to investigate a border clash earlier this week that killed five people, including two Tajik guards. Tajikistan announced on Thursday that three members of a “terrorist” group had crossed into the Central Asian country “illegally” at Khatlon province, which borders Afghanistan. Tajik security forces killed the trio, but two border guards also died in the clash, the Tajik national security committee said. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said on Saturday that “we have started serious investigations into” the recent “incidents” on Tajik soil. “I spoke to the foreign minister of Tajikistan and we are working together to prevent such incidents,” he told an event in Kabul. “We are worried that some malicious circles want to destroy the relations between two neighbouring countries,” the minister added, without elaborating. Tajikistan shares a mountainous border of about 1,350 kilometres with Afghanistan and has had tense relations with Kabul’s Taliban authorities, who returned to power in 2021. Unlike other Central Asian leaders, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, who has been in power since 1992, has criticised the Taliban and urged them to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks in Afghanistan. At least five Chinese nationals were killed and several wounded in two separate attacks along the border with Afghanistan in late November and early December, according to Tajik authorities. According to a UN report in December, the jihadist group Jamaat Ansarullah “has fighters spread across different regions of Afghanistan” with a primary goal “to destabilise the situation in Tajikistan”.

      "summary_orig": "RIYADH: The Saudi-led coalition warned on Saturday it would back Yemen’s government in any military confrontation with separatist forces and urged them to withdraw “peacefully” from recently-seized provinces. The statements came a day after reported Saudi air strikes on separatist positions in Yemen’s Hadramawt province — and after Washington called for restraint in the rapidly escalating conflict. General Turki al-Malki, the spokesman for the coalition, said they would act “directly and at the appropriate moment… to protect civilian life”, according to the Saudi news agency SPA . Saudi Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman posted on X that troops from the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) should “peacefully hand over” two regional governorates to the government. Rubio calls for restraint, diplomatic efforts on Yemen “It’s time,” he posted, “at this sensitive moment, to let reason prevail by withdrawing from the two provinces and doing so peacefully.” The STC had warned on Friday that they were undeterred after strikes blamed on Saudi Arabia hit their positions, in the latest escalation since they seized large swathes of territory in the Hadramawt and Mahrah provinces. There were no immediate reports of casualties in the strikes. In recent weeks, separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates and seeking to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen have made territorial gains. On Saturday, hundreds of Yemeni tribesmen gathered in Aden to ask the STC’s leaders to announce the independence of South Yemen, according to the separatist-affiliated Aden Independent Channel. The channel aired footage of a large crowd marching and waving the South Yemen independence flag alongside the UAE’s flag. Experts say their successes have embarrassed regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia, the main backer of the internationally-recognised Yemeni government. Farea al-Muslimi, from the Chatham House think tank in London, said that the STC had crossed Riyadh’s “red lines” and that the situation could quickly get worse. “It is one bad thing to humiliate Saudi Arabia. And it is another much worse thing to humiliate Saudi Arabia publicly. And that’s exactly what they did,” he said. US urges restraint In Washington, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: “We urge restraint and continued diplomacy, with a view to reaching a lasting solution.” Following Friday’s raids, Yemen’s government urged the Saudi-led coalition to support its forces in Hadramawt, after separatists seized most of the country’s largest province. The government asked the coalition to “take all necessary military measures to protect innocent Yemeni civilians in Hadramawt province and support the armed forces”, the official Yemeni news agency said. A Yemeni military official said that around 15,000 Saudi-backed fighters were amassed near the Saudi border but had not been given orders to advance on separatist-held territory. The areas where they were deployed are located at the edges of territory seized in recent weeks by the UAE-backed STC. “We have not received military instructions to move towards the two provinces,” the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Separatist advances have added pressure on ties between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which support rival groups within Yemen’s government. Published in Dawn, December 28th, 2025",

The truce took effect after a declaration signed by the neighbours’ defense ministers at a border checkpoint on the Thai side. The agreement applies to “all types of weapons, including attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures, and military objectives of either side, in all cases and all areas”. The three weeks of fighting, which utilised artillery, tanks, drones and jets, had spread to nearly every border province. The violence shattered a previous truce brokered in October, for which US President Donald Trump had taken credit. Thai Defence Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit described the initial three-day window as an “observation period to confirm that the ceasefire is real”. “A door to a peaceful resolution,” Nattaphon called the agreement in a speech on Saturday. Under the terms of the deal, both sides agreed to freeze troop movements and allow civilians in border areas to return home. The nations also pledged to cooperate on demining efforts and combatting cybercrime. Additionally, Thailand agreed to return 18 captured Cambodian soldiers within 72 hours. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the announcement “as a positive step towards alleviating the suffering of civilians … and creating an environment conducive to achieving lasting peace,” according to UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric. The conflict is rooted in a long-standing territorial dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of the 800-kilometre border, where both nations claim ancient temples based on a vague 1907 French map. Official tallies indicate at least 25 Thai soldiers and one Thai civilian were killed in the recent hostilities. Cambodia, facing a military with superior firepower, reported 21 civilian deaths. Phnom Penh has reported no military deaths, though an official Facebook post showed first lady Pich Chanmony atte­nding a funeral for troops. This ceasefire follows three days of talks convened after a crisis meeting of foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. International powers also pressed for a resolution. In Beijing, the foreign ministry stated that the ceasefire “demonstrates that dialogue and consultations are a realistic and effective way of resolving complex disputes”. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, is scheduled to host the Cambodian and Thai foreign ministers for talks in Yunnan province on Jan 28-29. UN human rights chief Volker Turk said he hoped the ceasefire “will pave the way for confidence building and peace”. Despite the halt in combat, the countries still must resolve the border demarcation. An earlier agreement in October, witnessed by Trump, broke down within months as each side accused the other of instigating fresh violence. Published in Dawn, December 28th, 2025",

      "title_orig": "Russian drones, missiles pound Ukraine ahead of Zelenskiy-Trump meeting",
      "summary_orig": "Russia attacked Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, ahead of what President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said would be a crucial meeting with US President Donald Trump to work out a plan to end nearly four years of war. Zelenskiy cast the vast overnight attack, which he said involved about 500 drones and 40 missiles and which knocked out power and heat in parts of the capital, as Russia’s response to the ongoing peace efforts brokered by Washington. The Ukrainian leader has said Sunday’s talks in Florida would focus on security guarantees and territorial control once fighting ends in Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War Two, started by Russia’s 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbour. The attack continued throughout the morning, with a nearly 10-hour air raid alert for the capital. Authorities said two people were killed in Kyiv and the surrounding region, while at least 46 people were wounded, including two children. “Today, Russia demonstrated how it responds to peaceful negotiations between Ukraine and the United States to end Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Zelenskiy told reporters. In Russia, air defence forces shot down eight drones headed for Moscow, the city’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Saturday. Explosions echoed across Kyiv from the early hours on Saturday as Ukraine’s air defence units went into action. The air force said Russian drones were targeting the capital and regions in the northeast and south. State grid operator Ukrenergo said energy facilities across Ukraine were struck, and emergency power cuts had been implemented across the capital. DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, said the attack had left more than a million households in and around Kyiv without power, 750,000 of which remained disconnected by the afternoon. Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said over 40% of residential buildings in Kyiv were left without heat as temperatures hovered around 0 degrees Celsius on Saturday. Territorial control: A diplomatic stumbling block On the way to meeting Trump in Florida, Zelenskiy stopped in Canada’s Halifax to meet Prime Minister Mark Carney, after which they planned to hold a call with European leaders. In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney noted that peace “requires a willing Russia.” “The barbarism that we saw overnight the attack on Kyiv shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time,” he said, announcing 2.5 billion Canadian dollars ($1.83 billion) in additional economic aid to Ukraine. Territory and the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant remain the main diplomatic stumbling blocks, though Zelenskiy told journalists in Kyiv on Friday that a 20-point draft document - the cornerstone of a US push to clinch a peace deal - is 90% complete. He said the shape of US security guarantees was crucial, and these would depend on Trump, and “what he is ready to give, when he is ready to give it, and for how long.” Zelenskiy told Axios earlier this week that the US had offered a 15-year deal on security guarantees, subject to renewal, but Kyiv wanted a longer agreement with legally binding provisions to guard against further Russian aggression. Trump said the United States was the driving force behind the process. “He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump told Politico. “So we’ll see what he’s got.” Trump said he believed Sunday’s meeting would go well. He also said he expected to speak with Putin “soon, as much as I want.” Fate of Donetsk is key Moscow is demanding that Ukraine withdraw from a large, densely-urbanised chunk of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian troops have failed to occupy in nearly four years of war. Kyiv wants the fighting halted at the current lines. Russia has been grinding slowly forwards throughout 2025 at the cost of significant casualties on the drone-infested battlefield. On Saturday, both sides issued conflicting claims about two frontline towns: Myrnohrad in the east and Huliaipole in the south. Moscow claimed to have captured both, while Kyiv said it had beaten back Russian assaults there. Under a US compromise, a free economic zone would be set up if Ukrainian troops pull back from parts of the Donetsk region, though details have yet to be worked out. Axios quoted Zelenskiy as saying that if he is not able to push the US to back Ukraine’s position on the land issue, he was willing to put the 20-point plan to a referendum - as long as Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire allowing Ukraine to prepare for and hold the vote. On Saturday, Zelenskiy said it was not possible to have such a referendum while Russia was bombarding Ukrainian cities. He also suggested that he would be ready for “dialogue” with the people of Ukraine if they disagreed with points of the plan. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Kyiv’s version of the 20-point plan differed from what Russia had been discussing with the US, according to the Interfax-Russia news agency. But he expressed optimism that matters had reached a “turning point” in the search for a settlement.",

In Russia, air defence forces shot down eight drones headed for Moscow, the city’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Saturday. Explosions echoed across Kyiv from the early hours on Saturday as Ukraine’s air defence units went into action. The air force said Russian drones were targeting the capital and regions in the northeast and south. State grid operator Ukrenergo said energy facilities across Ukraine were struck, and emergency power cuts had been implemented across the capital. DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, said the attack had left more than a million households in and around Kyiv without power, 750,000 of which remained disconnected by the afternoon. Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said over 40% of residential buildings in Kyiv were left without heat as temperatures hovered around 0 degrees Celsius on Saturday. Territorial control: A diplomatic stumbling block On the way to meeting Trump in Florida, Zelenskiy stopped in Canada’s Halifax to meet Prime Minister Mark Carney, after which they planned to hold a call with European leaders. In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney noted that peace “requires a willing Russia.” “The barbarism that we saw overnight the attack on Kyiv shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time,” he said, announcing 2.5 billion Canadian dollars ($1.83 billion) in additional economic aid to Ukraine. Territory and the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant remain the main diplomatic stumbling blocks, though Zelenskiy told journalists in Kyiv on Friday that a 20-point draft document - the cornerstone of a US push to clinch a peace deal - is 90% complete. He said the shape of US security guarantees was crucial, and these would depend on Trump, and “what he is ready to give, when he is ready to give it, and for how long.” Zelenskiy told Axios earlier this week that the US had offered a 15-year deal on security guarantees, subject to renewal, but Kyiv wanted a longer agreement with legally binding provisions to guard against further Russian aggression. Trump said the United States was the driving force behind the process. “He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump told Politico. “So we’ll see what he’s got.” Trump said he believed Sunday’s meeting would go well. He also said he expected to speak with Putin “soon, as much as I want.” Fate of Donetsk is key Moscow is demanding that Ukraine withdraw from a large, densely-urbanised chunk of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian troops have failed to occupy in nearly four years of war. Kyiv wants the fighting halted at the current lines. Russia has been grinding slowly forwards throughout 2025 at the cost of significant casualties on the drone-infested battlefield. On Saturday, both sides issued conflicting claims about two frontline towns: Myrnohrad in the east and Huliaipole in the south. Moscow claimed to have captured both, while Kyiv said it had beaten back Russian assaults there. Under a US compromise, a free economic zone would be set up if Ukrainian troops pull back from parts of the Donetsk region, though details have yet to be worked out. Axios quoted Zelenskiy as saying that if he is not able to push the US to back Ukraine’s position on the land issue, he was willing to put the 20-point plan to a referendum - as long as Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire allowing Ukraine to prepare for and hold the vote. On Saturday, Zelenskiy said it was not possible to have such a referendum while Russia was bombarding Ukrainian cities. He also suggested that he would be ready for “dialogue” with the people of Ukraine if they disagreed with points of the plan. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Kyiv’s version of the 20-point plan differed from what Russia had been discussing with the US, according to the Interfax-Russia news agency. But he expressed optimism that matters had reached a “turning point” in the search for a settlement.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi cast doubt on the government’s sincerity in holding talks with the PTI and said he was actively making efforts to initiate the party’s street movement by reaching out to multiple stakeholders. Accompanied by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and other leaders on the second day of his three-day visit to Lahore, the KP chief minister spoke to the media on two occasions while visiting the residences of incarcerated party leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed. Answering a question about the prospects of dialogue with the government in the wake of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer , the KP chief minister said: “Incumbent rulers are showing no sign of dialogue and instead are displaying their dictatorship mindset, which was inculcated in their minds since they began politics.” Asked whether he believed issues with the federal government could be resolved through talks, CM Afridi said Imran Khan had assigned the responsibility for “dialogue or protest” to the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP). The KP chief minister said that while the TTAP was “making efforts on its end,” which he supported, he had been directed to prepare for a street movement and would take “those preparations to their peak”. “Imran Khan is a symbol of national solidarity and stresses that everyone needs to respect others,” the chief minister added. For the street movement, he said he was in contact with all party leaders and organisations, as well as wings within the party to run the movement. The TTAP on Thursday welcomed PM Shehbaz’s recent invitation for talks. However, no concrete steps have so far been taken by the government to initiate a formal talks process, and PTI leaders say they are waiting for the government to make the first move. PM’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has stressed that PM Shehbaz would decide on talks with PTI once the opposition party clarifies its stance on negotiations. Referring to the Punjab government’s claim that the PTI had been eliminated from Punjab, he challenged the authorities by saying he could hold a public rally at Minar-i-Pakistan on 24 hours’ notice, while Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would take a week to stage one, allowing a comparison of the PTI’s and PML-N’s popularity. CM Afridi quipped that he would even support her by setting up a stage and providing vehicles to transport supporters. He also criticised the Punjab government for its rude behaviour toward him, as well as party leaders and workers, during his arrival at the Chakri interchange to reach the Punjab Assembly a day ago. “This shows their mean mentality, which cannot be approved in a civilised society,” he lambasted them and alleged that the “Punjab government is fanning hatred between the two provinces.“ Regretting the administration’s attitude on his arrival, he invited CM Maryam to visit KP, saying he would show her how democratic forces respect the office of a provincial chief executive. He said the Punjab government had not responded to the KP government’s request regarding his desire to meet incarcerated PTI leaders at Kot Lakhpat jail. “The incumbent rulers have neither allowed me to meet my leader Imran Khan nor the leaders who are incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat jail,” CM Afridi added. The KP chief minister said that he was impressed with the courage that the incarcerated leaders and their family members had shown in the face of the “fascism” unleashed against them. As planned, CM Afridi’s entourage reached Food Street for dinner but was surprised to find that all restaurants were shut with the lights turned off and even the general public evicted. The chief minister came out of his vehicle from the sunroof and chanted slogans with the public in Imran’s favour. As the entourage returned without having dinner, CM Afridi said the KP government had formally conveyed beforehand that it would go to the Food Street for dinner. “This is how the Punjab government is treating us. The whole Food Street has been shut down,” he regretted. He later visited the residence of PTI member Sanam Javed’s in-laws and lauded her efforts for the party. Bemoans treatment of courts in address to LHCBA Speaking to the legal community at the Lahore High Court Bar Association, CM Afridi lamented that the courts in the country had been rendered useless after the 27th Constitutional Amendment. He said three judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had allowed him to meet Imran, but “a mere jail superintendent threw the orders in the dustbin”. The chief minister urged the lawyers’ fraternity to “stand for an independent judiciary” in the party’s struggle for real independence. He complained that PTI workers were not even allowed to hold party flags in the open. Referring to his responsibility to run the PTI’s street movement, he said Imran wanted the Constitution and the judiciary to be restored in their original shape. “The PTI is standing with the independence of the judiciary,” he added. Visit to Imran’s Zaman Park residence The KP chief minister also visited Imran’s residence at Zaman Park with Aleema Khanum, amid a massive police deployment around the house. The two spoke at a joint media talk, while party workers engaged in loud sloganeering. Aleema alleged the Punjab government was “terrified to the point that it had closed all roads leading to Zaman Park and stopped even women and children from reaching there. They have converted Zaman Park into a jail, where even residents cannot go in or out,” she added. Referring to the massive police deployment outside her residence, she said she was not afraid and continued rebuffing any “cheap tactics.” She said CM Afridi and others would come and sit at the spot too, and people would see how long the administration would be able to hold them away. “Today is the beginning of the movement; the Punjab government will not be able to stop people on Lahore roads soon,” she asserted, and asked, “Will they shut down all of Lahore?” Answering a question, she said, Imran had given his clear-cut message through Noreen Niazi that people should come out on the roads because the “incumbent rulers want to prolong their rule and loot in the country”. CM Afridi said that he was half-happy that he had arrived at his leader’s home alone and wished he had been accompanied by Imran. “My leader will soon be with me here,” he said. He said those in the government never wanted talks; instead, they wanted the confrontation between the political parties to continue. Later, he paid a brief visit to the residences of Hammad Azhar, where he offered prayers for the recently deceased Mian Azhar, and party worker Zill-e-Shah, who died during a party protest in 2023. Meetings with families of jailed leaders CM Afridi first visited Qureshi‘s home, with visuals released by the PTI on X showing the former foreign minister’s son Zain Qureshi and daughter Meher Bano present during the meeting. Addressing the media alongside them, Afridi said, “This is my Pakistan, and wherever I go, I do not need a reason for it.” The chief minister said the aim of his Lahore trip was to meet party leaders. Afridi mentioned the names of multiple incarcerated leaders he wanted to meet and added, “I also wanted to meet the rest of the leadership and workers, but unfortunately, they did not let me meet them.” Following Afridi’s visit, Zain expressed his heartfelt gratitude to him and other PTI leaders in a post on X. He said the KP CM enquired about Qureshi’s health, “hailed his sacrifices and also visited my mother”. “His visit is a source of encouragement and strength for us.” According to statements by his focal person for digital media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi, CM Afridi also met Yasmin’s husband, Rashid Nabi Malik, and Chaudhry’s wife and children. According to PTI lawyer Naeem Panjutha, the KP CM was not able to visit former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema’s house as it was located in a cantonment and “permission was not being given to enter”. At Rasheed’s residence, KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi asserted that Punjab stood with Imran and “had always given us affection”. While on his way to Rasheed’s house, Panjutha said there will be lots of people on the streets of Lahore in the evening, and called on the public to take part in the PTI’s movement till Imran’s release. First day in Lahore Afridi had arrived in Lahore on Friday around 4:30pm, from where he made a beeline for the Punjab Assembly. However, the visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed. Although the KP CM managed to reach Liberty Roundabout last night, he was unable to deliver a planned speech at the venue as a heavy contingent of police had blocked all roads leading to the area by setting up pickets. Addressing PTI lawmakers at the Punjab Assembly, he had thanked the people of Punjab for their hospitality, but highlighted his treatment at the hands of the police during the journey to Lahore. “Today, the Punjab Police were rude to our workers at Chakri Interchange, Bhera, Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin,” he said. “Our workers, our parliamentarians, our leaders — they were harassed and arrested. This cannot be condemned enough.” In separate remarks to the media, Afridi had said he was in Lahore to launch a mass street movement on the instructions of Imran, urging the masses to prepare themselves and confront oppression and fascism without making mistakes. “We will take Imran Khan’s ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi ’ (real independence) movement to its logical conclusion, restore the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and revive an independent judiciary and independent media,” he had asserted.",

CM Afridi said that he was half-happy that he had arrived at his leader’s home alone and wished he had been accompanied by Imran. “My leader will soon be with me here,” he said. He said those in the government never wanted talks; instead, they wanted the confrontation between the political parties to continue. Later, he paid a brief visit to the residences of Hammad Azhar, where he offered prayers for the recently deceased Mian Azhar, and party worker Zill-e-Shah, who died during a party protest in 2023. Meetings with families of jailed leaders CM Afridi first visited Qureshi‘s home, with visuals released by the PTI on X showing the former foreign minister’s son Zain Qureshi and daughter Meher Bano present during the meeting. Addressing the media alongside them, Afridi said, “This is my Pakistan, and wherever I go, I do not need a reason for it.” The chief minister said the aim of his Lahore trip was to meet party leaders. Afridi mentioned the names of multiple incarcerated leaders he wanted to meet and added, “I also wanted to meet the rest of the leadership and workers, but unfortunately, they did not let me meet them.” Following Afridi’s visit, Zain expressed his heartfelt gratitude to him and other PTI leaders in a post on X. He said the KP CM enquired about Qureshi’s health, “hailed his sacrifices and also visited my mother”. “His visit is a source of encouragement and strength for us.” According to statements by his focal person for digital media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi, CM Afridi also met Yasmin’s husband, Rashid Nabi Malik, and Chaudhry’s wife and children. According to PTI lawyer Naeem Panjutha, the KP CM was not able to visit former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema’s house as it was located in a cantonment and “permission was not being given to enter”. At Rasheed’s residence, KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi asserted that Punjab stood with Imran and “had always given us affection”. While on his way to Rasheed’s house, Panjutha said there will be lots of people on the streets of Lahore in the evening, and called on the public to take part in the PTI’s movement till Imran’s release. First day in Lahore Afridi had arrived in Lahore on Friday around 4:30pm, from where he made a beeline for the Punjab Assembly. However, the visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed. Although the KP CM managed to reach Liberty Roundabout last night, he was unable to deliver a planned speech at the venue as a heavy contingent of police had blocked all roads leading to the area by setting up pickets. Addressing PTI lawmakers at the Punjab Assembly, he had thanked the people of Punjab for their hospitality, but highlighted his treatment at the hands of the police during the journey to Lahore. “Today, the Punjab Police were rude to our workers at Chakri Interchange, Bhera, Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin,” he said. “Our workers, our parliamentarians, our leaders — they were harassed and arrested. This cannot be condemned enough.” In separate remarks to the media, Afridi had said he was in Lahore to launch a mass street movement on the instructions of Imran, urging the masses to prepare themselves and confront oppression and fascism without making mistakes. “We will take Imran Khan’s ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi ’ (real independence) movement to its logical conclusion, restore the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and revive an independent judiciary and independent media,” he had asserted.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Saturday distanced itself from “provocative” remarks by a protester during a demonstration in the British city of Bradford, as the party continues to face backlash from the government and other quarters. In the video posted on PTI’s UK page and since deleted , a woman appears to be wishing ill on a person without taking any name, saying that they should be “blown up in a car”. The woman can be seen surrounded by people holding PTI flags. Pakistan also issued a demarche to the acting British high commissioner, demanding action against all those involved. “The demarche was issued after provocative statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership from British soil,” the FO spokesperson said. He urged the UK to “hold responsible elements accountable in accordance with the law”. In a strongly-worded statement on Saturday, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that the speech delivered by the demonstrator in the UK has “no connection” whatsoever with the party. Furthermore, he stated that the woman held no position within PTI and has no affiliation with the party. Therefore, PTI completely disowned her rhetoric and emphasised that it has never endorsed such irresponsible and inflammatory statements from any party office-bearer. Akram stated that the views expressed, the language used, and the tone adopted in the speech do not reflect PTI’s official stance, political ideology, or vision. “PTI, as a matter of principle, strongly opposes violence, hate speech, incitement, inflammatory rhetoric, and the use of unethical or indecent language in political discourse. PTI firmly believes in democratic, constitutional, and peaceful political struggle, and does not endorse or support any individual or group engaging in conduct contrary to these values,” he said. The PTI also strongly condemned the Punjab government for the treatment of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, his cabinet, parliamentarians, and the accompanying delegation during their visit to Punjab. Afridi arrived in Lahore on Friday to launch a mass street movement on the instructions of party founder Imran Khan, urging the masses to prepare themselves and confront oppression and fascism. The party’s information secretary said the visit, which began on December 26 in Lahore and various districts of Punjab as a peaceful, democratic, and political engagement aimed at meeting party workers and discussing public issues, was deliberately turned by the Punjab government into an exercise in political vendetta and hate-driven politics. Akram pointed out that CM KP and his delegation were stopped at multiple locations, their routes blocked, and they faced physical pushback and humiliating treatment inside the Punjab Assembly. “The forcible ejection of our elected representatives from the assembly constitutes a flagrant breach of federal respect and democratic norms,” he added. The party’s information secretary said that the deployment of heavy police forces to stop a peaceful rally at Liberty Chowk reflected the rising fear of public power among the current rulers. Waqas said he was astonished that, to further aggravate the situation, certain planted elements posing as journalists were brought forward, whose objective was neither reporting nor questioning, but a deliberate and well-planned attempt to provoke, ridicule, and fuel provincial hatred. He asserted that questioning a constitutional office-holder like the provincial chief executive with allegations such as whether he had “brought narcotics” was not only extremely despicable and shameful, reflecting a base mindset, but also a direct insult to the people of KP and the elected chief minister of a province. Waqas emphasised that such questions were not journalism, but rather a well-calculated attempt to sow provincial distrust and hatred, which PTI condemned in the strongest possible terms. He added that rogue elements undoubtedly existed in every field, but degrading a respected profession like journalism to such an extent was both regrettable and condemnable. “We call upon responsible media organisations and esteemed journalists to hold accountable those within their ranks who, under any specific agenda, pressure, or personal gain, use such hateful and unethical language,” he demanded. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) spokesperson, Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousufzai, said in a statement that the Punjab Police behaved rudely and inhumanely with the province’s chief executive, as well as the accompanying ministers and members, from Chakri all the way to the Punjab Assembly. “So-called tout journalists asked them extremely petty and degrading questions with the sole purpose of humiliating them. When this still did not satisfy them, police goons were sent to launch an attack on Liberty Chowk,” he claimed. He said that such tactics could not harm the opposition in any way; rather, they clearly exposed fear and panic. “We categorically do not believe that such conduct has any connection with the poor, hardworking people of Punjab. Instead, it reflects a defeated and depraved mindset that was thrown into the dustbin of history by the people’s silent revolution on February 8, 2024,” Akhunzada said.",

      "summary_orig": "PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday urged giving the provinces a greater role in areas such as tax collection to help address the federal government’s financial issues. The Bhutto scion was addressing the death anniversary programme for his mother, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. Benazir was assassinated in a gun-and-bomb attack near Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007, after a public gathering. The Sindh government announced a public holiday today to commemorate Benazir’s death anniversary. Foolproof security for the VVIPs, VIPs, and general public was ensured in Larkana, with over 8,500 police officers and personnel, alongside Rangers and other security agencies, deployed at and around Bhutto’s mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. Speaking at the event, Bilawal said the PPP was a federal party that conducted politics at both the national and provincial levels with sincerity, treating the Centre’s problems as its own. “If there is an issue of fiscal space for the federal government, then as a patriot, I would want to help solve it. The PPP has its own politics and history, and as the chain binding the four provinces, we have a greater responsibility to address the Centre’s issues while protecting provincial rights.” “We think that instead of attempts to take authority away from the provinces, it would be better if the federal government gave more responsibilities to them. We are ready to take on additional responsibilities to help fix the economy and the government’s issues.” Pointing to tax collection, the PPP chairman said the federal government should work together with provincial governments and give them more responsibilities in this area to boost revenue. “We will collect taxes better than the Federal Board of Revenue and will eliminate your financial crises.” Bilawal maintained that the government should remove itself from the business of supplying electricity through power utility companies and instead hand this responsibility over to the provinces. “We will perform better than the Centre. There are many other ways in which the PPP will work together with the federal government to address its issues. We should all tackle Pakistan’s economic problems together so we can improve the people’s financial situation.” On his mother, Bilawal said her last message was one of reconciliation. He added that reconciliation would be necessary to resolve the country’s current political crisis. The Bhutto scion said that parties would have to abandon “political extremism” for the reconciliation effort to succeed, and their supporters would need to bring politics back within bounds. He added that actions such as the May 9, 2023, nationwide riots or cursing institutional heads were not the way forward. He said Benazir and the PPP had never pursued the politics of revenge, as it caused losses to the country, its people, and the party’s supporters. “Political forces will have to follow a responsible political path. The opposition parties should engage in responsible politics, and government parties should also think in the national interest.” President Zardari says PPP always ready to defend Pakistan In his speech, the president said today marked the day the PPP saved the country by championing the slogan of Pakistan and refraining from any retaliation for Benazir’s assassination. He also referred to the May conflict with India, saying that the Pakistan Army gave a “befitting response” to the enemy, making it realise that it was serious. “Modi realised it was no joke. Pakistan is Pakistan, and we, as Muslims, know how to defend ourselves.” He warned that if any evil eye or country ever looked at Pakistan again, “they should remember that Asif Zardari, the PPP, and the scions of Bhutto and Bibi are present, and we are all ready to step onto the field of battle and make sacrifices to protect our nation”. ‘Unity over division’ In an earlier message on his wife’s death anniversary, the president said: “As we reflect on this solemn day on her 18th martyrdom anniversary, we must choose unity over division.” He stressed that Benazir “never believed in vindictiveness and vendetta”. “She always reminded us that democracy was the best revenge. Her message calls on us to heal political rifts, strengthen democratic institutions and work together for the progress of our motherland,” he said. “On her anniversary, I reaffirm the commitment to carrying forward her vision of a democratic, inclusive, tolerant, pluralist and forward-looking Pakistan,“ he added. Recalling that Benazir was the first female prime minister of a Muslim country and had been elected twice to the role, Zardari said: “In a political landscape shaped by exclusion, patriarchy, longer authoritarian rule and repeated disruptions of democratic order, she stood like a rock for the supremacy of the Constitution, authority of the Parliament and the peoples’ right to choose their representatives. “Her repeated return to electoral politics reflected an unshakeable faith in peaceful political struggle and unadulterated democracy,” he asserted. “She gave voice to the voiceless. She pulled farmers, workers and low-income families like a super magnet towards her, who remained at the centre of her politics,” the president highlighted, pointing out Benazir’s focus on widening access to livelihoods and education. “Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto believed deeply in an inclusive Pakistan. She rejected sectarianism, bigotry and intolerance, and consistently spoke for the protection of minorities,” President Zardari said about his late wife. “Her courage in the face of extremism remains one of her most enduring legacies,” he further said, adding that Benazir’s assassination was a “reminder that the fight against terrorism is not only about security, but also about ideas, education and respect for diversity”. “For the youth of Pakistan, her life offers a clear lesson. Speak up for justice, organise peacefully and do not surrender hope in the face of adversity. She confronted censorship and repression with resolve, proving that truth cannot be silenced forever.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to her, saying her political legacy was marked by patriotism, courage, and an unwavering commitment to democratic values, Radio Pakistan reported. He said she consistently promoted tolerance, harmony, and forbearance in the political process, which remained a guiding principle for strengthening democracy in the country. PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the government’s resolve to continue the journey of tolerance, rule of law, democratic governance, and public welfare. Bilawal, in a message released by the PPP yesterday, said his mother’s “supreme sacrifice was a pledge written in blood that democracy in Pakistan would never surrender”. “Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was not just a leader; she was the fearless voice of democracy, the hope of the oppressed and an unyielding symbol of resistance against dictatorship, extremism and intolerance,” he was quoted as saying. Reaffirming the PPP’s unwavering commitment to Benazir’s mission, Bilawal said the party will continue to fight for social and economic justice, constitutional supremacy, women’s empowerment and the protection of minorities. “We bow our heads in reverence before Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. Her sacrifice is our strength, her vision our guiding light and her courage our lasting responsibility. Her dream lives on in every voice raised for justice and every step taken for democracy,” the PPP scion said. Bilawal went on to say that Benazir’s vision of a “peaceful, democratic and inclusive Pakistan continues to inspire generations, especially women and youth”. He noted that as the premier, his mother “pursued people-centred policies, strengthened Pakistan’s defence, safeguarded national sovereignty and restored the country’s progressive and dignified image internationally”. Benazir‘s daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, who paid a visit to her mother’s mausoleum yesterday, said on social media platform X: “Today we remember Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. “She lived with courage and led with compassion. Her strength lives on in every voice that refuses injustice.” Aseefa further said, “In every struggle and every accomplishment, we think of you, miss you, and pray for you. We continue to strive to fulfil your vision and values. Your absence leaves us searching for the guidance only you could give.” Senator Sherry Rehman posted a video message on her X account, saying that Benazir “never wavered, she never compromised on her dreams for her beloved Pakistan”. “Despite all threats, risks and real dangers, she did what she believed in. Her courage and resilience define her as one of the greatest leaders the world saw,” Rehman said, adding that her vision lives on in the hands of Bilawal, Aseefa and President Zardari. Govt delegation to attend gathering at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Meanwhile, a government delegation led by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, has departed for Garhi Khuda Bakhsh to attend the gathering being held to mark Benazir’s death anniversary. The delegation, including Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, and MNAs, is attending on the special instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The delegation will also hold meetings with the PPP leadership. In a statement released prior to his departure, Sadiq said, “Today we are commemorating the death anniversary of Pakistan’s great daughter, former prime minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed.” He said Benazir had played a significant role in strengthening the role of women, adding she worked to make Pakistan a peaceful, progressive, and democratic state. “Her sacrifices and services are a guiding light for the entire nation,“ he said.",

He added that reconciliation would be necessary to resolve the country’s current political crisis. The Bhutto scion said that parties would have to abandon “political extremism” for the reconciliation effort to succeed, and their supporters would need to bring politics back within bounds. He added that actions such as the May 9, 2023, nationwide riots or cursing institutional heads were not the way forward. He said Benazir and the PPP had never pursued the politics of revenge, as it caused losses to the country, its people, and the party’s supporters. “Political forces will have to follow a responsible political path. The opposition parties should engage in responsible politics, and government parties should also think in the national interest.” President Zardari says PPP always ready to defend Pakistan In his speech, the president said today marked the day the PPP saved the country by championing the slogan of Pakistan and refraining from any retaliation for Benazir’s assassination. He also referred to the May conflict with India, saying that the Pakistan Army gave a “befitting response” to the enemy, making it realise that it was serious. “Modi realised it was no joke. Pakistan is Pakistan, and we, as Muslims, know how to defend ourselves.” He warned that if any evil eye or country ever looked at Pakistan again, “they should remember that Asif Zardari, the PPP, and the scions of Bhutto and Bibi are present, and we are all ready to step onto the field of battle and make sacrifices to protect our nation”. ‘Unity over division’ In an earlier message on his wife’s death anniversary, the president said: “As we reflect on this solemn day on her 18th martyrdom anniversary, we must choose unity over division.” He stressed that Benazir “never believed in vindictiveness and vendetta”. “She always reminded us that democracy was the best revenge. Her message calls on us to heal political rifts, strengthen democratic institutions and work together for the progress of our motherland,” he said. “On her anniversary, I reaffirm the commitment to carrying forward her vision of a democratic, inclusive, tolerant, pluralist and forward-looking Pakistan,“ he added. Recalling that Benazir was the first female prime minister of a Muslim country and had been elected twice to the role, Zardari said: “In a political landscape shaped by exclusion, patriarchy, longer authoritarian rule and repeated disruptions of democratic order, she stood like a rock for the supremacy of the Constitution, authority of the Parliament and the peoples’ right to choose their representatives. “Her repeated return to electoral politics reflected an unshakeable faith in peaceful political struggle and unadulterated democracy,” he asserted. “She gave voice to the voiceless. She pulled farmers, workers and low-income families like a super magnet towards her, who remained at the centre of her politics,” the president highlighted, pointing out Benazir’s focus on widening access to livelihoods and education. “Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto believed deeply in an inclusive Pakistan. She rejected sectarianism, bigotry and intolerance, and consistently spoke for the protection of minorities,” President Zardari said about his late wife. “Her courage in the face of extremism remains one of her most enduring legacies,” he further said, adding that Benazir’s assassination was a “reminder that the fight against terrorism is not only about security, but also about ideas, education and respect for diversity”. “For the youth of Pakistan, her life offers a clear lesson. Speak up for justice, organise peacefully and do not surrender hope in the face of adversity. She confronted censorship and repression with resolve, proving that truth cannot be silenced forever.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to her, saying her political legacy was marked by patriotism, courage, and an unwavering commitment to democratic values, Radio Pakistan reported. He said she consistently promoted tolerance, harmony, and forbearance in the political process, which remained a guiding principle for strengthening democracy in the country. PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the government’s resolve to continue the journey of tolerance, rule of law, democratic governance, and public welfare. Bilawal, in a message released by the PPP yesterday, said his mother’s “supreme sacrifice was a pledge written in blood that democracy in Pakistan would never surrender”. “Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was not just a leader; she was the fearless voice of democracy, the hope of the oppressed and an unyielding symbol of resistance against dictatorship, extremism and intolerance,” he was quoted as saying. Reaffirming the PPP’s unwavering commitment to Benazir’s mission, Bilawal said the party will continue to fight for social and economic justice, constitutional supremacy, women’s empowerment and the protection of minorities. “We bow our heads in reverence before Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. Her sacrifice is our strength, her vision our guiding light and her courage our lasting responsibility. Her dream lives on in every voice raised for justice and every step taken for democracy,” the PPP scion said. Bilawal went on to say that Benazir’s vision of a “peaceful, democratic and inclusive Pakistan continues to inspire generations, especially women and youth”. He noted that as the premier, his mother “pursued people-centred policies, strengthened Pakistan’s defence, safeguarded national sovereignty and restored the country’s progressive and dignified image internationally”. Benazir‘s daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, who paid a visit to her mother’s mausoleum yesterday, said on social media platform X: “Today we remember Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. “She lived with courage and led with compassion. Her strength lives on in every voice that refuses injustice.” Aseefa further said, “In every struggle and every accomplishment, we think of you, miss you, and pray for you. We continue to strive to fulfil your vision and values. Your absence leaves us searching for the guidance only you could give.” Senator Sherry Rehman posted a video message on her X account, saying that Benazir “never wavered, she never compromised on her dreams for her beloved Pakistan”. “Despite all threats, risks and real dangers, she did what she believed in. Her courage and resilience define her as one of the greatest leaders the world saw,” Rehman said, adding that her vision lives on in the hands of Bilawal, Aseefa and President Zardari. Govt delegation to attend gathering at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Meanwhile, a government delegation led by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, has departed for Garhi Khuda Bakhsh to attend the gathering being held to mark Benazir’s death anniversary. The delegation, including Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, and MNAs, is attending on the special instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The delegation will also hold meetings with the PPP leadership. In a statement released prior to his departure, Sadiq said, “Today we are commemorating the death anniversary of Pakistan’s great daughter, former prime minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed.” He said Benazir had played a significant role in strengthening the role of women, adding she worked to make Pakistan a peaceful, progressive, and democratic state. “Her sacrifices and services are a guiding light for the entire nation,“ he said.",
      "title": "Bilawal urges greater role for provinces as solution to Centre’s financial woes",
      "summary": "PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday urged giving the provinces a greater role in areas such as tax collection to help address the federal government’s financial issues. The Bhutto scion was addressing the death anniversary programme for his mother, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. Benazir was assassinated in a gun-and-bomb attack near Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007, after a public gathering. The Sindh government announced a public holiday today to commemorate Benazir’s death anniversary. Foolproof security for the VVIPs, VIPs, and general public was ensured in Larkana, with over 8,500 police officers and personnel, alongside Rangers and other security agencies, deployed at and around Bhutto’s mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. Speaking at the event, Bilawal said the PPP was a federal party that conducted politics at both the national and provincial levels with sincerity, treating the Centre’s problems as its own. “If there is an issue of fiscal space for the federal government, then as a patriot, I would want to help solve it. The PPP has its own politics and history, and as the chain binding the four provinces, we have a greater responsibility to address the Centre’s issues while protecting provincial rights.” “We think that instead of attempts to take authority away from the provinces, it would be better if the federal government gave more responsibilities to them. We are ready to take on additional responsibilities to help fix the economy and the government’s issues.” Pointing to tax collection, the PPP chairman said the federal government should work together with provincial governments and give them more responsibilities in this area to boost revenue. “We will collect taxes better than the Federal Board of Revenue and will eliminate your financial crises.” Bilawal maintained that the government should remove itself from the business of supplying electricity through power utility companies and instead hand this responsibility over to the provinces. “We will perform better than the Centre. There are many other ways in which the PPP will work together with the federal government to address its issues. We should all tackle Pakistan’s economic problems together so we can improve the people’s financial situation.” On his mother, Bilawal said her last message was one of reconciliation.

      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday hailed Pakistan’s success over India during the military escalation between the two countries earlier this year. “A strong message was sent to the world,” he said while speaking to the media in Islamabad, where he gave an overview of Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts in 2025. “Our international standing has […] improved due to principled, proactive and result-oriented diplomacy,” Dar said, reflecting on the past year. He said Pakistan was “known to be a diplomatically isolated country” at the time PM Shehbaz Sharif took oath last year. Speaking on the May conflict, Dar said India’s claim of regional hegemony and being the net security provider was tested during the four-day escalation. “We did not ask anyone to mediate between us,” the deputy premier asserted. He recalled that Pakistan shot down seven jets of India during the May 7 air battle, which was followed by “incorrect” statements by New Delhi that Pakistan had attacked 15 Indian military installations. He also hailed the armed forces’ technology for intercepting 79 out of 80 drones sent by India to Pakistan in 36 hours. The minister pointed out that Pakistan had remained “proactively engaged” after both the Pulwama and the Pahalgam incidents. “This time, their mala fide intentions regarding the Indus waters. They have been corresponding with Pakistan for the last 1.5-2 years on climate change that ‘ground realities have changed’,” he said. Detailing the May events, Dar said the civil-military leadership led by PM Shehbaz “authorised” certain decisions in a meeting on the night of May 9. He said India then “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Airbase in the early hours of May 10. “The process which had been authorised by the PM had to be implemented,” Dar said, but India made the “super mistake”, which then led to Pakistan’s retaliatory operation . “After April 22, we used to have long hours. From [May] 6 to 10, we used to be here at night too,” the minister said, adding that he conducted over 60 phone calls with foreign dignitaries before May 6 and after that. Speaking about India’s claims of Islamabad attacking it, Dar said: “I told one of the P5 countries that this is a digital world, it cannot be hidden … they called me back after 16-17 hours and told me we had not attacked anywhere in India. This was a first serious setback for them.” Detailing his exchanges with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Dar said, “At around 8:17am, I received a call from Secretary Rubio of USA that ‘India is ready to ceasefire, are you willing?’ I said ’we never wanted to go to war’. “Within 45 minutes, I received a call from Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal. ‘Brother, I understand that you have authorised Secretary Rubio. Am I permitted to talk to India’ […] Prince Faisal said I will talk to the foreign minister of India and get back,” Dar recalled. He added that within an hour, the Saudi minister called him back and said he had also confirmed the ceasefire. “It has been established that Pakistan’s armed forces, its technology and its capacity for defence is very solid. We only did in self-defence according to what was done to us; otherwise, it could have been much greater than this too,” the deputy PM said. “Allah made [Pakistan] a nuclear power and a missile power. What you need now is economic power,” he stressed, highlighting that the country possessed great natural resources, such as mines and minerals, gas, and hydrocarbons. “Related to Pahalgam and other incidents, our main analysis shared with everyone is that till the time the Jammu and Kashmir issue is not resolved, […] perpetual and permanent peace cannot be established in the region.” The foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s protest against India’s actions in occupied Kashmir, including “demographic changes and amendments in the Constitution”. Dar noted that the May episode had revived the Kashmir issue at the international level, with the United Nations Security Council also discussing agendas related to human rights violations in India-occupied Kashmir. On the Indus Waters Treaty, Dar said the FO had actively engaged with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and others. Ice breaks with Bangladesh The deputy PM also highlighted that a “major ice-breaking breakthrough” occurred with Bangladesh as ties between the two nations revived. Dar recalled that Hina Rabbani Khar had visited Bangladesh in 2012, but there had been no engagement afterwards because of the “anti-Pakistan” government there. “My 36-hour visit to Bangladesh was very engaging. I had meetings with the chief executive, the foreign minister and cabinet ministers and advisers,” he observed. “During my time there of 36 hours, I saw great gestures of goodwill for Pakistan,” Dar said, adding that Islamabad will proactively engage with Dhaka after the February polls. “Pakistan’s diplomacy during the crisis demonstrated our proactive approach and it showed our ability of transforming challenges into opportunities and our thought of effective narrative projection with principled engagement,” the minister said. Positive ties with US Dar hailed the United States’ “proactive role” in the Pak-India ceasefire. “That is why on June 11, we nominated [President Donald] Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize 2026 . The media had confusion on the date. I signed the letter on the authorisation of PM and sent it,” he said. “President Trump trumpeted the drum of May conflict success the most,” Dar quipped. “Around 60 times, he reiterated that Pakistan shot down six fighter jets of India. Then he praised the prime minister and the field marshal. The relations with the US have started again towards a positive trajectory,” he said.",
