      "summary_orig": "At least twelve people were killed and 27 people were injured on Tuesday in a suicide blast outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area, according to officials. The incident occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue, while a cricket match between the Greenshirts and Sri Lanka was also being held in Pindi. The death toll was initially confirmed to Dawn by a senior Islamabad police official. Later, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi briefed the media outside the court, saying that a “suicide blast” had occurred at 12:39pm. Confirming the death and injury toll, the interior minister said that the wounded were being provided medical treatment, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif personally in touch with the hospitals in question. “The attacker stood outside the court for around 12 minutes. He first attempted to go inside the court, but then targeted the police vehicle after he was unable to do so,” Naqvi said. He added that an investigation was underway and identifying the attacker was a top priority. “I assure you we will identify him in the next few hours,” he said.\n“We are linking this blast today with a lot of things and, in the coming hours or days, we will be very clear about it,” the interior minister said. “We are not taking this blast as just another one,” he added, noting that its timing and the federal capital being targeted “has a lot of messages”. “I don’t want to say anything about how Indians do…. like where and what happened half an hour before the blast even occurs,” he quipped. “We will go with complete evidence and details. Whoever is involved in this, whether locals or foreigners, we will not spare anyone,” the minister vowed, affirming that the state will not remain quiet on the matter. “We have a clear message that whoever did this will bear the consequences.” The minister detailed that CCTV footage showed that the suicide bomber, standing outside the court building, “kept trying to figure out from different angles how to go inside”. Responding to queries about those behind the blast, Naqvi said, “As far as this (Islamabad blast) is concerned, we will let you know as soon as this individual is identified. The minister noted the injured included some police personnel, adding that the driver of the vehicle targeted remained safe. A lawyer was among the casualties, he added. Meanwhile, the spokesperson for the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Dr Mubahshir Daha, also confirmed that “12 people have been martyred in the blast”, while the number of injured had risen to 30, as per a statement. “Following the attack, an emergency has been declared at PIMS, and medical assistance to the injured is underway,” the spokesperson said. “All resources are being utilised to assist the injured.” Meanwhile, security around the Judicial Complex, adjoining courts, and other sensitive buildings in Islamabad has been further tightened, police officials told the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) . ‘Massive blast’ Videos of the incident on social media showed flames and plumes of smoke rising into the air from the remains of a charred vehicle behind a security barrier. View this post on Instagram Lawyer Mohammed Shahzad Butt, who witnessed the explosion, told AFP that it was a “massive blast”. “Everyone started running inside out of panic. I have seen at least five dead bodies lying at the front gate,” he told AFP . Rustam Malik, another lawyer, told AFP he “heard a loud bang at the gate” as he was entering the complex. “It was complete chaos, lawyers and people were running inside the complex. I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate, and several cars were on fire,” said Malik. Security high alert in Rawalpindi According to Rawalpindi Police, following the suicide attack in Islamabad, a security high alert was issued for Rawalpindi. Security arrangements for the ongoing One-Day International Match (ODI) match in Rawalpindi have been tightened further,“ the police said in a statement. A Dawn correspondent in Rawalpindi said that the foolproof security and alternative traffic arrangements were causing difficulties for citizens. “Due to ongoing development projects in Rawalpindi, important roads in the city are also closed, causing the flow of traffic to be diverted towards the adjacent areas and streets,” he said. ‘Wake-up call’ In a post on X, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences to the bereaved families, prayed for the recovery of the injured, and paid tribute to law enforcement agencies. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also called the incident a “wake-up call”. “We are in a state of war. Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan Army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan, today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts is a wake-up call,” he said. “In this environment, it would be futile to hold out greater hope for successful negotiations with the rulers of Kabul,” he added. Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also condemned the incident in Islamabad and expressed grief over the loss of precious human lives. “Suicide bombers and terrorists have no religion. They enemies of humanity,” he said, adding that Sindh police had been put on high alert until further orders. “Checking and surveillance should be tightened at the province’s entry and exit points, important highways, roads and side roads, while intelligence measures should be made more effective and coordinated, especially in crime-affected areas and suburbs,” he said. Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the blast and wished a speedy recovery to the injured. “Those who spill the blood of innocent people are enemies of this nation and humanity,” he said as per a statement issued by the PPP media cell, stressing that “terrorists do not deserve any mercy.” National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, condemning the attack, said, “Terrorists cannot demoralise the nation by their cowardly actions.” He stressed that national unity was unavoidable to eliminate terrorism. The legal fraternity also strongly denounced the explosion and expressed grief at the passing of their colleagues, praying for the injured and urging strict action against those responsible. Speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court, senior lawyers expressed deep concern over the prevailing national situation and emphasised the need for solidarity among all segments of society. Senior lawyer Hamid Khan said the country was “passing through a critical phase and stressed that all institutions and citizens must work together to protect the Constitution,” according to the AAP . Former Attorney General Munir A. Malik said the entire nation mourned the loss of lives in the incident and stood in solidarity with the victims’ families. Ex-president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Abid Zuberi, addressed a press conference where he presented a resolution condemning the terrorist attack in the strongest terms and demanding that the perpetrators be brought to justice. “The lawyers collectively reiterated their firm resolve to defend constitutional supremacy, uphold the independence of the judiciary, and promote unity and peace in the country,” the report said. UK asks citizens to ‘monitor travel advisory’ British High Commissioner to Pakistan, Jane Marriott, asked British citizens to monitor travel advice. “We are aware of an explosion in Islamabad which has reportedly left several people dead,” she wrote on X. “We are closely tracking, and British nationals should monitor travel advice. My thoughts are with the loved ones of those who have lost their lives.” This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves.

      "title_orig": "PTI’s Gohar says govt attempting to create ‘another elite class’ as NA debates 27th Amendment",
      "summary_orig": "The National Assembly deliberated on the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment bill on Tuesday — a day after the government succeeded in manoeuvring it through the Senate — with PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan accusing the government of attempting to “create another elite class”. He made these remarks particularly in reference to a proposal under the 27th Amendment to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests. Speaking after Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, who presented the bill in the lower house of Parliament, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan condemned the 27th Amendment. He said that “with the passing of this amendment, democracy here will only exist in name”, adding that his party “will not accept” it. It was a disservice to the “constitutional oath”, he decried. “When you take the oath, you vow to exercise responsibility and honesty for the good of the people and democracy,” Gohar added. Speaking about the proposal to establish a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), he recalled that “this was also a part of the agenda for the 26th Amendment last year”. He claimed that the government had declared it “unconstitutional” back then. “The head of state was issuing orders from Baku and so we are labelling this the Baku amendment,” Gohar continued,  apparently referring to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif presiding over a federal cabinet meeting — which approved the amendment — via a video link from Baku. Barrister Gohar recalled that “when the current government first came into power, the first thing they did was amend the National Accountability Ordinance,” claiming that they got “rid of all corruption cases filed against them” by doing so. “Now, on their way out, they want to give themselves immunity and hold themselves above the law,” he alleged. The PTI chairperson stressed that “real democracy requires one to uphold the law and practice accountability”. He went on to question: “In what part of the world does the president have lifetime immunity? “Can you not appear in front of a court and prove your innocence?” View this post on Instagram Continuing his speech, Gohar said: “The day he (jailed PTI founder Imran Khan) gets free, when that man of steel is freed, whatever he says, his words will be declared as the Constitution.” Then, coming back to the matter of immunity for the president, the PTI chairman said, “We make the law, and then while calling ourselves the protectors of the said law, we decide to grant ourselves immunity.” “What face will you show to the people of Pakistan? People who have run out of patience, who do not have the means to eat, or pay hospital bills, people who do not have access to justice in courts,” he remarked. Barrister Gohar said that by trying to pass this clause under the proposed amendment, the government was attempting to “create another elite class on top of the one that already exists.” Tarar tables bill Earlier, Law Minister Tarar tabled the bill in the NA today for the house’s consideration. The bill needs a two-thirds majority in order to be passed by the NA, which the ruling coalition has in the 336-member house as compared to the opposition’s 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, the PPP has 74, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has 22, the  Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid has five, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party has four, and the PML-Z, the Balochistan Awami Party, and the National Peoples Party have one seat each. The NA session today began with a prayer for PML-N Irfan Siddiqui, who passed away yesterday. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then asked Tarar to move the bill for the constitutional amendment to be taken into consideration, as stated in the house’s agenda for today. The law minister moved the bill, recalling that when the legislation for the 26th Constitutional Amendment had landed in the house, “two main political parties, after much debate and discussion, made a few adjustments in the promises made to the public under the Charter of Democracy ”. “One of those key points was the establishment of a constitutional court […] Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman kept our friends from the opposition on board regarding this, and you all know that it was on their request that we agreed on establishing a constitutional bench instead of a constitutional court,” Tarar continued. Subsequently, he said, the amendment for establishing a constitutional bench was passed. However, he added, several objections were raised over it, with the critics saying that “you have formed a court within a court, and that this system will not continue”. Making a case for the constitutional court, Tarar said “some sensitive constitutional matters had surfaced in the past — and they will surface in the future as well — that took up most of the quality time of the court”. So, he continued, coalition partners were consulted, and it was agreed that a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) should be established. The minister said the salient features pertaining to the FCC in the amendment bill were the same as the points agreed in the Charter of Democracy. At this point, opposition members could be heard protesting in the background. Nevertheless, Tarar continued that an impression had been created that Article 184(3) of the Constitution — which elaborates on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court — was being abolished. But it was not the case, he clarified, adding that the powers granted under the clause would be transferred to the FCC and “a pari materia provision has been introduced after Article 175-B [in the Constitution], pertaining to the [court’s] jurisdiction”. He said in connection with Article 184 of the Constitution, the parliamentary committee that deliberated on the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment also discussed the matter of the court’s suo motu powers, “to which prime ministers, government employees, actors and even the country’s economic system had fallen victim”. In view of these past instances, he said the FCC was not being granted suo motu powers under the new proposed amendment. Instead, an application would have to be submitted and fulfil the criteria outlined under Article 184(3) — that the matter in question was of public importance and required the enforcement of fundamental rights — to exercise this power, elaborated. This power “will not be used to grill an individual”, he asserted. On the matter of transfer of judges, he said after discussion and deliberation, it had been decided that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) be given the authority to transfer judges. The initial draft of the bill stated that a judge would be deemed retired if he refused a transfer, Tarar said, adding that the clause had now been amended to provide judges an opportunity to present their stance to the JCP regarding their transfer. But after a decision regarding a judge’s transfer was finalised and the judge refused the transfer, the matter would be referred to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). The SJC would then decide whether a judge’s stance was valid, or not and warranted action. The minister pointed out that under the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, there were two courts at the apex level — the SC and FCC. The FCC, he said, had more or less the same powers as granted to the constitutional bench established under the 26th Amendment. “These powers include those granted under Articles 184 and 186, of deciding on matters among provinces, giving advice on presidential references, making decisions regarding the transfer of cases […] and deciding on writ petitions under Article 199 except in some cases,” he elaborated. The minister argued that this would reduce the SC caseload and the “Supreme Court will now have the time and energy to hear the cases of the common man”. He said the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi would continue to head the JCP and SJC under the new amendment on the basis of his seniority. Tarar added that the CJP would also continue to head any other body that he was currently heading. Moreover, he continued, it had been proposed that from among the top judges of the SC and FCC, the senior judge would head these bodies. “If they are appointed on the same day, seniority will be determined on the basis of the day they entered in the office in the high court or the Supreme Court,” Tarar explained. Another recommendation was that the five-judge panel of the JCP would comprise the top-most and senior puisne judges of the SC and FCC, Tarar said, adding that the two chief justices would decide who would be appointed as the fifth member of the panel. If they couldn’t nominate anyone, the matter would be referred to the commission, the law minister said. Tarar said it was also proposed in the bill that if an elected senator took their oath after a delay, the period of their term would be reduced accordingly. Speaking about Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces,  Tarar said the government decided after consultation to bestow the rank of Field Marshal upon Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir in light of the successes achieved during May conflict with India. He said it was also decided that under Article 243, “no individual will have the power to deprive a national hero of the title of Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force or Admiral of the Fleet. These titles will be for lifetime. But if there are valid grounds on the basis of which one is of the opinion that these titles should be withdrawn, Parliament will decide on it after deliberation”. On the matter of the president’s lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests, Tarar said a caveat had been added to the original proposal that the immunity would be waived for the period during which a former president would hold public office. He then urged the house to carry out a “fruitful discussion” on the proposed amendment. Speaker on opposition leader’s appointment At one point during the session, NA Speaker Sadiq made observations regarding the appointment of the leader of the opposition in the house. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub in August, and while the opposition party has requested the appointment of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party’s Mehmood Khan Achakzai in his place, the latter is yet to be notified as the opposition leader. Addressing the matter today, Sadiq said the matter was currently sub judice, and therefore, the house would await the court’s decision before taking any further steps on the issue. Referring to his meeting with PTI’s Asad Qaiser and Amir Dogar, the speaker said the matter of the opposition leader’s appointment had been referred back to the Peshawar High Court by the Supreme Court. The matter would be taken up in the assembly once the court delivered its verdict, he added. Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, from the MQM, also spoke during the session. He referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of local governments and to which his party had sought amendments. The matter, however, has not been included in the 27th Amendment. Kamal said the “matter is not dead yet” and will soon be discussed as part of a 28th constitutional amendment. Highlighting the importance of local governments, he said: “If you want to have rights and resources, good governance policies — of the federal as well as the provincial government — at people’s doorsteps, there’s no vehicle for that [at present].” Bill sails through Senate The PML-N-led coalition government on Monday succeeded in manouvering the passage of the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill through the Senate, securing a two-thirds majority with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines. The bill, seeking crucial changes to several articles of the Constitution mostly dealing with the judiciary and the military leadership, was presented before the upper house of Parliament for a final vote by Law Minister Tarar amid a noisy protest by opposition senators. As soon as Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani started putting up the bill for a clause-by-clause vote, the opposition senators started gathering in front of his dais and chanted anti-government slogans. They tore up copies of the bill and agenda and some of them were seen hurling the documents towards the law minister, prompting the sergeants-at-arm to make a human wall at the aisle between the treasury and the opposition benches to prevent any possible physical clash. After staying in the house for a few minutes, the opposition senators belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) staged a walkout from the house, providing the government with an opportunity to proceed smoothly. After holding the vote on the bill by division, Senate Chairman Gilani announced that the 27th Amendment bill had been passed with 64 votes, which is not less than a two-thirds majority in the 96-member house. After casting his vote against the party line, PTI’s Saifullah Abro announced his resignation from the house. Speaking on the floor, Senator Abro said he had “voted only for [Field Marshal] Gen Asim Munir”, adding that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by defeating India in the May war. He added that during the [passage of the] 26th Amen­dment, “my 10 family members were abducted, but my party [PTI] did not come to the rescue. Interestingly, when he tendered his resignation, Senate Chairman Gilani said, “We will make you a senator again”. Meanwhile, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. Changes in the bill During yesterday’s Senate session, PPP Senator Farooq Naek presented the final report on the bill, approved by the standing committees on the law and justice of the two houses, highlighting three to four changes that had been suggested by members. About the changes incorporated into the bill on recommendation of the parliamentary committees, Senator Naek said the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) would have equal representation of all provinces besides a representative from the Islamabad High Court. He said the initial draft of the bill stated a judge having served for seven years in the high court could be nominated for the FCC, but this qualification merit has been curtailed to five years on the recommendation. Moreover, he said, the committees agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. On the other hand, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. However, he added, if multiple judges would take the oath the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age. Also, the parliamentary committees suggested a change in the nomination for the reconstituted Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), he said. The 26th Amendment had authorised the speaker to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate for the JCP, he explained. However, the committees proposed that the nominee should be a technocrat, he added. The PPP senator said the suo motu powers of judges had not been taken away, but the court would exercise these powers only when an application was submitted. “The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed,” he said. The PPP senator, who was part of the committee that examined the initial draft of the bill, said that an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided under Article 199 of the Constitution. Since this created a huge backlog, the amendment suggested that interim order would be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made, he explained. Referring to the procedure of judges’ transfer, Mr Naek said previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, the President could transfer judges with their consent and after consultation with the chief justices of both relevant high courts. However, this procedure has been amended, he said. “Now a judge refusing his transfer would be given an opportunity of presenting his reasons for the decline before the JCP. And if the JCP finds the reasons invalid, he would have to retire,” the senator explained. About the provision of lifetime immunity to the president from facing criminal trial or arrest under Article 248, he said it was suggested that this immunity would not be available if the President holds a public office after the end of his term, but as soon as he ceases that public office he would again be entitled to this immunity. According to a proposed amendment in Article 243, this type of lifetime immunity has also been provided to the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the navy.",

      "summary_en": "The National Assembly deliberated on the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment bill on Tuesday — a day after the government succeeded in manoeuvring it through the Senate — with PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan accusing the government of attempting to “create another elite class”. He made these remarks particularly in reference to a proposal under the 27th Amendment to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests. Speaking after Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, who presented the bill in the lower house of Parliament, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan condemned the 27th Amendment. He said that “with the passing of this amendment, democracy here will only exist in name”, adding that his party “will not accept” it. It was a disservice to the “constitutional oath”, he decried. “When you take the oath, you vow to exercise responsibility and honesty for the good of the people and democracy,” Gohar added. Speaking about the proposal to establish a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), he recalled that “this was also a part of the agenda for the 26th Amendment last year”. He claimed that the government had declared it “unconstitutional” back then. “The head of state was issuing orders from Baku and so we are labelling this the Baku amendment,” Gohar continued,  apparently referring to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif presiding over a federal cabinet meeting — which approved the amendment — via a video link from Baku. Barrister Gohar recalled that “when the current government first came into power, the first thing they did was amend the National Accountability Ordinance,” claiming that they got “rid of all corruption cases filed against them” by doing so. “Now, on their way out, they want to give themselves immunity and hold themselves above the law,” he alleged. The PTI chairperson stressed that “real democracy requires one to uphold the law and practice accountability”. He went on to question: “In what part of the world does the president have lifetime immunity? “Can you not appear in front of a court and prove your innocence?” View this post on Instagram Continuing his speech, Gohar said: “The day he (jailed PTI founder Imran Khan) gets free, when that man of steel is freed, whatever he says, his words will be declared as the Constitution.” Then, coming back to the matter of immunity for the president, the PTI chairman said, “We make the law, and then while calling ourselves the protectors of the said law, we decide to grant ourselves immunity.” “What face will you show to the people of Pakistan? People who have run out of patience, who do not have the means to eat, or pay hospital bills, people who do not have access to justice in courts,” he remarked.

But it was not the case, he clarified, adding that the powers granted under the clause would be transferred to the FCC and “a pari materia provision has been introduced after Article 175-B [in the Constitution], pertaining to the [court’s] jurisdiction”. He said in connection with Article 184 of the Constitution, the parliamentary committee that deliberated on the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment also discussed the matter of the court’s suo motu powers, “to which prime ministers, government employees, actors and even the country’s economic system had fallen victim”. In view of these past instances, he said the FCC was not being granted suo motu powers under the new proposed amendment. Instead, an application would have to be submitted and fulfil the criteria outlined under Article 184(3) — that the matter in question was of public importance and required the enforcement of fundamental rights — to exercise this power, elaborated. This power “will not be used to grill an individual”, he asserted. On the matter of transfer of judges, he said after discussion and deliberation, it had been decided that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) be given the authority to transfer judges. The initial draft of the bill stated that a judge would be deemed retired if he refused a transfer, Tarar said, adding that the clause had now been amended to provide judges an opportunity to present their stance to the JCP regarding their transfer. But after a decision regarding a judge’s transfer was finalised and the judge refused the transfer, the matter would be referred to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). The SJC would then decide whether a judge’s stance was valid, or not and warranted action. The minister pointed out that under the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, there were two courts at the apex level — the SC and FCC. The FCC, he said, had more or less the same powers as granted to the constitutional bench established under the 26th Amendment. “These powers include those granted under Articles 184 and 186, of deciding on matters among provinces, giving advice on presidential references, making decisions regarding the transfer of cases […] and deciding on writ petitions under Article 199 except in some cases,” he elaborated. The minister argued that this would reduce the SC caseload and the “Supreme Court will now have the time and energy to hear the cases of the common man”. He said the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi would continue to head the JCP and SJC under the new amendment on the basis of his seniority. Tarar added that the CJP would also continue to head any other body that he was currently heading. Moreover, he continued, it had been proposed that from among the top judges of the SC and FCC, the senior judge would head these bodies. “If they are appointed on the same day, seniority will be determined on the basis of the day they entered in the office in the high court or the Supreme Court,” Tarar explained. Another recommendation was that the five-judge panel of the JCP would comprise the top-most and senior puisne judges of the SC and FCC, Tarar said, adding that the two chief justices would decide who would be appointed as the fifth member of the panel. If they couldn’t nominate anyone, the matter would be referred to the commission, the law minister said. Tarar said it was also proposed in the bill that if an elected senator took their oath after a delay, the period of their term would be reduced accordingly. Speaking about Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces,  Tarar said the government decided after consultation to bestow the rank of Field Marshal upon Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir in light of the successes achieved during May conflict with India. He said it was also decided that under Article 243, “no individual will have the power to deprive a national hero of the title of Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force or Admiral of the Fleet. These titles will be for lifetime. But if there are valid grounds on the basis of which one is of the opinion that these titles should be withdrawn, Parliament will decide on it after deliberation”. On the matter of the president’s lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests, Tarar said a caveat had been added to the original proposal that the immunity would be waived for the period during which a former president would hold public office. He then urged the house to carry out a “fruitful discussion” on the proposed amendment. Speaker on opposition leader’s appointment At one point during the session, NA Speaker Sadiq made observations regarding the appointment of the leader of the opposition in the house. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub in August, and while the opposition party has requested the appointment of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party’s Mehmood Khan Achakzai in his place, the latter is yet to be notified as the opposition leader. Addressing the matter today, Sadiq said the matter was currently sub judice, and therefore, the house would await the court’s decision before taking any further steps on the issue. Referring to his meeting with PTI’s Asad Qaiser and Amir Dogar, the speaker said the matter of the opposition leader’s appointment had been referred back to the Peshawar High Court by the Supreme Court. The matter would be taken up in the assembly once the court delivered its verdict, he added. Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, from the MQM, also spoke during the session. He referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of local governments and to which his party had sought amendments. The matter, however, has not been included in the 27th Amendment. Kamal said the “matter is not dead yet” and will soon be discussed as part of a 28th constitutional amendment. Highlighting the importance of local governments, he said: “If you want to have rights and resources, good governance policies — of the federal as well as the provincial government — at people’s doorsteps, there’s no vehicle for that [at present].” Bill sails through Senate The PML-N-led coalition government on Monday succeeded in manouvering the passage of the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill through the Senate, securing a two-thirds majority with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines. The bill, seeking crucial changes to several articles of the Constitution mostly dealing with the judiciary and the military leadership, was presented before the upper house of Parliament for a final vote by Law Minister Tarar amid a noisy protest by opposition senators. As soon as Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani started putting up the bill for a clause-by-clause vote, the opposition senators started gathering in front of his dais and chanted anti-government slogans. They tore up copies of the bill and agenda and some of them were seen hurling the documents towards the law minister, prompting the sergeants-at-arm to make a human wall at the aisle between the treasury and the opposition benches to prevent any possible physical clash. After staying in the house for a few minutes, the opposition senators belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) staged a walkout from the house, providing the government with an opportunity to proceed smoothly. After holding the vote on the bill by division, Senate Chairman Gilani announced that the 27th Amendment bill had been passed with 64 votes, which is not less than a two-thirds majority in the 96-member house. After casting his vote against the party line, PTI’s Saifullah Abro announced his resignation from the house. Speaking on the floor, Senator Abro said he had “voted only for [Field Marshal] Gen Asim Munir”, adding that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by defeating India in the May war. He added that during the [passage of the] 26th Amen­dment, “my 10 family members were abducted, but my party [PTI] did not come to the rescue. Interestingly, when he tendered his resignation, Senate Chairman Gilani said, “We will make you a senator again”. Meanwhile, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. Changes in the bill During yesterday’s Senate session, PPP Senator Farooq Naek presented the final report on the bill, approved by the standing committees on the law and justice of the two houses, highlighting three to four changes that had been suggested by members. About the changes incorporated into the bill on recommendation of the parliamentary committees, Senator Naek said the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) would have equal representation of all provinces besides a representative from the Islamabad High Court. He said the initial draft of the bill stated a judge having served for seven years in the high court could be nominated for the FCC, but this qualification merit has been curtailed to five years on the recommendation. Moreover, he said, the committees agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. On the other hand, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. However, he added, if multiple judges would take the oath the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age. Also, the parliamentary committees suggested a change in the nomination for the reconstituted Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), he said. The 26th Amendment had authorised the speaker to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate for the JCP, he explained. However, the committees proposed that the nominee should be a technocrat, he added. The PPP senator said the suo motu powers of judges had not been taken away, but the court would exercise these powers only when an application was submitted. “The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed,” he said. The PPP senator, who was part of the committee that examined the initial draft of the bill, said that an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided under Article 199 of the Constitution. Since this created a huge backlog, the amendment suggested that interim order would be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made, he explained. Referring to the procedure of judges’ transfer, Mr Naek said previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, the President could transfer judges with their consent and after consultation with the chief justices of both relevant high courts. However, this procedure has been amended, he said. “Now a judge refusing his transfer would be given an opportunity of presenting his reasons for the decline before the JCP. And if the JCP finds the reasons invalid, he would have to retire,” the senator explained. About the provision of lifetime immunity to the president from facing criminal trial or arrest under Article 248, he said it was suggested that this immunity would not be available if the President holds a public office after the end of his term, but as soon as he ceases that public office he would again be entitled to this immunity. According to a proposed amendment in Article 243, this type of lifetime immunity has also been provided to the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the navy.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday said that “three [people] have been martyred” during the ongoing operation against terrorists hiding inside the Cadet College in South Waziristan’s Wana district, adding that security forces have successfully rescued everyone from the building. “There were around 550 students and nearly 40 teachers [inside the college]. By the grace of god, our soldiers saved everyone there,” Naqvi said while addressing the media in Islamabad. Naqvi did not specify who was martyred during the operation. “The terrorists had planned to hold them (cadets) hostage there, but their plan could not materialise. “However, the clearance of the area is underway and will be completed in a bit,” the minister added. View this post on Instagram Security forces had killed two terrorists yesterday after attackers rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the college’s main gate, causing it to collapse and damaging an adjacent structure. In his media talk, Naqvi said, “We are very clear in that that Afghanistan is directly involved in the entire attack. Noting that the terrorists had been identified as Afghan, the interior minister said the attackers’ “communication with their people in Afghanistan also continued the entire night”. The minister further said, “I will request my brothers in KP that please do not defame yourselves. We must stand with our country, with our forces who are clearing these terrorists. “They (terrorists) are trying to defame you; they are trying to take you on board based on their ties, but Pakistan should be the priority for us. Any other country comes later,” he added. Referring to multiple visits carried out by top Pakistani leadership to Afghanistan, Naqvi said: “The foreign minister, deputy prime minister, defence minister — we all have gone numerous times and presented them with evidence and details on how they (terrorists) are being trained in Afghanistan, how they plan and then come here to carry out attacks.” He asserted, “We are very clear in this that Afghanistan must stop them under all circumstances. In case of not stopping them, we will have no other option but to deal with the terrorists who are attacking our country.” 3 terrorists hiding inside a college building Earlier today, security sources said that a clearance operation to eliminate three terrorists was underway at the educational facility. “An operation was underway to eliminate three khwarij present inside the Cadet College,” security sources said in a statement, adding that it was being reported that all of them hailed from Afghanistan. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while khwarij refers to terrorists associated with it. The security operation will continue till the eradication of the last terrorist, security sources asserted. View this post on Instagram They added that the terrorists were hidden in a building that was located far away from the cadets’ residence. They asserted that the clearance operation was being carried out with great expertise to ensure that the cadets’ lives remained safe and they were not harmed. The security source said the terrorists were “continuously taking directives from Afghanistan on the telephone”. Meanwhile, state-run PTV reported that at the time of the attack, approximately 650 individuals, including 525 cadets, were present. “Security forces have so far safely rescued 115 individuals,” PTV reported, citing security sources. “The three Afghan khwarij present in the Cadet College have been confined to a specific building of the college, and security forces have the area surrounded,” the report added. “The building where the Afghan khwarij are located is situated at a considerable distance from the cadets’ residential buildings. So far, all cadets are safe.” The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said yesterday that the terrorists inside the college were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan and “are getting instructions“. “This blatant act of barbarism orchestrated by khwarij from Afghanistan is in contrast to assertions made by the Afghan Taliban Regime claiming non-presence of these terrorist groups on their soil,“ the ISPR had said. Hailing yesterday’s response by the military, a security source noted, “The Pakistan Army’s soldiers sent two khwarij to hell by taking immediate and courageous action.” “Terrorists attacking innocent tribal children have no connection with Islam or the prosperity of Pakistan’s people,” they asserted. It had further said, “These khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij have once again tried to repeat the barbaric act of terrorism carried out by them in Army Public School Peshawar in 2014.“ On Dec 16, 2014, Pakistan lived through one of its most horrific chapters. The attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar and the operation to clear out the terrorists unfolded in less than 10 hours, during which 147 people, including 132 schoolchildren, were martyred. The military maintained that the latest attack aimed to instil fear among the youth of the tribal areas, “who are acquiring quality education at their doorstep to excel in life and achieve a better future for not only themselves and their families but also for their communities“. Earlier on Monday, security forces killed 20 terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBO) in KP — eight in North Waziristan and 12 in the Dara Adam Khel district. Another four were eliminated in Balochistan’s Kalat. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel.",

      "summary_orig": "An earlier version of this story erroneously stated the volume of monthly losses as $4.5 billion. The error was due to a typing mistake and has since been rectified. KHYBER: The month-long closure of Torkham border crossing has caused a cumulative loss of over $45 million and another Rs16.5 billion in terms of exports and imports respectively through Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan. Sources among official and trading circles told Dawn that Pakistan had already lost over 65 per cent of the Afghan market to Iran, some Central Asian States, Turkiye and even India due to hostile and aggressive trade policies dictated by security issues since the installation of the Taliban regime in Kabul in August 2021. They said that while big time Pakistan and Afghan exporters had lifted their capital from the export-import business between the two neighbouring countries due to the repeated border closure and a hostile environment for traders and investors, the month-long closure of all border points had seriously dented the confidence of remaining “bunch” of small traders. The sources said that while the uncertain situation had also dealt a severe blow to the burgeoning local manufacturing industry in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the border closure had seriously impacted manufacture of hundreds of daily items in Punjab and Sindh, which were exported to Afghanistan under the head of the miscellaneous items daily prior to the closure of the border. They said that Afghanistan was currently importing cement, garments, shoes and slippers, a variety of edibles including different vegetables, fresh fruits, fish, chicken and other poultry items, animal feed and confectionery items. The sources said that the prolonged border closure had negatively impacted the potato and banana exports, while the kinnow export was also in doldrums if immediate steps were not taken to ease border tensions. Qari Nazeem Gul, an exporter and clearing agent, told Dawn that even before the border tensions began, at least markets in Kabul and Jalalabad were flooded with Iranian, Turkish and Central Asian products with Iran grabbing the major share of its exports to Afghanistan. He said that Afghan traders were more interested and comfortable in doing trade with Iran instead of Pakistan as Iran was offering them more relaxations in acquisition of visas and custom duties. “We are now hugely disheartened with the current pattern of complicated business with Afghanistan with most of the local traders now developing a hatred for the said trade due to continuous security and political issues between the two neighbouring countries,” he said. Equally concerned was Mujeebullah Shinwari, who heads the Torkham customs clearing agents association. “We’ve long been advocating for a trader-friendly policy by the government with special focus on alienating bilateral trade from security and political issues with Afghanistan,” he said. Mr Shinwari said that the volume of Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan had dropped from $2.5 billion in the years from 2012 to 2016 to a mere $800 to 900 million dollars on an annual basis. “Gone are the times when 1000-1200 shipping containers loaded with multiple export items would cross over to Afghanistan on a daily basis, as we now have 250-300 containers left in the export field on a daily basis,” he said. The customs clearing agents’ leader said that the suspension of bilateral trade was also harming revenue generation through tax collection under various heads that was up till now a handsome amount for the national exchequer. He said that the current volatile and uncertain situation had deeply affected the small-time businessmen, traders and even shopkeepers in local markets as a large number of people affiliated with different trading fields had lost their legitimate earnings. Mr Shinwari said that the local trading and transport community had never experienced such a long closure of the border with a majority of the vehicle owners who got stranded due to sudden closure of Torkham on October 12 were now contemplating to switch over to other less profitable business venture in order to cover for the month-long financial loses. He suggested the formation of an all-powerful jirga of leading tribal elders, politicians and traders to hold meaningful dialogue with officials of both the countries to find a mutually agreed formula for reopening of all borders points for trading and thus, saving business communities of both countries from further financial losses. Meanwhile, Israr Shinwari, head of a local youth organisation, has demanded the immediate reopening of the Torkham border through a powerful jirga mediating between the two countries. During a meeting in Landi Kotal on Monday, he said that the Pak-Afghan border points should be kept open in all circumstances, with a special focus on promoting trade between the two countries. Mr Shinwari, however, warned a series of protest demonstrations would be staged if their legitimate demands weren’t met. Published in Dawn, November 11th, 2025",

He said that Afghan traders were more interested and comfortable in doing trade with Iran instead of Pakistan as Iran was offering them more relaxations in acquisition of visas and custom duties. “We are now hugely disheartened with the current pattern of complicated business with Afghanistan with most of the local traders now developing a hatred for the said trade due to continuous security and political issues between the two neighbouring countries,” he said. Equally concerned was Mujeebullah Shinwari, who heads the Torkham customs clearing agents association. “We’ve long been advocating for a trader-friendly policy by the government with special focus on alienating bilateral trade from security and political issues with Afghanistan,” he said. Mr Shinwari said that the volume of Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan had dropped from $2.5 billion in the years from 2012 to 2016 to a mere $800 to 900 million dollars on an annual basis. “Gone are the times when 1000-1200 shipping containers loaded with multiple export items would cross over to Afghanistan on a daily basis, as we now have 250-300 containers left in the export field on a daily basis,” he said. The customs clearing agents’ leader said that the suspension of bilateral trade was also harming revenue generation through tax collection under various heads that was up till now a handsome amount for the national exchequer. He said that the current volatile and uncertain situation had deeply affected the small-time businessmen, traders and even shopkeepers in local markets as a large number of people affiliated with different trading fields had lost their legitimate earnings. Mr Shinwari said that the local trading and transport community had never experienced such a long closure of the border with a majority of the vehicle owners who got stranded due to sudden closure of Torkham on October 12 were now contemplating to switch over to other less profitable business venture in order to cover for the month-long financial loses. He suggested the formation of an all-powerful jirga of leading tribal elders, politicians and traders to hold meaningful dialogue with officials of both the countries to find a mutually agreed formula for reopening of all borders points for trading and thus, saving business communities of both countries from further financial losses. Meanwhile, Israr Shinwari, head of a local youth organisation, has demanded the immediate reopening of the Torkham border through a powerful jirga mediating between the two countries. During a meeting in Landi Kotal on Monday, he said that the Pak-Afghan border points should be kept open in all circumstances, with a special focus on promoting trade between the two countries. Mr Shinwari, however, warned a series of protest demonstrations would be staged if their legitimate demands weren’t met. Published in Dawn, November 11th, 2025",
      "title": "Month-long Torkham border closure inflicts $45 million trade losses",
      "summary": "An earlier version of this story erroneously stated the volume of monthly losses as $4.5 billion. The error was due to a typing mistake and has since been rectified. KHYBER: The month-long closure of Torkham border crossing has caused a cumulative loss of over $45 million and another Rs16.5 billion in terms of exports and imports respectively through Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan. Sources among official and trading circles told Dawn that Pakistan had already lost over 65 per cent of the Afghan market to Iran, some Central Asian States, Turkiye and even India due to hostile and aggressive trade policies dictated by security issues since the installation of the Taliban regime in Kabul in August 2021. They said that while big time Pakistan and Afghan exporters had lifted their capital from the export-import business between the two neighbouring countries due to the repeated border closure and a hostile environment for traders and investors, the month-long closure of all border points had seriously dented the confidence of remaining “bunch” of small traders. The sources said that while the uncertain situation had also dealt a severe blow to the burgeoning local manufacturing industry in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the border closure had seriously impacted manufacture of hundreds of daily items in Punjab and Sindh, which were exported to Afghanistan under the head of the miscellaneous items daily prior to the closure of the border. They said that Afghanistan was currently importing cement, garments, shoes and slippers, a variety of edibles including different vegetables, fresh fruits, fish, chicken and other poultry items, animal feed and confectionery items. The sources said that the prolonged border closure had negatively impacted the potato and banana exports, while the kinnow export was also in doldrums if immediate steps were not taken to ease border tensions.

      "title_orig": "Modi vows not to spare those behind New Delhi car blast",
      "summary_orig": "Indian police are investigating a deadly car blast in New Delhi under a law used to fight “terrorism”, an officer said on Tuesday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to bring to justice all those responsible. The explosion near the historic Red Fort on Monday evening killed at least eight people and injured 20. It was the first such blast in the heavily guarded city of more than 30 million since 2011. “Today, I have come to Bhutan with a very heavy heart,” Modi said in Thimphu, the capital of the neighbouring Himalayan nation, as he arrived on Tuesday for a scheduled visit. “The horrific incident that happened in Delhi last evening has deeply disturbed everyone,” Modi told a public meeting. “Our agencies will get to the very bottom of this conspiracy. The conspirators behind this will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice.” New Delhi’s deputy chief fire officer A.K. Malik told AFP shortly after the explosion that eight people had been killed. The Press Trust of India news agency reported on Tuesday that the death toll had risen to 12, although that figure has not been confirmed. Home Minister Amit Shah told reporters late on Monday that security forces were “keeping all angles open”, adding that it was “very difficult to say what caused the incident” until forensic samples had been analysed. The blast, if confirmed as an attack, would be the first significant security incident since April 22, when 26 mainly Hindu civilians were killed at the tourist site of Pahalgam in India-occupied Kashmir. India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also vowed today that those responsible for a deadly car explosion will face justice. “The country’s leading investigative agencies are conducting a swift and thorough inquiry into the incident — findings of the investigation will soon be made public,” Singh told a conference in New Delhi. “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice, and will not be spared under any circumstances.” The defence minister said agencies were carrying out a swift, thorough investigation, with the findings to be made public soon. Crime scene investigators scoured through the wreckage of a car early on Tuesday, hours after the intense explosion. Security was increased across New Delhi as both forensic and anti-terrorism agencies searched for evidence. Deputy Commissioner of Police Raja Banthia said Delhi police had registered a case under the anti-terrorism law, as well as the Explosives Act and other criminal laws. The law, called the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, is India’s main anti-terrorism law. It is used to investigate and prosecute acts related to “terrorism” and activities that threaten the sovereignty and integrity of the country. “Investigation is at a preliminary stage and any comment on it will be too premature,” Banthia told reporters. Near the site of the blast in the city’s old quarters, a busy market and tourist area, most shops that shut soon after the explosion were yet to open in the early hours of Tuesday. Forensic experts were seen scouring the site of the blast, which has been sealed since Monday night and enclosed in white cloth barriers. Security personnel and a member of the forensic team work at the site of an explosion near the historic Red Fort in the old quarters of Delhi, India, on Nov 11, 2025. — Reuters Delhi Metro said the Red Fort station had been shut for security reasons.\nPolice said a slow-moving car, which stopped at a traffic signal, exploded just before 7pm (6:30pm PKT). Nearby vehicles were also badly damaged. The explosion left behind mangled bodies and the wreckage of several cars on a congested street near a metro station in the old quarter of Delhi. There was no immediate information on the occupants of the car, who were presumed to have been killed. Police said they were tracing the owner of the car. Relatives of the victims gathered outside the nearby Lok Nayak hospital to identify the bodies of their loved ones. “We at least know that my cousin is here, whether he is injured or not or the extent of his injury, we don’t know anything,” said a distressed relative who did not want to be named. Before leaving for his state visit to Bhutan, Modi offered his “condolences to those who have lost their loved ones in the blast in Delhi”. “I understand the pain of the families.

      "summary_en": "Indian police are investigating a deadly car blast in New Delhi under a law used to fight “terrorism”, an officer said on Tuesday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to bring to justice all those responsible. The explosion near the historic Red Fort on Monday evening killed at least eight people and injured 20. It was the first such blast in the heavily guarded city of more than 30 million since 2011. “Today, I have come to Bhutan with a very heavy heart,” Modi said in Thimphu, the capital of the neighbouring Himalayan nation, as he arrived on Tuesday for a scheduled visit. “The horrific incident that happened in Delhi last evening has deeply disturbed everyone,” Modi told a public meeting. “Our agencies will get to the very bottom of this conspiracy. The conspirators behind this will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice.” New Delhi’s deputy chief fire officer A.K. Malik told AFP shortly after the explosion that eight people had been killed. The Press Trust of India news agency reported on Tuesday that the death toll had risen to 12, although that figure has not been confirmed. Home Minister Amit Shah told reporters late on Monday that security forces were “keeping all angles open”, adding that it was “very difficult to say what caused the incident” until forensic samples had been analysed. The blast, if confirmed as an attack, would be the first significant security incident since April 22, when 26 mainly Hindu civilians were killed at the tourist site of Pahalgam in India-occupied Kashmir. India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also vowed today that those responsible for a deadly car explosion will face justice. “The country’s leading investigative agencies are conducting a swift and thorough inquiry into the incident — findings of the investigation will soon be made public,” Singh told a conference in New Delhi. “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice, and will not be spared under any circumstances.” The defence minister said agencies were carrying out a swift, thorough investigation, with the findings to be made public soon. Crime scene investigators scoured through the wreckage of a car early on Tuesday, hours after the intense explosion. Security was increased across New Delhi as both forensic and anti-terrorism agencies searched for evidence. Deputy Commissioner of Police Raja Banthia said Delhi police had registered a case under the anti-terrorism law, as well as the Explosives Act and other criminal laws. The law, called the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, is India’s main anti-terrorism law. It is used to investigate and prosecute acts related to “terrorism” and activities that threaten the sovereignty and integrity of the country. “Investigation is at a preliminary stage and any comment on it will be too premature,” Banthia told reporters. Near the site of the blast in the city’s old quarters, a busy market and tourist area, most shops that shut soon after the explosion were yet to open in the early hours of Tuesday. Forensic experts were seen scouring the site of the blast, which has been sealed since Monday night and enclosed in white cloth barriers. Security personnel and a member of the forensic team work at the site of an explosion near the historic Red Fort in the old quarters of Delhi, India, on Nov 11, 2025. — Reuters Delhi Metro said the Red Fort station had been shut for security reasons.\nPolice said a slow-moving car, which stopped at a traffic signal, exploded just before 7pm (6:30pm PKT). Nearby vehicles were also badly damaged. The explosion left behind mangled bodies and the wreckage of several cars on a congested street near a metro station in the old quarter of Delhi. There was no immediate information on the occupants of the car, who were presumed to have been killed. Police said they were tracing the owner of the car. Relatives of the victims gathered outside the nearby Lok Nayak hospital to identify the bodies of their loved ones. “We at least know that my cousin is here, whether he is injured or not or the extent of his injury, we don’t know anything,” said a distressed relative who did not want to be named. Before leaving for his state visit to Bhutan, Modi offered his “condolences to those who have lost their loved ones in the blast in Delhi”. “I understand the pain of the families. The whole nation stands with them,” he said. The Red Fort is one of India’s most well-known landmarks.

      "title_orig": "PM Shehbaz says lasting peace hinges on Kabul reining in terror groups operating from Afghan soil",
      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that Kabul must understand that lasting peace could only be achieved by reining in terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil. “Afghanistan must understand that lasting peace can only be realised by reining in Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory,” Shehbaz said while addressing the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference in Islamabad. In his remarks, the premier said that the theme of the conference, “Peace, Security and Development”, could not be more timely and relevant. He added that the theme was particularly resonant for Pakistan, saying that the country had always advocated for peace through dialogue and diplomacy. “We firmly believe that peace and security form the foundation of sustainable national and regional development,” he said. “The true value of peace is most profoundly understood when we are confronted with the conflicts that continue to plague our world,” he said. The premier especially called attention to the recent border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, calling Islamabad’s response “firm and decisive, teaching an unforgettable lesson”. He also deeply appreciated the efforts of Turkiye and Qatar in facilitating peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban regime. “A peaceful Afghanistan holds the key to regional connectivity, peace, and prosperity,” he said. “This peace has remained elusive for decades. However, Pakistan has never lost hope. We believe in a peaceful neighbourhood and have been striving hard for this purpose,” he asserted. He regretted that terrorist groups continued to “imperil peace”, both within Afghanistan and outside it. The premier also talked about the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. “In May, Pakistan faced unprovoked aggression from the eastern front. Our armed forces displayed remarkable preparedness and performed outstandingly on the battlefield,” he said. “Having won the war, we need to win peace, through sincere and honest efforts,” Shehbaz said. He added that Pakistan’s commitment to upholding peace and security was manifested by its constructive role at diplomatic forums including the United Nations ( UN ), Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ), Economic Cooperation Organisation ( ECO ) and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ). The prime minister’s remarks come days after a third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism.

      "summary_en": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that Kabul must understand that lasting peace could only be achieved by reining in terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil. “Afghanistan must understand that lasting peace can only be realised by reining in Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory,” Shehbaz said while addressing the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference in Islamabad. In his remarks, the premier said that the theme of the conference, “Peace, Security and Development”, could not be more timely and relevant. He added that the theme was particularly resonant for Pakistan, saying that the country had always advocated for peace through dialogue and diplomacy. “We firmly believe that peace and security form the foundation of sustainable national and regional development,” he said. “The true value of peace is most profoundly understood when we are confronted with the conflicts that continue to plague our world,” he said. The premier especially called attention to the recent border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, calling Islamabad’s response “firm and decisive, teaching an unforgettable lesson”. He also deeply appreciated the efforts of Turkiye and Qatar in facilitating peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban regime. “A peaceful Afghanistan holds the key to regional connectivity, peace, and prosperity,” he said. “This peace has remained elusive for decades. However, Pakistan has never lost hope. We believe in a peaceful neighbourhood and have been striving hard for this purpose,” he asserted. He regretted that terrorist groups continued to “imperil peace”, both within Afghanistan and outside it. The premier also talked about the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. “In May, Pakistan faced unprovoked aggression from the eastern front. Our armed forces displayed remarkable preparedness and performed outstandingly on the battlefield,” he said. “Having won the war, we need to win peace, through sincere and honest efforts,” Shehbaz said. He added that Pakistan’s commitment to upholding peace and security was manifested by its constructive role at diplomatic forums including the United Nations ( UN ), Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ), Economic Cooperation Organisation ( ECO ) and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ). The prime minister’s remarks come days after a third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif insisted that the negotiations were “over” and had “entered an indefinite phase”.

      "summary_orig": "Supreme Court (SC) Justice Athar Minallah has written an emphatic letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, calling for the convening of a conference to consider threats to the judiciary while also lamenting the use of the apex court as an instrument to suppress the people’s will by “unelected elite”, it emerged on Tuesday. The development comes as the government is making moves for the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. The bill, which has been passed by the Senate, seeks crucial changes to a number of articles, mostly dealing with the judiciary and the military leadership. In the seven-page letter, which Dawn has seen, Justice Minallah said that the missive was being recorded as a “solemn duty to the Constitution and to place on record for future generations how their destiny was being shaped behind the marble walls of the last resort of justice”. He said that it was being written in the wake of recent events, which had greatly eroded public confidence in the judiciary. “Institutions are not built overnight, but they can be destroyed in no time through fear, surrender or submission to the powers. The history of our judiciary is not unblemished nor flattering. However, its past failings, no matter how grave, cannot justify its continued capture to serve the interests of the unelected elites,” he said. Justice Minallah said that as a sitting SC judge, he felt it was his duty to raise his concerns regarding the erosion of the people’s trust. “I had taken an oath to defend, protect, and preserve the Constitution, but find myself helpless because the fundamental rights covenanted to the people have too often been reduced to mere cliché or rhetoric. We may pretend otherwise, but the stark reality is unpleasant and embarrassing for me as a judge of the highest Court and as a guardian of the Constitution,” he said. Justice Minallah said that the truth had been concealed from the people for too long, adding that they had been misled and exploited so that the elite capture could sustain. “From the very inception of our independence, the history of the state has been marred by the unholy alliance between certain state institutions and entrenched elites. An alliance having the hallmark of control, privilege, and impunity. The SC, by design or omission, has too often been employed as an instrument to suppress the will of the people rather than to safeguard it,” he said. ‘Political dissent has been criminalised’ In his letter, Justice Minallah also said that jurisprudence had too often bowed before power and might instead of standing on the side of the people. He highlighted the removal and execution of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, saying it “remains one of the gravest and most unpardonable betrayal of our oath and of the people’s trust”. He further said that the persecution of Benazir Bhutto by “unelected elements” within state institutions, and the disqualification of Nawaz Sharif and the harassment of him and his daughter were a “continuation of a pattern of suppression of the people’s will when the interests of the unelected elite were threatened”. The SC judge noted that President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also fallen victim to this phenomenon. “The phenomenon represents a consistent pattern of elite manipulation, wherein leaders are fostered and then ruined. Once they are backed by the people’s mandate, they are systemically dismantled if and when they challenge the entrenched power. The will of the people has repeatedly been subverted to perpetuate the elite capture of the state; a betrayal and subversion that strikes at the very heart of constitutional democracy,” he said. He said that PTI founder Imran Khan was also being victimised under the same cycle of suppression. “Political dissent has been criminalised, those who refuse to bend, including women, are made to endure inhuman conditions. It is no longer a secret that justice is denied to them,” he said. “The truth is known to us, but it is whispered only in the tea room and chambers of this Court. The independence of this institution has too often been compromised from within, whether through surrender or through active participation,” he said. “We proclaim ourselves to be guardians of the fundamental rights, but we maintained silence when a former chief justice of Pakistan told us that the phenomenon of enforced disappearance had reached his doorstep. We also chose to look the other way when another chief justice, who in the context of the reserved seats case , had warned twelve judges of this very court that he was the one responsible for stalling the imposition of martial law and that ‘they would come and send us home’.” He further said that under the watch of the apex court, electoral outcomes were manipulated, the will of the people suppressed, dissenting voices silenced, undesirable political allegiance and opinions criminalised, and journalists abducted or intimidated. ‘Need for introspection undeniable’ Justice Minallah further said that at this critical juncture, the need for introspection was “undeniable”. “I would respectfully urge that a judicial conference be convened for having an open institutional dialogue with all judges of the SC and the high courts to consider threats to independence of the judiciary that may be jeopardising its constitutional function of acting as a machinery for enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens,” he said. “A candid and open discussion on the state of our institution, the challenges to its independence, and the steps necessary to reclaim the people’s trust has become inevitable. The judiciary is at a perilous crossroads. The truth must be spoken at this moment of reckoning,” he said. He further said that Parliament may wish to consider the judiciary’s institutional perspective articulated through the proposed judicial conference, before it embarks upon “tinkering with the basic law of the land”. He noted that news reports suggested that preparations were underway to house the new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) within the building of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC). “What is the invisible process through which some within the judiciary have been made aware of the changes that are to proposed through a Constitutional amendment? And what explains their eagerness to make advance administrative arrangements to accommodate the proposed structure of the judiciary even prior to the Parliament considering it?” he asked. He said that the judiciary’s foremost loyalty lay not in self-preservation nor in deference to power but in allegiance to the people and to the Constitution. “This court and the judiciary as an institution are at a perilous crossroad and silence in the face of the systemic erosion of judicial independence would only\namount to complicity. Our oath compels us to speak and uphold the truth and to guard the Constitution even when it is inconvenient to do so,” he said. Full court demanded amid executive onslaught Justice Minallah’s letter comes a day after Justice Mansoor Ali Shah , in addition to several lawyers and former judges , requested CJP Afridi to play his role and act as the guardian of the judiciary’s independence. Senior puisne judge Shah, in a six-page letter, described the proposed amendment as a political device to weaken the judiciary and urged CJP Afridi to confront the executive to lay down a rule that no amendments affecting the judiciary be adopted without prior consultations with superior judges. “You [CJP] act not merely as its administrator but as its guardian,” Justice Shah said while also requesting a full court meeting or preferably a joint convention of all constitutional court judges, including the FSC and high courts, to articulate the judiciary’s collective stance. Justice Shah emphasised that this moment demanded leadership, transparency and institutional resolve. If such consultation is not initiated under CJ’s stewardship, it will inevitably be seen as acquiescence and an abdication of the trust reposed in the high office, he added. In his letter, Justice Shah also questioned the justification for creating the proposed FCC, asking what constitutional vacuum it would seek to fill. The proposed FCC does not arise from any genuine reform agenda, and its judges will be appointed without any constitutional parameters, as was the case with the Constitutional Bench (CB), the letter said, adding that such an arrangement vested decisive power in the executive and invited manipulation of the judicial process. A court may serve transient political interests, but it will permanently damage the republic, he added. Separately, former judges and top lawyers also wrote a letter to CJP Afridi, urging him to summon a full court meeting to discuss the 27th Constitutional Amendment. The request came in a letter that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers.",

It is no longer a secret that justice is denied to them,” he said. “The truth is known to us, but it is whispered only in the tea room and chambers of this Court. The independence of this institution has too often been compromised from within, whether through surrender or through active participation,” he said. “We proclaim ourselves to be guardians of the fundamental rights, but we maintained silence when a former chief justice of Pakistan told us that the phenomenon of enforced disappearance had reached his doorstep. We also chose to look the other way when another chief justice, who in the context of the reserved seats case , had warned twelve judges of this very court that he was the one responsible for stalling the imposition of martial law and that ‘they would come and send us home’.” He further said that under the watch of the apex court, electoral outcomes were manipulated, the will of the people suppressed, dissenting voices silenced, undesirable political allegiance and opinions criminalised, and journalists abducted or intimidated. ‘Need for introspection undeniable’ Justice Minallah further said that at this critical juncture, the need for introspection was “undeniable”. “I would respectfully urge that a judicial conference be convened for having an open institutional dialogue with all judges of the SC and the high courts to consider threats to independence of the judiciary that may be jeopardising its constitutional function of acting as a machinery for enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens,” he said. “A candid and open discussion on the state of our institution, the challenges to its independence, and the steps necessary to reclaim the people’s trust has become inevitable. The judiciary is at a perilous crossroads. The truth must be spoken at this moment of reckoning,” he said. He further said that Parliament may wish to consider the judiciary’s institutional perspective articulated through the proposed judicial conference, before it embarks upon “tinkering with the basic law of the land”. He noted that news reports suggested that preparations were underway to house the new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) within the building of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC). “What is the invisible process through which some within the judiciary have been made aware of the changes that are to proposed through a Constitutional amendment? And what explains their eagerness to make advance administrative arrangements to accommodate the proposed structure of the judiciary even prior to the Parliament considering it?” he asked. He said that the judiciary’s foremost loyalty lay not in self-preservation nor in deference to power but in allegiance to the people and to the Constitution. “This court and the judiciary as an institution are at a perilous crossroad and silence in the face of the systemic erosion of judicial independence would only\namount to complicity. Our oath compels us to speak and uphold the truth and to guard the Constitution even when it is inconvenient to do so,” he said. Full court demanded amid executive onslaught Justice Minallah’s letter comes a day after Justice Mansoor Ali Shah , in addition to several lawyers and former judges , requested CJP Afridi to play his role and act as the guardian of the judiciary’s independence. Senior puisne judge Shah, in a six-page letter, described the proposed amendment as a political device to weaken the judiciary and urged CJP Afridi to confront the executive to lay down a rule that no amendments affecting the judiciary be adopted without prior consultations with superior judges. “You [CJP] act not merely as its administrator but as its guardian,” Justice Shah said while also requesting a full court meeting or preferably a joint convention of all constitutional court judges, including the FSC and high courts, to articulate the judiciary’s collective stance. Justice Shah emphasised that this moment demanded leadership, transparency and institutional resolve. If such consultation is not initiated under CJ’s stewardship, it will inevitably be seen as acquiescence and an abdication of the trust reposed in the high office, he added. In his letter, Justice Shah also questioned the justification for creating the proposed FCC, asking what constitutional vacuum it would seek to fill. The proposed FCC does not arise from any genuine reform agenda, and its judges will be appointed without any constitutional parameters, as was the case with the Constitutional Bench (CB), the letter said, adding that such an arrangement vested decisive power in the executive and invited manipulation of the judicial process. A court may serve transient political interests, but it will permanently damage the republic, he added. Separately, former judges and top lawyers also wrote a letter to CJP Afridi, urging him to summon a full court meeting to discuss the 27th Constitutional Amendment. The request came in a letter that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers.",

      "summary_orig": "\"There is increasingly violent cynicism and criticism of the BBC amongst the public, but particularly amongst politicians,\" warns François Picard's Top Story guest: Professor Charlie Beckett, veteran journalist, editor and Professor of Practice and the London School of Economics' Director of Polis and the Polis/LSE JournalismAI project. Professor Beckett argues that the current turbulence at the BBC goes far beyond the fallout from a “bad edit” of Trump's infamous January 6th speech in a special edition of Panorama on Trump's second run for the presidency. Our guest asserts that the BBC's \"extraordinary\" loss of its top two executives is symptomatic of a decline in institutional trust, squeezed resources, weakened oversight and an environment in which politicised criticism and commercial pressure undermine the idea of an independent public service broadcaster. And the fragility of journalism is becoming more evident in a fractured hyper-politicised media eco‑system, where the audience demands relevance, the players fight for funding, and the mission becomes harder to maintain. Professor Beckett contends that if the BBC cannot defend its distinctiveness, transparency and value, we may lose not just a broadcaster but a valued global institution that has long stood for “objective, evidence‑based” journalism. The crisis, then, is both internal and external: \"In the same way that Donald Trump attacked media organisations that weren't slavishly loyal to him, so we're getting a much more partisan approach from politicians in the UK, and indeed from our newspapers, like the Daily Telegraph, which has always been very honestly right-wing, but is increasingly anti-BBC.",

      "title_orig": "Underdogs, take notes: Zohran Mamdani just broke the system (and won)",
      "summary_orig": "Forget everything you knew about New York politics: Zohran Mamdani just flipped the script. Armed with working-class solidarity, digital fluency, and meme-literate storytelling, the 34-year-old Queens Assemblyman didn’t just beat Andrew Cuomo — he made history. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Mamdani emerged as the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, clinching just over 50 per cent of the vote in one of the most closely watched races in decades. The shock wasn’t just in the result. It was in how he won. It was an insurgent campaign powered by aunties, taxi drivers, club DJs and night-shift nurses — not your average billionaires and consultants. Mamdani turned relentless field work into a campaign that made New Yorkers feel seen and the diaspora feel represented; a moment that spilled across boroughs and ricocheted through diasporas from Queens to Karachi. And yet, this victory wasn’t about vibes or progressive ideology alone. It was a strategy rooted in something older and truer: proximity. Mamdani embedded himself in the city’s daily rhythms from dawn at taxi depots to dusk at tai chi sessions, and from Queens bodegas to Bronx dance floors meeting New Yorkers where they actually live. While the existing political establishment figures such as Andrew Cuomo relied on TV ads and fundraisers, Mamdani relied on multilingual messaging, human contact and most importantly, the moral weight of showing up. The architecture a movement Long before declaring his run for Mayor, Mamdani stood shoulder to shoulder with medallion-debt taxi drivers, sleeping on pavements during their 2021 hunger strike . That solidarity didn’t fade with time; in fact, it matured into a network of trust. When he finally ran, those same drivers became his storytellers and precinct captains, spreading his name through garages, mosques, diners, and WhatsApp groups. While traditional campaigns clocked off at sunset, Mamdani’s chose to come alive. Volunteers canvassed outside airports, hospitals, and bodegas at odd hours handing out tea, talking and logging contacts all in real time. In immigrant corridors such as Jackson Heights, Richmond Hill and Flushing, “pop-ups” replaced rallies in the form of micro-events filled with food, music, and one key message: We see you. Moreover, in a race obsessed with youth turnout, Mamdani quietly also focused on seniors. He joined tai chi classes in Lower Manhattan parks, opting for softer introductions over hard pitches. It was low-ego politics that transformed sceptics into supporters. “He didn’t talk to us,” one volunteer recalled. “He moved with us.” Politics is never really found on a dance floor, but Mamdani’s team leaned in . From salsa nights to queer venues based in Brooklyn, the campaign turned nightlife into voter registration drives with club promoters and DJs becoming unexpected messengers of policy, blending the beat to the sound of ballot reminders. Then came the diaspora multiplier; the secret superstructure of the campaign. His campaigning understood the power of kinship. South Asian, Caribbean, West African and Arab communities were mobilised through WhatsApp groups, diaspora radio, Gen Z’s and auntie-driven relational networks where “Aunties for Zohran” became both a meme but also a massive movement. But what appeared spontaneous was rigorously organised. Nearly 100,000 volunteers helped knock on over a million doors . Nightly debriefs, real-time mapping, and turf adjustments turned chaos into choreography. Mamdani’s core promises were tailored to free buses, rent relief and childcare, which were repeated in every language, every borough. Simple, unfiltered and accessible. He told Time : “If your politics can’t be explained at a bus stop, it’s not politics for the people.” The campaign’s short-form videos, meme-ready graphics, and participatory humour turned supporters into broadcasters. Every now and then, Mamdani let his personality slip through the political cadence — a lyric dropped mid-speech, a joke left hanging just long enough. At one event, he wove a line from PinkPantheress into a point about political honesty, delivering it so casually that half the crowd caught it a beat late before bursting into laughter. It didn’t feel like a gimmick; it felt like someone speaking in the cultural shorthand of the city he was trying to lead. Unlike other campaigns that treated social media as more of an afterthought, Mamdani’s team engineered virality as a primal form of mobilisation, using key platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube to feed real-world turnout. Even the campaign’s visual identity felt like a love letter to the city. Mamdani’s team didn’t just campaign at full throttle, they redlined the engine, moving at a pace that made the establishment look motionless. The team pulled from the design grammar of everyday New York: the hand-painted warmth of bodega signs, the punchy signage of Coney Island, flashes of taxi-yellow, and a bold purple reminiscent of vintage Brooklyn Dodgers iconography. It also felt like the campaigning signage was layered with a touch of Bollywood’s saturated colour sensibility. The palette felt joyful rather than corporate; deeply human rather than consultant-made. It was an aesthetic born from the streets he canvassed, a visual dialect telling New Yorkers, before a single speech was delivered, ‘I speak your language.’ The establishment’s miscalculation Andrew Cuomo entered the race assuming that name recognition, big donors, and a polished record would suffice. His campaign operated from Midtown boardrooms, not subway platforms; it was flush with billionaire donations yet starved of intimacy. Cuomo ran a race built for an electorate that no longer exists. It wasn’t that he lacked achievements ; in fact, his record was full of landmark reforms. As governor, he signed the NY SAFE Act , one of the nation’s strongest gun-control laws in the wake of Sandy Hook; expanded paid family leave; legalised same-sex marriage in New York ; and positioned himself as a leader on climate action. But in this campaign, he rarely invoked those victories. Instead of defending a record that once resonated with working New Yorkers, he leaned on legacy and attacked his opponent. The absence was telling as his policies may have been progressive on paper, but his campaign’s posture was unmistakably elite. While Mamdani was out walking subway platforms and sitting in taxi garages, Cuomo spoke from studios and fundraisers. The result was a contrast of scale and sincerity: one man meeting voters where they lived, and another trying to remind them who he used to be. Institutional Democrats mistook endorsement lists for enthusiasm. Their outreach centred on press hits, corporate lunches, union halls, and Manhattan fundraisers, while Mamdani’s people were canvassing, dancing, and listening in the places politics tends to forget. The result was a rare thing in New York: a grassroots landslide that elite money couldn’t stop. The view from the ground And if policy analysts could see the strategy, ordinary New Yorkers could feel its effects even more sharply. For Amal, 26, who lives in Manhattan, Mamdani’s win wasn’t just political, it was personal. “I’m Muslim and South Asian, and living in New York you can feel how much our community keeps this city running — cab drivers, Uber drivers, restaurant workers, small businesses. They’re the backbone of New York, but they’ve always been invisible in politics. This isn’t about being given a chance; it’s about finally being seen.” “Zohran’s campaign captured the real essence of New York. People forget this city’s true demographic, that it’s a land of immigrants. He went everywhere — from Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods to Queens — walking from Upper to Lower Manhattan and talking to people. He captured what New York really is: fast, chaotic, crazy, alive!” Amal recalled the exact moment she realised his campaign understood the city’s texture. “I realised his campaign was different the moment he got on a Citi Bike . If you’re a New Yorker, you know that’s the great equaliser, everyone rides one. It told me he understood New York’s culture at a granular level. He wasn’t throwing money at consultants or hiding behind buzzwords. He was out there, doing the everyday things we do.” She added that it was a small gesture, but it revealed a larger truth about Mamdani: he communicates fluently in the city’s everyday language, not as performance, but as instinct. “Right now, with everything happening globally, Islamophobia is rampant. I’m excited to see him challenge that, to break stereotypes around South Asians and Muslims in public life,” she remarked. For Ryan, 30, also based in Manhattan, the win was less about symbolism and more about substance — a campaign that finally spoke to the city’s working realities. “I knew it was going to happen. 70pc of Mamdani’s votes came from people under 30, the generation feeling the full brunt of how unaffordable New York has become. You’d need to make around $150,000 before tax to afford a $5,000 rental, and even then, rent takes up 60-70pc of your income. That’s how out of reach living in this city is.” Mamdani’s policies — from rent freezes to free childcare — didn’t just resonate ideologically; they answered the most basic urban question: how do we live here? “This was the first time we had a candidate who was educated, informed, and not part of some political dynasty. People are tired of lineage politics. They want accountability. Most people in New York don’t have a sob story; we’re educated, ambitious, doing well on paper, but still struggling to afford life here. Mamdani represents those of us who are doing everything right but still can’t make the math work,” he said. For Erica, a 30-year-old Brooklynite, Mamdani’s rise was less a surprise than a correction; the moment New York finally rewarded a campaign that felt genuinely built for its people. “He was everywhere. His campaign was chronically online and offline at the same time, and that meant he was reaching groups of New Yorkers who have never really felt seen by politicians before. You could feel how authentically he was out in the community, talking to people who agreed with him and people who didn’t. It felt very personal.” Affordability was the point where her personal life and Mamdani’s message met most sharply. “It’s almost impossible as a young person trying to imagine a future here, owning a home and raising a family. So to have a candidate say openly that what we’ve tried in the past hasn’t worked and it’s time for something new, felt refreshing.” Mamdani’s identity as a South Asian Muslim became a political talking point in itself, often weaponised by opponents who tried to frame his campaign as identity-driven rather than policy-driven. But Erica didn’t see performance; she saw focus. “It felt policy-grounded. He never strayed from his three main promises. He kept steering the conversation back to the three promises: free fast buses, a rent freeze and universal child care. Everyone knew exactly what he stood for,” she noted. A turnout surge and future of city politics More than two million New Yorkers voted, this being the city’s highest mayoral turnout this century. Mamdani secured 50.4pc of the votes , Cuomo trailed at 41.8pc, and Republican Curtis Sliwa fell below 7pc. In victory, Mamdani told supporters in Queens, “We built this with our hands, our phones, our feet. We proved that New York’s power doesn’t sit in the skyscrapers, it walks these streets.” Mamdani’s win is a case study in how campaigns will be run, not only in New York, but in any city where trust has eroded and communities crave presence over polish. He turned political participation into something social, visible, and joyful. The message to future candidates is simple: if you’re willing to do the hours, you can beat the machine. In a world tired of cynicism, Mamdani’s win offered something rare: proof that hope is not naïve but rather a strategy. And as he walked out to the pulsing intro of Dhoom Machale , the message was clear: it wasn’t just a win; it was an arrival. This was a moment only he could pull off, a choice that sent the Gen Z and millennials into full-body joy. It was pop-culture mischief and political messaging at once, a South Asian anthem turned victory strut. It told New Yorkers exactly who their new mayor is. Fall of the old guard While Mamdani’s campaign strategy was undoubtedly decisive, elections are rarely won on tactics alone. His rise was aided by a confluence of factors and demographic shifts, record youth turnout, and widespread disillusionment with establishment politics. Issues like housing affordability, public transport, and cost of living had reached a boiling point, creating fertile ground for his message. Cuomo’s overreliance on legacy power and donor networks only sharpened that contrast. Mamdani’s victory, then, wasn’t a fluke of charisma or digital virality, it was the political expression of a city that had outgrown the comfort of its old elite.",

      "summary_en": "Forget everything you knew about New York politics: Zohran Mamdani just flipped the script. Armed with working-class solidarity, digital fluency, and meme-literate storytelling, the 34-year-old Queens Assemblyman didn’t just beat Andrew Cuomo — he made history. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Mamdani emerged as the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, clinching just over 50 per cent of the vote in one of the most closely watched races in decades. The shock wasn’t just in the result. It was in how he won. It was an insurgent campaign powered by aunties, taxi drivers, club DJs and night-shift nurses — not your average billionaires and consultants. Mamdani turned relentless field work into a campaign that made New Yorkers feel seen and the diaspora feel represented; a moment that spilled across boroughs and ricocheted through diasporas from Queens to Karachi. And yet, this victory wasn’t about vibes or progressive ideology alone. It was a strategy rooted in something older and truer: proximity. Mamdani embedded himself in the city’s daily rhythms from dawn at taxi depots to dusk at tai chi sessions, and from Queens bodegas to Bronx dance floors meeting New Yorkers where they actually live. While the existing political establishment figures such as Andrew Cuomo relied on TV ads and fundraisers, Mamdani relied on multilingual messaging, human contact and most importantly, the moral weight of showing up. The architecture a movement Long before declaring his run for Mayor, Mamdani stood shoulder to shoulder with medallion-debt taxi drivers, sleeping on pavements during their 2021 hunger strike . That solidarity didn’t fade with time; in fact, it matured into a network of trust. When he finally ran, those same drivers became his storytellers and precinct captains, spreading his name through garages, mosques, diners, and WhatsApp groups. While traditional campaigns clocked off at sunset, Mamdani’s chose to come alive. Volunteers canvassed outside airports, hospitals, and bodegas at odd hours handing out tea, talking and logging contacts all in real time. In immigrant corridors such as Jackson Heights, Richmond Hill and Flushing, “pop-ups” replaced rallies in the form of micro-events filled with food, music, and one key message: We see you. Moreover, in a race obsessed with youth turnout, Mamdani quietly also focused on seniors. He joined tai chi classes in Lower Manhattan parks, opting for softer introductions over hard pitches. It was low-ego politics that transformed sceptics into supporters. “He didn’t talk to us,” one volunteer recalled. “He moved with us.” Politics is never really found on a dance floor, but Mamdani’s team leaned in . From salsa nights to queer venues based in Brooklyn, the campaign turned nightlife into voter registration drives with club promoters and DJs becoming unexpected messengers of policy, blending the beat to the sound of ballot reminders. Then came the diaspora multiplier; the secret superstructure of the campaign. His campaigning understood the power of kinship. South Asian, Caribbean, West African and Arab communities were mobilised through WhatsApp groups, diaspora radio, Gen Z’s and auntie-driven relational networks where “Aunties for Zohran” became both a meme but also a massive movement. But what appeared spontaneous was rigorously organised. Nearly 100,000 volunteers helped knock on over a million doors . Nightly debriefs, real-time mapping, and turf adjustments turned chaos into choreography. Mamdani’s core promises were tailored to free buses, rent relief and childcare, which were repeated in every language, every borough. Simple, unfiltered and accessible. He told Time : “If your politics can’t be explained at a bus stop, it’s not politics for the people.” The campaign’s short-form videos, meme-ready graphics, and participatory humour turned supporters into broadcasters. Every now and then, Mamdani let his personality slip through the political cadence — a lyric dropped mid-speech, a joke left hanging just long enough. At one event, he wove a line from PinkPantheress into a point about political honesty, delivering it so casually that half the crowd caught it a beat late before bursting into laughter. It didn’t feel like a gimmick; it felt like someone speaking in the cultural shorthand of the city he was trying to lead. Unlike other campaigns that treated social media as more of an afterthought, Mamdani’s team engineered virality as a primal form of mobilisation, using key platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube to feed real-world turnout. Even the campaign’s visual identity felt like a love letter to the city. Mamdani’s team didn’t just campaign at full throttle, they redlined the engine, moving at a pace that made the establishment look motionless. The team pulled from the design grammar of everyday New York: the hand-painted warmth of bodega signs, the punchy signage of Coney Island, flashes of taxi-yellow, and a bold purple reminiscent of vintage Brooklyn Dodgers iconography. It also felt like the campaigning signage was layered with a touch of Bollywood’s saturated colour sensibility. The palette felt joyful rather than corporate; deeply human rather than consultant-made. It was an aesthetic born from the streets he canvassed, a visual dialect telling New Yorkers, before a single speech was delivered, ‘I speak your language.’ The establishment’s miscalculation Andrew Cuomo entered the race assuming that name recognition, big donors, and a polished record would suffice.

      "title_orig": "Afghan-based terrorist groups’ access to illicit arms threatens regional peace, Pakistan warns at UNSC debate",
      "summary_orig": "Islamabad has warned that the acquisition of abandoned weapons by terrorist groups based in Afghanistan not only threatens peace and security in Pakistan but also in the region. Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations, made the remarks while addressing the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) open debate on small arms late on Monday, according to a press release by the mission. In his remarks, Ambassador Iftikhar said, “Pakistan is seriously concerned about the presence of stockpiles of sophisticated arms and ammunition in Afghanistan, as noted in the findings of the secretary general’s reports.” The report states that transnational criminal dynamics were observed in Afghanistan, where possible arms and ammunition transfer to neighbouring states in breach of the arms embargo and unofficial markets for weapons have emerged, further escalating the threat to regional security. The envoy said Pakistan had “credible information of attempts to smuggle these arms to neighboring countries for terrorist activities”. “Weapons confiscated at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border are traced back to stockpiles of weapons left behind by foreign forces in Afghanistan and illegal weapons being sold across black markets in Afghanistan,” Ambassador Iftikhar said. “The movement of unmarked or unregistered weapons across the international border sustain and aid non-state armed groups, terrorist networks, and criminal gangs, undermining regional security and stability,” he said. He further said that Pakistan was “deeply concerned” at the acquisition and use of these “mostly abandoned, modern and potent weapons by terrorist groups based in Afghanistan, which continue to pose serious challenge to peace and security in Pakistan and the broader region”. He said that terrorist entities, such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K), the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Majeed Brigade, had used these weapons against Pakistani civilians and law enforcement agencies, leading to the loss of thousands of lives. “We urge stronger international efforts to prevent access of illicit arms to armed terrorist groups in Afghanistan and to ensure that the Afghan interim authorities adhere to their international obligations and commitments in that regard,” he said. “The international community needs to step up its efforts and plug gaps in its response to effectively address these threats to international and regional peace and security,” he added. In his remarks, the envoy also noted that small arms and light weapons had emerged as “instruments of choice for non-state actors to perpetrate violence”, adding that illicit arms directly threatened national security and impeded counter-terrorism operations, and civilian protection. He further said that illicit weapons impeded development prospects, contributed to human rights abuses and imperiled peace, security and stability. “We firmly believe that the issue of illicit small arms and light weapons should be addressed comprehensively and in a balanced manner,” Ambassador Iftikhar said. “The United Nations’ ‘Programme of Action on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects’ strikes a balance between the legitimate security requirements of states and the imperative to address the issue of illicit arms on both the supply and demand sides. We remain committed to its implementation at the national level and call for its full execution at the global level to safeguard and promote international and regional peace and security,” he said. As the US troops departed Afghanistan in August 2021, they destroyed more than 70 aircraft, dozens of armoured vehicles and disabled air defences before flying out of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport following a chaotic evacuation operation. However, a large stock of weapons and equipment was still left behind that was coopted by the Afghan Taliban. The arms also fell into the hands of the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan group and other terrorist outfits, as pointed out by Pakistan and others. Islamabad has repeatedly raised concerns over the use of Afghan soil by militants for cross-border terror­­ism and called on the United Nations for a “concerted campaign” to recover all weapons from terrorist groups such as the TTP. In January, the Foreign Office said the presence of advanced US weapons in Afghanistan following the August 2021 withdrawal had become a “profound concern” for Pakistan’s safety and security. The Washington Post also reported in April that terrorists who attacked the Jaffar Express train in Balochistan in March used weapons left behind when United States forces withdrew from Afghanistan. According to The Post , an M4A1 carbine rifle built by American manufacturer Colt was recovered from the site of the attack. The rifle’s serial number indicated that it was part of billions of dollars worth of weaponry sent to US forces in Afghanistan.",

      "summary_orig": "• Indigenous leaders demand protection for their territories • Scientists highlight rapid destabilisation of the planet’s frozen regions • It’s unclear whether states would aim to negotiate a single, final agreement for end of the event BELEM: The COP30 climate summit opened Monday in this Amazon city with the UN climate chief urging countries to cooperate with one another in the fight against a warming planet rather than battling over competing priorities. Host country Brazil brokered an agreement on the agenda for the two-week summit, fending off attempts from developing-country negotiating blocs to shoehorn contentious issues like climate finance and carbon taxes into the formal talks. The opening day was marked by calls for unity, stark warnings from scientists and Indige­nous groups, and a notable abse­nce by the US federal government that drew sharp criticism from one of its own governors. “In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another — your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,” UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates from more than 190 countries attending the conference. Stiell acknowledged that three decades of UN climate talks had helped to bend the curve in projected warming downward, “because of what was agreed in halls like this, with governments legislating, and markets responding.” It remained unclear whether countries would aim to negotiate a single, final agreement for the end of the event — a hard sell in a year of fractious global politics and US efforts to obstruct a transition away from fossil fuels. Some officials have suggested that countries focus on smaller efforts that do not need universal consensus, after years of COP summits making lofty promises only to leave many unfulfilled. Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned against interests trying to obscure the dangers of climate change in his opening remarks. “They attack the institutions, the science, the universities,” he said. “It’s time to imp­ose another defeat to denialists.” The world’s biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the United States, opted to skip the summit at the federal level, while US President Donald Trump asserts that climate change is a hoax. However, a state-level US presence was expected, with California Gov Gavin Newsom and New Mexico Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham scheduled to arrive in Belem on Tuesday. Addressing a global investors summit, Newsom questioned the federal government’s disengagement. “What the hell is going on here?” Newsom said about the US government’s absence from the talks. “We’re in Brazil, one of our great trading partners, one of the world’s great democracies. I mean hell, home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with instead of giving the middle finger with 50 percent tariffs,” Newsom said. European nations planned to use the summit to press for firm commitments. Germany said it would join other European countries to push for commitments to rein in fossil fuel use, a goal also promoted by Lula. Warning signs Delegates were joined by Indigenous leaders, who arri­v­ed on Sunday by boat after travelling some 3,000 kilometres (1,864 miles) from the Andes. They are demanding more say in how their territories are managed as climate change escalates and industries such as mining, logging and oil drilling push deeper into forests. “We want to make sure that they don’t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,” said Pablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru.—Reuters Published in Dawn, November 11th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• CJCSC urged troop mobilisation • COAS cautioned against hasty escalation ISLAMABAD: The Natio­nal Secur­ity Committee (NSC) did not overrule the then army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa’s response plan during the 2019 Balakot crisis , according to at least two participants of that meeting who spoke on Monday. “The then army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s response strategy was agreed upon and executed by the Pakistan Air Force,” said a federal minister who attended the meeting, adding that the then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, Gen Zubair Hayat, had proposed a more radical option that was not accepted. An armed forces official who also participated in the meeting gave a similar account, saying that then prime minister Imran Khan was “displeased” with Gen Hayat’s suggestion, which he thought “did not make any sense.” The statements counter a recent claim by former defence secretary Lt Gen (Retd) Asif Yasin Malik, who said that during the 2019 NSC meeting held after the Balakot strikes, Gen Bajwa had advised restraint but was overruled by the air chief and the CJCSC. The 2019 escalation followed a Feb 14 suicide bombing in Pulw­ama, India-occupied Kashmir, which killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel. India responded with airstrikes on Balakot on Feb 26, the first time since the 1971 war that Indian aircraft had crossed deep into Pakistani territory. According to the two participants, who spoke separately to Dawn , the sequence of events began in the early hours of Feb 26, 2019, when then chief of general staff (CGS) Gen Nadeem Raza called Gen Bajwa at about 2:30am to report an Indian airstrike near Balakot. Gen Bajwa asked for an assessment of the damage, and the CGS later informed him that no significant damage had occurred. A seminary built during the Afghan war, used for religious education of local children, had been the intended target. However, the missile missed its mark and landed some distance away, causing no casualties or structural damage. Soon afterwards, the then air chief marshal Mujahid Anwar contacted Gen Bajwa to discuss the situation. Gen Bajwa suggested that since no damage had been caused, the matter could be addressed during a meeting with the prime minister later that morning. Before attending the NSC meeting, Gen Bajwa convened his core team at General Headquarters (GHQ), where the director general of military operations (DGMO) suggested that Pakistan must respond, but in a measured way, to avoid escalation. The DGMO proposed that, unlike India’s night raid on a single site, Pakistan should strike multiple targets in broad daylight to send a clear message and restore deterrence. The response operation, later known as Operation Swift Retort , was conceived during these consultations. Gen Bajwa then took the plan to the National Security Committee meeting at the Prime Minister’s House. During the session, Gen Zubair Hayat spoke for about 40 minutes, emphasising that he was the prime minister’s principal adviser in times of war. When Gen Bajwa asked for his concrete suggestion, Gen Hayat proposed full mobilisation of troops and a declaration of war against India. According to participants, Gen Bajwa cautioned against hasty escalation. He then presented the operational plan prepared at GHQ, which was approved by the NSC. The detailed strategy was subsequently discussed with the PAF chief, who executed the air operation, they recalled. On Feb 27, Pakistani aircraft struck six targets in India-occupied Kashmir, hitting “open spaces” to demonstrate their capability to hit Indian targets without escalating the tensions further.

      "summary_orig": "The contentious bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment sailed through the Senate on Monday after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The government and its coalition partners secured a two-thirds majority in the vote following the defection of two opposition members, leading to a total of 64 votes for the bill. The bill, which had stirred controversy in the country for weeks, was presented in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the proceedings. Initially, a clause-by-clause voting was carried out. Later, voting by division was conducted, with the entry and exit gates of the Senate closed as per the protocol. View this post on Instagram Before the passage of the bill, opposition benches erupted in protest, chanting slogans against the government and its coalition partners. Lawmakers tore up copies of the bill and hurled them toward Tarar’s table as he began to present it. Most opposition members then staged a walkout, while a few stayed briefly to continue sloganeering before exiting the chamber — paving the way for the smooth passage of the bill. A joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s (NA) law and justice standing committees — boycotted by the opposition — approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill with minor changes. Senate Standing Committee of Law and Justice Chairman Farooq H. Naek presented a report on those before the Upper House. Following its approval by the Senate, the bill will also have to be voted on in the NA. The session had begun today but it was adjourned. The NA will now reconvene at 11am tomorrow (Tuesday). In the 336-member NA, the ruling coalition does enjoy a two-thirds majority. It has 233 members while the opposition holds 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, PPP 74, MQM-P 22, PML-Q five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and PML-Z, Balochistan Awami Party, and National Peoples Party one seat each. PTI senator resigns after voting in favour Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI resigned shortly after voting in favour of the bill. Speaking on the floor of the upper house, the lawmaker said he “voted only for Syed Gen Asim Munir”. He added that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by winning the war with India. “During the 26th Amendment, 10 family members of mine were abducted, but my party (PTI) did not come to the rescue.” When he tendered his resignation, the Senate chairman said, “We will make you a senator again”. Senators Saifullah Abro and Naseema Ehsan are seated in the Senate. — YouTube/PTV Parliament The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl also expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. ‘Historic bill’ Shortly after the passage of the bill, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar took to the floor of the house and termed the amendment a “historic bill”, saying that it was an “unfinished agenda” of the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by almost all political parties. “There was a feeling to maintain balance, and thus a constitutional court is being formed for the betterment of the judiciary,” he said. Dar added that the rank of field marshal was now included in the Constitution, adding that space was created for the rank of a five-star general in all three military forces. “The seniority of the current SC judges and the chief justice would not be impacted by the amendment,” he clarified. Govt presents parliamentary committee’s report Earlier in the day, Naek tabled a report in the Senate detailing some changes made in the draft bill by the parliamentary committee. Chairman Gilani asked for the opposition members to be called to the house as well, so they could be present during the briefing. Naek told the house that the joint committee deliberated on the bill for two days and made “many changes”. Sharing further details, he said the bill proposed the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which the committee “unanimously” approved with some changes to the relevant clause. Outlining those changes, he said there would be equal representation of all provinces in the FCC, and it would also include a representative from the Islamabad High Court. Moving on to the second change, he said the initial draft of the bill stated that a judge could be nominated for the FCC after serving on the high court for seven years. The committee reduced this qualification merit for the FCC from seven to five years, he added. Naek further said that the committee also agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. However, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. Moreover, he continued, if multiple judges would take the oath on the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age. He added that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was reconstituted under the 26th Constitutional Amendment, with the speaker being authorised to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate to become a member. The committee changed this to include a technocrat, Naek said. “So now, the speaker can nominate a woman, non-Muslim or technocrat who qualifies to be a member of Parliament for the JCP.” He highlighted that currently, the SC had suo motu powers and could invoke Article 183 of the Constitution to take up a case at its discretion. As for the FCC, “we have retained the suo motu powers […] but we would exercise these powers when an application is submitted. The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed”. On the transfer of judges, the PPP senator said that previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, judges could be transferred by the president, but the consent of the said judge was required, and two chief justices of the relevant high courts were consulted. “The amended bill has changed the method of transfers, as now, a judge will be transferred from one high court to another through the JCP, which was reconstituted under the 26th Amendment and has the representation of all — the executive, parliament, judges, civil society, and lawyers,” Naek said. Naek said that under Article 199 of the Constitution, an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided. This created a huge backlog, he remarked, adding that the interim order would now be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made until then. Senate debate The Senate session began shortly after 11am with Senator Manzoor Kakar presiding over the proceedings in the absence of Chairman Gilani. At the outset, he said some speeches regarding the constitutional amendment could not be delivered yesterday, and proceedings today would begin with those addresses. He then gave the floor to PML-N’s Agha Shahzaib Durrani, whose speech was repeatedly interrupted by the opposition benches. During his speech, Durrani mentioned that the opposition had questioned that what was the need for a constitutional court. He justified this need, citing the backlog of cases in the Supreme Court. Durrani also berated the opposition, particularly the PTI, for “abolishing the democracy” and “turning the President’s House into an ordinance factory” during its tenure. His speech was followed by that of PPP’s Zamir Hussain Ghumro, who rejected the opposition’s criticism that the 27th Amendment was a “9/11 on Pakistan“ . He defended the planned establishment of the constitutional court, alleging that the SC had not been performing its “original function, but enforcing fundamental rights, which is a function of the high courts”. “The Supreme Court has been interfering in [matters of] Parliament and the executive,” he claimed, further justifying the need for the constitutional court. “It will not only strengthen the independence of the judiciary but also the federation,” he argued. Regarding the proposed changes to Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he recalled the recent conflict with India in May . “The chief of army staff, the Field Marshal won a war for Pakistan,” he said, adding that he deserved immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests. “What is the problem with this? Do you want to drag your heroes through the streets and courts?” he questioned. He added that the PPP believed the 27th Amendment would be a “milestone in advancing democracy, the Constitution, and the 18th Amendment”. After Ghumro concluded his speech, PTI’s Fawzia Arshad pointed out that an opposition leader had still not been notified in the Senate. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Shibli Faraz in August. Arshad said the pendency of the notification was a denial of legislative rights to the PTI. She also assailed the proposed 27th Amendment and its proponents, saying that “institutions are being trampled and their rights are being taken away”. For his part, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Amir Waliuddin Chishti said his party was promised changes to Articles 142 (advocate general for a province) and 140-A (local government) under the 27th Amendment. “Now, after two days, I am hearing that while the amendments came under discussion, it is being said that they may be included in the 28th Amendment,” he added. PML-N Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu also referred to the May conflict, saying, “The entire nation won the war. The media and opposition also won. Everyone did. But under whose leadership? General Syed Asim Munir sahib .” Senator Sindhu quipped that it was not as if some land was being named for the army chief, but only an honorary title was being bestowed on him. He claimed that all Commonwealth nations had officers who remained in uniform for life. He also highlighted Field Marshal Munir’s role in “trade and foreign affairs as he accompanied the prime minister” on multiple visits. The PML-N leader dismissed the concerns regarding the 27th Amendment as “frivolous and concocted”, asserting there was nothing contradictory to the Constitution in it. Later, Kakar paused the proceedings and said the house would meet again at 3.30pm. Speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, a key minister said the government planned to get the bill passed today, “no matter what.” Will ensure amendment does not pass: PTI Separately, PTI Senator Ali Zafar said while speaking to the media in Parliament that the opposition would ensure the amendment was not passed if the government did not have the requisite numbers. “It is possible they may not be able to table it today,” he said while speaking to the media. He further said that the opposition was against giving immunity from criminal proceedings to anyone. “We are saying that if anyone has committed a crime, be it a president or a governor, they should be punished according to the law and the Constitution,” he said. However, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar defended the inclusion of a clause for providing lifetime immunity to the president from criminal proceedings and arrests under the proposed amendment. “The heads of state enjoy immunity across the world. This is a choice, and this system prevails in the whole world […] I think there is no harm in this,” he said while speaking to the media. He also welcomed the premier’s decision not to pursue the clause for immunity. The minister further said the amendment was for “good governance”, improving the federation’s relationship with the provinces, and for strengthening defence“. He said, constitutional courts also existed in other parts of the world, adding that this was also included in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006. Tarar said the demand for constitutional courts was jointly made by the PML-N, PPP and the Awami National Party, and that the Constitution was a living document which continued to evolve. He asserted that the government had the requisite votes, terming the amendment “positive” and in line with international practices. MQM-P backs Article 243, reiterates call for LG powers In his address, Senator Faisal Subzwari, parliamentary leader for the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), said: “When you concede your space, those succeeding you get even less space.” As he looked towards the opposition benches, Subzwari expressed the wish that politicians were as concerned about merits and justice when they were in power themselves. He stressed that all highs had a downfall, adding that the remark was meant for everyone. Speaking on changes in Article 243, he said, “We wish that after the passage of this amendment […] the honour of the Pakistan Army, the defence of Pakistan and the state of Pakistan rises, especially during a time when India — much more powerful than us and with a more armed military — is present on our eastern front.” The MQM-P leader also mentioned the “dispute” on the western front with Afghanistan, and added that on such occasions, there was a need to “encourage and support the armed forces in every possible manner”. He criticised PTI’s Omar Ayub for making remarks in the National Assembly that doubted the military’s preparedness and arms supplies. On the “much-debated” changes being brought in the judiciary, Subzwari said the formation of the FCC should “bear fruit” and not remain limited to high courts. “What steps have been taken by the constitutional courts that will be formed or have been formed that will impact the ordinary petitioner?” We need to answer this,“ he said. Subzwari recalled the MQM-P’s demand for local bodies’ autonomy made in an amendment submitted in the NA last year. He noted that the matter was still with the relevant standing committee and said the MQM-P will approach other parties, including the PTI and the PPP, for it. He refuted the impression that empowering local governments (LGs) amounted to rolling back the 18th Amendment that provided provincial autonomy. The lawmaker stressed that giving LGs powers in the same way as provinces was to ensure that the citizens there received the resources distributed to them. “This is a case for Jacobabad and Kashmore, and of Sajidabad and Rahim Yar Khan, which are away from their provincial capitals,” he said. Subzwari acknowledged that the proposals made earlier on the National Finance Commission (NFC) shares — which were not included in the current amendment bill following the PPP’s opposition — needed a debate. He suggested that a certain share be allocated for provincial finance commissions in the NFC.",

Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, PPP 74, MQM-P 22, PML-Q five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and PML-Z, Balochistan Awami Party, and National Peoples Party one seat each. PTI senator resigns after voting in favour Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI resigned shortly after voting in favour of the bill. Speaking on the floor of the upper house, the lawmaker said he “voted only for Syed Gen Asim Munir”. He added that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by winning the war with India. “During the 26th Amendment, 10 family members of mine were abducted, but my party (PTI) did not come to the rescue.” When he tendered his resignation, the Senate chairman said, “We will make you a senator again”. Senators Saifullah Abro and Naseema Ehsan are seated in the Senate. — YouTube/PTV Parliament The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl also expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. ‘Historic bill’ Shortly after the passage of the bill, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar took to the floor of the house and termed the amendment a “historic bill”, saying that it was an “unfinished agenda” of the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by almost all political parties. “There was a feeling to maintain balance, and thus a constitutional court is being formed for the betterment of the judiciary,” he said. Dar added that the rank of field marshal was now included in the Constitution, adding that space was created for the rank of a five-star general in all three military forces. “The seniority of the current SC judges and the chief justice would not be impacted by the amendment,” he clarified. Govt presents parliamentary committee’s report Earlier in the day, Naek tabled a report in the Senate detailing some changes made in the draft bill by the parliamentary committee. Chairman Gilani asked for the opposition members to be called to the house as well, so they could be present during the briefing. Naek told the house that the joint committee deliberated on the bill for two days and made “many changes”. Sharing further details, he said the bill proposed the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which the committee “unanimously” approved with some changes to the relevant clause. Outlining those changes, he said there would be equal representation of all provinces in the FCC, and it would also include a representative from the Islamabad High Court. Moving on to the second change, he said the initial draft of the bill stated that a judge could be nominated for the FCC after serving on the high court for seven years. The committee reduced this qualification merit for the FCC from seven to five years, he added. Naek further said that the committee also agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. However, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. Moreover, he continued, if multiple judges would take the oath on the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age. He added that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was reconstituted under the 26th Constitutional Amendment, with the speaker being authorised to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate to become a member. The committee changed this to include a technocrat, Naek said. “So now, the speaker can nominate a woman, non-Muslim or technocrat who qualifies to be a member of Parliament for the JCP.” He highlighted that currently, the SC had suo motu powers and could invoke Article 183 of the Constitution to take up a case at its discretion. As for the FCC, “we have retained the suo motu powers […] but we would exercise these powers when an application is submitted. The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed”. On the transfer of judges, the PPP senator said that previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, judges could be transferred by the president, but the consent of the said judge was required, and two chief justices of the relevant high courts were consulted. “The amended bill has changed the method of transfers, as now, a judge will be transferred from one high court to another through the JCP, which was reconstituted under the 26th Amendment and has the representation of all — the executive, parliament, judges, civil society, and lawyers,” Naek said. Naek said that under Article 199 of the Constitution, an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided. This created a huge backlog, he remarked, adding that the interim order would now be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made until then. Senate debate The Senate session began shortly after 11am with Senator Manzoor Kakar presiding over the proceedings in the absence of Chairman Gilani. At the outset, he said some speeches regarding the constitutional amendment could not be delivered yesterday, and proceedings today would begin with those addresses. He then gave the floor to PML-N’s Agha Shahzaib Durrani, whose speech was repeatedly interrupted by the opposition benches. During his speech, Durrani mentioned that the opposition had questioned that what was the need for a constitutional court. He justified this need, citing the backlog of cases in the Supreme Court. Durrani also berated the opposition, particularly the PTI, for “abolishing the democracy” and “turning the President’s House into an ordinance factory” during its tenure. His speech was followed by that of PPP’s Zamir Hussain Ghumro, who rejected the opposition’s criticism that the 27th Amendment was a “9/11 on Pakistan“ . He defended the planned establishment of the constitutional court, alleging that the SC had not been performing its “original function, but enforcing fundamental rights, which is a function of the high courts”. “The Supreme Court has been interfering in [matters of] Parliament and the executive,” he claimed, further justifying the need for the constitutional court. “It will not only strengthen the independence of the judiciary but also the federation,” he argued. Regarding the proposed changes to Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he recalled the recent conflict with India in May . “The chief of army staff, the Field Marshal won a war for Pakistan,” he said, adding that he deserved immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests. “What is the problem with this? Do you want to drag your heroes through the streets and courts?” he questioned. He added that the PPP believed the 27th Amendment would be a “milestone in advancing democracy, the Constitution, and the 18th Amendment”. After Ghumro concluded his speech, PTI’s Fawzia Arshad pointed out that an opposition leader had still not been notified in the Senate. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Shibli Faraz in August. Arshad said the pendency of the notification was a denial of legislative rights to the PTI. She also assailed the proposed 27th Amendment and its proponents, saying that “institutions are being trampled and their rights are being taken away”. For his part, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Amir Waliuddin Chishti said his party was promised changes to Articles 142 (advocate general for a province) and 140-A (local government) under the 27th Amendment. “Now, after two days, I am hearing that while the amendments came under discussion, it is being said that they may be included in the 28th Amendment,” he added. PML-N Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu also referred to the May conflict, saying, “The entire nation won the war. The media and opposition also won. Everyone did. But under whose leadership? General Syed Asim Munir sahib .” Senator Sindhu quipped that it was not as if some land was being named for the army chief, but only an honorary title was being bestowed on him. He claimed that all Commonwealth nations had officers who remained in uniform for life. He also highlighted Field Marshal Munir’s role in “trade and foreign affairs as he accompanied the prime minister” on multiple visits. The PML-N leader dismissed the concerns regarding the 27th Amendment as “frivolous and concocted”, asserting there was nothing contradictory to the Constitution in it. Later, Kakar paused the proceedings and said the house would meet again at 3.30pm. Speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, a key minister said the government planned to get the bill passed today, “no matter what.” Will ensure amendment does not pass: PTI Separately, PTI Senator Ali Zafar said while speaking to the media in Parliament that the opposition would ensure the amendment was not passed if the government did not have the requisite numbers. “It is possible they may not be able to table it today,” he said while speaking to the media. He further said that the opposition was against giving immunity from criminal proceedings to anyone. “We are saying that if anyone has committed a crime, be it a president or a governor, they should be punished according to the law and the Constitution,” he said. However, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar defended the inclusion of a clause for providing lifetime immunity to the president from criminal proceedings and arrests under the proposed amendment. “The heads of state enjoy immunity across the world. This is a choice, and this system prevails in the whole world […] I think there is no harm in this,” he said while speaking to the media. He also welcomed the premier’s decision not to pursue the clause for immunity. The minister further said the amendment was for “good governance”, improving the federation’s relationship with the provinces, and for strengthening defence“. He said, constitutional courts also existed in other parts of the world, adding that this was also included in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006. Tarar said the demand for constitutional courts was jointly made by the PML-N, PPP and the Awami National Party, and that the Constitution was a living document which continued to evolve. He asserted that the government had the requisite votes, terming the amendment “positive” and in line with international practices. MQM-P backs Article 243, reiterates call for LG powers In his address, Senator Faisal Subzwari, parliamentary leader for the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), said: “When you concede your space, those succeeding you get even less space.” As he looked towards the opposition benches, Subzwari expressed the wish that politicians were as concerned about merits and justice when they were in power themselves. He stressed that all highs had a downfall, adding that the remark was meant for everyone. Speaking on changes in Article 243, he said, “We wish that after the passage of this amendment […] the honour of the Pakistan Army, the defence of Pakistan and the state of Pakistan rises, especially during a time when India — much more powerful than us and with a more armed military — is present on our eastern front.” The MQM-P leader also mentioned the “dispute” on the western front with Afghanistan, and added that on such occasions, there was a need to “encourage and support the armed forces in every possible manner”. He criticised PTI’s Omar Ayub for making remarks in the National Assembly that doubted the military’s preparedness and arms supplies. On the “much-debated” changes being brought in the judiciary, Subzwari said the formation of the FCC should “bear fruit” and not remain limited to high courts. “What steps have been taken by the constitutional courts that will be formed or have been formed that will impact the ordinary petitioner?” We need to answer this,“ he said. Subzwari recalled the MQM-P’s demand for local bodies’ autonomy made in an amendment submitted in the NA last year. He noted that the matter was still with the relevant standing committee and said the MQM-P will approach other parties, including the PTI and the PPP, for it. He refuted the impression that empowering local governments (LGs) amounted to rolling back the 18th Amendment that provided provincial autonomy. The lawmaker stressed that giving LGs powers in the same way as provinces was to ensure that the citizens there received the resources distributed to them. “This is a case for Jacobabad and Kashmore, and of Sajidabad and Rahim Yar Khan, which are away from their provincial capitals,” he said. Subzwari acknowledged that the proposals made earlier on the National Finance Commission (NFC) shares — which were not included in the current amendment bill following the PPP’s opposition — needed a debate. He suggested that a certain share be allocated for provincial finance commissions in the NFC.",
