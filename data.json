      "summary_orig": "Senior presidential, government and ruling Democratic Party of Korea officials will meet Sunday to discuss policy coordination in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down U.S. President Donald Trump's global \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The meeting, led by Kim Yong-beom, presidential chief of staff for policy, and National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac, will take place after the top court ruled against the sweeping emergency tariffs Friday, which has prompted Trump to announce a new global tariff. Other senior officials scheduled to attend the meeting include Finance Minister Koo Yoon-cheol, Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan, Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo and DPK floor leader Han Byung-do. The officials are expected to discuss response measures to the Trump administration's follow-up steps to the court ruling as well as the status of Korean investment projects in the United States. Hours after Friday's ruling, Trump signed a proclamation to impose a temporary 10 percent global tariff under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which the White House said would take effect at 12:01 a.m",

      "summary_orig": "The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu said on Sunday it had thwarted a militant attack, adding that a detained commander of a banned outfit was killed in an exchange of fire, according to a press release. The investigation team was transporting a “recently arrested, highly wanted terrorist commander, Osama alias Baghi”, to identify the site of the attack on Assistant Commissioner Miranshah Shah Wali Khan , when his accomplices opened indiscriminate fire on the convoy, attempting to release him, the release said. “A fierce exchange of fire followed, during which Osama was killed by gunfire from his own associates,” it added. The CTD team’s armoured personnel carrier (APC) was also hit, but no personnel were injured. The gun battle reportedly lasted around 40 minutes, it added. It stated that the assault was aimed at freeing the detained commander during a crime-scene visit. “In the retaliatory action by CTD’s Special Weapons and Tactical (SWAT) team, another terrorist was also killed. He was identified as Kamyab Khan alias Ikhlas Yar, a resident of North Waziristan.” It added that the killed terrorist was wanted in multiple cases involving attacks on police and security forces. “Weapons and explosives, including a Kalashnikov rifle with two magazines, two hand grenades, a card of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a CNIC and a mobile phone, were recovered from the slain militant.” The release continued: “Bloodstains were found at several locations, indicating that the fleeing terrorists took their injured accomplices with them. Search and strike operations are underway to arrest the remaining suspects.” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Zulfiqar Hamid and the additional IGP CTD praised the professionalism of the officers involved and reiterated that indiscriminate action against terrorist elements would continue, particularly in the southern districts, to ensure lasting peace and order in the province, the release said. On February 12, CTD announced the arrest of Osama alias Baghi from Bannu’s Pipal Bazaar area. It said that he was an active commander of the newly formed organisation Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), established through a collaboration between the banned TTP and Gul Bahadur group. During the interrogation, he confessed to his involvement in nine major terrorist activities, including the killing of AC Miranshah Shah Wali Khan and three others.",

      "title_orig": "Armed forces strike 7 terrorist camps along Pakistan-Afghanistan border in response to recent suicide bombings",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has struck seven “terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban of [Fitna al Khwarij] and its affiliates and [the Islamic State-Khorasan Province] at the border region of Pakistan Afghan border,” the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting announced in a post early Sunday on social media platform X. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The action was taken, “in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, including Imam Bargah at Islamabad , one each in Bajaur and Bannu, followed by another incident today in Bannu during the holy month of Ramazan,” the information ministry’s statement said. “Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij on behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers. Responsibilities for these attacks were also claimed by Afghanistan-based Pakistani Taliban belonging to Fitna al Khwarij (FAK) and their affiliates, and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP),” the statement said. The statement asserted that “Pakistan has always strived for maintaining peace and stability in the region, but at the same time, the safety and security of our citizens remains our top priority”, adding that the action against the seven camps and hideouts was “a retributive response”, carried out based on “intelligence-based selective targeting”. “Despite repeated efforts by Pakistan to urge the Afghan Taliban Regime to take verifiable measures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted. “Pakistan expects and reiterates [that the] Interim Afghan Government […] fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost. Pakistan also expects the international community to play a positive and constructive role by urging the Taliban regime to stand by its commitments as part of [the] Doha Agreement to deny use of its soil against other countries; an act vital for regional and global peace and security,” the statement added. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, in a post on X, stated that the strikes by the “Pakistan Air Force were retribution for the innocent lives lost to terrorism”. He maintained that the strikes were an “answer to the tears of every mother who has sacrificed her son for the homeland”. Chaudhry issued a stern warning, stating that while “Pakistan desired peace, it would not make compromises on its safety, land, and people”. “Whoever looks at us with evil intent, we will destroy them, and no one will be spared,” the minister said. Souring relations There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire. Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast. Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault. Then, on Saturday, Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district. In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”. “Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij , irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted. On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable. Not the first time In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR. The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.",

On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable. Not the first time In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR. The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.",

      "title_orig": "Andrew’s arrest hands King Charles fresh royal crisis",
      "summary_orig": "King Charles III has been left wrestling with a new test after the arrest of his brother Andrew, the latest in a series of painful personal shocks to mar his reign. “Charles has, since coming to the throne in September 2022, been battered by a succession of difficulties and crises, whether it’s in relation to his second son, Harry … his health, the health of Catherine, or the very disruptive figure of Andrew,” royal commentator Ed Owens told AFP . After decades waiting in the wings, Charles became king in September 2022 on the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who had reigned for 70 years and commanded deep public affection and respect. His coronation on May 6, 2023 was rich in pageantry, projecting continuity and tradition. Yet trouble stirred even before the crown was placed on his head. In January 2023, his youngest son Harry released his explosive memoir Spare , launching repeated attacks on the royal family and airing private disputes lapped up by a global audience. Living in California with his wife Meghan since 2020 and estranged from his family, Harry has been accused by critics of damaging, for personal and commercial gain, an institution long seen as unshakeable. Though Harry has since sought reconciliation, the rift remains. Then, in February 2024, Charles, now 77, revealed he was undergoing treatment for cancer, without disclosing the type, forcing him to scale back public duties . Weeks later came another blow: Catherine, Princess of Wales and wife of heir apparent William, announced she too was being treated for cancer. While Catherine has since said she is in remission and Charles indicated in December that his treatment was being eased, illness has cast a long shadow over the royal household. The king has won admiration for his dignified, touching fight against cancer, talking about his shock at learning his diagnosis, and making a point of publicly visiting patients, urging prevention and early detection. But arguably the gravest threat to his reign has come from his younger brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, who remains eighth in line to the throne. Royal historian Andrew Lownie told AFP that it was “a crunch point” for the monarchy. If it is found that “they have been abetting him, enabling him, protecting him, then I think Charles will have to stand aside”, he said. The long-standing ties between the deeply unpopular Mountbatten-Windor to late convicted American sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have caused years of embarrassment. A photograph published in 2011 showing the former prince with his arm around the waist of Virginia Giuffre, Epstein’s main accuser, proved especially damaging. ‘Monarchy unstable’ Scrutiny has intensified in recent months. In October, Charles sought to draw a line under the affair by stripping his brother of all his titles. But new documents released by the US Department of Justice last month reignited public outrage. On Thursday, Andrew was arrested and held for hours in police custody, suspected of having passed confidential information to Epstein during his 2001-2011 role as a UK trade envoy. It was the first time a senior British royal has been arrested in modern history. In a rare personally signed statement, Charles vowed on Thursday the “law must take its course” and expressed his “deepest concern”. Some commentators have likened the moment to other crises that have shaken the monarchy, such as the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII and the 1997 death of Princess Diana, Charles’s ex-wife. In both cases, it took more than a decade to restore stability and public confidence, Owens said. For Pauline Maclaran, an academic and royal family expert, Charles is in part a victim of timing. “The monarchy seems quite unstable now and that was always going to happen after the queen passed away because she had been there for so long and had given this great sense of continuity,” she said. The late queen “certainly protected Andrew”, Maclaran added. Owens was more direct. “Andrew was an unexploded bomb that the queen passed on to Charles,” he said. “This episode, I think, could potentially be hugely damaging to the institution,” he added. “Already, I think its moral authority has suffered. That includes the moral authority of the king.” Restoring that authority will require visible change, Maclaran argued. “William has indicated that he will change things, but they’ve got to really emphasise that more now,” she said.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Central Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dr Imran Khan on Sunday ordered the suspension of five cops for their alleged involvement in the custodial torture of a man at the city’s Sharifabad police station. According to a statement issued by the Sindh Police’s Central District branch, SSP Imran took serious notice of the alleged incident and issued directives for the five cops to be suspended. The statement noted that an initial inquiry was conducted by the Liaquatabad sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) on the orders of the Central SSP. According to the probe, four personnel of Sindh Police’s Shaheen Force and a sentry of the Sharifabad police station were found to be involved in the torture. “All five personnel were immediately suspended and the [case] was closed, while further departmental inquiry is under way,” the Central District police statement read. “Further departmental action will be taken after the inquiry has been completed,” it added. SSP Imran warned, “Unlawful and unethical behaviour towards citizens would not be tolerated, and indiscriminate action will be taken against police officers and personnel violating the law.” On Wednesday, a large number of people gathered outside the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday to protest the killing of a man during an alleged encounter by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD). The protest and a petition before the Sindh High Court (SHC) came after the CTD said its officials had conducted a raid on a house in Shah Latif Town on a terrorist hideout. However, the man’s family said the deceased was a student who was earlier arrested by law enforcers and termed it a “fake encounter”. Earlier this month, PTI leaders presented journalists with what they described as “evidence” of torture allegedly inflicted on them during their detention under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance. In October 2025, seven policemen were suspended after a “teenage boy” died under controversial circumstances in the custody of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of Sindh Police.",

      "summary_orig": "US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal. The United States and Iran this week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at averting the possibility of military action, after Washington dispatched two aircraft carriers, jets and weaponry to the region to back its warnings. In a Fox News interview with Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Iran’s position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal. “I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated’, because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t… I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated’, but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said. “Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.” The US envoy also confirmed in the interview that he had met with Reza Pahlavi , the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a critic of the current authorities, who has not returned to the country since before the 1979 Revolution that ousted the monarchy. “I met him at the direction of the president,” Witkoff said, without providing further details. “I think he’s strong for his country, cares about his country. But this is going to be about President Trump’s policies.” US-based Pahlavi last week told a crowd in Munich that he was ready to lead the country to a “secular democratic future” after Trump said regime change would be best for the country. Witkoff’s comments come after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days. Trump said on Thursday that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme. As talks between the two nations continued in Geneva, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday said that Trump would not succeed in destroying the Islamic republic. Western countries accuse Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes. Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy, which played a role in sparking anti-government protests in December.",

      "summary_orig": "PPP leader Sharjeel Inam Memon on Sunday said that PTI founder Imran Khan’s release was “in his own hands” as it depended on his party’s “attitude”. The Sindh senior minister made the remarks while speaking to reporters during a visit to a site of ongoing development work in Karachi. In response to a question regarding Imran’s release, the minister maintained that the incarcerated former premier’s release “was in his own hands and the attitude” of PTI. “I do not have any knowledge of his release; however, it is the blessed month of Ramazan, and I pray for his health, particularly his eye issue”, Memon said. Imran’s health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January. Memon assailed the party for “not focusing on the release of their leadership” and instead “creating fuss and staging protests outside of Adiala”. “It is better if they focus on seeking Imran’s release,” he added. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was convicted months ago in another case regarding state gifts. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023 . Speaking to the media, Memon further said the PTI’s social media teams “target leaders and national institutions on social media and through their teams abroad”. The PPP leader advised the party to “improve their language and choice of words”, stressing that while one can hold disagreements, it was not appropriate to “verbally abuse people’s families and use below the belt language”. “Improve your mindset. It will help you a lot,” he added. Earlier this week, PPP Central Punjab General Secretary Syed Hassan Murtaza warned the PTI that any character assassination would be met with a forceful response, as he accused the PTI of unleashing a wave of online abuse against his party’s leadership. Last week, in a series of public addresses during his visit to South Punjab, President Asif Ali Zardari also criticised Imran amid concerns about his health, saying the jailed PTI leader should face imprisonment “like a man” and should not order his party leaders and workers to block roads. “He has served less than two years of imprisonment and is exhausted. In fact, [one realises what jail] actually is after two years of imprisonment,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "RAWALPINDI: As many as 469 trees and 715 shrubs have been relocated from Peshawar Road to other areas as work on three underpasses worth Rs8 billion commenced on the main artery of the cantonment area. The federal and Punjab governments had earlier issued directives not to cut any trees at the development sites following criticism over tree felling in Islamabad’s Shakarparian . After initial work began on Race Course Park, Army Graveyard and the Chairing Cross underpasses, the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) was tasked with relocating trees in the middle of the road and along Peshawar Road from Qasim Market to Chairing Cross. Cantonment Executive Officer Amir Rasheed told Dawn that the RCB decided to relocate the trees to protect them in nearby areas. 715 shrubs and 74 dead trees also removed; RCB pledges to plant 10 trees for each dead one He stated that 469 trees had been moved from Qasim Market to Chairing Cross and planted elsewhere around the area. “A total of 469 trees and 715 shrubs were affected in the development work and we have planted them in and around Peshawar Road,” he said. He added that as part of the replacement plan, RCB intends to plant more than 400 full-grown, healthy local tree and shrub varieties on the site after underpass construction, for a safer and healthier environment. There were 22 large trees, including 11 pilkan, two sheesham, six alstonia and one each of peepal, dhariak, and shireen. There were also 90 terminalia trees, one conocorpus, three eucalyptus, one more sheesham, 21 pine trees, and 33 ashoke. Additionally, 74 dead trees were removed from the site, and on the recommendation of the Environment Protection Agency Punjab, the RCB will plant ten new trees for each dead one. He mentioned that clear instructions had been given to the RCB Garden Branch to cultivate more plants in the nursery to be used for replanting once the underpass construction concludes in late May. Existing trees have been replanted in green belts from Lane 5 to Motorway Chowk, where space is available. The green belts are also being extended from Motorway Chowk to Chur Chowk, giving the area a greener appearance. Meanwhile, Iesco has completed its work on relocating electricity pylons from Chairing Cross to Radio Pakistan. The work, which started from Qasim Market to Radio Pakistan, is expected to be finished by the end of February. The Punjab Department of Communication and Works has already announced plans to commence work on the underpasses following Eidul Fitr. Punjab Highway Department Executive Engineer Qamar Ali Saqib told Dawn that initial work on the underpasses had already begun. After utility services, trees and electricity pylons are shifted, formal construction will commence. He explained that the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) has started constructing a dedicated utility service corridor in front of Race Course Park. Utility providers such as Iesco, SNGPL, RCB, and PTCL will lay their lines before work begins. He added that once the underpass work begins, it is expected to be completed within 70 days.

After utility services, trees and electricity pylons are shifted, formal construction will commence. He explained that the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) has started constructing a dedicated utility service corridor in front of Race Course Park. Utility providers such as Iesco, SNGPL, RCB, and PTCL will lay their lines before work begins. He added that once the underpass work begins, it is expected to be completed within 70 days.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The government borrowed almost five times more from banks in the first seven months of FY26 than in the same period last year, reflecting growing spending despite higher revenue collections. The government’s appetite for more bank money has shot up, leaving little room for the private sector to borrow. The private sector is not performing well enough to spur economic growth, given persistent tight monetary policy despite low inflation. The data issued by the State Bank showed that the government borrowed Rs1,912 billion in 7MFY26 from the commercial banks compared to Rs408bn a year ago. However, the government ended FY25 with total borrowing of Rs5.4 trillion, indicating most of the borrowing was carried out in the second half of that fiscal year. Raises Rs1.9tr from banks in 7MFY26, leaves little room for private sector The situation is even worse this year, as the government has already borrowed about Rs2tr, and if the pace continues, the total would surely exceed the Rs5.4tr borrowed in FY25. It must be alarming, since the government had borrowed Rs8.5tr in FY24 to meet rising current expenditure. Interest payments accounted for the largest share of spending, at around Rs8tr in FY25. Financial sectors have been warning that increased borrowing will lead to higher debt servicing costs. The government has no option but to borrow and cut development spending, as noted over the last three years. Last month, the State Bank reduced the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) for banks to 5pc from 6pc enabling banks to have higher liquidity. This additional liquidity has been created to feed the private sector. However, financial sector experts believe the additional liquidity could boost investment in government papers, as the private sector is least interested in launching new projects or expanding production. Businessmen and industrialists were borrowing for working capital, not for new ventures. Experts offer several reasons for the private sector’s reluctance to borrow for long-term investments. First, the interest rate is still double the prevailing inflation and the highest among regional countries. Secondly, the banks prefer risk-free easy profit from government securities and discourage long-term lending to businesses amid high default fears. Third, the unprecedented cost of inputs, especially energy, and high taxes, combined with rampant corruption in the Federal Board of Revenue, discourage new investment. It is believed in the financial sector that the time is not suitable for any new long-term investment due to the uncertain political situation in the country, while an alarming high alert in the region regarding the increasing possibility of attacks on Iran by Israel and US forces. Neither domestic nor foreign investors would invest in the economy unless the external and internal situation becomes conducive and attractive. This is why hundreds of Pakistanis have relocated their companies and partially shifted their businesses to Central Asia, Africa, and Mexico. Published in Dawn, February 22nd, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ALL eyes in Pakistan must be on Iran because of the likely crippling consequences of an outbreak of hostilities between the US-Israel coalition and the Persian Gulf Islamic Republic, with millions here and abroad asking when and if Trump will pull the trigger. Many analysts believe that the level of US military mobilisation ordered by President Donald Trump and the assembling of what he calls an ‘armada’ in the Gulf can’t be just to threaten or intimidate Iran but is actually part of preparations to attack it. Israel and its American supporters who have given Trump hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign funds apply their own pressure. Despite its overwhelming technical, numerical and resource advantage, is American military might enough to deliver mass-scale destruction in Iran in the shortest possible time? Even if accompanied by, reportedly, hundreds, even thousands, of Mossad-CIA-MI6 (Israeli, US and UK) agents and operatives on the ground — all carefully cultivated, funded and armed to play fifth columnists? This is the question Trump must be addressing. America’s appetite for either prolonged conflict or ‘boots on the ground’ is near zero, especially in Trump’s MAGA heartland. With mid-term Congressional elections due on Nov 3, a little over eight months away, the US president knows what making the wrong call on Iran could mean for the remainder of his term in office if his obedient-subservient Republicans lose their House majorities. Iranian planners know they can’t win a war against the US. But they say they plan to inflict a heavy cost on the US for any unilateral aggression. The US may not be dependent on Gulf oil, unlike China and East Asia and even Pakistan, but 20 per cent of the global oil supply passes through the Strait of Hormuz daily. If the US can’t quickly clear the area of Iranian naval assets — including of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) — comprising high-speed missile boats, shore-based fortified missile batteries, and missile launchers on islands dotting the Gulf, besides Iran’s ability to mine the narrow waterway, then any disruption will lead to a rise in oil prices. The longer the disruption, the higher the oil prices. Where this can devastate economies such as Pakistan’s and cause headaches for even China — 15pc of whose oil needs are met by discounted Iranian imports — experts say that a months-long campaign can push oil prices up to $150 a barrel. Such an oil price hike will hammer the global economy and the US can’t remain immune to its effects. Blocking the strait is just one step the Iranians could take if they retain the military capacity in the days and weeks after the start of a possible attack during which the US military claims it can carry out 800 sorties a day. Sea- and land-based missiles will be in addition, as will Israeli air attacks. Iran could retaliate by targeting not just US military bases but also part of the Arab Gulf oil and gas infrastructure, impacting supplies. One can be sure that if the US does decide to attack Iran, mainly at the behest of Israel and some of its two-faced regional allies, it will have factored in Iran’s military capability and devised a plan on how to knock out Tehran’s missile stockpiles and launch sites quickly. The memory of last year’s 12-day war is still fresh; faced with an Iranian missile barrage that breached sophisticated multi-layered missile defence shields to hammer Israel. The latter country is reported to have asked the US to secure a ceasefire. One can be sure in the months since that the US-Israel coalition has done its homework, strengthened missile defence shields and worked on identifying and better targeting Iran’s missile launchers, many of which are said to be in deep underground bunkers but still highly mobile. Although China and Russia have refrained from any openly declared military supplies/upgrades, there are suggestions in the independent media (not in the Western legacy media framework) that the Iranian military, like Pakistan’s, has now completely transitioned to the Chinese BeiDou satellite system from the US Global Positioning System (GPS). This has two advantages. The first is the West’s difficulty in jamming it, and secondly, its targeting is said to be better compared to that of GPS in some areas. There are some reports that Iran now also possesses a datalink for military communications and targeting similar to Pakistan’s Link-17 which the latter state used to devastating effect in last year’s conflict with India. Iranian planners know well that they can’t win a war against the US. But they say they plan to inflict a heavy cost on the US for any unilateral aggression. How high that cost can be and how much of it is achievable by a long-sanctioned Iran is something Trump would be receiving briefings on. Israel wants to devastate Iran’s central authority and turn the country into another Libya or Syria so that it loses its ability to challenge the settler-colonial state. Fragmentation and a civil war-like situation may remove the threat to Tel Aviv but the latter’s proxies can threaten states like Pakistan, unleashing hitherto unknown dynamics. Western media is abuzz with talk of an attack as early as this weekend. But, as we speak, Russian, Chinese and Iranian (including the IRGC) navies are carrying out exercises in the Strait of Hormuz. China has made it clear many times that it has no appetite for military conflict and will focus on economic growth and global trade integration through its Belt and Road Initiative. Russia is preoccupied with its war in Ukraine and the US might leverage that conflict to secure Russian neutrality. However, with both major powers carrying out naval manoeuvres bang in the middle of a conflict zone, it isn’t clear what their reaction would be if their assets suffer collateral damage; they won’t be targeted. This may dictate the timing of the US decision, perhaps the decision itself. The writer is a former editor of Dawn. abbas.nasir@hotmail.com Published in Dawn, February 22nd, 2026",

How high that cost can be and how much of it is achievable by a long-sanctioned Iran is something Trump would be receiving briefings on. Israel wants to devastate Iran’s central authority and turn the country into another Libya or Syria so that it loses its ability to challenge the settler-colonial state. Fragmentation and a civil war-like situation may remove the threat to Tel Aviv but the latter’s proxies can threaten states like Pakistan, unleashing hitherto unknown dynamics. Western media is abuzz with talk of an attack as early as this weekend. But, as we speak, Russian, Chinese and Iranian (including the IRGC) navies are carrying out exercises in the Strait of Hormuz. China has made it clear many times that it has no appetite for military conflict and will focus on economic growth and global trade integration through its Belt and Road Initiative. Russia is preoccupied with its war in Ukraine and the US might leverage that conflict to secure Russian neutrality. However, with both major powers carrying out naval manoeuvres bang in the middle of a conflict zone, it isn’t clear what their reaction would be if their assets suffer collateral damage; they won’t be targeted. This may dictate the timing of the US decision, perhaps the decision itself. The writer is a former editor of Dawn. abbas.nasir@hotmail.com Published in Dawn, February 22nd, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "In February 2025, the National Citizens Party (NCP) was established by the prominent youth leaders of Bangladesh’s so-called ‘Gen-Z Revolution.’ This student-led uprising had terminated Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year authoritarian tenure during the summer of 2024. The primary objective of the party was to transition young leaders into the parliament. The 2024 uprising comprised a broad coalition of liberals, leftists, Islamists and nationalists. The Bangladesh Jamaat-i-Islami (BJI) emerged as the most organised faction. It had been a primary target of Hasina’s government. The movement against Hasina’s rule was highly iconoclastic, actively attacking symbols associated with the birth of Bangladesh and the role played by Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujeeb, in this birth. He is someone the BJI detests. When the young leaders of the 2024 uprising decided to formalise their revolution by establishing a political party, the move was immediately met with internal confusion. The NCP’s ranks comprised a volatile mix of progressives, secularists, conservatives and nationalists. Internal debates were often heated but failed to produce a consolidated consensus. Instead, a flimsy foundational statement was tabled, asserting that the party was neither secular nor Islamist. This was criticised by political analysts as a product of political ambiguity. This lack of clarity became particularly apparent during the drafting of the party’s primary charter. The leadership struggled to reconcile the aspirations of its secular factions with the increasing influence of its Islamist factions. By refusing to define its stance on the role of religion in the state, the party risked becoming a vessel for any organised group capable of mobilising the street. This led to NCP’s controversial alignment with the BJI for the elections. From Pakistan in 1977 and Iran in 1979 to Egypt in 2011 and Bangladesh in 2026, when loosely organised reformists align with disciplined Islamist forces, the ‘revolution’ rarely ends as they imagine This represents a classic phenomenon observed across various developing nations, where small progressive groups frequently align themselves with the more organised right-wing forces. Such progressives often operate under the belief that this partnership will provide a viable route into the corridors of power by leveraging the superior organisational machinery of right-wing parties. However, the historical precedent for such alliances is almost invariably disastrous. In these arrangements, the smaller progressive elements often find themselves ideologically hollowed out or eventually sidelined by their resource-rich right-wing ‘partners’. The NCP’s attempt to harness the mobilising power of the BJI ultimately compromised the youthful party’s reformist identity and led to significant internal fractures. In the 1977 general elections in Pakistan, and the subsequent anti-Bhutto protest movement, various small secular and progressive parties joined an alliance that was largely led by the country’s three main Islamist parties. The alliance viewed the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto regime as tyrannical. However, the progressives in the alliance frequently found themselves at a loss for words when their Islamist ‘allies’ began advocating for the replacement of Bhutto’s ‘socialist’ policies with a government based on Shariah law. When the Bhutto regime was toppled in a reactionary military coup, the progressives and secularists in the alliance found themselves in jails or exile, while the Jamaat-i-Islami, a major partner in the alliance, successfully integrated itself into the first cabinet of the new military regime. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 provides another prominent example of this precarious dynamic. In the late 1970s, a broad coalition of secular liberals, leftists and student activists collaborated with religious clerics under Ayatollah Khomeini to overthrow the Shah of Iran. According to the Iranian-American historian Ervand Abrahamian, middle-class progressives operated under the assumption that, as the “intellectual engines of the uprising”, they would inevitably dictate the shape of the post-revolutionary state. However, once the Shah was ousted, the more organised Islamist factions rapidly consolidated authority. This resulted in a systematic and brutal purge of their former secular and leftist partners. A similar pattern emerged in Egypt following the ousting of Hosni Mubarak in 2011. The sociologist Hazem Kandil wrote that the secular and liberal activists who had led the protests lacked a formal political structure to translate their street presence into institutional power. They entered into a tactical partnership with the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. Although the Brotherhood won the ensuing elections, the alliance with the progressive youth disintegrated. The progressives felt that the Brotherhood had ‘hijacked’ the revolution to implement a narrow ideological agenda. This internal collapse eventually created the conditions for a military takeover in 2013. The NCP could only win seven seats in the recent parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. The elections were swept by the centrist Bangladesh National Party (BNP). Critics within the NCP are of the view that its alliance with an Islamist party alienated a significant number of their supporters, who decided to vote for the BNP, which has been a historical opponent of the Awami League. Progressives/leftists are often effective at articulating grievances and dominating the media narrative during an uprising. Yet, they frequently lack the social machinery required to sustain political power. They employ ‘tactical entryism’, believing that it is more convenient to enter into a partnership with  larger right-wing parties and use their physical and logistical strength to grab a piece of the power pie and gradually steer the government toward reform. Such moves frequently fail. Right-wing parties are strictly hierarchical and highly disciplined. This makes it easy for them to later purge their more loosely organised progressive ‘allies’. A recent case of ‘entryism’ is visible in the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Aaien-i-Pakistan (TTAP), an opposition alliance headed by the right-wing populist Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). It contains a mixture of sectarian outfits, secularists, conservatives and a left-wing group. The left within this alliance has decided not to view PTI as a right-wing party but as a populist vehicle for ‘democracy’ and, of course, its own entry into a future parliament. There may also be an ambition that they might simply step into the vacuum and replace the PTI that is in such spectacular shambles. After all, what better way to lead the masses than by hijacking a shipwreck, no? One can only admire the intellectual flexibility required for these activists to rationalise positions that contradict their own stated values, most notably PTI’s steadfast refusal to entertain any meaningful action against Islamist militants. It is a masterclass in moral amnesia. Meanwhile, the alliance’s more seasoned folk, who are ex-devotees of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), are clearly treating this populist vehicle as an elaborate audition. Their goal isn’t so much to save the soul of the nation as it is to bat their eyelashes at the establishment, hoping to be hand-picked for the lead role in the next state-sanctioned ‘king’s party.’ Ultimately, the whole spectacle offers far more fodder for a dark comedy than it does for any genuine ‘struggle for democracy’ and the ‘sanctity of the constitution.’ Published in Dawn, EOS, February 22nd, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: As a guilty plea in New York confirms India’s involvement in an assassination attempt on US soil, Pakistan has highlighted Indian-sponsorship of extraterritorial terrorism and threats against dissidents abroad, warning that the Modi government, in the garb of extremist Hindutva ideology has become the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Islamabad has shared “irrefutable and concrete evidence of Indian sponsorship of terrorism and terrorist groups operating in Pakistan from across our borders,” said Tahir Abdrabi, spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a recent press briefing. The warning comes as Nikhil Gupta , an American citizen, formally stands convicted in a US federal court after a Manhattan judge accepted his guilty plea in a murder-for-hire conspiracy targeting Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh activist living in New York. The case carries a maximum prison exposure of 40 years. Observers say conviction confirms Indian plot to kill Sikh activist, but it does not resolve broader diplomatic questions of ‘state responsibility’ Under US law, a conviction occurs once a judge accepts a guilty plea after determining it was made knowingly, voluntarily, and with a factual basis. In Gupta’s case, the finding of guilt is final; only sentencing remains. His hearing is scheduled for May 29, with prosecutors calculating an advisory sentencing range of 235 to 293 months (roughly 19 to 24 years). Gupta admitted to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. US officials have emphasised the broader implications. A US Department of Justice state­­ment said the assassination plot was initiated by an Indian government employee, identified in reports as former Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) officer Vikash Yadav. FBI Assistant Director James C. Barnacle, Jr., added that Gupta acted at the “direction and coordination of an Indian government employee,” facilitating a “foreign adversary’s unlawful effort to silence a vocal critic of the Indian government.” When the case first appeared in the media in November 2023, then-Senator and Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin described it as “a foiled assassination plot against a US citizen involving Indian government officials,” highlighting the need to examine how governments attempt to silence dissidents abroad. While US lawmakers have not publicly commented on Gupta’s conviction, reports indicate interest in assessing whether the plot reflects a systemic pattern or a limited operation. Intelligence cooperation between Washington and New Delhi could see subtle recalibrations in sensitive channels, while the Trump administration is expected to use the case as a warning against extraterritorial targeting on American soil. Diplomatic observers in Washington note that the case will likely influence “intelligence sharing, law-enforcement coordination, and visa or security vetting in sensitive areas,” rather than immediately prompting public sanctions or a breakdown in relations. The case also remains linked to the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada, an episode that strained Ottawa-New Delhi relations and drew attention from the United States and other Five Eyes partners. Together, the two incidents have positioned India in Western security discourse as a country accused of targeting dissidents abroad. While Gupta’s conviction confirms the plot, it does not resolve broader diplomatic questions of state responsibility, the observers noted. Those issues are expected to be addressed through intelligence channels, congressional oversight, and private diplomatic engagement — the quiet processes through which Washington balances law enforcement red lines with strategic partnerships central to its Asia policy. In that sense, the case is no longer just about the criminal act itself, but about how the United States chooses to translate a conviction into long-term norms governing the conduct of both allies and adversaries.

      "summary_en": "WASHINGTON: As a guilty plea in New York confirms India’s involvement in an assassination attempt on US soil, Pakistan has highlighted Indian-sponsorship of extraterritorial terrorism and threats against dissidents abroad, warning that the Modi government, in the garb of extremist Hindutva ideology has become the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Islamabad has shared “irrefutable and concrete evidence of Indian sponsorship of terrorism and terrorist groups operating in Pakistan from across our borders,” said Tahir Abdrabi, spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a recent press briefing. The warning comes as Nikhil Gupta , an American citizen, formally stands convicted in a US federal court after a Manhattan judge accepted his guilty plea in a murder-for-hire conspiracy targeting Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh activist living in New York. The case carries a maximum prison exposure of 40 years. Observers say conviction confirms Indian plot to kill Sikh activist, but it does not resolve broader diplomatic questions of ‘state responsibility’ Under US law, a conviction occurs once a judge accepts a guilty plea after determining it was made knowingly, voluntarily, and with a factual basis.

      "summary_orig": "• Trump tells reporters 32,000 killed during last month’s nationwide protests; UN expert puts toll at 20,000 • Pezeshkian says Tehran will not bow to pressure as threat of war looms large TEHRAN: The Iranian government has demanded evidence after the US President Donald Trump told reporters that 32,000 people were killed during last month’s nationwide protests in the Islamic Republic, Al Jazeera reported on Saturday. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the government released a list of 3,117 people, including about 200 security personnel, whom he described as “victims of recent terrorist operation”. “If anyone disputes accuracy of our data, please share any evidence,” the diplomat, who has previously stated that 690 people on the list were “terrorists” armed and funded by the US and Israel, wrote on X. His comments came as the threat of war looms increasingly large over the country and potentially the region, with Serbia on Saturday becoming the latest country to call on all its citizens to immediately leave Iran. ‘20,000 civilians’ Mai Sato, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, has said more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed, but information remains limited amid heavy internet filtering by the state, six weeks after a nationwide communications blackout was imposed. The US-based HRANA says it has documented more than 7,000 people killed during the nationwide protests, and is investigating nearly 12,000 more cases. Sato was among 30 special rapporteurs and international human rights experts who signed a joint statement on Friday calling on Iranian authorities to fully disclose the fate and whereabouts of tens of thousands arrested, forcibly disappeared or missing in the aftermath of the nationwide protests, and to halt all related death sentences and executions. ‘Iran will not bow to pressure’ Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that his country would not bow its head to pressure from world powers amid nuclear talks with the United States, Reuters reported. “World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads … but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us,” Pezeshkian said in a speech carried live by state TV. On the other hand, the Iranian foreign minister has also been speaking with multiple US media outlets to advocate for a “fair” agreement with Washington over Iran’s nuclear programme. The comments come after President Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran after ordering a major naval build-up in the Middle East aimed at pressuring Tehran to reach a deal to curb its nuclear programme. The latest warning came after Iran’s foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready within days, following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week. Trump had suggested on Thursday that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, a deadline he later extended to 15 days. Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump replied: “The most I can say — I am considering it.” As part of the military build-up, the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford was seen entering the Mediterranean Sea on Friday, transiting the Strait of Gibraltar, after being ordered to the region by Trump. Washington had already deployed t he USS Abraham Lincoln and escort warships to the Gulf in January. Published in Dawn, February 22nd, 2026",
