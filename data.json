The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) held a meeting marking the launch of the development project at the headquarters of HD Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan, South Gyeongsang Province. Under the plan, the agency aims to replace the combat systems and towed array sonars of three KSS-II submarines with the latest equipment by 2033. They will also be newly equipped with mine avoidance sonars and buoyant wire antennas, according to DAPA. The planned upgrade is expected to significantly enhance the submarines' operational capabilities, including their detection, navigation and attack skills, and help demonstrate the optimal combat system developed through homegrown technology, DAPA said.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces have killed seven terrorists during three operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media affairs wing said on Thursday. According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij ” were killed in operations conducted over two days, November 18 and 19. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) The ISPR said an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in KP’s Mohmand district on the reported presence of terrorists. “During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij ’s location and after an intense fire exchange, four khawarij were sent to hell.” Another IBO was conducted in the Lakki Marwat district. In the ensuing fire exchange, “two khawarij were effectively neutralised by the security forces,” the ISPR said. It added that during the third encounter in the Tank district, security forces killed one more terrorist. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area,” ISPR the statement said, adding: “Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under the vision of ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.” The ISPR’s latest statement detailing the three operations in KP comes two days after it reported the killing of 38 terrorists in four IBOs conducted over a span of three days. Of these operations, one was conducted in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, during which ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed. Another operation was carried out Datta Khel in the North Waziristan district, where troops killed five more terrorists. The remaining two IBOs took place between in Bajaur and Bannu districts, during which 11 and 12 terrorists were killed, respectively. Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan. Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents follow the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Last month, Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged in the country over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.",

      "summary_orig": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Thursday that it had approved loans totalling $330 million to Pakistan for the country’s Second Power Transmission Strengthening Project. The ADB press release said the project was one of the government’s “top priority investments to expand the national transmission network and enable the evacuation of low-cost renewable and hydropower to major load centres”. The bank said a new 500 kilovolt transmission line of approximately 290 kilometres would be constructed under the project, in addition to upgrading “critical grid infrastructure” feeding Islamabad and Faisalabad. “These investments will address long-standing constraints in Pakistan’s north–south power corridor, enabling the transfer of up to 3,200 megawatts of clean energy from hydropower plants in the north of the country. This will help reduce reliance on imported fuels, improve energy security, and support Pakistan’s transition to a more affordable and sustainable energy mix,” the ADB said. ADB said that the initiative supported Pakistan’s broader power sector reforms and contributed to state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms “by solidifying institutional, financial, operational, and governance improvements of the National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) on its pathway to a modern grid operator”. It added that the NGC would serve as the executing agency for the project. According to the press release, the ADB financing package comprises a $285m loan from the bank’s ordinary capital resources and a $45m concessional loan. “This financing will help NGC expand and modernise transmission assets, strengthen institutional capacity, improve financial management, and advance public outreach and gender equity initiatives.” The press release quoted ADB Country Director for Pakistan Emma Fan as saying: “This project represents ADB’s strong partnership with Pakistan and our shared commitment to accelerate clean energy transition and integration, and to achieve a resilient and sustainable energy sector. By expanding transmission capacity and enabling the delivery of low-cost hydropower, the project aims to improve access to clean energy in the power mix, reduce system costs, and support Pakistan’s long-term and sustainable economic development.” The press release further stated that the Second Power Transmission Strengthening Project aligned with Pakistan’s National Power Policy (2021) , Vision 2025 , and Pakistan’s Nationally Determined Contributions (2021) , which emphasised energy security, climate resilience, affordable clean power, and sustainable development. “The new infrastructure will also lower technical losses, enhance grid reliability, and support the financial sustainability of the energy sector,” it said. The ADB reaffirmed that it “continues to work with Pakistan and development partners to advance reforms, strengthen sector governance, and expand access to greener and more reliable electricity”.",

      "summary_orig": "A Rawalpindi Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Thursday withdrew arrest warrants previously issued for Aleema Khan, the sister of PTI founder and former premier Imran Khan, in the November 26 protest case. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah withdrew the warrants after Aleema appeared before the court and submitted a compliance report. The court directed her to furnish fresh surety bonds worth Rs1 million each, following which the warrants were cancelled. The case pertains to a protest staged by the PTI in November last year and the court has issued arrest warrants for Aleema multiple times over her repeated absence. Aleema has denied any wrongdoing, maintaining that the charges are politically motivated. At a previous hearing, the judge had also directed the relevant authorities to block Aleema’s national identity card (CNIC) and passport, and freeze her bank accounts. During today’s hearing, Aleema moved an application seeking a reversal of the freeze on her bank accounts, including joint accounts associated with the National University of Modern Languages. She argued that the freezing orders had caused her undue hardship and were issued without proper legal justification. In response, Judge Shah issued notices to the prosecution, seeking their response on the application. The court is expected to examine whether the freezing orders were warranted and whether there was a sufficient legal basis to maintain them. Subsequently, the judge adjourned the hearing until November 26, directing the prosecution to submit its reply before then. The case The case pertains to allegations brought under various sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) in connection with protests and unrest linked to last year’s  November 26 protest. The protest saw more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”. Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the ATA. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations. Aleema, along with 10 others, was booked in the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station.",

      "summary_orig": "Denmark has pointed to the “serious threat” posed by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Central and South Asia and says that the terror outfit has been receiving “logistical and substantial support from the de facto authorities”. In the capacity of the chair of the Security Council ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee, Denmark raised these concerns while briefing a UNSC meeting held in New York on Wednesday. The presence of TTP militants in Afghanistan has long been a point of contention between Islamabad and the Taliban administration. Since the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul in 2021, Pakistan has accused the group of sheltering thousands of TTP fighters, who have escalated attacks on Pakistani security forces, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Balochistan provinces. Denmark’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Sandra Jensen Landi told the UNSC meeting that the TTP, “with its approximately 6,000 fighters, is another serious threat emanating from the region, receiving both logistical and substantial support from the de facto authorities”. “The TTP has conducted numerous high-profile attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil, some of which incurred mass casualties,” she added. Landi also gave an overview of the evolving terrorist threat posed by Daesh, Al-Qaeda and their affiliates, drawing on the latest assessments of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team. “The threat posed by ISIL (Daesh), Al-Qaeda and their affiliates remains dynamic and geographically diverse, with the highest intensity observed in Africa. ISIL, Al-Qaeda and their affiliates continue to step up their propaganda, exploiting social media platforms to glorify violence, recruit youth and raise funds. Their continued use of cryptocurrencies poses a growing challenge to sanctions implementation,” she said. Landi further stated that after losses in the Middle East, Daesh had “pivoted towards Africa, where affiliates such as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have expanded activities and propaganda”. “ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K) is one of the most serious threats in Central and South Asia, with at least 2,000 fighters under Sanaullah Ghafari. They continue to target Shia communities, de facto Afghan authorities and foreign nationals,” she said. “Across regions, foreign terrorist fighter movements — particularly between Syria, Africa and Central Asia — remain a persistent concern for member states.” Landi further said that Al-Qaeda’s central leadership remained weak and largely marginalised, while affiliates — including Jamaat Nasr al Islam wal Muslimin in the Sahel region of Africa — had “exploited local grievances to expand their reach and financing”. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) also continued to incite attacks and raise funds, she highlighted. “Overall, ISIL and Al-Qaeda have proven resilient, adaptive and opportunistic, exploiting regional instability, weak governance and emerging technologies to sustain relevance and project influence. These developments underscore the need for continued vigilance and close multilateral cooperation under the 1267 sanctions regime.” Following Landi’s briefing, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Usman Jadoon was among those who addressed the meeting. He highlighted that the global terrorism landscape continued to evolve, “adapting itself to a fast-changing world with new and emerging threats under the shadow of rapid technological advancement”. “At the same time, the prevalence of prolonged unresolved conflicts, external interventions and root causes of terrorism, or euphemistically referred to as the ‘conditions conducive to terrorism’, remain unaddressed, giving continued life to the threat of terrorism.” He said that as a frontline state in global efforts to counter terrorism, Pakistan had rendered invaluable sacrifices in its efforts to eradicate this menace, with over 80,000 casualties and billions of dollars in economic losses. Al Qaeda was decimated largely due to Pakistan’s efforts, he said. “Our valiant security forces and law enforcement agencies continue to counter the terrorism threat emanating from Afghanistan where entities like ISIL-K, TTP and its affiliates, BLA (Baloch Liberation Army) and the Majeed Brigade are thriving under the patronage of their hosts and backed by our principle adversary and net destabiliser in the region.” Jadoon stressed that the 1267 sanctions regime — the UNSC framework for imposing sactions on Daesh and Al Qaeda — must reflect ground realities. “Its scope should be broadened to list individuals and entities, without any association with religion, nationality or ethnicity.” He further said that it was necessary to deal with listing and delisting issues in a fair, transparent, judicious and impartial manner, and without political considerations. “We must also ensure that the 1267 sanctions committee takes an objective view of all listing proposals that are brought before its consideration and not subject them to narrow political interests.” Moreover, to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism, the UN’s counter-terrorism architecture “must also possess the necessary tools to designate violent, far-right, extreme right-wing, ultra-nationalist, xenophobic and Islamophobic groups around the world”, he said. Failed Pak-Afghan talks on countering terrorism Since 2022, Pakistan has seen a spate of attacks by the banned group, and security forces routinely engage in counter-terrorism operations along the north-western border to eliminate the threat. The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have also come under strain in recent times as the TTP remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. But the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegation of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.

      "summary_en": "Denmark has pointed to the “serious threat” posed by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Central and South Asia and says that the terror outfit has been receiving “logistical and substantial support from the de facto authorities”. In the capacity of the chair of the Security Council ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee, Denmark raised these concerns while briefing a UNSC meeting held in New York on Wednesday. The presence of TTP militants in Afghanistan has long been a point of contention between Islamabad and the Taliban administration. Since the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul in 2021, Pakistan has accused the group of sheltering thousands of TTP fighters, who have escalated attacks on Pakistani security forces, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Balochistan provinces. Denmark’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Sandra Jensen Landi told the UNSC meeting that the TTP, “with its approximately 6,000 fighters, is another serious threat emanating from the region, receiving both logistical and substantial support from the de facto authorities”. “The TTP has conducted numerous high-profile attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil, some of which incurred mass casualties,” she added. Landi also gave an overview of the evolving terrorist threat posed by Daesh, Al-Qaeda and their affiliates, drawing on the latest assessments of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team. “The threat posed by ISIL (Daesh), Al-Qaeda and their affiliates remains dynamic and geographically diverse, with the highest intensity observed in Africa. ISIL, Al-Qaeda and their affiliates continue to step up their propaganda, exploiting social media platforms to glorify violence, recruit youth and raise funds. Their continued use of cryptocurrencies poses a growing challenge to sanctions implementation,” she said. Landi further stated that after losses in the Middle East, Daesh had “pivoted towards Africa, where affiliates such as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have expanded activities and propaganda”. “ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K) is one of the most serious threats in Central and South Asia, with at least 2,000 fighters under Sanaullah Ghafari. They continue to target Shia communities, de facto Afghan authorities and foreign nationals,” she said. “Across regions, foreign terrorist fighter movements — particularly between Syria, Africa and Central Asia — remain a persistent concern for member states.” Landi further said that Al-Qaeda’s central leadership remained weak and largely marginalised, while affiliates — including Jamaat Nasr al Islam wal Muslimin in the Sahel region of Africa — had “exploited local grievances to expand their reach and financing”. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) also continued to incite attacks and raise funds, she highlighted. “Overall, ISIL and Al-Qaeda have proven resilient, adaptive and opportunistic, exploiting regional instability, weak governance and emerging technologies to sustain relevance and project influence. These developments underscore the need for continued vigilance and close multilateral cooperation under the 1267 sanctions regime.” Following Landi’s briefing, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Usman Jadoon was among those who addressed the meeting. He highlighted that the global terrorism landscape continued to evolve, “adapting itself to a fast-changing world with new and emerging threats under the shadow of rapid technological advancement”. “At the same time, the prevalence of prolonged unresolved conflicts, external interventions and root causes of terrorism, or euphemistically referred to as the ‘conditions conducive to terrorism’, remain unaddressed, giving continued life to the threat of terrorism.” He said that as a frontline state in global efforts to counter terrorism, Pakistan had rendered invaluable sacrifices in its efforts to eradicate this menace, with over 80,000 casualties and billions of dollars in economic losses. Al Qaeda was decimated largely due to Pakistan’s efforts, he said. “Our valiant security forces and law enforcement agencies continue to counter the terrorism threat emanating from Afghanistan where entities like ISIL-K, TTP and its affiliates, BLA (Baloch Liberation Army) and the Majeed Brigade are thriving under the patronage of their hosts and backed by our principle adversary and net destabiliser in the region.” Jadoon stressed that the 1267 sanctions regime — the UNSC framework for imposing sactions on Daesh and Al Qaeda — must reflect ground realities. “Its scope should be broadened to list individuals and entities, without any association with religion, nationality or ethnicity.” He further said that it was necessary to deal with listing and delisting issues in a fair, transparent, judicious and impartial manner, and without political considerations. “We must also ensure that the 1267 sanctions committee takes an objective view of all listing proposals that are brought before its consideration and not subject them to narrow political interests.” Moreover, to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism, the UN’s counter-terrorism architecture “must also possess the necessary tools to designate violent, far-right, extreme right-wing, ultra-nationalist, xenophobic and Islamophobic groups around the world”, he said. Failed Pak-Afghan talks on countering terrorism Since 2022, Pakistan has seen a spate of attacks by the banned group, and security forces routinely engage in counter-terrorism operations along the north-western border to eliminate the threat. The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have also come under strain in recent times as the TTP remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. But the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegation of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) has issued a notice to airmen (Notam) extending the airspace ban for Indian aircraft till December 24, it emerged on Thursday. The new ban for Indian aircraft has been notified just four days before a previous one is set to expire. India and Pakistan have closed their airspaces to each other’s airlines since tensions between them escalated in late April in the wake of an attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people. Islamabad most recently extended the airspace ban in mid-October till November 24. The latest restriction went into effect from 2:50pm Pakistan time on November 19 (yesterday) to 4:59am on December 24, according to a Notam issued on Wednesday. The bar will apply to all Indian-registered aircraft as well as any aircraft operated, owned, or leased by Indian airlines or operators, including military flights. The airspace closure applies from ground level up to unlimited altitude. Pakistan’s airspace is divided into two flight information regions (FIRs) — Karachi and Lahore, according to a Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) document from 2022. The Notam applies to both the Karachi (OPKR) and Lahore (OPLR) FIRs. The Notam issued by Pakistan for barring Indian flights in its airspace till Dec 24, 2025. — PAA website On April 24, in response to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty after the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines.

      "summary_orig": "In fresh comments on the military escalation between Pakistan and Indian in May, United States President Donald Trump has said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif phoned him to say that he had “saved millions”, adding that it took the threat of “350 per cent tariffs” to end the conflict. Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared earlier this year when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was blamed on Islamabad, which denied the accusations. The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump in May, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries. Addressing the US-Saudi Investment Forum on Wednesday, the US president said, “I’m good at settling disputes, and I’ve always been — I’ve done very well with that over the years. View this post on Instagram “India, Pakistan — they were going to go at it, nuclear weapons. I said that’s okay, you can go at it, but I’m putting a 350pc tariff on each country. No more trade with the United States,” he said. “No, no you can’t do that,” Trump said, doing an impression. “I said I am going to do it. Come back to me and I’ll take it down, but I’m not going to have you guys shooting nuclear weapons at each other, killing millions of people and having the nuclear dust floating over Los Angeles. I’m not going to do it,” he said, reiterating that it took the threat of a 350pc tariff to settle the conflict. “No other president would have done that. Joe Biden doesn’t even know what countries we are talking about. He wouldn’t have any idea,” Trump said as laughter rang out. The US president said that he settled five out of eight wars he has taken credit for ending by threatening tariffs. “I tell you what, the prime minister of Pakistan called me … he actually said I saved millions — and he said in front of Susie. He said, ‘President Trump saved millions and millions of lives. He doesn’t even know that, but he saved millions of lives’.” The person the US president was referring to appeared to be White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. Trump also said he had received a call from Indian PM Narendra Modi, recounting the exchange between the two, where the latter said that “we’re not going to go to war”. “I said, ‘Thank you very much. Let’s make a deal’.” Trump also recounted his role in ending other conflicts, including brokering a peace plan for Gaza in October, saying, “I’ve settled eight wars. I have one to go.” However, he expressed disappointment in Russian President Vladimir Putin for his resistance to ending Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. “I thought that was going to be my easy one, because I have a good relationship with President Putin,” he said. “But I’m a little disappointed in President Putin right now. He knows that.” The US president also said that the Saudi crown prince wanted him “to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan ” and expressed his resolve to turn his attention there, although it had not previously been “on his charts”. “I just see how important that is to you … and we’re going to start working in Sudan,” he said to applause. “I didn’t think that that was one that was going to be so easy to do, but we’re going to start working.” The US president has previously stated on several occasions that five to eight planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September. India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said he will host New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani for a meeting on Friday, after fiercely attacking the 34-year-old self-described Democratic Socialist during his recent campaign. Trump, while repeating his false claim that Mamdani is a “communist,” said on his Truth Social platform that the meeting “will take place at the Oval Office on Friday”. Mamdani’s spokesperson Dora Pekec confirmed the meeting in a statement. “As is customary for an incoming mayoral administration, the mayor-elect plans to meet with the President in Washington to discuss public safety, economic security and the affordability agenda that over one million New Yorkers voted for just two weeks ago,” Pekec said on Wednesday. Trump’s meeting with Mamdani marks the coming together of two men raised in the Queens borough of New York, but their similarities may end there. While Trump frequently touts the record-breaking gains on Wall Street during his presidency, Mamdani’s view on the economy extends beyond the bullish financial markets in downtown Manhattan to an affordability crisis facing a city of over 8 million people. As the first mayoral candidate to surpass the one-million-vote mark in New York since 1969, Mamdani campaigned on pledges of affordable housing and childcare, as well as free rides on city buses and city-run grocery stores. Experts have questioned Mamdani’s ability to deliver on his idealistic and broad-reaching platform. Virulently anti-immigrant Trump has derided Mamdani’s South Asian name, and threatened to cut federal funding for New York upon the Muslim’s election to run America’s largest city. “ Mandami , whatever the hell his name is,” Trump said recently — deliberately mispronouncing the Uganda-born politician’s surname. Mamdani has not backed down from Trump, calling out the 79-year-old Republican during his victory rally earlier this month. “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you — turn the volume up!” he said to his cheering supporters. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later confirmed the president had indeed watched Mamdani speak.",

      "summary_orig": "KABUL: The Afghan Taliban trade minister arrived in India on Wednesday on a maiden visit to draw greater investments and goods, as both countries consider ways to enhance their relations in the backdrop of Kabul’s souring relations with neighbouring Pakistan. India last month upgraded its ties with the Taliban by reopening its embassy in Kabul that was shut in 2021, following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces. New Delhi is also ramping up its aid to the country as it competes with China for influence. Minister Alhaj Noor­uddin Azizi will hold talks with his Indian counterpart and the foreign minister, as well as with traders and investors, Afgha­nistan’s commerce ministry said in a statement. “These meetings will focus on expanding economic cooperation, facilitating trade relations, creating joint investment opportunities, and stren­g­thening Afgh­anis­tan’s role in regional transit routes,” it added. Landlocked Afgh­a­nis­tan is seeking access to grains, medicines and industrial goods following the closure of its border with Pakistan in recent weeks after armed clashes last month between the neighbours over cross-border terrorism. In the past six months, Afghanistan’s trade through Iran has reached $1.6 billion, higher than the $1.1 billion exchanged with Pakistan, Afgha­ni­stan’s commerce ministry told Reuters. “Advancing bilateral trade and investment ties are the key focus of the visit,” Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry, wrote on X along with a photograph of Azizi’s arrival in Delhi.
