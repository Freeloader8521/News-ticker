      "summary_orig": "IN an increasingly lawless world in which the global order is fragmenting, countries have to navigate an uncharted geopolitical terrain in a very unpredictable environment. Powerful states and regional powers are using coercive power to try to bend other states to their will. The threat or the use of force has become an option of first resort for them and the principal means of ‘resolving’ disputes. Attacks by stronger countries on the sovereignty of their adversaries or weaker states have become all too frequent. Some of these aggressive actions are disingenuously called pre-emptive wars. Israel’s war on Gaza , its attacks on Iran , Syria , Lebanon , Yemen and Qatar , the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US bombardment of Iran and India’s military action against Pakistan all testify to the increasing use of force and violation of international law. This new era of escalation and growing insecurity has renewed thinking among countries about nuclear weapons. Iran and Ukraine were attacked by nuclear powers. An NPT-member state, Iran was bombed by two nuclear-weapon states. This has encouraged more countries to see nuclear weapons as a guarantor of security. The lesson security-challenged countries may have drawn from recent events is that without nuclear weapons they are more vulnerable to external aggression and attacks on their sovereignty. The annual 2025 SIPRI report highlights the potential for more countries to consider developing or hosting nuclear weapons. This at a time when the nuclear arsenals of nuclear-weapon states are being enlarged and upgraded and arms control efforts have come to a halt. President Donald Trump’s recent announcement that the US will resume nuclear testing seems a response to Russia’s claim to have tested a long-range, nuclear-powered cruise missile. But it is a dangerous move that will further erode a fraying nonproliferation regime. In the annual resolution on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the UN General Assembly’s First Committee last week, the US was the only country to vote ‘no’ — for the first time. A newly published book by Serhii Plokhy is a timely assessment of the nuclear issue and why countries have sought the bomb. The Nuclear Age: An Epic Race for Arms, Power and Survival is a tour de force of the history of nuclear weapons development and the geopolitics behind it, focusing on what motivated countries to acquire them. It is a cautionary tale about the perils of weapons that can annihilate all humanity. Plokhy writes that since the American acquisition of the bomb, the nuclear arms race never really ceased except in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the US and Soviet Union agreed on disarmament measures and several countries were persuaded or forced to give up their nuclear programmes. That lull ended in 1998 with nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan. Israel acquired a nuclear weapons capability decades earlier, in the late 1960s/ early ’70s with significant French and some British help. By 2006, North Korea also joined the nuclear club. Meanwhile, Iran continued its nuclear programme. If fear is a key motivation to go nuclear more countries may be encouraged by today’s turbulent world. With nuclear-weapon states upgrading their arsenals and no arms limitation efforts to restrain them, Plokhy argues the world is in a more dangerous place than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis because an uncontrolled arms race raises the chances of nuclear war, by accident or otherwise. He says a new threat emerged with Russia’s attack on Ukraine’s nuclear installations and Russian leaders threatening to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state. Although he doesn’t mention this, Israel and America’s attack on Iran’s nuclear sites takes that threat to another level. Plokhy is concerned with drawing lessons from the first nuclear arms race that can help stop or control the next one. The crux of his book lies in assessing why some countries built the bomb while others gave up trying to acquire one. This is a question long discussed in the rich literature on the subject with motivating factors ascribed to prestige, security, power projection, domestic politics and leaders’ ambitions. Plokhy’s core argument is that whatever the combination of motives, the fear factor is decisive — “fear of nuclear attack by another state or of superior conventional forces possessed by an adversary”. Thus states’ “concerns about their security, represented by the emotion of fear, is paramount for understanding why they go nuclear”. Fear, he says, can generate different reactions, some irrational, others grounded in actual security threats. Fear has produced paradoxical effects in nuclear history, both fuelling the arms race and making it more manageable and predictable. Fear of the nuclear balance of terror among adversaries led to arms control and reduction agreements during the Cold War. What worries the author is that in today’s unregulated global nuclear environment, fear can ignite a more dangerous phase of the arms race. He offers prudent advice. “We have to relearn how to manage our fear, recall how dangerous nuclear brinkmanship can be and recognise how important it is not to become a victim of nuclear blackmail and encourage the adventurism of nuclear rivals.” What about the factors behind South Asia’s nuclear trajectory? Pakistan’s pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability was unambiguously security-driven. Two key developments shaped the decision. First, the Indian intervention in Pakistan’s dismemberment and military defeat in 1971. The second turning point was India’s 1974 nuclear explosion. The never-again thinking that followed 1971 — and fear of more Indian aggression — led to the strategic conclusion that Pakistan could only rely on itself for its security. Feroze Khan, author of the seminal book about Pakistan’s nuclear quest, Eating Grass , explains that “Pakistan’s humiliation [in 1971] laid the foundation for a shift in the once peaceful nature of the nuclear programme” to one aimed at acquiring the bomb. India’s motivation to go nuclear was driven less by security and more by its quest for great-power status and prestige, as George Perkovich and others have also pointed out. Khan says it was also about competition with China, which motivated both India’s 1974 and 1998 tests. The 1962 Sino-Indian conflict acted as added incentive. Given the current global turbulence and surge in regional rivalries, Plokhy’s book ends with a stark warning. The world may see 40 additional nuclear-armed countries which would dramatically increase the threat of intentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons. A sobering thought for a deeply troubled world. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN. Published in Dawn, November 3rd, 2025",

With regard to the possible deployment of Pakistani troops as part of the International Stabilisation Force in occupied Gaza, mixed messages from official quarters have added to the confusion, and allowed inimical actors to manufacture unverified claims regarding this country’s future role in the Strip. Take the case of comments reportedly made by Parliamentary Secretary for Information and Broadcasting Danyal Chaudhry. Talking to a local TV channel, Mr Chaudhry said Pakistan’s role in Gaza would be to ensure “there is no extremism” or cross-border attacks. By this, we assume he means no more attacks from occupied Palestinian territory into Israel. Asked if the foreign troops’ mission would include the disarmament of Hamas, he replied: “absolutely”. The remarks have drawn criticism from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who questioned the statements his colleague made. Indeed, Mr Chaudhry’s troubling comments seem to suggest that Pakistan is considering the Gaza mission not to protect the Strip’s Palestinian population and ensure rehabilitation and reconstruction, but to enforce the US-Israeli plan for the territory. We hope this is not the case. But it is a fact that hostile actors are using such unguarded comments to construct dubious narratives. For example, an Indian TV channel had reported that Pakistan had removed the restriction that the green passport was valid for all countries except Israel, along with specifying the number of troops this country had allegedly committed to the Gaza mission. The information ministry said these foreign reports were fabricated. However, unless there is a coherent, unified official narrative, conspiracy theories and half-truths will spread regarding Pakistan’s role due to the state’s confused messaging. To prevent the spread of inaccuracies regarding Pakistan’s role, only the Foreign Office should be mandated to speak on the Palestine issue and other matters of import in global affairs. This would eliminate chances of contradictory messages being issued by officials. Regarding the actual mission in Gaza, there needs to be a parliamentary debate to bring clarity to the matter. Pakistani officials have repeatedly said the national policy on Palestine remains unchanged, and that this country stands with the Palestinian people. The message should be amplified by parliament, with a clear mandate regarding what role, if any, Pakistan forces will play in Gaza. If the aim is to protect Palestinian civilians from Israeli brutality, bring in aid and help rebuild the devastated Strip, then Pakistan can consider participation. However, if there are some other considerations, such as enforcing American and Israeli plans to dismantle the Palestinian resistance, and relegating the question of an independent Palestinian state to the back-burner, Pakistan should stay away from such schemes.

US President Donald Trump has said the strikes obliterated Iran’s nuclear programme, but the full extent of the actual damage remains unknown. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a visit to the country’s nuclear organisation, said Tehran “will build (the destroyed sites) stronger than before”. “By destroying buildings… we will not be set back,” he said in a video posted to his official website, adding that Iranian scientists still had the necessary nuclear know-how. Pezeshkian did not elaborate. In similar remarks in February before the strikes, he said Tehran would rebuild its sites if they came under attack. Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran in June, kicking off a 12-day war that saw it target nuclear and military facilities — as well as residential areas — and kill many top scientists. Iran retaliated with ballistic missile barrages aimed at Israeli cities. Iranian Foreign Mini­ster Abbas Araghchi said in July, after the United States announced a halt in fighting, that the damage in Iran was “serious and severe”. Pezeshkian’s comments came as Oman, Iran’s traditional intermediary, urged the two countries on Saturday to resume talks. “We want to return to the negotiations between Iran [and] the United Sta­tes,” Omani Foreign Mini­ster Badr Albusaidi said at the IISS Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain. Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said Sunday that Tehran “has received messages” on resuming diplomacy, without providing further details. Oman hosted five rounds of US-Iran talks this year. Just three days before the sixth round, Israel launched its strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities. Iran has since faced the return of UN sanctions after Britain, Germany and France triggered the “snapback” mechanism over Tehran’s alleged non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.

      "summary_orig": "• Fawad claims over a dozen lawmakers agree with him on need to ‘open channel with govt’; concedes he ‘doesn’t represent PTI’ • Qaiser says party ‘willing to talk to anyone’ if fair polls assured • Ismail says no ‘minus-Imran formula’ LAHORE/ISLAM­ABAD: Even as its founder remains locked up, and the party continues to lose ground, some former PTI members seem to have taken it upon themselves to end the isolation faced by their erstwhile party, proposing talks with the government and other parties to bring down political temperatures and pave the way for Imran Khan’s release. Only a day ago, a number of ex-PTI leaders, including former information minister Fawad Chaudhry and ex-Sindh governor Imran Ismail, had called on party vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a Lahore hospital, ostensibly to seek his blessing for their campaign — an offer Mr Qureshi did not endorse, as per his lawyer. On Sunday, Mr Chaudhry doubled down on his quest to revive the fortunes of the PTI, even as senior party leaders like Asad Qaiser maintained that both the party and its founder “will not compromise on their principles” even if they engage in a dialogue. Speaking to Dawn , Fawad Chaudhry acknowledged that he and his colleagues did not have a mandate to engage with the government on behalf of the PTI. However, as a concerned citizen, he said he wanted the volatile political climate to stabilise. According to the ex-PTI leader, his group will meet the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman next week to ask them to play a role in defusing political tensions. He claimed that most seasoned PTI politicians and more than 15 MPAs had approached him to express their agreement that a government-PTI engagement was “highly necessary”. He urged the government to take the first step towards de-escalation by offering relief to imprisoned senior PTI leaders. “If the government gives relief to the incarcerated Lahore and Gujranwala leaders, then these leaders could engage with the jailed Khan and lead a process of engagement,” he explained. “Imran Khan’s mandate is with the party leaders, who have been in jails for the past two years,” he acknowledged, referring to people like Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Dr Yasmin Rashid. “If the government does not leave any stake for the opposition in the system, the opposition will be left with no option but to hold long marches, resign from assemblies and resort to other modes of protest,” he rued. It may be noted that the government and opposition held a series of talks in the recent past, which did not prove fruitful. “Until the three major players —Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari – and the establishment engage with the incarcerated seasoned politicians, no political engagement will be possible in a volatile situation,” he added. Speaking about his “meeting” with Mr Qureshi and Ejaz Chaudhry, he said he planned to take these leaders on board in light of their letters from jail in which they had urged the party chief for dialogue to break the political deadlock. The incarcerated leaders had written a letter to their jailed chief to consider a dialogue with other political parties instead of insisting on only talking to the military establishment. Downplaying overtures On the other hand, former NA speaker and PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser played down the recent overtures by his former party colleagues, saying they would be prepared to talk only if the “stolen mandate” was returned to the “true representatives”. “The fact is that we have been suggesting for years that the PTI is ready to talk to everyone only if justice is provided to the party without creating any hurdles,” Mr Qaiser told Dawn . “We just want the court cases to be decided on merit. We are willing to talk with anyone about deciding the modalities of the next election and assurances that the next election will be free and fair,” he said. When asked if it was correct that some party leaders wanted to “streamline” the issues with the establishment, but were reluctant due to Imran Khan, Mr Qaiser said that some individuals may have their personal opinions, but it was not the party policy. “During party meetings, it is categorically stated that there will not be any compromise on principles,” he said. However, Fawad Chaudhry said the PTI leadership had failed to create any breakthrough to get Imran Khan out of jail during the past two years. He claimed that he had told Mr Khan that many politicians in the party had vested interests attached to his imprisonment and they would make no efforts to help him get out of jail. No ‘minus formula’ His colleague Imran Ismail dispelled the impression that they were working on a ‘minus Imran formula’ and termed their outreach campaign an “effort to move Pakistan’s politics away from confrontation”. “We privately consulted a number of PTI stalwarts. Almost all admitted that confrontation has failed and that reconciliation is the only way forward,” he said in a lengthy statement posted on X (formerly Twitter). “When we met Chaudhry Ejaz in Kot Lakhpat Jail and Shah Mehmood Qureshi at PKLI, both — while firmly standing with Khan — agreed that the stalemate must end. They sought normal political breathing space, not surrender,” he said. He said if any PTI leader believed that “continuing agitation and confrontation is the right path, he should come forward and convince the rest of us who think otherwise”.

      "summary_orig": "• Summit of Muslim bloc foreign ministers will ‘come down hard on Israel’ over ceasefire violations • Pakistan to demand complete Israeli withdrawal, unfettered provision of aid to Palestinians ISLAMABAD: Turkiye is expected to push for ensuring the security and administration of Gaza by Palestinians, as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar joins his counterparts from the eight-nation Muslim bloc, suing for peace in the besieged Palestinian territory, for a summit in Istanbul today (Monday). The Coordination Meeting of Arab-Islamic Foreign Ministers is expected to take up the Gaza ceasefire deal, piloted by US President Donald Trump. However, the truce, which left thorny issues like the disarmament of Hamas and a timeline for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza unresolved, has been tested by unilateral Israeli bombardment since coming into force. The Istanbul meeting is expected to bring together the foreign ministers of Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan — the same countries that met with US President Donald Trump on Sept 23, on the margins of the UN General Assembly. At the foreign ministers’ meeting, Turkiye’s Hakan Fidan is expected to “emphasise the importance of coordinated action by Muslim countries for the ceasefire to evolve into a lasting peace,” Reuters quoted a Turkish foreign ministry source as saying on Sunday. The source said Mr Fidan is set to tell the meeting that Israel is “making excuses” to end the ceasefire and emphasise the need for the international community to “take a resolute stance against Israel’s provocative actions”. He was also set to say that humanitarian aid entering Gaza is insufficient and Israel has not fulfilled its obligations in this regard. According to TRT World , Mr Fidan is anticipated to stress the need to swiftly implement arrangements that would allow Palestinians to assume responsibility for Gaza’s security and administration, while safeguarding their legitimate rights and upholding the vision of a two-state solution. He will also highlight the importance of maintaining consultations and close coordination on steps to be taken within UN platforms, the sources added. Relations between Turkiye and Israel have hit new lows during the Gaza war, with President Tayyip Erdogan harshly criticising Israel’s attacks. It was Turkiye that helped persuade Hamas to accept Trump’s peace plan, and Ankara has expressed willingness to take part in the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), proposed to monitor ceasefire implementation in Gaza. However, Israeli has made it clear that it won’t accept the presence of Turkish armed forces in Gaza. Other nations part of troop contribution talks include Jordan, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan. Top-level consultations are said to be underway over the question of sending Pakistani troops for the proposed ISF, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the United Nations umbrella. On Saturday, the Jordanian and German foreign ministers had called for a UN mandate for the proposed ISF, saying it would “need a clear basis in international law”. Pakistan’s stance During the Istanbul meeting, Pakistan will emphasise the need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza, as well as the provision of unfettered humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and the reconstruction of Gaza, a statement from the Foreign Office said. Pakistan has remained engaged with the peace initiative that led to the signing of the Gaza Peace Agreement in Sharm El-Sheikh, the FO said. “Pakistan will also reiterate the need for collective efforts aimed at achieving an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders, in accordance with relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative,” the FO added. Pakistan has been, and will continue to be, committed to efforts to restore peace, justice, and dignity to the Palestinian people, as well as to ensure the realisation of their right to self-determination, the statement said.

The call came as PM Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his government’s commitment to protecting press freedom and ensuring a safe environment for journalists. “There can be no real press freedom without accountability for attacks against members of the media,” PFUJ President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari said in a statement on the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists. They noted with concern that crimes against journalists had witnessed a sharp surge, jumping nearly 60pc over the past year, with 142 cases documented between Nov 2024 and Sept 2025. This creates “a climate of fear and intimidation that undermines press freedom and the public’s right to information,” the statement said, while demanding that the government ensure the safety and security of journalists; investigate and prosecute crimes against them in a timely manner’, ensure justice and reparations; and, create a safe and enabling environment for the press. In his message on #EndIm­punity day, PM Shehbaz paid tribute to all journalists who have endured hardships in the pursuit of truth and justice, and expressed solidarity with the families of those writers, journalists, and media workers who lost their lives in the line of duty. “We will take all necessary measures to guarantee effective investigation of crimes against jou­­rnalists, deliver justice, and ens­ure legal action against the perpetrators,” he further emphasised. He said a free, informed, and responsible press is vital to democracy, enabling public access to facts and truth. Acts of violence or threats against journalists, he noted, are attacks on freedom of expression. The prime minister also urged the global community, media organisations, and civil society to help protect journalists and uphold press freedom. ‘Attempt to muzzle dissent’ Meanwhile, pointing to recent reports indicating that Punjab and Islamabad had become the most dangerous places for journalists in the country, the opposition PTI described it as a deliberate and systematic campaign to muzzle dissent, criminalise journalism, and suppress the truth. PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram warned that the ongoing crackdown on journalists and the press represented “one of the most repressive chapters in Pakistan’s democratic history”. He said the alarming rise in attacks, arrests, and legal cases against journalists underlined the regime’s growing intolerance for truth. The PTI leader also expressed his anguish over the murder of senior journalist Arshad Sharif, whose killers remain unpunished, despite the lapse of several years.

      "title_orig": "Mamdani leads dramatic NY mayoral race going into voting day",
      "summary_orig": "New Yorkers will pick a new mayor on Tuesday after an unpredictable race that has drawn attention from far beyond the largest city in the United States, with President Donald Trump branding frontrunner Zohran Mamdani “a communist”. Breakout Democratic Party candidate Mamdani, a naturalised Muslim American who represents Queens in the state legislature, leads former governor and sex assault-accused Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing his party’s primary contest to Mamdani. The Republican party candidate polling in third place is Curtis Sliwa, 71, who has a colourful past as the founder of the Guardian Angels vigilante group, a prolific broadcaster and cat lover. The latest Quinnipiac University poll , conducted from October 23 to 27, gives Mamdani 43 per cent of the vote, followed by Cuomo on 33pc and Sliwa on 14 pc. The race has centred on the cost of living, crime and how each candidate would handle Trump, who has threatened to withhold federal funds from the city. “Mamdani is an unusual political figure and really captures the spirit of the moment. This is a moment where a loud anti-Trump voice in America’s biggest city is going to get news,” Lincoln Mitchell, a politics professor at Columbia University, told AFP . “Frankly, a Muslim candidate for mayor of New York is an enormous story.” Mamdani, 34, has attacked his opponents for Islamophobic rhetoric and smears, calling out both Republicans and Democrats for “anti-Muslim sentiment that has grown so endemic in our city”. New York City Board of Elections data showed 275,006 registered Democrats had cast ballots, as had 46,115 Republicans, along with 42,383 voters unaffiliated with any party in the first five days of early voting, which ends on November 2. Mamdani’s ascent has highlighted the gulf between the left and centre-right of the Democratic Party. New York’s state governor, centrist Kathy Hochul, appeared at a Mamdani rally on October 26 but was drowned out by “tax the rich” chants, an AFP correspondent saw. Hochul has been critical of Mamdani’s proposals to impose a 2pc income tax on New Yorkers making more than $1 million. Mamdani’s rise Mamdani’s unlikely ascent has been fueled by young New Yorkers canvassing for him, with his campaign claiming 90,000 people have volunteered. “It really comes back to people speaking to other New Yorkers about the city that we all love,” Mamdani told ‘The Daily Show’. Teenager Abid Mahdi, a Queens native who leads canvases for Mamdani, told AFP that “when I think of Zohran, I think of what Bernie Sanders was to many Americans in 2016 and 2020. He is my Bernie Sanders in a lot of ways.” Mamdani appeared with leftist standard-bearer Senator Bernie Sanders at a Queens rally on October 26. “I’m 15 right now, I’ll be an adult and paying taxes at 18, right? The majority of laws will apply to me in about three years. So, why should I start caring then?” added Mahdi. Underscoring the importance of older voters who typically turn out in greater numbers than youngsters, Mamdani attended a “paint and pour” session at an elder care home in Brooklyn on Thursday. Torrential rain at the end of the week slowed canvassing, with the three leading candidates touring TV studios in a final push to woo wavering voters. Ahead of the vote, Sliwa appeared in a surreal conservative rap video wearing a suit and his signature red beret. Cuomo, 67, sought on Thursday to court Black and Muslim voters, campaigning in Harlem with current mayor Eric Adams, a corruption-accused Democrat who bowed out, eventually endorsing his former foe Cuomo. There was a stir in the week when a British newspaper published what claimed to be an interview with former mayor and Mamdani backer Bill de Blasio in which he appeared to question the affordability of the Democratic socialist’s spending plans. The article was removed after the former mayor denied speaking to the journalist. A day prior, former Democrat president Barack Obama called Mamdani and offered to be a sounding board if the frontrunner wins the election. He also praised Mamdani’s campaign. The call, first reported by The New York Times , was confirmed by Mamdani’s spokesperson. “Zohran Mamdani appreciated President Obama’s words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city, said Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday said the government would take steps to ensure effective investigation, justice, and prosecution in cases of crimes against journalists. His remarks came on the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. The day, observed on November 2, highlights the need for justice in cases where journalists are attacked or killed. This year’s observance draws attention to the online threats faced by women journalists and the broader chilling impact these have on freedom of expression. “Today reminds us that a free, informed, and responsible press is the foundation of any democratic society,” the prime minister said in a statement. “Journalists enable public access to facts and are torchbearers of truth. Violence, threats, or reprisals against them while performing their duties are attacks on freedom of expression. “I pay tribute to journalists who faced hardships for truth and solidarity with families of media workers who lost loved ones in the line of duty.” He added that the Government of Pakistan was committed to protecting press freedom and providing a safe environment for journalists. “We will take measures to ensure effective investigation, justice, and prosecution of crimes against journalists. “I appeal to the international community, media organisations, and civil society to play their role in protecting journalists and promoting freedom of expression. A free press guarantees a strong, transparent, and democratic Pakistan.” Pakistan is consistently ranked as one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists due to frequent threats, physical attacks, and a pervasive culture of impunity for perpetrators. In the 2025 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Pakistan was ranked 158th out of 180 countries. A day prior, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) condemned the worsening situation for media professionals in Pakistan. A delegation from the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) held talks with IFJ President Dominique Pradalié and Secretary General Anthony Bellanger at the Syndicat National des Journalistes (SNJ) headquarters in Paris, according to a statement issued from Islamabad on Saturday. “The IFJ leaders expressed deep concern over targeted killings of journalists, misuse of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) to file cases against media workers, undeclared censorship, harassment by state and non-state actors, forced layoffs, and non-payment of salaries,” the statement said. “They urged Pakistan’s president, prime minister, and top judge to take immediate notice, warning that inaction could prompt an appeal to the United Nations for intervention.” During the meeting, the PFUJ delegation, including Secretary General Shakeel Ahmed, Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists President Tariq Usmani, and Foreign Committee Head Waseem Shahzad Qadri, briefed the IFJ leaders on ground realities.",
