      "summary_orig": "The PTI on Tuesday again raised concerns about the health of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, saying it had learned through credible reports that the ex-premier was suffering from an ailment that could cause permanent damage to his eyesight if not treated promptly. In a statement released on the social media platform X, the party demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and associates. It also demanded that he be allowed medical treatment at a hospital of his own choice. The statement said the party had learnt through credible media reports that Imran had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, “resulting in a dangerous blockage in the retinal vein”. “According to medical experts who reportedly checked him in jail, this is an extremely sensitive and serious medical condition which, if not treated promptly and properly, carries a high risk of permanent damage to his eyesight,” the party said. “Despite this, the jail administration is stubbornly insisting that the treatment be carried out inside the jail, while the attending specialist doctor has clearly stated that such treatment is not possible in jail and that it requires an operation theatre and specialized medical facilities,” the party said, adding that this “reckless attitude” put Imran’s vision and his overall health in grave danger. It said that Imran was last granted access to his personal physician in October 2024, who had not been allowed to examine him since then, despite order issued by the Islamabad High Court. “This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights. Moreover, a petition regarding Imran Khan’s regular medical check-ups has been pending since August 2025, which is being deliberately ignored. The government’s conduct clearly demonstrates that, in its obsession with political vendetta, it is willing to gamble with the life and health of a prisoner,” the party said. It demanded that Imran be immediately allowed an unrestricted meeting with his family and close associates so that the “public may be reassured about his condition”. “We also demand that he be allowed without delay to Shaukat Khanum Hospital or to any other reputable hospital of his own choice, where he can receive proper treatment under the supervision of qualified specialists with full medical facilities. We strongly appeal to the judiciary to treat this as a matter of health and human life, not politics, and to ensure that no negligence or delay is allowed in his medical care,” it said. The statement said that if there was permanent damage to Imran’s eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be responsible as they were “obstructing his treatment despite clear medical advice and court orders”. Shaukat Khanum Hospital, which was established by Imran, also issued a statement, saying it was “gravely concerned” about the ex-premier’s health. “While we have every confidence in the abilities and professionalism of the physicians currently looking after him, we nevertheless request that a team of physicians from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be given immediate access to Khan sahib and be allowed to participate in his care so as to reassure all those who are concerned for his welfare,” the statement said. PTI MNAs file fresh plea for meeting Imran Separately, PTI MNA arrives at the IHC to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, along with MNAs Ali Muhammad Khan, Shehryar Afridi, Salman Akram Raja, Aamir Dogar, Ali Asghar Khan and Shahzada Gustasp, among others, appeared at the IHC court premises and completed the biometric verification to submit their application. Speaking to the media outside the IHC, Gohar said that Tuesdays were the designated day for meetings with Imran. He said that the party leadership had approached the IHC chief justice multiple times but had not been granted a meeting. He added that a letter signed by PTI MNAs was being submitted to the IHC chief justice, requesting that meetings with the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi be scheduled in accordance with the law and court orders. The PTI chairman also expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi stressing that meeting a prisoner was a fundamental legal right and should not be politicised. Gohar reiterated that PTI’s mandate had been “robbed” and reiterated the opposition’s nationwide protest call for February 8, including a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike, calling on shopkeepers and transporters to participate. PTI Secretary General Raja said that the youth’s right to vote had been snatched. He called for a peaceful protest and expressed concern over reports that Imran was suffering from an eye problem. He added that the party would raise these concerns with the IHC chief justice. Separately, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka extended interim bail to Imran in five additional cases related to May 9 and to Bushra Bibi in a fake receipts case related to the Toshakhana. The PTI founder could not be presented before the court, either physically or via video link, due to which arguments could not be concluded. The court ordered that he be presented at the next hearing and extended interim bail until February 6.",

      "title_orig": "No question of military operation in Tirah: defence minister",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Tuesday that there was no question of a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley, whose residents have been vacating their houses in recent days amid concerns about a military action against terrorists. Asif made these remarks during a press conference in Islamabad, where he was flanked by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Information and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan. The press conference was held two days after the federal and provincial governments traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process. The evacuations, which were carried out in line with a plan agreed upon by all stakeholders — including local elders, the provincial government and the military — seem to have become a bone of contention after the displaced populace found themselves stranded in cold weather under open skies, with mismanagement by the authorities only adding to their troubles. At the outset of the press conference, he said members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan had been residing in Tirah with their families. “They are around 400-500 in number,” he said. The defence minister further stated that the provincial government had approved a package of Rs4 billion for the people of Tirah Valley, who were to migrate. “The armed forces deployed in that area have nothing to do with it. This is an arrangement between the jirga and the provincial government, and as a result of that, this notification was issued,” he added, holding up a notification that he said was issued by the KP government. On Sunday, a statement by the information ministry also referred to the same notification by the KP Relief, Rehabilitation and Resettlement department for the release of funds, reportedly Rs4 billion, for the anticipated temporary and voluntary movement of the population from certain localities of Tirah (Bagh). These funds were seemingly required for relief-related arrangements for those leaving Tirah. The statement also asserted that the armed forces or the federal government had not issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Tirah. It claimed that the federal government and the armed forces did not ask anyone to leave their homes for an operation, adding that intelligence-based operations (IBO) being conducted by the forces in the area did not require “de-population or migration”. During the press conference, Asif also said that a military operation in the area had been carried out years ago. “And it was strategically decided then that IBOs are way more effective than operations; the collateral damage is way less. So, the armed forces have not carried out an operation since years in favour of the IBOs,” he said. The minister added, “This is why this practice has been ongoing there for many years, and that is why there is no question of any operation there.” Moreover, the minister continued, migration in the valley was a routine practice. He also criticised the KP government’s performance, highlighting a lack of hospitals, schools and police stations in the valley. “Even though, it had been agreed between the provincial government and the jirga that hospitals, police stations and girls’ schools will be established there.” The minister claimed that there was a “complete absence of civilian law enforcement agencies” in Tirah. “There is no police station there,” he added. Asif further stated that hemp was being harvested in Tirah over 12,000 acres. Hemp harvested over each acre gave a profit of around Rs3-3.5 million, he said, adding that “this is a major factor” in this matter. He said that hemp had several uses, including in medicines, construction material and bricks. “Hemp is harvested there and dividends earned from it either go to the people associated with politics or the TTP. We have initiated measures to stop this, so that [Tirah’s] people benefit from this harvest, and schools and hospitals are constructed there,” Asif added. He went on to allege that the interests of the provincial government aligned with that of the TTP in Tirah, “as they are together exploiting this source (hemp)”. The minister recalled that the jirga in Tirah had held meetings on December 11, 21 and 31 last year on the matter. “It has been meeting the civilian government. You don’t see the military anywhere in this [matter]. And this jirga was constituted many years ago […] And all 24 members of the jirga are onboard. All the things that I have listed that are required there [Tirah], it is their (jirga) demand. Now, in the presence of jirga and this notification, where do you see the military’s [involvement] in this?” Asif said. He alleged that the KP government wanted to deflect the blame for its “failures” to the military or an operation that did not even exist. Then, ostensibly referring to the movement of people of in Tirah, he maintained that this “tradition has been in place for decades” due to the climate and topography of the area. It was even mentioned in a gazette from the Bristish era, he added. “This transition takes place every year.” “This is nothing unusual, but the PTI government has tried to make it [appear] unusual,” he said. Moreover, the KP government had claimed spending Rs2-4bn on setting up camps for the evacuated residents, he said, alleging that those camps did not provide protection from the cold. He again asserted that the military presence or an operation in Tirah was an “assumption”. “No operation has been carried out there for years,” he maintained. He added that if the KP government wanted to work for the betterment of the people of Tirah, the federal government would provide it the wherewithal needed for that purpose. Speaking after him, Information Tarar said it was stated in the official gazetteer in the 1880s that the Afridi and Akakhel tribes of Khyber descend and migrate to other areas in winters and return to Tirah in summers. “This is an established fact,” he insisted. For his part, PM’s aide Wali said it needed to be found out that what amount from the Rs4bn package approved by the provincial government had reached the people who had been “forced to relocate”. “Because the PTI has been in power [in KP] for 13 years, and we know them. They create such programmes and use these funds for campaigns such as street movements,” he alleged. Wali further highlighted that the KP government’s notification that the movement of people from Tirah would be “voluntary”. “This proves my points that a project was created to mint money,” he argued, adding that the armed forces had nothing to do with the movement of people in Tirah, “you call it depopulation or forced relocation”. The PM’s said that to his understanding, that the people of Tirah would be used to ensure the success of the opposition’s protest on February 8. Following that, a journalist sought confirmation of the number of people who had left Tirah, saying that international media reported that 65 per cent had vacated their houses. To that, Asif said “people escape the snow in the area and relocate. And it more or less 65pc people migrate […] There is historical evidence of this. And this will continue to happen in the future as well”. He said that this matter had been “politicised”, asserting that an impression had been created as if “forced relocation” had been taking place in Tirah. “And it is being linked to us. Even if forced [relocation] is taking place, it is between the provincial government that population. We or the military has nothing to do with it. “The military has been carrying out IBOs there and will continue to do so. As I said, there are around 500 TTP members there […] The military conducts IBOs and weed them out,” he said. When asked about KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s claim that he had not been involved in talks with tribal elders from Tirah, Asif said: “This is his and his government’s problem. The talks were held with his government, and if he was not in the loop, that is not my problem or the problem of the federal government.” He also alleged that some TTP militants had been paying extortion money to some individuals in the KP government. In reply to another question, he clarified that no operation was being carried out in Tirah. The minister was also whether the option of reversing the decision to merge erstwhile tribal areas with KP was being considered in a potential “next amendment”. Asif said no such proposal was being considered. When asked who formed the jirga that held talks regarding the evacuation of people from Tirah, Asif insisted that it was the provincial government.

      "summary_en": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Tuesday that there was no question of a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley, whose residents have been vacating their houses in recent days amid concerns about a military action against terrorists. Asif made these remarks during a press conference in Islamabad, where he was flanked by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Information and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan. The press conference was held two days after the federal and provincial governments traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process. The evacuations, which were carried out in line with a plan agreed upon by all stakeholders — including local elders, the provincial government and the military — seem to have become a bone of contention after the displaced populace found themselves stranded in cold weather under open skies, with mismanagement by the authorities only adding to their troubles. At the outset of the press conference, he said members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan had been residing in Tirah with their families. “They are around 400-500 in number,” he said. The defence minister further stated that the provincial government had approved a package of Rs4 billion for the people of Tirah Valley, who were to migrate. “The armed forces deployed in that area have nothing to do with it. This is an arrangement between the jirga and the provincial government, and as a result of that, this notification was issued,” he added, holding up a notification that he said was issued by the KP government. On Sunday, a statement by the information ministry also referred to the same notification by the KP Relief, Rehabilitation and Resettlement department for the release of funds, reportedly Rs4 billion, for the anticipated temporary and voluntary movement of the population from certain localities of Tirah (Bagh). These funds were seemingly required for relief-related arrangements for those leaving Tirah. The statement also asserted that the armed forces or the federal government had not issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Tirah. It claimed that the federal government and the armed forces did not ask anyone to leave their homes for an operation, adding that intelligence-based operations (IBO) being conducted by the forces in the area did not require “de-population or migration”. During the press conference, Asif also said that a military operation in the area had been carried out years ago. “And it was strategically decided then that IBOs are way more effective than operations; the collateral damage is way less. So, the armed forces have not carried out an operation since years in favour of the IBOs,” he said. The minister added, “This is why this practice has been ongoing there for many years, and that is why there is no question of any operation there.” Moreover, the minister continued, migration in the valley was a routine practice. He also criticised the KP government’s performance, highlighting a lack of hospitals, schools and police stations in the valley. “Even though, it had been agreed between the provincial government and the jirga that hospitals, police stations and girls’ schools will be established there.” The minister claimed that there was a “complete absence of civilian law enforcement agencies” in Tirah. “There is no police station there,” he added. Asif further stated that hemp was being harvested in Tirah over 12,000 acres. Hemp harvested over each acre gave a profit of around Rs3-3.5 million, he said, adding that “this is a major factor” in this matter. He said that hemp had several uses, including in medicines, construction material and bricks. “Hemp is harvested there and dividends earned from it either go to the people associated with politics or the TTP. We have initiated measures to stop this, so that [Tirah’s] people benefit from this harvest, and schools and hospitals are constructed there,” Asif added. He went on to allege that the interests of the provincial government aligned with that of the TTP in Tirah, “as they are together exploiting this source (hemp)”. The minister recalled that the jirga in Tirah had held meetings on December 11, 21 and 31 last year on the matter. “It has been meeting the civilian government. You don’t see the military anywhere in this [matter]. And this jirga was constituted many years ago […] And all 24 members of the jirga are onboard. All the things that I have listed that are required there [Tirah], it is their (jirga) demand. Now, in the presence of jirga and this notification, where do you see the military’s [involvement] in this?” Asif said. He alleged that the KP government wanted to deflect the blame for its “failures” to the military or an operation that did not even exist. Then, ostensibly referring to the movement of people of in Tirah, he maintained that this “tradition has been in place for decades” due to the climate and topography of the area.

      "summary_orig": "The Sindh government on Tuesday denied claims made by factions of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) that the provincial administration has withdrawn personnel deployed for the latter’s security. The MQM-Pakistan (MQM-P) and the PPP have been engaged in a war of words since the Gul Plaza inferno, trading blame over improper governance during the tenure of their respective party mayors. Speaking to Geo News earlier today, MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal replied in the affirmative when asked whether he was among the MQM leaders whose security protocol had reportedly been withdrawn by the Sindh government. The MQM-P leader, who also serves as the federal health minister, insisted that the action was “in response” to his party’s criticism of the Sindh government and to “scare them”. Instead, Kamal argued, the provincial government’s alleged action supported the MQM-P’s stance that Karachi be “taken in the Centre’s control”. “Karachi should not be in control of an incompetent provincial government like Sindh’s,” he said, adding the Sindh government could not “suppress our voices” by taking these measures. He went on to say that the provision of security did not matter to them. However, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon and Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar rejected the MQM-P’s claims, with the latter stating that no security granted to any political figure has been revoked. The MQM-Haqiqi (MQM-H) had also said the Sindh government has withdrawn security from party chairman Afaq Ahmed. In a statement, MQM-H Vice Chairman Shaukat Farooqi condemned the alleged move, saying it indicated that the PPP was afraid of Ahmed. ‘Sindh govt stepping back from responsibility’ Addressing a press conference in Karachi after the Sindh government’s denial, MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said, “You withdrew security. Even if some individuals’ security was restored, then also restore whatever little security you had given as a formality to our MNAs and MPAs.” Stressing that it was the Sindh government’s responsibility to provide security, Sattar said, “If you would not provide, then we will ask the Islamabad police and the prime minister to send their police. “And then gradually make this a federal territory,” he added, reiterating his party’s demand. The MQM-P leader contended that by revoking the security of “all” its MNAs and MPAs, including party convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, the Sindh government was distancing itself from its duties. He stressed that it was the Sindh Police that had alerted them about a threat to their lives, and the same provincial government was stepping back from the responsibility to guarantee their security. “Then this means someone will have to take responsibility. Should we then ask Islamabad Police to provide us security?” Sattar said. ‘Those entitled have security’ In a statement, the Sindh home minister clarified that security has not been withdrawn from any MQM leaders. He stated that Kamal, the federal health minister, and Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui were currently in Islamabad, adding that no security granted to any political figure has been revoked. Lanjar added that security arrangements for political leaders, including those from the MQM, will continue unchanged. Speaking to reporters later in the day, the Sindh senior minister also dismissed the MQM-P’s claims. “The home minister has categorically told the media that no security has been withdrawn from MQM,” Memon asserted, saying that the party was engaged in “propaganda” and a “campaign”. The minister clarified that even Sindh Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi still has the security allotted to him. “Whoever is entitled to it, they all have security,” Memon said, adding that those not entitled, needed to submit a request to the government along with their reasons. “Federal ministers in Islamabad roam around with a single police official. Here, they have been allotted 10 police personnel each. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui has 10 police officers; Mustafa Kamal may have more than that.” He also noted that MQM-P leaders who were federal ministers — namely Kamal and Siddiqui — were in Islamabad as per his reports. “So, did you have to take the security along with you?” he asked rhetorically. Earlier in the day, Sindh government spokesperson MPA Sadia Javed told Geo News that she was unaware of any such move to withdraw security, adding that it might have been done due to “shortage of police”. Replying to a question on the disruption of proceedings in the Sindh Assembly, which witnessed a protest on Monday and slogans on Tuesday as well, Memon said protesting was the right of everyone in a democracy. “Opposition can protest, if they want,” he told reporters. Memon raised multiple questions, asking why the MQM-P did not protest after the May 12, 2007 mayhem , the Bolton market blaze and the Baldia factory tragedy . The Sindh senior minister stated: We are not saying them [MQM-P] not to [protest] .. it. We are democratic people. Everything that comes under democracy is allowed. “However, if they opt for undemocratic practices, the government will not sit idle,” he added, calling for the protests to be “peaceful”. “We will support them. However, if they opt for old tactics of … [forcefully] closing shops, … shooting in the city, this time our mood is different,” he said, adding that the government would prioritise the public’s safety if the MQM-P attempted to stage a strike or engage in arson or vandalism. “When this incident (Gul Plaza fire) occurred, everyone was teary-eyed … but the attitude of certain parties … the bodies were not even recovered and calls were made to roll back the 18th Amendment and hand over Karachi to the Centre,” Memon said. In the wake of the Gul Plaza inferno, which has claimed at least 73 lives , the MQM-P demanded that Karachi be made a “federal territory” by making it the country’s “financial capital”. It also assailed the 18th Amendment, which devolved certain ministries to the provinces from the Centre, and claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage” of it. In response, the PPP has assailed the MQM-P for “ politicising ” the Gul Plaza fire. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah detailed the shopping centre’s history, noting former mayors had approved leases to regularise building violations.",

Instead, Kamal argued, the provincial government’s alleged action supported the MQM-P’s stance that Karachi be “taken in the Centre’s control”. “Karachi should not be in control of an incompetent provincial government like Sindh’s,” he said, adding the Sindh government could not “suppress our voices” by taking these measures. He went on to say that the provision of security did not matter to them. However, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon and Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar rejected the MQM-P’s claims, with the latter stating that no security granted to any political figure has been revoked. The MQM-Haqiqi (MQM-H) had also said the Sindh government has withdrawn security from party chairman Afaq Ahmed. In a statement, MQM-H Vice Chairman Shaukat Farooqi condemned the alleged move, saying it indicated that the PPP was afraid of Ahmed. ‘Sindh govt stepping back from responsibility’ Addressing a press conference in Karachi after the Sindh government’s denial, MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said, “You withdrew security. Even if some individuals’ security was restored, then also restore whatever little security you had given as a formality to our MNAs and MPAs.” Stressing that it was the Sindh government’s responsibility to provide security, Sattar said, “If you would not provide, then we will ask the Islamabad police and the prime minister to send their police. “And then gradually make this a federal territory,” he added, reiterating his party’s demand. The MQM-P leader contended that by revoking the security of “all” its MNAs and MPAs, including party convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, the Sindh government was distancing itself from its duties. He stressed that it was the Sindh Police that had alerted them about a threat to their lives, and the same provincial government was stepping back from the responsibility to guarantee their security. “Then this means someone will have to take responsibility. Should we then ask Islamabad Police to provide us security?” Sattar said. ‘Those entitled have security’ In a statement, the Sindh home minister clarified that security has not been withdrawn from any MQM leaders. He stated that Kamal, the federal health minister, and Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui were currently in Islamabad, adding that no security granted to any political figure has been revoked. Lanjar added that security arrangements for political leaders, including those from the MQM, will continue unchanged. Speaking to reporters later in the day, the Sindh senior minister also dismissed the MQM-P’s claims. “The home minister has categorically told the media that no security has been withdrawn from MQM,” Memon asserted, saying that the party was engaged in “propaganda” and a “campaign”. The minister clarified that even Sindh Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi still has the security allotted to him. “Whoever is entitled to it, they all have security,” Memon said, adding that those not entitled, needed to submit a request to the government along with their reasons. “Federal ministers in Islamabad roam around with a single police official. Here, they have been allotted 10 police personnel each. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui has 10 police officers; Mustafa Kamal may have more than that.” He also noted that MQM-P leaders who were federal ministers — namely Kamal and Siddiqui — were in Islamabad as per his reports. “So, did you have to take the security along with you?” he asked rhetorically. Earlier in the day, Sindh government spokesperson MPA Sadia Javed told Geo News that she was unaware of any such move to withdraw security, adding that it might have been done due to “shortage of police”. Replying to a question on the disruption of proceedings in the Sindh Assembly, which witnessed a protest on Monday and slogans on Tuesday as well, Memon said protesting was the right of everyone in a democracy. “Opposition can protest, if they want,” he told reporters. Memon raised multiple questions, asking why the MQM-P did not protest after the May 12, 2007 mayhem , the Bolton market blaze and the Baldia factory tragedy . The Sindh senior minister stated: We are not saying them [MQM-P] not to [protest] .. it. We are democratic people. Everything that comes under democracy is allowed. “However, if they opt for undemocratic practices, the government will not sit idle,” he added, calling for the protests to be “peaceful”. “We will support them. However, if they opt for old tactics of … [forcefully] closing shops, … shooting in the city, this time our mood is different,” he said, adding that the government would prioritise the public’s safety if the MQM-P attempted to stage a strike or engage in arson or vandalism. “When this incident (Gul Plaza fire) occurred, everyone was teary-eyed … but the attitude of certain parties … the bodies were not even recovered and calls were made to roll back the 18th Amendment and hand over Karachi to the Centre,” Memon said. In the wake of the Gul Plaza inferno, which has claimed at least 73 lives , the MQM-P demanded that Karachi be made a “federal territory” by making it the country’s “financial capital”. It also assailed the 18th Amendment, which devolved certain ministries to the provinces from the Centre, and claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage” of it. In response, the PPP has assailed the MQM-P for “ politicising ” the Gul Plaza fire. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah detailed the shopping centre’s history, noting former mayors had approved leases to regularise building violations.",

      "title_orig": "In landmark ruling, Federal Constitutional Court upholds super tax",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Accepting the authority of Parliament to legislate on imposing taxes, the Federal Constitution Court (FCC) on Tuesday — in a landmark ruling with far-reaching constitutional and fiscal implications — upheld the vires of the super tax. This means that means Section 4-B and the 4-C of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001 will be applicable from the dates these were levied as per the prescribed rates. A three-member bench, headed by FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan and also including Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah, announced the much-anticipated short order. The short order was announced in the afternoon after a brief hearing in the morning, when the FCC reserved its ruling with an observation that the verdict would be issued today. The detailed judgment will follow later. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar, who was representing the Revenue Division secretary, said the FCC decided over 2,200 long-pending tax cases concerning Sections 4-B and 4-C of the ITO, thus safeguarding an estimated Rs310 billion in public revenue. These cases were transferred to the FCC after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Different appeals were instituted against the judgments of the Sindh , Lahore and Islamabad high courts regarding the levy of super tax through Section 4-B and 4-C of the ordinance. Different businesspersons, banks, and companies had challenged the imposition of the super tax in high courts, arguing against its retrospective imposition, saying it amounted to double taxation. The tax was initially imposed by the PML-N government in 2015 as a one-time measure under a money bill, with the stated purpose of rehabilitating areas affected during Operation Zarb-i-Azb against terrorists. Previously, an additional 5pc super tax was levied on annual profits exceeding Rs300m. But in 2022, the super tax was applied to individuals earning over Rs150m annually, with a maximum rate of 10pc. It levies a tax rate of 4pc on the income of banking companies and 3pc on other sectors, aimed at funding the rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons. The cases arose from tax levies under Sections 4-B (super tax for rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons) and 4-C (super tax on high-earning persons). While Section 4-B had largely been upheld, Section 4-C had been read down or struck down in some high court rulings on grounds of alleged retrospectivity, discrimination, irrationality of tax slabs, double taxation, and inequity. Following the 27th Constitutional Amendment, the case was transferred to the FCC after 71 hearings in the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, the FCC declared the provisions intra vires the Constitution, reaffirmed Parliament’s exclusive legislative competence in taxation, and set aside the judgments of the Islamabad, Lahore, and Sindh high courts, which were found to have exceeded their jurisdiction. The FCC held that courts cannot redetermine tax slabs, rates, thresholds, or fiscal policy, and that the high courts committed judicial overreach, violating the doctrine of separation of powers. All appeals filed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) secretary and Inland Revenue commissioner were confirmed as maintainable. The FCC said the super taxes were valid, with specific exclusions for benevolent funds. It also allowed oil and gas exploration companies to approach the relevant tax commissioner individually for tax exemptions that should be assessed individually as per the 1948 concession regime. It said Sections 4-B and 4-B were intra vires of the Constitution, the Parliament had the authority to determine taxation under Sections 4-B and 4-C and that the courts’ role was limited to interpretation. The FCC also stated that the high courts’ judgments striking down or reading down Section 4-C were constitutionally invalid and set aside.",

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: Accepting the authority of Parliament to legislate on imposing taxes, the Federal Constitution Court (FCC) on Tuesday — in a landmark ruling with far-reaching constitutional and fiscal implications — upheld the vires of the super tax. This means that means Section 4-B and the 4-C of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001 will be applicable from the dates these were levied as per the prescribed rates. A three-member bench, headed by FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan and also including Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah, announced the much-anticipated short order. The short order was announced in the afternoon after a brief hearing in the morning, when the FCC reserved its ruling with an observation that the verdict would be issued today. The detailed judgment will follow later. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar, who was representing the Revenue Division secretary, said the FCC decided over 2,200 long-pending tax cases concerning Sections 4-B and 4-C of the ITO, thus safeguarding an estimated Rs310 billion in public revenue. These cases were transferred to the FCC after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Different appeals were instituted against the judgments of the Sindh , Lahore and Islamabad high courts regarding the levy of super tax through Section 4-B and 4-C of the ordinance. Different businesspersons, banks, and companies had challenged the imposition of the super tax in high courts, arguing against its retrospective imposition, saying it amounted to double taxation. The tax was initially imposed by the PML-N government in 2015 as a one-time measure under a money bill, with the stated purpose of rehabilitating areas affected during Operation Zarb-i-Azb against terrorists. Previously, an additional 5pc super tax was levied on annual profits exceeding Rs300m. But in 2022, the super tax was applied to individuals earning over Rs150m annually, with a maximum rate of 10pc. It levies a tax rate of 4pc on the income of banking companies and 3pc on other sectors, aimed at funding the rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons. The cases arose from tax levies under Sections 4-B (super tax for rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons) and 4-C (super tax on high-earning persons). While Section 4-B had largely been upheld, Section 4-C had been read down or struck down in some high court rulings on grounds of alleged retrospectivity, discrimination, irrationality of tax slabs, double taxation, and inequity. Following the 27th Constitutional Amendment, the case was transferred to the FCC after 71 hearings in the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, the FCC declared the provisions intra vires the Constitution, reaffirmed Parliament’s exclusive legislative competence in taxation, and set aside the judgments of the Islamabad, Lahore, and Sindh high courts, which were found to have exceeded their jurisdiction. The FCC held that courts cannot redetermine tax slabs, rates, thresholds, or fiscal policy, and that the high courts committed judicial overreach, violating the doctrine of separation of powers. All appeals filed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) secretary and Inland Revenue commissioner were confirmed as maintainable. The FCC said the super taxes were valid, with specific exclusions for benevolent funds. It also allowed oil and gas exploration companies to approach the relevant tax commissioner individually for tax exemptions that should be assessed individually as per the 1948 concession regime. It said Sections 4-B and 4-B were intra vires of the Constitution, the Parliament had the authority to determine taxation under Sections 4-B and 4-C and that the courts’ role was limited to interpretation. The FCC also stated that the high courts’ judgments striking down or reading down Section 4-C were constitutionally invalid and set aside.",

      "title_orig": "Japan’s beloved last pandas leave for China as ties fray",
      "summary_orig": "Hundreds gathered to say farewell to two popular pandas departing Tokyo for China on Tuesday, leaving Japan without any of the beloved bears for the first time in 50 years as ties between the Asian neighbours fray. Panda twins Lei Lei and Xiao Xiao were transported by truck out of Ueno Zoological Gardens, their birthplace, disappointing many Japanese fans who have grown attached to the furry four-year-olds. “I’ve been coming to watch them since they were born,” Nene Hashino, a woman in her 40s wearing a panda-themed jacket and clutching a bear stuffed toy, told AFP . “It feels like my own children are going somewhere far away. It’s sad.” The pandas’ abrupt return was announced last month during a diplomatic spat that began when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi hinted that Tokyo could intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan. Her comment provoked the ire of Beijing, which regards the island as its own territory. The distinctive black-and-white animals, loaned out as part of China’s “panda diplomacy” programme , have symbolised friendship between Beijing and Tokyo since they normalised ties in 1972. Their repatriation comes a month before their loan period expires in February, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which operates Ueno Zoo. “According to the relevant agreement between China and Japan, the giant pandas who were living in Japan, Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei, today began their return trip to China,” said Guo Jiakun, China’s foreign ministry spokesman. “As always, we welcome the Japanese public to come see giant pandas in China.” Japan has reportedly been seeking the loan of a new pair of pandas. However, a weekend poll by the liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper showed that 70 per cent of those surveyed do not think the government should negotiate with China on the lease of new pandas, while 26pc would like them to. On Sunday, Ueno Zoo invited some 4,400 lucky winners of an online lottery to see the pandas for the last time. ‘Part of my heart’ Well-wishers wearing panda-themed clothes, hats and badges waited for hours on the streets lining the zoo two days later to say their final goodbyes. They called out to the animals as the windowless truck left the gates. “It’s so sad,” said Daisaku Hirota, a 37-year-old shop worker who said he tried to visit the pandas as often as he could on his days off. “I lost one part of my heart,” he said. Lei Lei and Xiao Xiao were delivered in 2021 by their mother Shin Shin , who arrived in 2011 and was returned to China in 2024 because of declining health. Since late last year, China has discouraged its nationals from travelling to Japan, citing deteriorating public security and criminal acts against Chinese nationals in the country. Beijing is reportedly also choking off exports to Japan of rare-earth products crucial for making everything from electric cars to missiles. However, China routinely removes pandas from foreign countries and the latest move may not be politically motivated, said Masaki Ienaga, a professor at Tokyo Woman’s Christian University and an expert in East Asian international relations. “If you talk about [Chinese] politics, the timing of sending pandas is what counts,” and pandas could return to Japan if bilateral ties warm, Ienaga said. Other countries use animals as tools of diplomacy, including Thailand with its elephants and Australia with its koalas, he added. “But pandas are special,” Ienaga said. “They have strong customer-drawing power, and … they can earn money.”",

      "summary_orig": "Jamaat-i-Islami chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Tuesday stressed the formation of a “city government” as the only solution to Karachi’s administrative and governance issues. The remarks come against the backdrop of the Gul Plaza inferno , which has resulted in lawmakers stressing the need to empower local governments (LGs) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) even demanding that Karachi be made a “federal territory”. “The solution to Karachi’s issues is not provincial or federal control. According to the Constitution, the solution is Karachi city government,” the JI chief said while addressing a press conference in the metropolis. Rehman made the case for better local governance by citing Istanbul as an example: “Istanbul’s local governance has its master plan, fire brigade, construction, transportation, water, sewage, education and employment under its jurisdiction.” “This is real governance, not KDA (Karachi Development Authority) or SBCA (Sindh Building Control Authority),” he said, adding that “development cannot result from this”. “This is why a city government is the only solution here — a government that is empowered and represented by an elected official,” he said, alleging that the mayorship was “stolen from JI”. In June 2023, Murtaza Wahab was elected as the first PPP mayor of Karachi, after much controversy, recriminations and protests. During his presser, the JI chief also announced a march on February 1, titled “ Jeenay dou Karachi ko ” (let Karachi live) — on Sharea Faisal, expressing optimism that “it will give young people hope”. “At the march, we will outline our plans,” he said, stressing that “we must free the city from mafia and feudal lords”. He said that the “JI stood with young people of the country — Generation Z”. The JI chief reiterated that the “people’s mandate should be respected, and the city governance plan should be implemented”. He also demanded that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah step down and take accountability for his government’s “incompetence”. Growing calls for local government Last week, the National Assembly echoed with calls for strengthening LGs as lawmakers stressed the need for reforms in the wake of the Gul Plaza fire. The deadly inferno , which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished , has claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins. Only 23 of the deceased have been identified so far . While the first information report (FIR) of the incident has said the blaze was an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”, no identified individuals have been nominated so far. The Karachi police on Monday formed a special team make “ all-out efforts ” to arrest suspects. In the NA, MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units” and for powers to be “handed over” to the mayor, town chairman, and union council chairman. Besides members of the MQM-P, PML-N’s Khawaja Asif has also favoured strengthening LGs for better city administration. Speaking on the floor of the NA last week, Asif called for providing people “representation in their own neighbourhoods”. Days later, he also lamented that LGs continued to be neglected by political parties, ultimately weakening civilian rule.",

      "summary_orig": "The long-awaited announcement of Pakistan’s 15-member squad for the Twenty20 World Cup finally came on Sunday. Among many talking points, the biggest was the exclusion of speedster Haris Rauf; despite his good showing at the Big Bash Down Under. Perhaps he’d lost the trust of chief selector Aaqib Javed. Pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi suffered an injury during the Big Bash League, having missed the previous tri-series against Sri Lanka due to fitness issues. With Haris absent, Shaheen will have to bear greater responsibility; needing to take wickets in the early overs, and the death overs — which will be particularly challenging for him as his performance in that phase has not been great. Salman Mirza has emerged as a good pacer, performing well with both the new and old ball, while Naseem Shah’s fitness and performance were satisfactory, leading to his selection. Many others were overlooked. The selectors did not choose Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jr., or Ahmed Daniyal, opting instead for fast-bowling all-rounder Faheem Ashraf. Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, Saim Ayub, and skipper Salman Ali Agha are the spin-bowling all-rounders in the team, but their increased number, as well as the presence of multiple wicket-keepers seems to disrupt the team balance. The squad includes three wicket-keepers, none of whom were the first choice for their Pakistan Super League franchises. Khawaja Nafay is with Quetta Gladiators, but the keeping is handled by Sri Lankans Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal. Usman Khan played as a batsman for Multan Sultans and occasionally kept wickets, but Mohammad Rizwan was the number one choice. Sahibzada Farhan kept wickets in just one match for Islamabad United, as Andries Gous and Azam Khan were the main wicket-keepers. In comparison, the cricketing world has wicket-keepers who are match-winners. Pakistan’s philosophy is different. Instead of a specialist, any batter who can keep wickets is given a chance without considering how costly it could prove for the team. Babar conundrum Further beyond, there are questions regarding former skipper Babar Azam’s selection, as his performance in the shortest format of the game hasn’t been very impressive of late; the batter coming off a below-par in Big Bash. There is also a striking likeness between Babar and captain Salman Ali Agha. They are similar batters, occupying number three and four spots in the line-up. They may perform well in low-scoring matches, but could face difficulties in high-scoring games. The batting lineup has five openers who are capable of batting at different numbers, including Saim, Sahibzada, Babar, Fakhar Zaman and Nafay, who have all been seen playing in the top order for their franchises. However, when it comes to the middle-order, batters like Irfan Khan Niazi and Abdul Samad have not been given opportunities. The spotlight has been on the performance of Pakistan players in the Big Bash, while overlooking their performance in the Bangladesh Premier League. Opener Sahibzada scored 185 runs in nine innings with a strike rate of 118.58, which is not particularly commendable. Similarly, Saim Ayub scored 68 runs in four innings with a strike rate of only 117.24. Fakhar Zaman, who went to play in the International League T20, performed below his standards, scoring 260 runs in 12 innings with an average of 21.66 and a strike rate of 124.40. Babar, meanwhile, played seven innings in the Big Bash, scoring 131 runs at a strike rate of 99.2. Spin strength Overall, Pakistan’s spin department looks the strongest with two specialist spinners in Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, who are world-class. However, it might be difficult to see both play together since Nawaz, Shadab and Saim are the three spin-bowling all-rounders available. With their presence, it is likely that only one of Usman or Abrar is able to secure a spot in the playing eleven. Pakistan could benefit from the conditions in Sri Lanka, with the team playing all their matches in Colombo. Their biggest test will come against holders India, with the United States, Namibia and the Netherlands the other teams in the group. On paper, Pakistan should advance from the group stage. Further ahead, it remains to be seen whether they can forge a combination that can help them go all the way.",

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: In a revealing interview with The Sunday Times, former UK Chancellor Sajid Javid reflected on his life journey from a childhood marked by poverty, domestic violence and racism to a career as a multimillionaire, cabinet minister, and home secretary. He also discussed his family’s complex past and integration in Britain and modern immigration policy. Among the most striking revelations, British Pakistani Javid admitted that under the existing immigration rules, he “wouldn’t allow either his unskilled father or his non-English speaking mother entry today”. “The biggest block to good community cohesion is English. We should have set a requirement that if you want to settle in the UK, you should be able to speak fluent English. We should have done that ages ago,” he said. Javid’s parents arrived from Pakistan in the early 1960s. His father, arriving with just £1, worked as a bus driver, mill worker and shop owner, while his mother who was uneducated and initially unable to speak English, struggled to adapt. The Colour of Home, Javid’s new memoir, details a childhood shaped by hardship and family tension. In revealing Sunday Times interview, Sajid Javid says he ‘wouldn’t allow his unskilled father or his non-English speaking mother entry’ into UK under current rules The memoir describes his father’s violence. Javid recounts being beaten with a leather slipper, a wooden spoon and on one occasion a hammer that required a CT scan. He writes about enduring racist attacks from skinheads and school bullies, as well as the emotional toll of growing up in cramped and impoverished living conditions. “Crouching in a ball and covering his face while his father beat him,” Javid recalls, highlights the intensity of these early struggles. Family tensions extended to marriage expectations. His mother initially objected to his white Christian wife Laura refusing to meet her for two years, and had even tried to arrange a marriage with his cousin. His mother also “didn’t want two black workmen her husband employed to come for dinner” though she later learnt English and “came to deeply regret her racism towards the black workmen”. Later in life, his father apologised to Javid for his past violence. Despite these hardships, the family’s story is one of resilience. Javid fulfilled his childhood goal of buying his parents a house in Bristol, writing that one of his proudest moments was achieving “enough to give myself and my family a better life”. He told the interviewer that a “Reform voter… might think this is exactly the kind of family that we want in the UK because they went on a journey and look where they’ve ended”. In politics, Javid was known for his positions on immigration. He supported a post-Brexit points-based system but argued that the UK “lets in too many immigrants” and stressed that language skills are essential for community cohesion.

      "summary_orig": "• TTAP may announce ‘Jail Bharo Tehreek’, urges people to keep their shutters closed • Forms 10 bodies at international, national and provincial levels to ensure success of strike • JUI-F to stage public gathering in Rawalpindi ISLAMABAD / RAWALPINDI: Opposition parties have chalked out plans for Feb 8 to protest against the alleged rigging in the 2024 general elections, with Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) hinting that it may announce a Jail Bharo Tehreek (court arrest movement) and urging people to keep their shutters closed, while the JUI-F has decided to stage a public gathering in Rawalpindi. TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Monday said that the call for a countrywide protest on Feb 8 — the second anniversary of the 2024 general polls —would not be withdrawn under any circumstances. He urged the masses to shut down everything on that day, which falls on a Sunday. Suggesting that the alliance might announce a Jail Bharo Tehreek, he said it would be just the beginning and that more moves would follow. Mr Achakzai was chairing a meeting of the TTAP, attended by alliance’s vice chief Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, former Sindh governor Zubair Umar, Asad Qaiser, Dr Ammar Ali Jan, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Yousufzai and Advocate Khalid Chaudhry. The participants decided that Feb 8 would be observed as a Black Day and that a nationwide strike would be ensured. Ten committees formed They said 10 committees had been formed at international, national and provincial levels to ensure the success of the strike. They termed Feb 8 a day of humiliation for the entire nation, saying people had been deprived of their basic right to elect representatives and rendered powerless. The meeting also expressed concern over the sentences awarded to rights activist, Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, terming them a violation of constitutional rights to freedom of expression and a fair trial. The participants warned of a looming humanitarian crisis in Khyber Agency’s Tirah valley, saying millions could be forced to migrate in harsh weather. They said any deviation from resolutions passed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and decisions of the national jirga would be against provincial autonomy. They further criticised the government’s decision to join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking parliament and the public into confidence, questioning Pakistan’s participation when Palestinians were excluded from the forum. Later, a TTAP delegation led by Mr Achakzai visited the residence of former PTI leader Dr Shireen Mazari to express solidarity with her over the arrest and conviction of her daughter and son-in-law, Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha. JUI-F rally Meanwhile, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has announced that his party would stage a rally in Rawalpindi on Feb 8 to protest against the alleged rigging in the last general elections. According to JUI-F Rawalpindi district spokesperson Hafiz Ziaullah, the party chief will address the public gathering. The party spokesperson said the Feb 8 elections were “tantamount to the killing of the public mandate” and an “insult” to the nation’s vote, and “would not be accepted under any circumstances”. He said the government formed as a result of the 2024 polls would be “rejected through public power”, and the struggle would continue to protect the original principles of democracy. According to the spokesperson, preparations for the rally have been formally started, and instructions have been issued to all tehsils, workers and officials of the Rawalpindi district to ensure full participation. “A large number of people, workers and people belonging to different schools of thought will participate in the rally,” he said. The JUI-F Rawalpindi chapter initially appealed to the public to reach Dera Taji Khokhar on Feb 8 to raise their voices against the “fake” elections and the “illegitimate” government, and to stand with the JUI-F for the restoration of democracy. The spokesperson said under the initial plan, the public gathering would be held at Dera Taji Khokhar near the old airport, but the venue was likely to change. Responding to a question about seeking permission from the district administration, he said a meeting of the JUI-F general council would be held on Jan 31, after which the venue would be decided and an application submitted to the district administration by Feb 1. Hafiz Ziaullah said preparations had already begun and all office-bearers had been informed about the decision to launch a protest against the “rigged” 2024 general elections. He added that tehsil chapters had been asked to form committees for public mobilisation, and the general council would task these committees with bringing the maximum number of people to the meeting. Meanwhile, the district administration has imposed Section 144 in the district since December and extending it on a weekly basis. Under Section 144, public gatherings are not permitted. The current one has been imposed from Jan 23 till Feb 6. A senior district administration official told Dawn that if an application was received from any party, it would be forwarded to the Punjab government after a report from the District Intelligence Committee.

TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Monday said that the call for a countrywide protest on Feb 8 — the second anniversary of the 2024 general polls —would not be withdrawn under any circumstances. He urged the masses to shut down everything on that day, which falls on a Sunday. Suggesting that the alliance might announce a Jail Bharo Tehreek, he said it would be just the beginning and that more moves would follow. Mr Achakzai was chairing a meeting of the TTAP, attended by alliance’s vice chief Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, former Sindh governor Zubair Umar, Asad Qaiser, Dr Ammar Ali Jan, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Yousufzai and Advocate Khalid Chaudhry. The participants decided that Feb 8 would be observed as a Black Day and that a nationwide strike would be ensured. Ten committees formed They said 10 committees had been formed at international, national and provincial levels to ensure the success of the strike. They termed Feb 8 a day of humiliation for the entire nation, saying people had been deprived of their basic right to elect representatives and rendered powerless. The meeting also expressed concern over the sentences awarded to rights activist, Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, terming them a violation of constitutional rights to freedom of expression and a fair trial. The participants warned of a looming humanitarian crisis in Khyber Agency’s Tirah valley, saying millions could be forced to migrate in harsh weather. They said any deviation from resolutions passed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and decisions of the national jirga would be against provincial autonomy. They further criticised the government’s decision to join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking parliament and the public into confidence, questioning Pakistan’s participation when Palestinians were excluded from the forum. Later, a TTAP delegation led by Mr Achakzai visited the residence of former PTI leader Dr Shireen Mazari to express solidarity with her over the arrest and conviction of her daughter and son-in-law, Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha. JUI-F rally Meanwhile, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has announced that his party would stage a rally in Rawalpindi on Feb 8 to protest against the alleged rigging in the last general elections. According to JUI-F Rawalpindi district spokesperson Hafiz Ziaullah, the party chief will address the public gathering. The party spokesperson said the Feb 8 elections were “tantamount to the killing of the public mandate” and an “insult” to the nation’s vote, and “would not be accepted under any circumstances”. He said the government formed as a result of the 2024 polls would be “rejected through public power”, and the struggle would continue to protect the original principles of democracy. According to the spokesperson, preparations for the rally have been formally started, and instructions have been issued to all tehsils, workers and officials of the Rawalpindi district to ensure full participation. “A large number of people, workers and people belonging to different schools of thought will participate in the rally,” he said.
