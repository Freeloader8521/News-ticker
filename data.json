      "summary_orig": "Two cases of the deadly Nipah virus in India have prompted countries in Asia to step up airport screening to prevent the spread of the infection. But what is Nipah virus, and how worried should people be? What is Nipah virus? Nipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic, but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40 to 75 per cent, depending on the local healthcare system’s capacity for detection and management, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. An undated image of fruit bats in Kerala, India. — Reuters/File However, while it can also spread from person to person, it does not do this easily, and outbreaks are usually small and fairly contained, according to experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Candidate vaccines are under development, although none have been approved yet. How common is it? Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1999. Since then, there have been small outbreaks almost every year, mostly in Bangladesh. India also sees sporadic outbreaks. According to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a group that tracks emerging disease threats and funds the development of medical tools to protect against them, as of December, 750 cases had been recorded in all, and 415 of the patients died. Reuters traced the spread of Nipah in a 2023 series, Bat Lands. How does it spread? When first identified in Malaysia, Nipah spread largely through direct contact with sick pigs or contaminated tissues. Since then, it more commonly spreads from contact with what scientists say is its natural host: fruit bats. More specifically, the consumption of fruit or fruit products — like raw date palm juice — containing urine or saliva from infected fruit bats has been the most likely source of infection, the WHO says. Human-to-human spread has been found, mainly after close contact between a sick patient and their family or caregivers. What are the symptoms? The initial symptoms of Nipah, such as fever, headaches and muscle pain, are not specific and can be confused with other diseases. These can then be followed by neurological signs indicating acute encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and some people experience severe respiratory problems. In this file photo, an airport official checks the temperature of a passenger upon her arrival at the Bacha Khan International Airport in Peshawar. — AFP Seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to a coma in days. Most people who get better make a full recovery, but some experience long-term neurological problems. How worried should we be? While Nipah is a dangerous disease with a high fatality rate, it has not yet shown signs of becoming more transmissible among humans or spreading easily worldwide, scientists say. However, it remains a significant public health concern, according to the WHO, particularly in countries where outbreaks are more common. It can also lead to the mass culling of farm animals such as pigs that are susceptible to the virus. Scientists say, however, that it is unlikely to spread globally and also point out that airport screening may be ineffective as the virus has a long incubation period. What vaccines or treatments are available? There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for Nipah, although several candidates are undergoing testing, including one developed by the Oxford University scientists involved in developing one of the Covid-19 vaccines. Researchers in Bangladesh use nets to catch bats and collect samples to find the Nipah virus in the wild. — Reuters/File Their Nipah vaccine uses the same technology and began phase II testing in Bangladesh in December in collaboration with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and with funding from CEPI.",

These can then be followed by neurological signs indicating acute encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and some people experience severe respiratory problems.

Most people who get better make a full recovery, but some experience long-term neurological problems. How worried should we be? While Nipah is a dangerous disease with a high fatality rate, it has not yet shown signs of becoming more transmissible among humans or spreading easily worldwide, scientists say. However, it remains a significant public health concern, according to the WHO, particularly in countries where outbreaks are more common. It can also lead to the mass culling of farm animals such as pigs that are susceptible to the virus. Scientists say, however, that it is unlikely to spread globally and also point out that airport screening may be ineffective as the virus has a long incubation period. What vaccines or treatments are available? There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for Nipah, although several candidates are undergoing testing, including one developed by the Oxford University scientists involved in developing one of the Covid-19 vaccines. Researchers in Bangladesh use nets to catch bats and collect samples to find the Nipah virus in the wild. — Reuters/File Their Nipah vaccine uses the same technology and began phase II testing in Bangladesh in December in collaboration with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and with funding from CEPI.",

      "summary": "Two cases of the deadly Nipah virus in India have prompted countries in Asia to step up airport screening to prevent the spread of the infection. But what is Nipah virus, and how worried should people be? What is Nipah virus? Nipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic, but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40 to 75 per cent, depending on the local healthcare system’s capacity for detection and management, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. An undated image of fruit bats in Kerala, India. — Reuters/File However, while it can also spread from person to person, it does not do this easily, and outbreaks are usually small and fairly contained, according to experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Candidate vaccines are under development, although none have been approved yet. How common is it? Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1999. Since then, there have been small outbreaks almost every year, mostly in Bangladesh. India also sees sporadic outbreaks. According to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a group that tracks emerging disease threats and funds the development of medical tools to protect against them, as of December, 750 cases had been recorded in all, and 415 of the patients died. Reuters traced the spread of Nipah in a 2023 series, Bat Lands. How does it spread? When first identified in Malaysia, Nipah spread largely through direct contact with sick pigs or contaminated tissues. Since then, it more commonly spreads from contact with what scientists say is its natural host: fruit bats. More specifically, the consumption of fruit or fruit products — like raw date palm juice — containing urine or saliva from infected fruit bats has been the most likely source of infection, the WHO says. Human-to-human spread has been found, mainly after close contact between a sick patient and their family or caregivers. What are the symptoms?

      "title_orig": "Governor Kundi blames ‘barrage of statements’ by KP govt for Tirah exodus",
      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Wednesday blamed statements by the PTI-led provincial government for the recent evacuation of residents from Tirah Valley in the province’s Khyber district. The federal and provincial governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists. Speaking to reporters in Khyber’s Bara tehsil — where families displaced from Tirah have arrived — Kundi noted that while there was typically around 20 per cent “migration” during winters, it was between 50 to 60pc this year. “It is 50 to 60pc this time because statements were repeatedly made that perhaps an operation will be conducted in Tirah, so people vacated [their homes].” “In my opinion, people are suffering today due to the failure and weakness of our province’s government,” he said. The governor noted that the KP government had issued a “barrage of statements and compelled these people to leave the area,” adding that the residents realised the situation was different when they reached Bara. He noted that, usually, people do not live in “tent villages” after evacuating during the winter, but stay in the homes of host families. Kundi stressed that whenever a military operation was planned, official statements were issued and necessary preparations were made. Speaking to reporters alongside Kundi, KP Opposition Leader Ibadullah Khan, who had accompanied the governor to Bara, said their visit aimed to meet the people who had come from Tirah and “see the ground situation” and the issues faced by the area residents. “This is our duty, these are our people,” he said. “Unfortunately, the person who has government in this province is playing politics on everything,” the PML-N MPA said, referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. He stressed that “certain topics” should not be politicised. ‘Come, let’s sit with Centre’ Kundi also extended an offer to CM Afridi for dialogue with the federal government to resolve various issues. Noting that the PPP was an ally of the PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre, Kundi said: “Therefore, we have always suggested to them that if they have any issue with the Centre, they should make a committee or a jirga and we are ready to accompany you.” The governor lamented that the PTI was willing to “hold jirgas with militants but was not ready to convene a jirga or sit with Punjab or the Centre”. “They are ready to work with the country’s enemies but not those who work for the country’s stability. “[…] If there is anything under the Centre’s responsibility, we are ready to play our role, but the provincial government should bring forth its case.” The governor noted that the law and order situation in Dera Ismail Khan, as well as the southern and merged districts of KP, was “not that good,” adding that security personnel and residents were making sacrifices. “Come, let’s sit with Centre, with security agencies to bring peace in the province, as well as development and prosperity,” the governor reiterated. Noting that the KP CM hailed from the merged districts, the governor said he should “provide a solution for the injustices that he says people there have faced in the past”. “I will again ask my province’s government to come to its senses. Leave aside Qaidi No.804 — he will come out of jail after facing punishment for his acts,” he said, an apparent reference to former prime minister Imran Khan. Kundi went on to quip that the PTI had the option to “form two parties”, one for its “ Tehreek-i-Intishaar ” (incitement movement) and the other to run KP. He also noted CM Afridi’s frequent visits outside the province, including to Rawalpindi , Lahore and Karachi . “If you have a mandate — however you got it — you should work for your province’s development,” the governor said, adding that people often requested facilitation for their medical treatment in Sindh and other places. He noted that Ibadullah and other opposition lawmakers informed CM Afridi of various issues “daily, but he remains unmoved”. Kundi asked the chief minister to fix KP’s governance and take steps for peace in the province. PTI concocting narrative to hide its corruption in Tirah funds: Tallal Chaudhry Separately, in a televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry claimed that the PTI-led KP government was concocting a false narrative to “hide its corruption” in the reported Rs4 billion approved for the Tirah residents’ temporary relocation. “The army’s name is being taken to hide their performance, incompetence, lack of capibility and their corruption in the Rs4bn dedicated for Tirah Valley,” Chaudhry said. Echoing the Centre’s clarifications issued in the past few days, the state minister asserted that no document or notification issued in the matter mentioned the federal government or the armed forces. “As soon as people were relocated to other places from Tirah, and they (KP govt) were paid Rs4bn, due to which there was noise, and it was found out that their own people had retained more than half of the money for some other purpose, so a baseless narrative was created after that to hide it.” Chaudhry asserted: “Whenever an operation is planned, we will issue a notification and conduct it after informing everyone. We will take everyone onboard. “Any kind of new operation or any operation is not taking place in Tirah Valley currently.” However, the interior official added, “If any action is underway in the entire country, from Quetta to Gilgit and Gilgit to Karachi, it is under the National Action Plan (NAP) . Highlighting that the current NAP was revised in 2021 under the PTI government, Chaudhry said the KP government was “fully a part of it”. “Each action, each IB (intelligence-based) operation or other action — the KP government is a full participant and onboard with each action taken in KP or any process carried out under the National Action Plan,” he asserted. The PML-N leader remarked that the “issue is they want to do it but they are scared”. “You want to do it and even attempt to, are fully onboard the National Action Plan, but are also scared and hide.” The state minister contended that the KP government was “concocting a narrative based on lies” to create a political narrative, collect votes, hide its corruption and divert attention from its performance. Noting that Rs14bn were recovered from a “truck driver’s account” in the Kohistan graft case , Chaudhry alleged there was a “similar scandal in Tirah” involving the Rs4bn allocated. The interior ministry official declared that the “routine” intelligence-based operations (IBOs) will continue under the NAP, and they were taking place with the “cooperation” of the KP government and its chief minister. “But to make themselves appear good in the public’s eyes and make the army bad, lies are told,” he remarked, noting that military operations had previously been carried out after proper announcements. “Whenever there is such a need, we do not need to hide. We will do it openly,” Chaudhry said. “But repeatedly making false accusations against the army cannot hide your lack of capability, incompetence, or corruption, or the Rs4bn that went in your pockets in Tirah Valley,” he added. The minister highlighted that the KP government was responsible for distributing the allocated funds, adding that the deputy commissioner who was involved in the December agreement with the tribal elders was also under the provincial administration. “The action for which you are fully responsible, not just a participant, you pin the blame for it on someone else,” Chaudhry quipped.",

Leave aside Qaidi No.804 — he will come out of jail after facing punishment for his acts,” he said, an apparent reference to former prime minister Imran Khan. Kundi went on to quip that the PTI had the option to “form two parties”, one for its “ Tehreek-i-Intishaar ” (incitement movement) and the other to run KP. He also noted CM Afridi’s frequent visits outside the province, including to Rawalpindi , Lahore and Karachi . “If you have a mandate — however you got it — you should work for your province’s development,” the governor said, adding that people often requested facilitation for their medical treatment in Sindh and other places. He noted that Ibadullah and other opposition lawmakers informed CM Afridi of various issues “daily, but he remains unmoved”. Kundi asked the chief minister to fix KP’s governance and take steps for peace in the province. PTI concocting narrative to hide its corruption in Tirah funds: Tallal Chaudhry Separately, in a televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry claimed that the PTI-led KP government was concocting a false narrative to “hide its corruption” in the reported Rs4 billion approved for the Tirah residents’ temporary relocation. “The army’s name is being taken to hide their performance, incompetence, lack of capibility and their corruption in the Rs4bn dedicated for Tirah Valley,” Chaudhry said. Echoing the Centre’s clarifications issued in the past few days, the state minister asserted that no document or notification issued in the matter mentioned the federal government or the armed forces. “As soon as people were relocated to other places from Tirah, and they (KP govt) were paid Rs4bn, due to which there was noise, and it was found out that their own people had retained more than half of the money for some other purpose, so a baseless narrative was created after that to hide it.” Chaudhry asserted: “Whenever an operation is planned, we will issue a notification and conduct it after informing everyone. We will take everyone onboard. “Any kind of new operation or any operation is not taking place in Tirah Valley currently.” However, the interior official added, “If any action is underway in the entire country, from Quetta to Gilgit and Gilgit to Karachi, it is under the National Action Plan (NAP) . Highlighting that the current NAP was revised in 2021 under the PTI government, Chaudhry said the KP government was “fully a part of it”. “Each action, each IB (intelligence-based) operation or other action — the KP government is a full participant and onboard with each action taken in KP or any process carried out under the National Action Plan,” he asserted. The PML-N leader remarked that the “issue is they want to do it but they are scared”. “You want to do it and even attempt to, are fully onboard the National Action Plan, but are also scared and hide.” The state minister contended that the KP government was “concocting a narrative based on lies” to create a political narrative, collect votes, hide its corruption and divert attention from its performance. Noting that Rs14bn were recovered from a “truck driver’s account” in the Kohistan graft case , Chaudhry alleged there was a “similar scandal in Tirah” involving the Rs4bn allocated. The interior ministry official declared that the “routine” intelligence-based operations (IBOs) will continue under the NAP, and they were taking place with the “cooperation” of the KP government and its chief minister. “But to make themselves appear good in the public’s eyes and make the army bad, lies are told,” he remarked, noting that military operations had previously been carried out after proper announcements. “Whenever there is such a need, we do not need to hide. We will do it openly,” Chaudhry said. “But repeatedly making false accusations against the army cannot hide your lack of capability, incompetence, or corruption, or the Rs4bn that went in your pockets in Tirah Valley,” he added. The minister highlighted that the KP government was responsible for distributing the allocated funds, adding that the deputy commissioner who was involved in the December agreement with the tribal elders was also under the provincial administration. “The action for which you are fully responsible, not just a participant, you pin the blame for it on someone else,” Chaudhry quipped.",
      "title": "Governor Kundi blames ‘barrage of statements’ by KP govt for Tirah exodus",
      "summary": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Wednesday blamed statements by the PTI-led provincial government for the recent evacuation of residents from Tirah Valley in the province’s Khyber district. The federal and provincial governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists. Speaking to reporters in Khyber’s Bara tehsil — where families displaced from Tirah have arrived — Kundi noted that while there was typically around 20 per cent “migration” during winters, it was between 50 to 60pc this year. “It is 50 to 60pc this time because statements were repeatedly made that perhaps an operation will be conducted in Tirah, so people vacated [their homes].” “In my opinion, people are suffering today due to the failure and weakness of our province’s government,” he said. The governor noted that the KP government had issued a “barrage of statements and compelled these people to leave the area,” adding that the residents realised the situation was different when they reached Bara. He noted that, usually, people do not live in “tent villages” after evacuating during the winter, but stay in the homes of host families. Kundi stressed that whenever a military operation was planned, official statements were issued and necessary preparations were made. Speaking to reporters alongside Kundi, KP Opposition Leader Ibadullah Khan, who had accompanied the governor to Bara, said their visit aimed to meet the people who had come from Tirah and “see the ground situation” and the issues faced by the area residents. “This is our duty, these are our people,” he said. “Unfortunately, the person who has government in this province is playing politics on everything,” the PML-N MPA said, referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. He stressed that “certain topics” should not be politicised. ‘Come, let’s sit with Centre’ Kundi also extended an offer to CM Afridi for dialogue with the federal government to resolve various issues. Noting that the PPP was an ally of the PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre, Kundi said: “Therefore, we have always suggested to them that if they have any issue with the Centre, they should make a committee or a jirga and we are ready to accompany you.” The governor lamented that the PTI was willing to “hold jirgas with militants but was not ready to convene a jirga or sit with Punjab or the Centre”. “They are ready to work with the country’s enemies but not those who work for the country’s stability. “[…] If there is anything under the Centre’s responsibility, we are ready to play our role, but the provincial government should bring forth its case.” The governor noted that the law and order situation in Dera Ismail Khan, as well as the southern and merged districts of KP, was “not that good,” adding that security personnel and residents were making sacrifices. “Come, let’s sit with Centre, with security agencies to bring peace in the province, as well as development and prosperity,” the governor reiterated.

      "summary_orig": "Amid reports about PTI founder Imran Khan suffering from an ailment that could permanently damage his eyesight and being taken to a hospital for treatment, the opposition on Wednesday demanded that a meeting be arranged between the ex-premier and his family. A day prior, the party said it had learned through credible reports that the ex-premier was suffering from an ailment that could cause permanent damage to his eyesight if not treated promptly. According to a senior doctor at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on Saturday night for the procedure, which took quite some time. Another doctor, however, has denied this and said it was better not to discuss it as the PTI would make an issue out of such a development. During a press conference in Islamabad, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said that Imran was allegedly taken to the hospital over the weekend before being taken back to jail. He called the situation “distressing for the nation, the party and the family”. “The family should have been taken on board for moving him for medical treatment. To this day, we have still not been informed about the disease for which he was taken to the hospital, which doctor examined him, why he was taken back [to jail] and why the need arose for doing so,” he said. In an apparent reference to the government, Gohar said they “are trying to consolidate their power” by making changes in the law but the people’s trust in them was failing. He added that denying meetings with the PTI chief was causing great concern. “The government is not understanding, but we will try to make them understand through this press conference; try to understand these problems. Let the meetings happen … do not deny meetings until February 8 under any circumstances,” he requested. “A meeting with the family is very important. We demand that today, if not tomorrow, a meeting be arranged between Khan sahib and his family, and we are informed about his health. This is our demand,” he said. Gohar urged the government to consider the demand so that the “anxiety within the nation, the party and his (Imran) family be immediately put at ease”. Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said that Imran was the most popular leader in Pakistan. “He (Imran) is a former prime minister of Pakistan … whom Pakistan loves,” he said. Gohar termed the current situation, where Imran had been taken to the hospital without his family being informed, an “injustice”. He said that as a result of this, the government was losing its credibility in the eyes of the nation. “This is condemnable and they will have to answer for it at some point one day,” he said. Abbas said that the government had faced a resounding defeat in the Feb 8, 2024 general election. “If the [results] of the Feb 8 polls were accepted, then the political crisis would have ended,” he asserted. He called on the nation to join the opposition’s nationwide protest call for Feb 8. Meanwhile, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that Imran and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, being kept in isolation in jail was “unacceptable”. He said that the latter was last allowed to meet her daughter on November 4. Raja said that Imran’s personal physician, who was not related to politics in any way, was not allowed to see him. He said that petitions had also been filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) by the party’s senators and MNAs for meeting Imran. “I learnt today that the IHC has refused to hear these petitions as regular petitions. An objection had been placed on both pleas, saying that the petitioners had no right to approach the court,” he said. “We mentioned in our petition very clearly that we have grave concerns about the reports regarding Imran Khan sahib’s health and that his personal doctors should be allowed to examine him immediately. But we were told that this petition does not qualify for a hearing,” Raja asserted. “We went to the chambers of the chief justice … and we urged him to use his administrative powers and tell the advocate general that a meeting be arranged,” he added, saying that the situation “bordered on barbarism”. He again questioned why the party was not informed about Imran being taken to the hospital. “We demand that a meeting with Imran be arranged,” he said, also calling for the end of the couple’s solitary confinement. Senior PTI leaders request proper medical treatment for Imran Separately, senior PTI leaders incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail demanded that the government provide Imran proper medical treatment. PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Omar Safraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Reasheed also appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment was being administered as soon as possible. “Imran Khan’s eye infection has resulted in central retinal vein occlusion and may produce permanent damage to the eye and loss of vision, if not treated properly,” the five leaders expressed in an open letter shared by their counsel Rana Mudassar on Wednesday. The open letter — written by Rashid on behalf of all five incarcerated leaders — said learning about Imran Khan’s eye infection, which had resulted in central retinal vein occlusion, was extremely distressing. “This condition is extremely serious and if not treated properly, may produce permanent damage to the eye resulting in loss of vision,” the PTI leaders said. They urged the government to stop its “petty behaviour and ensure that he (Imran) is admitted to a hospital of his choice and given proper treatment” and called the denial of proper treatment “shameful”. “We appeal to the chief justice of Pakistan to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment is given as soon as possible,” they said. “The action taken in this case should be visible to the people of Pakistan,” they added.",

      "summary_orig": "The last year was supposed to be the one in which Pakistan were supposed to redefine their approach towards Twenty20 cricket. It didn’t come. Despite the promises of more aggression with the bat and the subsequent change in personnel, the team scored at just 127.47 – more than a run (1.37 to be precise) slower than the year before. There was a record for the most wins in a calendar year — 21 — but 18 of those had come against lower-ranked or weaker sides in Bangladesh, West Indies, Afghanistan, Oman, UAE, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. The attempted reinvention — that brought in new captain and head coach — focused towards ensuring Pakistan’s T20 World Cup campaign this year does not look similar to 2024, when they were knocked out in just the group stage following embarrassing defeats to the United States and India. There are some positives though. Pakistan look more settled as a team with the roles for each player well defined as the selectors and team management have persisted with the same core for the last 10 months. That was not the case in last year’s Champions Trophy when Pakistan, due to an injury to one player, rejigged their entire batting order, and before the 2024 edition of the T20 World Cup when two cricketers came out of retirement only to play that tournament. For Pakistan, who are accustomed to chaos, this is a good start. But, they face their sternest challenge when they come up against Australia — albeit in the familiar surroundings of Lahore — from Thursday in three T20Is. A series against a tough and ruthless opposition like Australia is not a bad way to get ready for a world event and it will help Salman Ali Agha in shaping his playing XI. “These games are very important because they will determine what will be our XI for the World Cup,” the Pakistan T20I captain told a press conference before his team’s final practice session ahead of the series. “We are pretty much on track in regards to the direction we ventured upon a year ago. We have not had the conditions [in most series] to score 200 runs, but we scored 200 whenever we got them. We did so over here [at Gaddafi Stadium] against Bangladesh in almost every game. The team’s progress has been good.” But, there remain areas that need to be fine-tuned before Pakistan departs for Colombo. Since their T20I tri-series victory in November 2025, Pakistan have played only two matches in Sri Lanka and the last of them had to be curtailed because of the rain. Most of the Pakistan players had been playing in leagues around the world and the performances of the batters have not been satisfactory. Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub, Pakistan’s two openers, are coming off an underwhelming BPL and Fakhar Zaman failed to fire in the ILT20. Babar Azam had a torrid BBL in which he failed to put any score of note and his scoring rate remained under scanner. Shaheen Afridi returns to competitive cricket after a knee injury curtailed his BBL stint with Brisbane Heat. Being the most senior pacer in the side, Shaheen will carry the weight of Pakistan’s four-man fast bowling contingent and his workload will be stretched in the absence of Haris Rauf as Pakistan will often return to him in the latter half of the opposition’s innings to stop the flow of runs in the death overs. Pakistan’s recent successes have been engineered by their spin attack and the selectors had no qualms in naming a spin-heavy contingent for the T20 World Cup, which they will play in spin-friendly conditions. In the ongoing T20 World Cup cycle (since the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup final), Pakistan spinners have taken 140 wickets in 44 matches at an average of 18.477 and have bowled at an economy rate of 6.94. Among the full-member teams, only India have taken more wickets (161) than them at an average of 15.68. But, India’s economy rate of 7.18 falls behind Pakistan. But, the stiff challenge that this Australian side poses will test each aspect of Pakistan’s game, which is the best possible preparation that a team can ask for before a world event. Pakistan have lost all their completed last seven T20Is against Australia, including the solitary game between these two sides on Pakistan soil (also at Gaddafi Stadium). They last won a T20I against Australia back in October 2018 when Sarfaraz Ahmed was the captain. Australia play the series without their frontline pace attack due to the injury-related absences of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. Middle-order hard-hitter Tim David will also not play in this series because of hamstring woes. The three will join the team in Sri Lanka ahead of their warm-up in Colombo. But, the squad that in land in Lahore in two batches – first in early afternoon and the second in late evening – contains most of those in Travis Head, captain Mitch Marsh, Cameron Green, Marcus Stoinis, and Adam Zampa, who have turned this side into a formidable unit. Australia decided against holding practice before the first T20I as most of their players have had a camp in the UAE over the last four days and the others arrived straight from Australia after having played in the BBL finals. Marsh, who had landed in Lahore just a few hours before the press conference, revealed that the final call on the team composition will be made when the squad sits together as a group later in the evening. “Thank you for having us,” Marsh said. “We’re very excited to be here. It’s a really important time in both teams’ preparation for the [T20] World Cup. Most of the squad has been in Dubai for the last four days training and getting together. Some of us have flown in a little bit later due to Big Bash commitments. But we’re ready to go and looking forward to a great series.” But would there be any acclimatisation issues with such a quick turnaround? “I didn’t pack too many jumpers,” Marsh said, “[I] wasn’t aware Pakistan got this cold.”",

That was not the case in last year’s Champions Trophy when Pakistan, due to an injury to one player, rejigged their entire batting order, and before the 2024 edition of the T20 World Cup when two cricketers came out of retirement only to play that tournament. For Pakistan, who are accustomed to chaos, this is a good start. But, they face their sternest challenge when they come up against Australia — albeit in the familiar surroundings of Lahore — from Thursday in three T20Is. A series against a tough and ruthless opposition like Australia is not a bad way to get ready for a world event and it will help Salman Ali Agha in shaping his playing XI. “These games are very important because they will determine what will be our XI for the World Cup,” the Pakistan T20I captain told a press conference before his team’s final practice session ahead of the series. “We are pretty much on track in regards to the direction we ventured upon a year ago. We have not had the conditions [in most series] to score 200 runs, but we scored 200 whenever we got them. We did so over here [at Gaddafi Stadium] against Bangladesh in almost every game. The team’s progress has been good.” But, there remain areas that need to be fine-tuned before Pakistan departs for Colombo. Since their T20I tri-series victory in November 2025, Pakistan have played only two matches in Sri Lanka and the last of them had to be curtailed because of the rain. Most of the Pakistan players had been playing in leagues around the world and the performances of the batters have not been satisfactory. Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub, Pakistan’s two openers, are coming off an underwhelming BPL and Fakhar Zaman failed to fire in the ILT20. Babar Azam had a torrid BBL in which he failed to put any score of note and his scoring rate remained under scanner. Shaheen Afridi returns to competitive cricket after a knee injury curtailed his BBL stint with Brisbane Heat. Being the most senior pacer in the side, Shaheen will carry the weight of Pakistan’s four-man fast bowling contingent and his workload will be stretched in the absence of Haris Rauf as Pakistan will often return to him in the latter half of the opposition’s innings to stop the flow of runs in the death overs. Pakistan’s recent successes have been engineered by their spin attack and the selectors had no qualms in naming a spin-heavy contingent for the T20 World Cup, which they will play in spin-friendly conditions. In the ongoing T20 World Cup cycle (since the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup final), Pakistan spinners have taken 140 wickets in 44 matches at an average of 18.477 and have bowled at an economy rate of 6.94. Among the full-member teams, only India have taken more wickets (161) than them at an average of 15.68. But, India’s economy rate of 7.18 falls behind Pakistan. But, the stiff challenge that this Australian side poses will test each aspect of Pakistan’s game, which is the best possible preparation that a team can ask for before a world event. Pakistan have lost all their completed last seven T20Is against Australia, including the solitary game between these two sides on Pakistan soil (also at Gaddafi Stadium). They last won a T20I against Australia back in October 2018 when Sarfaraz Ahmed was the captain. Australia play the series without their frontline pace attack due to the injury-related absences of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. Middle-order hard-hitter Tim David will also not play in this series because of hamstring woes. The three will join the team in Sri Lanka ahead of their warm-up in Colombo. But, the squad that in land in Lahore in two batches – first in early afternoon and the second in late evening – contains most of those in Travis Head, captain Mitch Marsh, Cameron Green, Marcus Stoinis, and Adam Zampa, who have turned this side into a formidable unit. Australia decided against holding practice before the first T20I as most of their players have had a camp in the UAE over the last four days and the others arrived straight from Australia after having played in the BBL finals. Marsh, who had landed in Lahore just a few hours before the press conference, revealed that the final call on the team composition will be made when the squad sits together as a group later in the evening. “Thank you for having us,” Marsh said. “We’re very excited to be here. It’s a really important time in both teams’ preparation for the [T20] World Cup. Most of the squad has been in Dubai for the last four days training and getting together. Some of us have flown in a little bit later due to Big Bash commitments. But we’re ready to go and looking forward to a great series.” But would there be any acclimatisation issues with such a quick turnaround? “I didn’t pack too many jumpers,” Marsh said, “[I] wasn’t aware Pakistan got this cold.”",

      "summary": "The last year was supposed to be the one in which Pakistan were supposed to redefine their approach towards Twenty20 cricket. It didn’t come. Despite the promises of more aggression with the bat and the subsequent change in personnel, the team scored at just 127.47 – more than a run (1.37 to be precise) slower than the year before. There was a record for the most wins in a calendar year — 21 — but 18 of those had come against lower-ranked or weaker sides in Bangladesh, West Indies, Afghanistan, Oman, UAE, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. The attempted reinvention — that brought in new captain and head coach — focused towards ensuring Pakistan’s T20 World Cup campaign this year does not look similar to 2024, when they were knocked out in just the group stage following embarrassing defeats to the United States and India.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Wednesday renewed threats to attack Iran, saying “time is running out” to make a deal on nuclear weapons, after Tehran rejected talks. “Hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table’ and negotiate a fair and equitable deal — NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS — one that is good for all parties. Time is running out,” the US leader said in a social media post, noting that “a massive armada is heading to Iran.” “As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn’t, and there was ‘Operation Midnight Hammer,’ a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse!” The dialling up of threats came after Iran’s top diplomat said the country would not come to the table under the shadow of military action. “Conducting diplomacy through military threat cannot be effective or useful,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in televised comments on Wednesday. “If they want negotiations to take shape, they must certainly set aside threats, excessive demands and raising illogical issues.” Trump has repeatedly left open the option of new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war in June aimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Earlier this month, he threatened to strike Iran over its crackdown on anti-government protests. But the prospect of immediate American action seemed to recede in recent days, with both sides insisting on giving diplomacy a chance. With a US naval strike group led by an aircraft carrier lurking in the region, top Iranian officials also reached out to key Arab states in behind-the-scenes diplomacy to rally support. A strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln has now arrived in Middle Eastern waters, US Central Command said, without revealing its precise location.",

      "summary_orig": "Seconds after an attacker sprayed US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar with an unidentified liquid at a Minnesota meeting, she confronted the man and then defiantly went on to finish her comments, AFP journalists saw. The Somali-born US lawmaker, a constant target of US President Donald Trump’s attacks, had just called for the president’s homeland security chief to resign in the wake of immigration agents killing two US citizens in a matter of weeks. The attacker, identified by police as 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak, managed to spray Omar before he was tackled and removed from the Tuesday meeting in Minneapolis. She was unharmed, police said. Yet before he was even grabbed, Omar stepped rapidly toward the attacker with her fist raised. The lawmaker then went on to urge the crowd to settle down and listen to herremarks. “Here is the reality that people like this ugly man don’t understand — we are Minnesota strong and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us,” Omar said to the meeting of constituents. Authorities have not reported what may have motivated the attacker, but the incident comes as Minneapolis is in a running confrontation with Trump’s aggressive deportation campaign . Ahead of the incident, Omar’s constituents raised issues with her as eclectic as trash collections and the plight of North Minneapolis, alongside fears over the sweeping immigration operations that have sparked large protests . Just as she called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the attacker jumped to his feet from the front row of seats in the meeting room. He then appeared to spray the contents of his syringe, prompting complaints about a foul smell, AFP correspondents witnessed. Two men quickly tackled the assailant, sparking calls of “Nazis out” as he was led from the room. Stunned onlookers gasped and recoiled as the drama unfolded against an already tense backdrop in Minnesota as its targeted by Trump’s immigration operation. Omar has accused Trump of turning Minneapolis into a “war zone”, while he has accused her of corruption without evidence. ‘Not about him’ “It’s not about him, Ilhan,” said one bystander, seeking to encourage Omar, an outspoken Trump critic, to continue. Undeterred, Omar proclaimed, “Please don’t let them have the show.” The suspect was arrested on suspicion of third-degree assault, according to police. An investigation was underway. One witness said they asked themselves, “Is this really happening?” “He could have done something else,” he told AFP . Questions will be asked about security arrangements at the event with members of the public checked by staff, but members of the press allowed in without scrutiny. After the event, Omar, the first Somali-American representative, posted on X, “I’m OK.” “I’m a survivor so this small agitator isn’t going to intimidate me from doing my work,” she wrote.",

      "summary_orig": "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran, state news agency SPA reported on Tuesday. In a phone call with Pezeshkian, the crown prince affirmed his country’s support for any “efforts that would resolve differences through dialogue” to bolster security and stability in the region. Earlier, Iranian media reported that Pezeshkian told bin Salman that Tehran welcomes any process , within the framework of international law, that prevents war. The statement by the Saudi de facto ruler follows a similar statement by the United Arab Emirates that it would not allow any military action against Iran using its airspace or territorial waters. Uncertainty over the possibility of military action in Iran has lingered after US President Donald Trump said last week that an “armada” was heading toward the country but that he hoped he would not have to use it. Trump said on Tuesday another US “armada” was floating towards Iran and he hoped that Tehran would make a deal with Washington. “There is another beautiful armada floating beautifully towards Iran right now,” Trump said in a speech. “I hope they make a deal.” Trump’s warnings to Tehran were against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear programme, but the countrywide demonstrations have since abated. A US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East, two US officials told Reuters on Monday, expanding Trump’s capabilities to defend US forces, or potentially take military action against Iran. Iran has been embroiled in protests during which rights groups say security forces killed thousands of people, including bystanders. The rights groups describe the unrest as the biggest crackdown since the Iranian leadership took power in the 1979 revolution . Iranian authorities have blamed the unrest and deaths on terrorists and rioters backed by exiled opponents.",

      "summary_orig": "KHYBER: Even though the federal and provincial governments are locked in a blame game over displacement from the restive Tirah valley, officials estimate that around 80-85pc of all residents have been evacuated so far. Inclement weather continues to hold up the evacuation process, which has been temporarily halted. Those who had already left their homes and became stranded due to snow storms have also finally reached Bara after two days of hectic rescue operations. Heavy snowfall and the slow pace of registration at multiple locations along the 110-kilometre road from Tirah to Bara has multiplied the miseries of displaced families, with most spending sleepless nights on the road in severe cold. District administration officials told Dawn that though the exact number of families who arrived in Bara was not yet known, but by Tuesday, they estimated that only around 15pc were yet to be evacuated. Evacuation process still on hold amid inclement weather; authorities increase number of registration centres at Bara to facilitate the displaced They said the final date for evacuation had been extended after heavy snowfall and the remaining families were told to stay back till weather improves, though no exact completion date was given. Officials explained that the relaxation was given in light of weather-related hurdles, as it was imperative to give the Tirah people some ‘space’ prior to the restart of their final evacuation after an improvement in weather condition. Dawn has also learnt that families still stranded in their homes due to the suspension of the evacuation process are facing an acute shortage of edibles, as authorities were not allowing anyone into the valley. In Bara, local tribal elders, former parliamentarians and political party representatives blamed both governments for forcing families to vacate their houses to pave the way for yet another military operation. Demanding an immediate halt to the ongoing ‘inhuman’ treatment’ of displaced families, Hamidullah Jan Afridi, a former MNA, sought transparency in the registration process, and called for honouring all commitments made with the 24-member jirga of Tirah elders prior to the start of displacement. He also demanded stopping of political interference in the registration process and due compensation against all losses the people of Tirah had incurred during their displacement. Hashim Khan Afridi, president of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, insisted the decision about the military operation and ‘forced displacement’ was jointly taken by federal and KP governments after holding a series of consultations with local tribal elders. He also demanded an open audit of all funds released in the name of Tirah IDPs and sharing required data with people of both Tirah and Bara. Registration process The district administration has also increased the number of registration centers in Bara to expedite the process and make it more transparent. Officials said that alongside the Paindi Cheena centre, four new centres had been made operational in Alamgudar, Bar Qambarkhel, Malakdin Khel and Qambarabad localities of Bara. They said that separate desks for female registration were established at all centres, as many displaced families had complained that the women had to be herded into the same centres as men, which they considered against their culture and traditions. Officials said that along with district administration officials, local tribal elders, bank staff and staff of a mobile phone company were deputed at all centres for instant verification and issuance of SIM cards to Tirah families. They said previous polio vaccination records would also be used for verification of genuine IDPs with timely provision of basic necessities. Sources in Bara informed that a majority of newly arrived families from Tirah were staying with relatives in different parts of Bara, with some having second homes while a limited number went to Peshawar suburbs where they own houses. Authorities also started registration of hundreds of Zakhakhel families at Paindi Cheena after reaching understanding with Nadra staff. The Zakhakhel families were earlier denied registration on the pretext they had acquired CNICs from Landi Kotal tehsil and are not actual residents of Tirah. Published in Dawn, January 28th, 2026",
