      "title_orig": "23 troops martyred, 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed in border skirmishes with Afghanistan: ISPR",
      "summary_orig": "Twenty-three Pakistani troops have been martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Sunday. The statement comes after overnight skirmishes between the two sides, which began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border,” the ISPR statement said. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. “During overnight skirmishes, 23 brave sons of Pakistan embraced shahadat (martyrdom) while defending the territorial integrity of our beloved country against this outrageous action, while 29 soldiers [were] injured. “According to credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment, more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher, the ISPR added. Afghanistan claims it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. In response to Islamabad’s repeated calls to bar terrorists from using its territory for cross-border attacks, Afghanistan denies the allegation of allowing terrorist outfits to use it soil. But, the ISPR statement today said Afghanistan’s “cowardly action” of the overnight attack, which included fire and a few physical raids, was aimed at destabilising the border areas to “facilitate terrorism, furthering the nefarious designs of the terrorists”. According to a late-night report by state-run Radio Pakistan , which cited security sources, “Afghan forces carried out unprovoked firing at several locations”, Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Bahram Chah in Balochistan along the Pak-Afghan border. “Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban forces and affiliated khwarij ,” the ISPR said. “Precision fires and strikes, as well as physical raids, were directed against Taliban camps and posts, terrorist training facilities and support networks operating from [the] Afghan territory, including elements linked to Fitna-al-Khawarij , Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh. “All possible measures were taken to avoid collateral damage and to protect civilian lives.” The ISPR said that as a result of the unrelenting operations, multiple Taliban locations were destroyed along the border. Providing further details, it said 21 hostile positions on the Afghan side of the border were also briefly physically captured and multiple terrorist training camps, used to plan and facilitate attacks against Pakistan, were rendered inoperative. “The infra-structural damages to Taliban posts, camps, headquarters and support networks of terrorists are extensive, all along the border and range from tactical to operational depth.”. The ISPR further said: “The armed forces of Pakistan remain ever ready to protect the territorial integrity, life and property of the people of Pakistan. Our resolve to defend Pakistan’s territorial integrity and to defeat those who threaten our security is unwavering.” It underlined that while the people of Pakistan preferred constructive diplomacy and dialogue over violence and belligerence, “we will not tolerate the treacherous use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan”. “We have noted with concern that this serious provocation has occurred during the visit of the [Afghan] Taliban foreign minister to India, the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the region. “In the interest of regional peace and security, we call upon the Taliban government to take immediate and verifiable actions to neutralise the terrorist groups, inter alia, Fitna-al-Khawarij , Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh operating from their territory.” Otherwise, it asserted, Pakistan will continue to exercise its right to defend its people by persistently neutralising terror targets. It said that the Taliban government should “shun any ill-begotten notions and prioritise well-being, peace, prosperity and development of the Afghan people over irresponsible sabre-rattling”. The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Last night’s episode vindicates Pakistan’s long-standing position that the Taliban government is actively facilitating the terrorists. “If the Taliban government continues to sponsor terrorist outfits, in cohorts with India, for the shortsighted objective of destabilising the region, the people and the state of Pakistan will not rest until the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.” Afghan posts targeted by army Earlier, state broadcaster PTV News reported details of the Afghan posts targeted by the Pakistan Army. The sources said the army had launched “successful strikes at Durrani Camp, Manojba Camp Battalion Headquarters and Manojba Camp-2, Ghaznali Headquarters in Noshki Sector and neutralised them completely”. “Dozens of Taliban soldiers and Khwarij positioned in the camps and headquarters have been reportedly killed,” the report added. Security sources said that the army had also devastated the Afghan Taliban’s “most important Asmatullah Karar Camp” at Spin Boldak . They noted that the camp was the Taliban’s “one of the biggest” from where terrorist activities against Pakistan were carried out. Afghan Taliban and Khawarij hiding in the camp reportedly suffered “heavy losses”. Meanwhile, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan shared footage of a “second engagement and destruction” of the Asmatullah Karar camp at Spin Boldak. The second Battalion Headquarters of the Afghan Taliban in the Brabcha area, from “where Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists were launched into Pakistan”, was also targeted, as per the sources. In a series of posts on X, PTV News said Afghanistan’s Barikot base camp, Manojba Camp-3 , Karzai post, and Shapola Khula Taliban post were also destroyed. According to Radio Pakistan , security forces also occupied an “important” Afghan post in the Zhob sector and hoisted the Pakistani flag. “Humvee-armoured personnel carrier of the Afghan Taliban deployed at the post was destroyed as well in the attack,” the report said. Targeting an Afghan Tank position at the mountain peaks opposite Kurram, the forces eliminated “several tanks of the Afghan Taliban”, the state media reported, citing security sources. In an earlier Radio Pakistan report, security sources said Afghanistan’s Jandusar Post, Turkmenzai camp and Kharchar Fort had also been “completely destroyed”. On the other hand, Pakistan’s posts also came under attack in the Baramcha area of Chagai district, which borders Afghanistan’s Helmand province. “Afghan forces opened indiscriminate fire at Pakistani border posts with heavy weapons late on Saturday night,” a senior official said. Security sources stated that Afghan forces also tried to infiltrate into Pishin and Zhob districts. However, the attempts were defeated by Pakistani forces in the area. Afghan govt urges Pakistan to ‘desist from using force’ Following the border fighting, Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid urged Pakistan to “desist from using force as such actions will have negative consequences”. Addressing a press conference in Kabul, Mujahid alleged that “certain elements within the Pakistani security establishment want to destabilise Afghanistan“. He further warned that Kabul “possessed weapons to respond”, adding that the Afghanistan Islamic Emirate had made “efforts to resolve issues with Pakistan”. Earlier, the Afghan military said in a statement that “in retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces”, Taliban border forces in the east are “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas”. Taliban officials from the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika, Khost, and Helmand — all located on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan — had confirmed the clashes. The Afghan Ministry of Defence also confirmed earlier that Afghan forces had launched “retaliatory operations against Pakistani security forces” tonight. “The operations ended at midnight. If the opposing side violates Afghanistan’s territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly,” said the statement. Separately, it was reported that the Torkham border crossing had been closed for all kinds of traffic after the overnight firing exchanges at various locations, according to locals on the Pakistani side. Afghan official Qureshi Badloon also confirmed the closure to Dawn.com from Nangarhar. ‘No compromise on Pakistan’s sovereignty’ Earlier in the day, as reports with details of the skirmishes continued to emerge, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted there would be “no compromise” on Pakistan’s sovereignty. President Zardari, in a statement, noted that there were United Nations reports that “proved” terrorist attacks were carried out from the Afghan soil. However, he also stressed that bilateral respect and joint counter-terrorism efforts were the key to long-term regional peace. Asserting that no compromise will be made on Pakistan’s sovereignty, President Zardari said the country remained “firmly committed to safeguarding its national interests, regional sovereignty and security”. He noted that attacks launched “from the territory of the Interim Afghan government by India-backed Khawarij terrorists are a well-documented reality confirmed in successive United Nations Security Council (UNSC) monitoring reports”. The president pointed out that Pakistan had repeatedly “ made it clear that its civilians and security personnel are being targeted through the nexus of the Indian sponsored Khawarij and other terror groups”. President Zardari urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete and verifiable action” against anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from the Afghan soil, the statement added. He termed the menace of terrorism “sponsored by India” as the “greatest threat to regional peace and stability”. “Terrorism is a shared challenge and its burden cannot be placed on any single country,” the president was quoted as saying. In his statement, President Zardari termed it unfortunate that the current Afghan interim administration had “turned away from the just struggle of the oppressed people” of India-occupied Kashmir , “thereby doing injustice to both history and the Muslim ummah”. He reaffirmed that Pakistan will “never accept any disputed or misleading position on Jammu and Kashmir” and reiterated that India’s “unlawful claims over the territory” are contrary to international law and UNSC resolutions. The president highlighted Pakistan’s hosting of millions of Afghan refugees for over decades, saying it “demonstrated Islamic fraternity and exemplary neighbourliness”. However, he added that the “dignified repatriation of Afghan citizens” was in the interest of both countries and essential for sustainable peace. “President Zardari reaffirmed that Pakistan will continue to support the educational and humanitarian needs of the Afghan people, but no compromise will ever be made on Pakistan’s national sovereignty,” the statement said. The president emphasised that Pakistan had extended “every possible facilitation to Afghanistan in trade, economic connectivity, and people-to-people exchanges”. Mutual cooperation and economic partnership are the foundation for lasting peace and regional prosperity, he noted. President Zardari underscored that Pakistan desires a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan. He said brotherly relations must be based on mutual respect, security cooperation and a shared commitment to regional peace. He expressed hope that the interim Afghan government will prevent its soil from being used by “Khawarij and India-backed terrorist elements against Pakistan”, stressing that only joint and practical measures can guarantee enduring peace in the region. PM Shehbaz, too, strongly condemned the “provocation by Afghanistan in Pakistan’s border areas”. “There will be no compromise on Pakistan’s defence, and every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response,“ he asserted. “We are proud of the professional excellence of our armed forces,” the premier said, hailing the army’s “strong and effective response to Afghanistan’s aggression”. “The Pakistan Army not only gave a powerful response to Afghan aggression under the bold leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, but also destroyed several of their posts, forcing them to retreat,” the prime minister said. “Our defence is in strong hands, and we know well how to defend every inch of our motherland,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the army has always given a “crushing response to every form of external aggression”. The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had “repeatedly provided Afghanistan with information regarding terrorist elements such as Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan , who are using Afghan soil to launch attacks against Pakistan”. “Terrorist organisations are being supported by certain elements within Afghanistan,” he stated, expressing hope that the Afghan interim government will ensure its territory is not used by terrorist elements against Pakistan. In one of the first official statements by Pakistan, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi lauded the security forces for their “prompt” response. “Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,” Naqvi said on X. “Pakistan’s forces are alert and Afghanistan is being answered with stones for bricks. The people of Pakistan stand with the brave armed forces like a lead wall. Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India.” Expressing his “deep concern” over the attack from the Afghan side, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said “unprovoked firing and raids along Pak-Afghan border by the Taliban government is a serious provocation”. “Pakistan’s befitting response and strikes are against Taliban infrastructure and to neutralise Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil,” he asserted in a post on X. “Our defensive response is not targeted towards peace-loving Afghan civilian population. Unlike Taliban forces, we are exercising extreme caution in our defensive responses to avoid loss of civilian lives,” Dar added. He expressed Pakistan’s expectation from the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures against terrorist elements and their perpetrators that wish to derail Pak-Afghan relations”. “Pakistan will take all possible measures to defend its own territory, sovereignty and its people,” the deputy premier pledged. Calls for restraint After the border clashes were reported, multiple countries urged Pakistan and Afghanistan to exercise restraint. Saudi Arabia, with which Pakistan recently signed a mutual defence deal , expressed concern at the skirmishes. “The kingdom calls for restraint, avoiding escalation, and embracing dialogue and wisdom to contribute to reducing tensions and maintaining security and stability in the region. “The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security, which will achieve stability and prosperity for the brotherly Pakistani and Afghan peoples.” Iranian top diplomat Abbas Araghchi called on Afghanistan and Pakistan “to exercise restraint” amid ongoing clashes. “Our position is that both sides must exercise restraint,” Araghchi said during a live interview with state television, adding that “stability” between the countries “contributes to regional stability”. Qatar’s foreign ministry urged both sides to prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint, and to work towards containing differences in a manner that helps to reduce tension and avoid escalation, in order to achieve regional security and stability. The foreign ministry reiterated Qatar’s support for all regional and international efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security, and affirmed its commitment to ensuring security and prosperity for the people of the two countries. Events preceding the border clashes The border clashes come against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. An instance of Pakistan asserting its position was when Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly,\n“Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out.” While Kabul maintains that it does not provide safe havens to terrorists, Afghan officials blamed Pakistan on Friday of bombing a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line and also violating the territory of capital Kabul. This was after an explosion was reported in Afghanistan on Thursday. The Foreign Office in Islamabad avoided directly acknowledging the incident in Kabul during a weekly briefing on Friday, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil. Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, the ISPR director general also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out any strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who was on a visit to India when the border clashes began, had condemned Thursday’s incident and Pakistan’s alleged role in it during a press conference in New Delhi. It was India’s — with which Pakistan’s ties have historically been tense — first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. On Friday, New Delhi also announced that it would be reopening its embassy in Kabul after four years. These developments followed a four-day military escalation between Pakistan and India in May — one of the deadliest in recent years — which led to a new low in relations between the two countries.",

Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India.” Expressing his “deep concern” over the attack from the Afghan side, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said “unprovoked firing and raids along Pak-Afghan border by the Taliban government is a serious provocation”. “Pakistan’s befitting response and strikes are against Taliban infrastructure and to neutralise Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil,” he asserted in a post on X. “Our defensive response is not targeted towards peace-loving Afghan civilian population. Unlike Taliban forces, we are exercising extreme caution in our defensive responses to avoid loss of civilian lives,” Dar added. He expressed Pakistan’s expectation from the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures against terrorist elements and their perpetrators that wish to derail Pak-Afghan relations”. “Pakistan will take all possible measures to defend its own territory, sovereignty and its people,” the deputy premier pledged. Calls for restraint After the border clashes were reported, multiple countries urged Pakistan and Afghanistan to exercise restraint. Saudi Arabia, with which Pakistan recently signed a mutual defence deal , expressed concern at the skirmishes. “The kingdom calls for restraint, avoiding escalation, and embracing dialogue and wisdom to contribute to reducing tensions and maintaining security and stability in the region. “The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security, which will achieve stability and prosperity for the brotherly Pakistani and Afghan peoples.” Iranian top diplomat Abbas Araghchi called on Afghanistan and Pakistan “to exercise restraint” amid ongoing clashes. “Our position is that both sides must exercise restraint,” Araghchi said during a live interview with state television, adding that “stability” between the countries “contributes to regional stability”. Qatar’s foreign ministry urged both sides to prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint, and to work towards containing differences in a manner that helps to reduce tension and avoid escalation, in order to achieve regional security and stability. The foreign ministry reiterated Qatar’s support for all regional and international efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security, and affirmed its commitment to ensuring security and prosperity for the people of the two countries. Events preceding the border clashes The border clashes come against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. An instance of Pakistan asserting its position was when Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly,\n“Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out.” While Kabul maintains that it does not provide safe havens to terrorists, Afghan officials blamed Pakistan on Friday of bombing a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line and also violating the territory of capital Kabul. This was after an explosion was reported in Afghanistan on Thursday. The Foreign Office in Islamabad avoided directly acknowledging the incident in Kabul during a weekly briefing on Friday, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil. Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, the ISPR director general also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out any strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who was on a visit to India when the border clashes began, had condemned Thursday’s incident and Pakistan’s alleged role in it during a press conference in New Delhi. It was India’s — with which Pakistan’s ties have historically been tense — first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. On Friday, New Delhi also announced that it would be reopening its embassy in Kabul after four years. These developments followed a four-day military escalation between Pakistan and India in May — one of the deadliest in recent years — which led to a new low in relations between the two countries.",
      "title": "23 troops martyred, 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed in border skirmishes with Afghanistan: ISPR",
      "summary": "Twenty-three Pakistani troops have been martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Sunday. The statement comes after overnight skirmishes between the two sides, which began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border,” the ISPR statement said. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. “During overnight skirmishes, 23 brave sons of Pakistan embraced shahadat (martyrdom) while defending the territorial integrity of our beloved country against this outrageous action, while 29 soldiers [were] injured. “According to credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment, more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher, the ISPR added. Afghanistan claims it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. In response to Islamabad’s repeated calls to bar terrorists from using its territory for cross-border attacks, Afghanistan denies the allegation of allowing terrorist outfits to use it soil. But, the ISPR statement today said Afghanistan’s “cowardly action” of the overnight attack, which included fire and a few physical raids, was aimed at destabilising the border areas to “facilitate terrorism, furthering the nefarious designs of the terrorists”. According to a late-night report by state-run Radio Pakistan , which cited security sources, “Afghan forces carried out unprovoked firing at several locations”, Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Bahram Chah in Balochistan along the Pak-Afghan border. “Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban forces and affiliated khwarij ,” the ISPR said. “Precision fires and strikes, as well as physical raids, were directed against Taliban camps and posts, terrorist training facilities and support networks operating from [the] Afghan territory, including elements linked to Fitna-al-Khawarij , Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh. “All possible measures were taken to avoid collateral damage and to protect civilian lives.” The ISPR said that as a result of the unrelenting operations, multiple Taliban locations were destroyed along the border. Providing further details, it said 21 hostile positions on the Afghan side of the border were also briefly physically captured and multiple terrorist training camps, used to plan and facilitate attacks against Pakistan, were rendered inoperative. “The infra-structural damages to Taliban posts, camps, headquarters and support networks of terrorists are extensive, all along the border and range from tactical to operational depth.”. The ISPR further said: “The armed forces of Pakistan remain ever ready to protect the territorial integrity, life and property of the people of Pakistan. Our resolve to defend Pakistan’s territorial integrity and to defeat those who threaten our security is unwavering.” It underlined that while the people of Pakistan preferred constructive diplomacy and dialogue over violence and belligerence, “we will not tolerate the treacherous use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan”. “We have noted with concern that this serious provocation has occurred during the visit of the [Afghan] Taliban foreign minister to India, the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the region. “In the interest of regional peace and security, we call upon the Taliban government to take immediate and verifiable actions to neutralise the terrorist groups, inter alia, Fitna-al-Khawarij , Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh operating from their territory.” Otherwise, it asserted, Pakistan will continue to exercise its right to defend its people by persistently neutralising terror targets. It said that the Taliban government should “shun any ill-begotten notions and prioritise well-being, peace, prosperity and development of the Afghan people over irresponsible sabre-rattling”. The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Last night’s episode vindicates Pakistan’s long-standing position that the Taliban government is actively facilitating the terrorists. “If the Taliban government continues to sponsor terrorist outfits, in cohorts with India, for the shortsighted objective of destabilising the region, the people and the state of Pakistan will not rest until the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.” Afghan posts targeted by army Earlier, state broadcaster PTV News reported details of the Afghan posts targeted by the Pakistan Army. The sources said the army had launched “successful strikes at Durrani Camp, Manojba Camp Battalion Headquarters and Manojba Camp-2, Ghaznali Headquarters in Noshki Sector and neutralised them completely”. “Dozens of Taliban soldiers and Khwarij positioned in the camps and headquarters have been reportedly killed,” the report added. Security sources said that the army had also devastated the Afghan Taliban’s “most important Asmatullah Karar Camp” at Spin Boldak . They noted that the camp was the Taliban’s “one of the biggest” from where terrorist activities against Pakistan were carried out. Afghan Taliban and Khawarij hiding in the camp reportedly suffered “heavy losses”. Meanwhile, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan shared footage of a “second engagement and destruction” of the Asmatullah Karar camp at Spin Boldak. The second Battalion Headquarters of the Afghan Taliban in the Brabcha area, from “where Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists were launched into Pakistan”, was also targeted, as per the sources. In a series of posts on X, PTV News said Afghanistan’s Barikot base camp, Manojba Camp-3 , Karzai post, and Shapola Khula Taliban post were also destroyed. According to Radio Pakistan , security forces also occupied an “important” Afghan post in the Zhob sector and hoisted the Pakistani flag. “Humvee-armoured personnel carrier of the Afghan Taliban deployed at the post was destroyed as well in the attack,” the report said. Targeting an Afghan Tank position at the mountain peaks opposite Kurram, the forces eliminated “several tanks of the Afghan Taliban”, the state media reported, citing security sources. In an earlier Radio Pakistan report, security sources said Afghanistan’s Jandusar Post, Turkmenzai camp and Kharchar Fort had also been “completely destroyed”. On the other hand, Pakistan’s posts also came under attack in the Baramcha area of Chagai district, which borders Afghanistan’s Helmand province. “Afghan forces opened indiscriminate fire at Pakistani border posts with heavy weapons late on Saturday night,” a senior official said. Security sources stated that Afghan forces also tried to infiltrate into Pishin and Zhob districts. However, the attempts were defeated by Pakistani forces in the area. Afghan govt urges Pakistan to ‘desist from using force’ Following the border fighting, Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid urged Pakistan to “desist from using force as such actions will have negative consequences”. Addressing a press conference in Kabul, Mujahid alleged that “certain elements within the Pakistani security establishment want to destabilise Afghanistan“. He further warned that Kabul “possessed weapons to respond”, adding that the Afghanistan Islamic Emirate had made “efforts to resolve issues with Pakistan”. Earlier, the Afghan military said in a statement that “in retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces”, Taliban border forces in the east are “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas”. Taliban officials from the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika, Khost, and Helmand — all located on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan — had confirmed the clashes. The Afghan Ministry of Defence also confirmed earlier that Afghan forces had launched “retaliatory operations against Pakistani security forces” tonight. “The operations ended at midnight. If the opposing side violates Afghanistan’s territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly,” said the statement. Separately, it was reported that the Torkham border crossing had been closed for all kinds of traffic after the overnight firing exchanges at various locations, according to locals on the Pakistani side. Afghan official Qureshi Badloon also confirmed the closure to Dawn.com from Nangarhar. ‘No compromise on Pakistan’s sovereignty’ Earlier in the day, as reports with details of the skirmishes continued to emerge, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted there would be “no compromise” on Pakistan’s sovereignty. President Zardari, in a statement, noted that there were United Nations reports that “proved” terrorist attacks were carried out from the Afghan soil. However, he also stressed that bilateral respect and joint counter-terrorism efforts were the key to long-term regional peace. Asserting that no compromise will be made on Pakistan’s sovereignty, President Zardari said the country remained “firmly committed to safeguarding its national interests, regional sovereignty and security”. He noted that attacks launched “from the territory of the Interim Afghan government by India-backed Khawarij terrorists are a well-documented reality confirmed in successive United Nations Security Council (UNSC) monitoring reports”. The president pointed out that Pakistan had repeatedly “ made it clear that its civilians and security personnel are being targeted through the nexus of the Indian sponsored Khawarij and other terror groups”. President Zardari urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete and verifiable action” against anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from the Afghan soil, the statement added. He termed the menace of terrorism “sponsored by India” as the “greatest threat to regional peace and stability”. “Terrorism is a shared challenge and its burden cannot be placed on any single country,” the president was quoted as saying. In his statement, President Zardari termed it unfortunate that the current Afghan interim administration had “turned away from the just struggle of the oppressed people” of India-occupied Kashmir , “thereby doing injustice to both history and the Muslim ummah”. He reaffirmed that Pakistan will “never accept any disputed or misleading position on Jammu and Kashmir” and reiterated that India’s “unlawful claims over the territory” are contrary to international law and UNSC resolutions. The president highlighted Pakistan’s hosting of millions of Afghan refugees for over decades, saying it “demonstrated Islamic fraternity and exemplary neighbourliness”. However, he added that the “dignified repatriation of Afghan citizens” was in the interest of both countries and essential for sustainable peace. “President Zardari reaffirmed that Pakistan will continue to support the educational and humanitarian needs of the Afghan people, but no compromise will ever be made on Pakistan’s national sovereignty,” the statement said. The president emphasised that Pakistan had extended “every possible facilitation to Afghanistan in trade, economic connectivity, and people-to-people exchanges”. Mutual cooperation and economic partnership are the foundation for lasting peace and regional prosperity, he noted. President Zardari underscored that Pakistan desires a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan. He said brotherly relations must be based on mutual respect, security cooperation and a shared commitment to regional peace. He expressed hope that the interim Afghan government will prevent its soil from being used by “Khawarij and India-backed terrorist elements against Pakistan”, stressing that only joint and practical measures can guarantee enduring peace in the region. PM Shehbaz, too, strongly condemned the “provocation by Afghanistan in Pakistan’s border areas”. “There will be no compromise on Pakistan’s defence, and every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response,“ he asserted. “We are proud of the professional excellence of our armed forces,” the premier said, hailing the army’s “strong and effective response to Afghanistan’s aggression”. “The Pakistan Army not only gave a powerful response to Afghan aggression under the bold leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, but also destroyed several of their posts, forcing them to retreat,” the prime minister said. “Our defence is in strong hands, and we know well how to defend every inch of our motherland,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the army has always given a “crushing response to every form of external aggression”. The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had “repeatedly provided Afghanistan with information regarding terrorist elements such as Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan , who are using Afghan soil to launch attacks against Pakistan”. “Terrorist organisations are being supported by certain elements within Afghanistan,” he stated, expressing hope that the Afghan interim government will ensure its territory is not used by terrorist elements against Pakistan. In one of the first official statements by Pakistan, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi lauded the security forces for their “prompt” response. “Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,” Naqvi said on X. “Pakistan’s forces are alert and Afghanistan is being answered with stones for bricks. The people of Pakistan stand with the brave armed forces like a lead wall. Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India.” Expressing his “deep concern” over the attack from the Afghan side, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said “unprovoked firing and raids along Pak-Afghan border by the Taliban government is a serious provocation”. “Pakistan’s befitting response and strikes are against Taliban infrastructure and to neutralise Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil,” he asserted in a post on X. “Our defensive response is not targeted towards peace-loving Afghan civilian population.

He expressed Pakistan’s expectation from the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures against terrorist elements and their perpetrators that wish to derail Pak-Afghan relations”. “Pakistan will take all possible measures to defend its own territory, sovereignty and its people,” the deputy premier pledged.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan rode on a brilliant 93 from Imam-ul-Haq to reach 313-5 after a brief fightback from South Africa on the opening day of the first Test in Lahore on Sunday. Shan Masood hit 76, but Haq missed out on his hundred as Pakistan slumped to 199-5 as four wickets fell quickly. Mohammad Rizwan, 62 not out, and Salman Agha, unbeaten 52 at the close, rebuilt the innings during an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 114 in the final session on a spin-friendly Gaddafi Stadium pitch. Rizwan hit two fours and two sixes in his 12th Test half-century while Agha had two fours and a six in reaching his 10th fifty. Pakistan dominated most of the first two sessions, but then had a mini-\ncollapse from 163-1 to 199-5 as they lost four wickets for 36 runs, the last three without adding a run either side of the tea interval. Spinner Prenelan Subrayen trapped Masood lbw for 76, including nine fours and a six, to end a 161-run stand with Haq. Left-arm spinner Senuran Muthusamy then had Haq caught at short-leg by Tony de Zorzi, after a 236-minute knock that included seven fours and a six. Next ball — the last before tea — Muthusamy had Saud Shakeel caught and bowled to bring South Africa back into the game at 199-4. Local hero Babar Azam fell for 23, trapped leg-before by off-spinner Simon Harmer after the interval to make it 199-5 and leave a good 10,000 holiday crowd disappointed. South Africa could have been in a better position had they not dropped Masood on 61 and Haq on 72 with Subrayen the unlucky bowler on both occasions. With the pitch likely to turn, Masood opted to bat after winning the toss and named specialist spin duo Noman Ali and Sajid Khan in the team Pakistan lost opener Abdullah Shafique leg before to pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada off the third ball of the day. South African captain Aiden Markram turned to his spinners in the sixth over and by lunch had used all three — Subrayen, Harmer and Muthusamy. But there were no further dramas in the opening session as Pakistan reached 107-1 at lunch after Haq had brought up his 10th Test fifty. The two-match series is part of the new World Test Championship two-year cycle. South Africa won the title by beating Australia in June. The two-match series is part of the new World Test Championship two-year cycle. South Africa won the title by beating Australia in June. The Shan Masood-led hosts, who finished an embarrassing last in the nine-team table of the 2023-25 WTC, must raise their game significantly in all departments if they are to resist Aiden Markram-captained tourists who claimed their maiden WTC crown by beating Australia in the final at Lord’s last year. The Gaddafi Stadium did not host any Test in the previous WTC cycle after the venue was used for the third and final Test between Pakistan and Australia in March 2022. South Africa, on their last tour to Pakistan in 2021 , lost a two-Test series 2-0. While both the captains expected a spin-friendly track at the Gaddafi Stadium, there were doubts over the inclusion of key Pakistan off-spinner Sajid, who was suffering from a viral infection but did practise with the team yesteday. Ahead of the game, Shan said taking 20 wickets, rather than piling up big scores, will be key to winning the Test series. “We don’t want flat tracks where matches end in draws,” he remarked. In his presser, Markram acknowledged Pakistan’s plan to prepare spinning pitches at home and said that his players were ready for the challenge. “As a team not heavily exposed to these conditions, it is going to be exciting and a great opportunity for us to get things right here.” Teams: Pakistan: Shan Masood (captain), Imam-ul-Haq, Abdullah Shafique, Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Salman Ali Agha, Saud Shakeel, Hasan Ali, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Noman Ali, Sajid Khan South Africa: Aiden Markram (captain), Dewald Brevis, Tony de Zorzi, Simon Harmer, Wiaan Mulder, Senuran Muthusamy, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Prenelan Subrayen, Kyle Verreynne Umpires: Chris Brown (NZ) and Rod Tucker (AUS) TV umpire: Sharfuddoula Saikat (BAN) Match referee: Ranjan Madugalle (SRI)",

South Africa, on their last tour to Pakistan in 2021 , lost a two-Test series 2-0. While both the captains expected a spin-friendly track at the Gaddafi Stadium, there were doubts over the inclusion of key Pakistan off-spinner Sajid, who was suffering from a viral infection but did practise with the team yesteday. Ahead of the game, Shan said taking 20 wickets, rather than piling up big scores, will be key to winning the Test series. “We don’t want flat tracks where matches end in draws,” he remarked. In his presser, Markram acknowledged Pakistan’s plan to prepare spinning pitches at home and said that his players were ready for the challenge. “As a team not heavily exposed to these conditions, it is going to be exciting and a great opportunity for us to get things right here.” Teams: Pakistan: Shan Masood (captain), Imam-ul-Haq, Abdullah Shafique, Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Salman Ali Agha, Saud Shakeel, Hasan Ali, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Noman Ali, Sajid Khan South Africa: Aiden Markram (captain), Dewald Brevis, Tony de Zorzi, Simon Harmer, Wiaan Mulder, Senuran Muthusamy, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Prenelan Subrayen, Kyle Verreynne Umpires: Chris Brown (NZ) and Rod Tucker (AUS) TV umpire: Sharfuddoula Saikat (BAN) Match referee: Ranjan Madugalle (SRI)",

      "summary_orig": "The PTI’s Sohail Afridi on Sunday submitted his papers to contest the chief minister elections due to be held during a session of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly tomorrow , according to the assembly’s secretary. Afridi, a member of the provincial assembly hailing from Bara, was nominated for the office by party founder Imran Khan after sitting KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announced his resignation earlier this week. This has prompted an election to decide KP’s next chief executive. Secretary Syed Muhammad Mahir told reporters that Afridi’s papers, as well as those of the three opposition candidates — contesting on behalf of the PPP, PML-N and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) — have been received and approved. “The nomination papers of the PTI’s Sohail Afridi have been approved,” he said. “The papers of Arbab Zarq of the People’s Party, Sardar Jahan of the PML-N and Maulana Lutfur Rehman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-F have also been approved for the Chief Minister’s post.” A video shared by the PTI on X showed Afridi signing documents, with the caption reading that he has submitted his papers to contest the CM elections. When asked by a Dawn.com correspondent about federal ministers’ allegations that he was in contact with proscribed organisations, Afridi told Dawn.com that the Centre has “declared we are all banned groups, we are all terrorists and they have filed all of the FIRs (first information reports) against us”. Meanwhile, a delegation of candidates called on the Awami National Party (ANP) at their Bacha Khan Markaz headquarters in Peshawar. The delegation was led by PTI Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan and comprised Sher Ali Arbab, Ali Khan Jadoon, Shaukat Yousafzai, Malik Adeel Iqbal, Irfan Saleem and other leaders, according to PTI Deputy Information Secretary and social media head Ikram Katahna, who was also part of the delegation. “A democratic process is going to take place tomorrow, for which we are contacting democratic people,” Junaid said. “The PTI has a numerical majority in KP. We want to elect Sohail Afridi unopposed to stop undemocratic characters.” ANP KP President Mian Iftikhar Hussain, in response, said that the party would “not be a part of any unconstitutional and undemocratic process” and that it would speak with their leadership after consultations. The PTI delegation also met Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam today, with Junaid stating that the delegation had come in the hope of making a joint decision “like in the past”, according to Katahna. “We have to come together to solve the problems the country is going through,” Junaid said. “The PTI has a clear majority in the assembly, and KP cannot afford further issues or political instability at this time. We want to elect Sohail Afridi unopposed.” Muqam replied that he would consult federal leadership “as per the traditions of the province” and inform the delegation after his talks. Outgoing CM Gandapur resigned his seat over party founder Imran’s concerns regarding a spike in terrorism in the province. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja on Wednesday confirmed Gandapur’s resignation during a media briefing, stating that the decision was made by Imran, who he said told him about the “background of this in detail and also ordered me to put this before you”. He pointed out that the PTI had a “clear majority” in the KP Assembly through which Afridi would be elected as the next chief minister. Raja also quoted Imran as raising concerns over the spike in terrorism in PTI-ruled KP. He said: “There is the worst terrorism situation in KP. There have been record incidents this year […] the lives lost and martyrdoms so far, there is no example found of this.” “Khan sahib is very sad, the incident that happened in Orakzai , Khan sahib said there is no choice for him now, but to make the change [in KP CM].”",

      "summary_orig": "Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Sunday urged the PTI and other political parties to unite in backing the “charter for a stable Pakistan” , saying the initiative had become more crucial than ever following last night’s border escalation with Afghanistan. According to a statement from the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), overnight skirmishes between Kabul and Islamabad erupted on the night of Oct 11-12, after “Afghan Taliban and India-backed militants launched an unprovoked attack along the Pak-Afghan border”. Pakistan said its forces responded decisively, killing over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, while 23 Pakistani soldiers were martyred. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Afghanistan to rein in the Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for militants linked to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — saying the group operates from Afghan soil. Kabul, however, has denied any involvement. Speaking during a media briefing in Lahore today, Sanaullah said that given the current circumstances, when the country’s stability was more important than anything else, all political parties needed to adopt a unified stance. “At this moment, I say to the PTI leadership: you may continue to criticise us and chant slogans against the government by all means, but you must stand with Pakistan, with its armed forces, and with its martyrs,” he said. “If you stand with Pakistan and the armed forces, a way forward will open for you.” PTI has opposed renewed military operations, arguing they have repeatedly failed to curb terrorism and only displaced civilians, fuelling resentment in affected areas. The party insists militancy should be tackled through dialogue and governance reforms rather than force, warning that fresh offensives without a political strategy could further destabilise Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A day earlier, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had assailed the PTI-led KP government for “facilitating terrorists, sowing division, and undermining national security.” Sanaullah said at this crucial hour, political leadership should fulfil its responsibility, and invited other parties to join the ‘charter for a stable Pakistan’, or ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’, as well, a concept introduced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to lay the basis for the greater national interest. “I call upon all political parties, political leaders and all parliamentarians — whether members of the provincial assemblies, members of the National Assembly or the Senate. “I invite and appeal to them to accept Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s request that he made on Independence Day that we should back the charter.” He said national consolidation had become more important than ever before due to the circumstances. “Come and unite on the ‘charter for stable Pakistan’, and discuss the proposals that the prime minister has put forward,” he stressed. Talking about the escalation with Afghan Taliban forces, he said: “Today, we have dealt a blow to a disgraced and hidden enemy. We have given the enemy, one that was apparently attacking us from the shadows, a crushing answer.” He said that because of the Field Marshal Asim Munir’s courageous policy and the bravery of the armed forces, “the whole nation witnessed this honourable moment which they had not seen in some 78 years.” More to follow",

      "summary_orig": "Erling Haaland scored a hat-trick to pass 50 international goals in record time as Norway cruised to a 5-0 thrashing of Israel on Saturday, edging closer to qualifying for a first World Cup finals since 1998. Before the match in Oslo, hundreds of people attended a pro-Palestinian demonstration, chanting “Free Palestine” to protest against Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza, AFP journalists reported. Norwegian police dispersed a gathering of pro-Palestinian activists with tear gas and made several arrests. Inside the Ullevaal Stadium, several dozen Israeli fans waved their country’s flag and a banner reading “Let the Ball Talk!”. Norway now lead Group I with 18 points, six more than second-placed Italy,\nwho beat Estonia 3-1 in Tallinn to stay on track for qualification. The comfortable win in Oslo leaves Norway firmly in control of the group as they seek a place at next year’s finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico. After a meek performance, Israel take on Italy in Udine on Tuesday knowing they must win to keep alive their fading hopes of qualifying. Haaland became the fastest player in men’s international football to reach 50 goals for his country and now boasts 51 goals for Norway in just 46 games. His early penalty was saved by Israel goalkeeper Daniel Peretz but the referee ordered the spot-kick to be retaken for encroachment inside the area, only for Peretz to parry away Haaland’s second effort. But Norway forged ahead in the 18th minute through an Anan Khalaili own goal, before Haaland raced clear to score. Norway got their third from an Idan Nachmias own goal. Manchester City forward Haaland added his second with a powerful header before nodding in to complete his sixth hat-trick for his country with 18 minutes left. Italy, attempting to reach their first World Cup finals since 2014, moved a step closer thanks to goals from Moise Kean, Mateo Retegui and Pio Esposito in Tallinn. The Italians move three points ahead of Israel in second place in Group I, which offers a play-off spot. Italy’s meeting with Israel is expected to be a tense affair, surrounded by pro-Palestinian protests and only 5,000 tickets have been sold. Missed Ronaldo spot-kick In Lisbon, Cristiano Ronaldo had a second-half penalty saved by the legs of Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhim Kelleher but Portugal stole the win in injury time when Ruben Neves scored with a header. Neves wore the number 21 shirt in tribute to his late international teammate Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash this year. Jota wore 21 for Portugal. The hard-fought 1-0 victory puts the Portuguese five points clear of Hungary at the top of Group F. The Hungarians beat Armenia 2-0 and the Irish and Armenia face a do-or-die match in Dublin on Tuesday. European champions Spain kept their perfect record in qualifying intact by defeating Georgia 2-0 thanks to goals from Yeremy Pino and Mikel Oyarzabal. Turkiye remain three points behind them in Group E thanks to a thumping 6-1 defeat of Bulgaria in Sofia. Albania have never qualified for a World Cup but have a chance of being in the finals next year after a 1-0 win at Serbia thanks to a goal from Rey Manaj. The Albanians are second in Group K behind England and four points clear of third-placed Serbia.",

      "title_orig": "Australian airline Qantas says millions of customers’ data leaked online",
      "summary_orig": "Australian airline Qantas said on Sunday that data from 5.7 million customers stolen in a major cyberattack this year had been shared online, part of a leak affecting dozens of firms. Disney, Google, Ikea, Toyota, McDonald’s, and fellow airlines Air France and KLM are also reported to have had data stolen in a cyberattack targeting software firm Salesforce, with the information now being held to ransom.\nSalesforce said this month it was “aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors”. Qantas confirmed in July that hackers had targeted one of its customer contact centres, breaching a computer system used by a third party now known to have been Salesforce. They secured access to sensitive information such as customer names, email addresses, phone numbers and birthdays, the blue-chip Australian company said. No further breaches have taken place since, and the company is cooperating with Australian security services. “Qantas is one of a number of companies globally that has had data released by cyber criminals following the airline’s cyber incident in early July, where customer data was stolen via a third-party platform,” the company said in a statement. Most of the data leaked was names, email addresses and frequent flyer details, the firm said. But some of the data included customers’ “business or home address, date of birth, phone number, gender and meal preferences”. “No credit card details, personal financial information or passport details were impacted,” Qantas said. It also said it had obtained a legal injunction with the Supreme Court of New South Wales, where the firm is headquartered, to prevent the stolen data from being “accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published”. Cybersecurity expert Troy Hunt told AFP that it would do little to prevent the spread of the data. “It’s frankly ridiculous,” he said. “It obviously doesn’t stop criminals at all anywhere, and it also really doesn’t have any effect on people outside of Australia.” Hackers ‘laying siege’ In response to questions about the leak, tech giant Google pointed AFP to an August statement in which it said one of its corporate Salesforce servers had been targeted. It did not confirm if the data had been leaked. “Google responded to the activity, performed an impact analysis and has completed email notifications to the potentially affected businesses,” Melanie Lombardi, head of Google Cloud Security Communications, said. Cybersecurity analysts have linked the hack to individuals with ties to an alliance of cybercriminals called Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. Research group Unit 42 said in a note that the group had “asserted responsibility for laying siege to customer Salesforce tenants as part of a coordinated effort to steal data and hold it for ransom”. The hackers had reportedly set an October 10 deadline for ransom payment. ‘Oldest tricks in the book’ The hackers stole the sensitive data using a social engineering technique, referring to a tactic of manipulating victims by pretending to be a company representative or other trusted person, experts said. The FBI last month issued a warning about such attacks targeting Salesforce.\nThe agency said hackers posing as IT workers had tricked customer support employees into granting them access to sensitive data. “They have been very effective,” expert Hunt said. “And it hasn’t been using any sophisticated technical exploits… they have exploited really the oldest tricks in the books.” The hack of data from Australia’s biggest airline comes as a string of major cyberattacks in the country has raised concerns about the protection of personal data. Qantas apologised last year after a glitch with its mobile app exposed some passengers’ names and travel details.

      "summary_en": "Australian airline Qantas said on Sunday that data from 5.7 million customers stolen in a major cyberattack this year had been shared online, part of a leak affecting dozens of firms. Disney, Google, Ikea, Toyota, McDonald’s, and fellow airlines Air France and KLM are also reported to have had data stolen in a cyberattack targeting software firm Salesforce, with the information now being held to ransom.\nSalesforce said this month it was “aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors”. Qantas confirmed in July that hackers had targeted one of its customer contact centres, breaching a computer system used by a third party now known to have been Salesforce. They secured access to sensitive information such as customer names, email addresses, phone numbers and birthdays, the blue-chip Australian company said. No further breaches have taken place since, and the company is cooperating with Australian security services. “Qantas is one of a number of companies globally that has had data released by cyber criminals following the airline’s cyber incident in early July, where customer data was stolen via a third-party platform,” the company said in a statement. Most of the data leaked was names, email addresses and frequent flyer details, the firm said. But some of the data included customers’ “business or home address, date of birth, phone number, gender and meal preferences”. “No credit card details, personal financial information or passport details were impacted,” Qantas said. It also said it had obtained a legal injunction with the Supreme Court of New South Wales, where the firm is headquartered, to prevent the stolen data from being “accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published”. Cybersecurity expert Troy Hunt told AFP that it would do little to prevent the spread of the data. “It’s frankly ridiculous,” he said. “It obviously doesn’t stop criminals at all anywhere, and it also really doesn’t have any effect on people outside of Australia.” Hackers ‘laying siege’ In response to questions about the leak, tech giant Google pointed AFP to an August statement in which it said one of its corporate Salesforce servers had been targeted. It did not confirm if the data had been leaked. “Google responded to the activity, performed an impact analysis and has completed email notifications to the potentially affected businesses,” Melanie Lombardi, head of Google Cloud Security Communications, said. Cybersecurity analysts have linked the hack to individuals with ties to an alliance of cybercriminals called Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. Research group Unit 42 said in a note that the group had “asserted responsibility for laying siege to customer Salesforce tenants as part of a coordinated effort to steal data and hold it for ransom”. The hackers had reportedly set an October 10 deadline for ransom payment. ‘Oldest tricks in the book’ The hackers stole the sensitive data using a social engineering technique, referring to a tactic of manipulating victims by pretending to be a company representative or other trusted person, experts said. The FBI last month issued a warning about such attacks targeting Salesforce.\nThe agency said hackers posing as IT workers had tricked customer support employees into granting them access to sensitive data. “They have been very effective,” expert Hunt said. “And it hasn’t been using any sophisticated technical exploits… they have exploited really the oldest tricks in the books.” The hack of data from Australia’s biggest airline comes as a string of major cyberattacks in the country has raised concerns about the protection of personal data. Qantas apologised last year after a glitch with its mobile app exposed some passengers’ names and travel details.

      "summary_orig": "The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon said Sunday that one of its members was wounded by an Israeli grenade dropped near a UN position in the country’s south, the third incident of its kind in just over a month. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has been working with the Lebanese army to support a November ceasefire that sought to end more than a year of hostilities between Israel and militant group Hezbollah that culminated in two months of open war. “Just before noon yesterday, an Israeli drone dropped a grenade that exploded near a UNIFIL position” in Kfar Kela, the force said in a statement published on Sunday. “One peacekeeper was lightly injured and received medical assistance.” Earlier this month, UNIFIL said Israeli drones had dropped multiple grenades near peacekeepers providing security for workers clearing rubble left over from the war. And in a similar episode in September, UNIFIL said Israeli drones had dropped four grenades near peacekeepers, with Israel insisting at the time that there had been “no intentional fire” directed at the force. UNIFIL said Saturday’s incident represented “another serious violation of resolution 1701 and concerning disregard for the safety of peacekeepers”. UN Security Council Resolution 1701 ended a 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and formed the basis of the November ceasefire. Under the US-brokered ceasefire , Hezbollah and Israel were both required to withdraw from south Lebanon, while UNIFIL deployed there alongside the Lebanese military, in part to help dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure. Israel has kept up regular strikes in Lebanon on what it says are Hezbollah targets despite the truce, and has maintained its troops in five locations it deems strategic. “We again call on the (Israeli army) to cease attacks on or near peacekeepers, who are working to rebuild the stability that both Israel and Lebanon have committed to restore,” the UN peacekeeping force said. UNIFIL has been deployed since 1978 to separate Israel and Lebanon, and numbers some 10,000 personnel from almost 50 countries. In August, the Security Council voted to end UNIFIL’s mission in 2027.",

      "summary_orig": "New Delhi: India’s opposition Congress party criticised the Narendra Modi government on Saturday over the absence of women journalists from a press conference addressed by visiting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asking the prime minister to clarify his position on the matter. “Mr Modi, when you allow the exclusion of women journalists from a public forum, you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them. In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space. “Your silence in the face of such discrimination exposes the emptiness of your slogans on Nari Shakti,” Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, said in a post on X. Mr Gandhi’s post followed Priyanka Vadra’s earlier message, in which she asked whether the prime minister’s recognition of women’s rights was “just convenient posturing from one election to another”, and questioned how such an “insult to some of India’s most competent women” could have been permitted. “Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India,” she said on X. The press conference, addressed by the Afghan foreign minister on Friday was restricted to a limited group of male journalists, with women reporters conspicuously absent. Mr Muttaqi held the interaction at the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, hours after holding wide-ranging talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Taliban decision While there has been no official comment from the government of India, it is learnt that the decision on media invitations was taken by Taliban officials accompanying the visiting minister. Sources said the Indian side had suggested to the Afghan delegation that women journalists be included among the invitees. “(Tali)ban on female journalists in India. Shocking and unacceptable that the govt of India agreed to it — and that too in New Delhi on the eve of the Inter­na­ti­onal Day of the Girl Child,” Con­g­ress communications chief Jai­ram Ramesh said in a post on X. Former finance minister P. Chidambaram, expressing his personal view, said: “The men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited).” Communist Party of India general secretary D. Raja, tagging External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in his X post, asked: “Was it just Taliban misogyny or a tacit endorsement of it on Indian soil? The Republic of India is built on equality. We are the nation which gave women voting rights from day one, when many Western countries lagged behind. “To allow such exclusion here is blasphemy to our constitutional spirit.” Mr Raja urged the ministry of external affairs to explain how it agreed to “permit this discriminatory spectacle”. “This is not a diplomatic nuance. This is nourishment to patriarchal ideology that wants to erase half the world from public life. We must call it out, without hesitation,” he added. The high-profile visit has stirred strong reactions, including from Pakistan. Mr Jaishankar used the visit to push India’s agenda in Kabul. While the countries have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity, Mr Jaishankar told Mr Muttaqi: “These are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We appreciate your sensitivity towards India’s security concerns. “Your solidarity with us in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack was noteworthy. India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghan­is­tan. Closer cooperation between us contributes to your national development, as well as regional stability and resilience. To enha­nce that, I am pleased to anno­u­nce today the upgrading of India’s technical mission in Kabul to the status of embassy of India.” Published in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",

Mr Gandhi’s post followed Priyanka Vadra’s earlier message, in which she asked whether the prime minister’s recognition of women’s rights was “just convenient posturing from one election to another”, and questioned how such an “insult to some of India’s most competent women” could have been permitted. “Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India,” she said on X. The press conference, addressed by the Afghan foreign minister on Friday was restricted to a limited group of male journalists, with women reporters conspicuously absent. Mr Muttaqi held the interaction at the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, hours after holding wide-ranging talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Taliban decision While there has been no official comment from the government of India, it is learnt that the decision on media invitations was taken by Taliban officials accompanying the visiting minister. Sources said the Indian side had suggested to the Afghan delegation that women journalists be included among the invitees. “(Tali)ban on female journalists in India. Shocking and unacceptable that the govt of India agreed to it — and that too in New Delhi on the eve of the Inter­na­ti­onal Day of the Girl Child,” Con­g­ress communications chief Jai­ram Ramesh said in a post on X. Former finance minister P. Chidambaram, expressing his personal view, said: “The men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited).” Communist Party of India general secretary D. Raja, tagging External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in his X post, asked: “Was it just Taliban misogyny or a tacit endorsement of it on Indian soil? The Republic of India is built on equality. We are the nation which gave women voting rights from day one, when many Western countries lagged behind. “To allow such exclusion here is blasphemy to our constitutional spirit.” Mr Raja urged the ministry of external affairs to explain how it agreed to “permit this discriminatory spectacle”. “This is not a diplomatic nuance. This is nourishment to patriarchal ideology that wants to erase half the world from public life. We must call it out, without hesitation,” he added. The high-profile visit has stirred strong reactions, including from Pakistan. Mr Jaishankar used the visit to push India’s agenda in Kabul. While the countries have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity, Mr Jaishankar told Mr Muttaqi: “These are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We appreciate your sensitivity towards India’s security concerns. “Your solidarity with us in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack was noteworthy. India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghan­is­tan. Closer cooperation between us contributes to your national development, as well as regional stability and resilience. To enha­nce that, I am pleased to anno­u­nce today the upgrading of India’s technical mission in Kabul to the status of embassy of India.” Published in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",

The M2 motorway connects Lahore to Islamabad, while the M3 motorway links Lahore to Abdul Hakeem in Khanewal district, where it joins the M4 leading to Faisalabad and Multan.

TLP spokesperson Usman Naushahi told Dawn.com that protesters remained in Muridke and Sadhoke, saying, “We have not gone further yet.” While internet service is slow in the area, mobile data services are working, according to citizens.

Yesterday, police said a gathering of 300 people, carrying TLP flags, posters, and banners, reached the crossing from Dhoke Abbasi and surrounding areas. The rally chanted anti-government slogans and delivered speeches, provoking people to join the TLP protest. The protesters also blocked the GT Road and refused to clear it when asked by the police. In response, the police used force, arresting 90 protesters and seizing sound systems, while others escaped. Last night, the police also decided to lift some blockades from a few roads.",

      "title_orig": "Beijing blames US for raising trade tensions, defends rare earth curbs",
      "summary_orig": "China called President Donald Trump’s latest US tariffs on Chinese goods hypocritical on Sunday and defended its curbs on exports of rare earth elements and equipment, but stopped short of imposing new levies on US products. On Friday, Trump responded to Beijing’s most recent export controls by imposing additional tariffs of 100 per cent on China’s US-bound exports, along with new export controls on critical software by November 1. The revived trade tensions have rattled Wall Street, sending Big Tech shares tumbling, worried foreign companies dependent on China’s production of processed rare earths and rare earth magnets, and could derail a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping tentatively scheduled for later this month. Responding to Trump The Chinese commerce ministry’s statement on Sunday was Beijing’s first direct response to Trump’s lengthy Truth Social post on Friday, where he accused Beijing of suddenly raising trade tensions after an uneasy truce was reached six months ago between the world’s two largest economies, allowing them to trade goods without sky-high tariff rates. “Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,” Trump said. The commerce ministry said in an equally lengthy statement that its export controls on rare-earth elements followed a series of US measures since bilateral trade talks in Madrid last month. Beijing cited the addition of Chinese companies to a US trade blacklist and Washington’s imposition of port fees on China-linked ships as examples. “The US actions have severely harmed China’s interests and undermined the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks, and China is resolutely opposed to them,” the ministry said. Beijing stopped short of explicitly connecting these US actions to its export curbs on rare-earth elements, saying its curbs were motivated by concern about these materials’ military applications at a time of “frequent military conflicts”. It also held off on announcing a corresponding levy on China-bound US imports, unlike earlier in the year, when both superpowers progressively ratcheted up tariffs on each other until the US rate was 145pc while China’s was 125pc. “Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the commerce ministry said, adding China would take corresponding measures if the US did not correct its course. Path of Negotiations China’s decision not to immediately respond in kind to Trump’s opening salvo in this latest round of trade tensions could leave the door open for both countries to negotiate a de-escalation, analysts said. “By clarifying the rationale behind its retaliatory measures, Beijing is also outlining a potential path forward for negotiations. The ball is now in the US court,” said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, managing director at strategic advisory firm GreenPoint. But Hutong Research said in a note on Saturday that if Beijing chooses not to respond to Trump’s 100pc tariff hike, it may signal that Beijing no longer prioritises a long-term deal with him, reflecting diminished confidence in his ability to restrain hawks or stick to commitments. “Key watchpoints now: Whether Beijing moves to freeze or complicate the TikTok sale , given its political symbolism. Proceeding with the sale under current conditions would be seen as a major concession,” the research firm said. China says export controls are not export bans The commerce ministry also countered Trump’s narrative that China was using its dominance in processed rare earths and rare earth magnets to attack all countries, not just the US. “We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,” Trump said on Friday on Truth Social. China produces over 90pc of the world’s processed rare earths and rare earth magnets. The 17 rare earths are vital materials in products ranging from electric vehicles to aircraft engines and military radars. Exports of 12 of them are restricted after China’s commerce ministry on Thursday added five — holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium — along with related materials. The commerce ministry statement on Sunday sought to reassure foreign companies spooked by the latest export curbs, promising to promote compliant trade by granting general licenses and license exemptions. “China’s export controls are not export bans,” it said. “Any export applications for civilian use that comply with regulations will be approved, and relevant enterprises need not worry.”",

      "summary_orig": "WHETHER it is a comprehensive peace or a mere pause in the genocide to secure the release of Israeli hostages will become apparent in the coming days. What is clear is that the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Gaza and their backers have learnt a lesson about the significance of the war of narratives. And they aren’t wasting any time, given the speed with which they are moving to capture control over the means of propagating and controlling the narrative. A cursory glance at social media platform ownership and control abundantly demonstrates this. A day into the ceasefire has already seen a massive flood of pro-Israel content on all timelines. With the use of algorithms and AI, the course of discussions is being altered to favour one side and the visibility of the other is being severely restricted. How do those on the other side, despite their staggering numbers, counter this? The surge in support for the just Palestinian cause and the outpouring of outrage in Western cities at the Gaza genocide have been a characteristic response to the Israeli Occupation Forces’ (IOF) two-year brutal genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip. It’s difficult to say how any new conflict or renewed genocide will see content freely make its way to social media platforms. Protesters have also found reprehensible the Israeli settler violence against the Palestinians, their displacement, the destruction of their infrastructure and their means of livelihood in the West Bank. These protesters have braved often ruthless police violence (as in Germany ) and hundreds of arrests, as we saw in Britain , including of the infirm and elderly, for simply demonstrating with placards in support of an organisation designated ‘terrorist’, at the behest of the Labour touts of an Israeli arms manufacturer. These street protests have shown how the genocidal Israeli apartheid state has lost the war for the moral high ground after decades of finding many a sympathetic ear for its victimhood narrative. This change in the public sentiment created a chasm between the genocide-supporting Western European governments and their people. Perhaps for Israel, even worse was the change in mood in America where the apartheid state has always enjoyed unrivalled precedence owing in no insignificant measure to the funding of politicians — from White House incumbents to Congress members — by billionaire ‘friends of Israel’ and organisations such as the AIPAC. In addition to the Israeli ban on foreign journalists reporting from Gaza, the legacy media itself may have covered the Gaza genocide with the necessary filters and censorship in place to offer a sanitised view of the murders of thousands of people, including some 20,000 children, following the Oct 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel in which some 800 civilians and nearly 400 security personnel were killed. It is not clear how many fell to Hamas and how many became victims of the Hannibal Directive of the IOF whereby the authorities prefer to kill their own citizens rather than have them fall into ‘enemy’ hands and become hostages and a bargaining chip. A few segments of the Israeli media that remain independent have carried gunship pilot testimonies about this. As social media images continued to paint a picture of the brutally disproportionate IOF response in Gaza with the number of dead or amputee children running into several thousands, public opinion started to change in the US. Several recent opinion polls support this suggestion. A majority of young Democrats started looking at Israel negatively and supporting the occupied Palestinian cause. But even more ominously for Israel and its unshakeable pillar of support, President Donald J. Trump, the genocide created a split within the latter’s MAGA movement. With leading MAGA figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens beginning to question the wisdom of blind US support to Israel, and its psychopathic leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the game was beginning to turn. Trump could neither ignore nor attack this influential segment of his diehard support base. This split, along with the Trump family’s business ties with the mega rich Arab Gulf states, whose initial indifference to the Gaza genocide changed dramatically after Israel’s missile attack on Qatari soil, may have guided his hand to eventually ask Israel to pause its ruthless genocidal military campaign against Gaza’s Palestinians. While X was already in the hands of one of Israel’s uncompromising supporters, Elon Musk, and with Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) controlled by the evil manipulator Mark Zuckerberg (whose track record of being pro-Israel and also backing right-wing causes is exactly like Musk’s), the very influential TikTok was the only social media platform that represented all user opinion regardless of who it favoured. Brandishing the threat of shutting it down, Trump forced the Chinese owners to sell off TikTok US operations to Larry Ellison, the Oracle’s multibillionaire owner, whose son also owns/controls Paramount and, therefore, all the content on the influential CBS News in the US. Ellison is a diehard friend/funder of Israel and IOF. With the wealth and social media empires owned by three of the richest men in the world — their collective worth surpassing a trillion and a half dollars — now firmly in the control of the genocidal Zionists’ sympathisers and supporters, it will be difficult to say how any new conflict or renewed genocide in Gaza will see content freely making its way to these platforms. Loopholes that existed earlier and afforded more openness will surely be plugged now. Israel killed over 200 journalists in Gaza and blocked foreign media from the Strip to stop news trickling out to shape public opinion. It failed mainly because of social media images. Will this tightening of the grip via algorithms on social media change the flow of information and its impact on global public opinion? Or can the sheer numbers of users force these commercial enterprises not to censor at will? The writer is a former editor of Dawn. abbas.nasir@hotmail.com Published in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",

      "title": "Peace or genocide pause?",
      "summary": "WHETHER it is a comprehensive peace or a mere pause in the genocide to secure the release of Israeli hostages will become apparent in the coming days. What is clear is that the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Gaza and their backers have learnt a lesson about the significance of the war of narratives. And they aren’t wasting any time, given the speed with which they are moving to capture control over the means of propagating and controlling the narrative. A cursory glance at social media platform ownership and control abundantly demonstrates this. A day into the ceasefire has already seen a massive flood of pro-Israel content on all timelines. With the use of algorithms and AI, the course of discussions is being altered to favour one side and the visibility of the other is being severely restricted. How do those on the other side, despite their staggering numbers, counter this? The surge in support for the just Palestinian cause and the outpouring of outrage in Western cities at the Gaza genocide have been a characteristic response to the Israeli Occupation Forces’ (IOF) two-year brutal genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip. It’s difficult to say how any new conflict or renewed genocide will see content freely make its way to social media platforms. Protesters have also found reprehensible the Israeli settler violence against the Palestinians, their displacement, the destruction of their infrastructure and their means of livelihood in the West Bank. These protesters have braved often ruthless police violence (as in Germany ) and hundreds of arrests, as we saw in Britain , including of the infirm and elderly, for simply demonstrating with placards in support of an organisation designated ‘terrorist’, at the behest of the Labour touts of an Israeli arms manufacturer. These street protests have shown how the genocidal Israeli apartheid state has lost the war for the moral high ground after decades of finding many a sympathetic ear for its victimhood narrative. This change in the public sentiment created a chasm between the genocide-supporting Western European governments and their people. Perhaps for Israel, even worse was the change in mood in America where the apartheid state has always enjoyed unrivalled precedence owing in no insignificant measure to the funding of politicians — from White House incumbents to Congress members — by billionaire ‘friends of Israel’ and organisations such as the AIPAC. In addition to the Israeli ban on foreign journalists reporting from Gaza, the legacy media itself may have covered the Gaza genocide with the necessary filters and censorship in place to offer a sanitised view of the murders of thousands of people, including some 20,000 children, following the Oct 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel in which some 800 civilians and nearly 400 security personnel were killed. It is not clear how many fell to Hamas and how many became victims of the Hannibal Directive of the IOF whereby the authorities prefer to kill their own citizens rather than have them fall into ‘enemy’ hands and become hostages and a bargaining chip. A few segments of the Israeli media that remain independent have carried gunship pilot testimonies about this. As social media images continued to paint a picture of the brutally disproportionate IOF response in Gaza with the number of dead or amputee children running into several thousands, public opinion started to change in the US. Several recent opinion polls support this suggestion. A majority of young Democrats started looking at Israel negatively and supporting the occupied Palestinian cause. But even more ominously for Israel and its unshakeable pillar of support, President Donald J. Trump, the genocide created a split within the latter’s MAGA movement. With leading MAGA figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens beginning to question the wisdom of blind US support to Israel, and its psychopathic leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the game was beginning to turn. Trump could neither ignore nor attack this influential segment of his diehard support base. This split, along with the Trump family’s business ties with the mega rich Arab Gulf states, whose initial indifference to the Gaza genocide changed dramatically after Israel’s missile attack on Qatari soil, may have guided his hand to eventually ask Israel to pause its ruthless genocidal military campaign against Gaza’s Palestinians. While X was already in the hands of one of Israel’s uncompromising supporters, Elon Musk, and with Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) controlled by the evil manipulator Mark Zuckerberg (whose track record of being pro-Israel and also backing right-wing causes is exactly like Musk’s), the very influential TikTok was the only social media platform that represented all user opinion regardless of who it favoured.

      "summary_orig": "ALTHOUGH the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan represent two contrasting shades of religiously inspired violent extremism in Pakistan, they share at least one characteristic: both soft and coercive measures have failed to work against them. The TTP, aligned with the Afghan Taliban and global terrorist networks such as Al Qaeda, fully exploited the government’s attempts at mainstreaming them and used the process to restructure and expand its network inside the country. On the other hand, the TLP, once a banned extremist organisation, exploits the state and violates its writ whenever it feels the need to mobilise its workers and bring them onto the streets. While the TTP is a terrorist group directly confronting the state and its security forces, the TLP is an adversary of the state and society in disguise. It operates through narratives that weaken state authority, create diplomatic friction and damage Pakistan’s international standing. The group has already caused such strains in the past, particularly vis-à-vis European countries, most notably France. It has now announced a march on the US embassy in Islamabad at a time when Pakistan-US relations are stabilising after two decades of mistrust. Any protest targeting the US diplomatic mission inevitably evokes memories among American and Pakistani security officials of the incident in November 1979, when the Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT), the radical student movement of the time, attacked the US embassy in Islamabad following false rumours that the US was involved in the assault on Masjid al-Haram in Makkah. A decade later, in February 1989, the IJT again resorted to violent protest, this time against a controversial novel. The TLP carries the same menacing potential that the IJT once possessed. Both enjoyed, in their respective times, a degree of patronage from state institutions, a factor that encouraged them to push far beyond the limits set by their patrons, believing themselves to be autonomous and emboldened by their perceived bargaining power with the state. The state now intends to eliminate the threat through coercive means, whatever the cost. The state’s calculus has remained tricky. It remains puzzling why it so often surrenders to extremists under the pretext of maintaining peace and order through non-violent means. In certain instances, particularly during periods of political turmoil, the state has even allowed such groups the freedom to act, or worse, subtly encouraged them to do so. The purpose seems nothing more than to suppress political opponents. Though the state institutions regard the TTP as an enemy, in the past, they have tried to deal with it in much the same way as they have handled the TLP in Punjab and Karachi, alternating between appeasement and accommodation. For now, however, the state has completely abandoned its earlier approach and intends to eliminate the threat through coercive means, whatever the cost. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently warned Kabul to choose between supporting Pakistan or siding with the outlawed TTP, accusing militants of crossing from Afghanistan to carry out deadly attacks. He issued this warning during a visit to Bannu, where he was accompanied by Field Marshal Asim Munir and Peshawar Corps Commander Lt-Gen Omer Bukhari, following clashes in which 19 soldiers were martyred and 45 militants killed in KP. Pakistan has, in recent months, pursued a calibrated strategy to pressure the Afghan Taliban to curb support for anti-Pakistan militant groups such as the TTP, the Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, and Baloch insurgent leaders. This effort has combined diplomatic engagement with public exposure of cross-border militant activity. The recent aerial strikes reportedly inside Afghanistan on TTP hideouts and moving targets, conducted during Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Muttaqi’s visit to India, are seen as a message, both to the TTP, underscoring Pakistan’s zero tolerance for terrorism within its borders, and the Taliban leadership, reminding it that it cannot bypass Pakistan and must address its concerns. These developments have also reinforced the view within Pakistan’s security institutions that the TTP continues to receive backing from India. The TTP problem becomes more complex because of its deep-rooted ties with the Afghan Taliban. The latter are unwilling to entirely abandon the TTP, as they view it in much the same way as the Pakistan establishment once viewed the Afghan Taliban — potential proxies in a complicated border security environment. A segment within the Taliban leadership believes that if they sever ties with the TTP, Pakistan will become more assertive towards Afghanistan, particularly on issues of trade, border management and, most importantly, the long-standing border demarcation dispute. They continue to regard the Durand Line as a contested boundary between the two countries. In this context, Pakistan’s options are limited, and the quickest course may be to rely on coercive measures, a choice that could provoke anger in Afghanistan. Islamabad already lacks a favourable public opinion there, particularly since the large-scale repatriation of Afghan refugees began. Obviously, the TLP is not an armed militia like the TTP and therefore requires a different approach. Yet, its potential to harm national harmony, disrupt law and order, and create chaos has enormous consequences, clearly detrimental to the economy, political stability and the image Pakistan needs to project to attract foreign investment. The TLP issue can be managed through a mix of measures: re-imposing the ban if necessary, taking control of its madressahs and mosques, as was done with the banned Jamaatud Dawa’s assets under UN Security Council and FATF pressure, and, most importantly, appointing moderate imams in its affiliated mosques. However, this would pose a significant challenge for the state. The religious radicalism it has nurtured over the past four or more decades has produced very few moderate or reasonable religious scholars. Many of those who do exist have already left the country, while others are preparing to do so. The writer is a security analyst. Published in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Emergency crew restore power to many parts of Ukraine after attack on grid • US, UK, and Nato conduct air patrol along Russia’s border KYIV: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged US President Donald Trump on Saturday to use the diplomatic success he achieved in the Middle East as a model to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, saying that if Trump could stop one war, “others can be stopped as well.” The appeal came during a phone call between the two leaders, just a day after Moscow launched what Ukrainian officials described as a large-scale attack targeting critical energy facilities across 10 regions, including the capital Kyiv. “If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well, including the Russian war,” Zelen­sky wrote on Facebook, describing what he characterised as a “very positive and productive” conversation with Trump. The timing of the appeal underscores Ukraine’s growing concern that its nearly three-year conflict with Russia has slipped down the international agenda, overshadowed by the Gaza crisis and other global flashpoints. Diplomatic momentum has stalled in recent months, with both sides accusing the other of undermining potential negotiations. Relations between the two leaders have warmed dramatically since Febru­ary, when they sparred during a now infamous televised meeting at the White House. Trump has since grown more hostile towards Moscow while expressing sympathy for Ukraine. In September, he wrote on Truth Social that Kyiv should try to “take back” all its occupied territory with Europe’s and Nato’s help. US First Lady Melania Trump said Friday she had secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia after establishing an extraordinary back channel of communication with Putin. Power restored Meanwhile, emergency crews restored power to many parts of Ukraine after an overnight Russian drone and missile attack on Friday struck energy facilities, plunging large districts of Kyiv and other areas into darkness and cutting water supplies. Friday’s strikes, which Ukrainian officials said killed at least five people and disrupted power supplies in the southern Odesa region. Moscow has targeted Ukraine’s energy grid each winter since it invaded in 2022, cutting power and heating to millions of households and disrupting water supply in what Kyiv says is a brazen war crime. Russia denies targeting civilians and says Ukraine uses the energy sites to power its military sector. Ukrainian drone attacks meanwhile killed two people in Russia, according to regional officials. Both countries have accused each other of frustrating progress towards a peace deal in recent months. Russia blames Kyiv and its European allies for the impasse, accusing them of undermining peace negotiations with Washington. Ukraine and Europe accuse Russia of playing for time so it can seize more Ukrainian territory. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, describing it as a “special military operation” to demilitarise the country and prevent the expansion of NATO. Kyiv and its European allies say the war is an illegal land grab that has resulted in tens of thousands of civilian and military casualties and widespread destruction. Jets fly near Russian border Britain said on Saturday that two Royal Air Force aircraft flew a 12-hour mission earlier this week alongside US and Nato forces to patrol the border of Russia, amid a series of recent Russian drone and aircraft incursions into Nato airspace. “This was a substantial joint mission with our US and Nato allies,” defence minister John Healey said. “Not only does this provide valuable intelligence to boost the operational awareness of our Armed Forces, but sends a powerful message of Nato unity to Putin and our adversaries,” Healey added.

Russia denies targeting civilians and says Ukraine uses the energy sites to power its military sector. Ukrainian drone attacks meanwhile killed two people in Russia, according to regional officials. Both countries have accused each other of frustrating progress towards a peace deal in recent months. Russia blames Kyiv and its European allies for the impasse, accusing them of undermining peace negotiations with Washington. Ukraine and Europe accuse Russia of playing for time so it can seize more Ukrainian territory. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, describing it as a “special military operation” to demilitarise the country and prevent the expansion of NATO. Kyiv and its European allies say the war is an illegal land grab that has resulted in tens of thousands of civilian and military casualties and widespread destruction. Jets fly near Russian border Britain said on Saturday that two Royal Air Force aircraft flew a 12-hour mission earlier this week alongside US and Nato forces to patrol the border of Russia, amid a series of recent Russian drone and aircraft incursions into Nato airspace. “This was a substantial joint mission with our US and Nato allies,” defence minister John Healey said. “Not only does this provide valuable intelligence to boost the operational awareness of our Armed Forces, but sends a powerful message of Nato unity to Putin and our adversaries,” Healey added.

      "summary": "• Emergency crew restore power to many parts of Ukraine after attack on grid • US, UK, and Nato conduct air patrol along Russia’s border KYIV: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged US President Donald Trump on Saturday to use the diplomatic success he achieved in the Middle East as a model to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, saying that if Trump could stop one war, “others can be stopped as well.” The appeal came during a phone call between the two leaders, just a day after Moscow launched what Ukrainian officials described as a large-scale attack targeting critical energy facilities across 10 regions, including the capital Kyiv. “If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well, including the Russian war,” Zelen­sky wrote on Facebook, describing what he characterised as a “very positive and productive” conversation with Trump. The timing of the appeal underscores Ukraine’s growing concern that its nearly three-year conflict with Russia has slipped down the international agenda, overshadowed by the Gaza crisis and other global flashpoints. Diplomatic momentum has stalled in recent months, with both sides accusing the other of undermining potential negotiations. Relations between the two leaders have warmed dramatically since Febru­ary, when they sparred during a now infamous televised meeting at the White House. Trump has since grown more hostile towards Moscow while expressing sympathy for Ukraine. In September, he wrote on Truth Social that Kyiv should try to “take back” all its occupied territory with Europe’s and Nato’s help. US First Lady Melania Trump said Friday she had secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia after establishing an extraordinary back channel of communication with Putin. Power restored Meanwhile, emergency crews restored power to many parts of Ukraine after an overnight Russian drone and missile attack on Friday struck energy facilities, plunging large districts of Kyiv and other areas into darkness and cutting water supplies.

      "title_orig": "TLP protesters set up overnight camp in Muridke; dozens injured during clashes",
      "summary_orig": "Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) supporters have camped at Muridke for the night as they continued attempts to reach Islamabad to stage a protest in ‘solidarity with Palestinians’. Punjab Police, in an attempt to stop the march towards the federal capital, have reportedly dug a trench on the road. Earlier in the day, clashes between supporters of the religious party and police were reported in the Shahdara area of Lahore earlier today. At least 40 police personnel have been injured today, while the TLP claims that more than 10 of its workers have been killed in clashes with law enforcers. TLP began its protests in Lahore on Thursday and announced plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to voice its opposition to the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after two years of conflict in Gaza. The demonstrations turned violent on Friday, with police launching baton charges and firing tear gas at protesters who had pelted\nthem with rocks, AFP journalists saw. Arrests in Karachi Police in Karachi arrested over a dozen TLP workers on Saturday in a bid to break up their protest at the Karachi Press Club (KPC). Roads leading to JPC were blocked earlier in the day. DIG South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that 18 TLP workers were apprehended when they arrived at Regal Chowk in Saddar. A spokesperson for the religious party, Mohammad Rehan Khan, told Dawn.com that as part of the country-wide protest, they had planned to demonstrate outside the KPC against the Punjab government’s action against their protest rally in Lahore. He said since all roads leading to the KPC were blocked, they could not reach the venue and confirmed that some party workers were detained by the police. ‘Cleared them from Lahore’ Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran, addressing the media, said some police personnel were still admitted in hospitals and undergoing treatment, while others have been discharged. He added that TLP protesters have also damaged government property. “We have records of 15 calls from citizens stating that the protesters have stolen their vehicles. You have seen how this group behaves in the past. The common citizen is the one who is suffering the most, roads are blocked, and property has been damaged,” said the senior police officer. He elaborated that the police station in Shahdara was also ransacked by TLP supporters. “The frontline force for internal security is the police, and state institutions are backing us. We have cleared them from Lahore and the situation has settled somewhat. We are trying to make sure there is as little damage as possible.” Offering the religious party an olive branch, Kamran said that they are open to talks. “But if you continue to inconvenience the public and vandalise property, then the state is ready to deal with the situation.” Giving an overview of the situation, he said 112 police personnel have been injured since the start of the protest and added that some police personnel are also missing. “They [the TLP] are showing footage of where they are taking the abducted policemen,” said the DIG. Punjab Police question TLP’s motives Punjab Police posted a lengthy statement on X questioning the TLP’s motives behind the march. Video footage attached to the post showed policemen being beaten and cars with shattered windshields. “A peace agreement has been reached in Gaza, the Muslims there are celebrating and thanking Allah for the establishment of peace; why are the TLP demonstrators representing by wreaking havoc in Pakistan?” the police asked in the statement. “It is clear from such actions that the TLP people are also saddened by the establishment of peace in Gaza and this anarchist group is actively supporting the mission of Israeli Jews,” the statement added. The police questioned how kidnapping police personnel and engaging in widespread vandalism displayed loyalty to the people of Gaza. “Some anarchist groups from the TLP are misleading the public in the name of religion and trying to disrupt the peace,” the statement read. “Attacks on police officers and road closures will not be tolerated under any circumstances.” Punjab Police warned that people who take the law into their own hands would be dealt with an iron fist and urged the public to avoid supporting “mischievous elements”, be mindful of misinformation and cooperate with the authorities. Residents in twin cities face disruptions Residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have complained of road closures, traffic jams, and mobile network disruptions. Activities across the twin cities remained disrupted for the second consecutive day amid security measures and traffic restrictions, with authorities also suspending mobile internet connections and closing major roads. Shipping containers were being placed as barriers across major roads in the capital in anticipation of the arrival of the protesters. Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi told Dawn.com that no TLP protesters have entered the city, nor have any within the capital taken to streets to demonstrate. “With the exception of Faizabad, all roads in Islamabad are open,” he said in a voice note. “There are no issues. Some containers have been placed on certain roads, but traffic is still able to move.” According to an earlier notification issued by the Islamabad Traffic Police, “entry of all types of heavy vehicles into the capital will remain suspended until further notice.” “Traffic diversions are being implemented due to the law and order situation in Islamabad’s Faizabad area, and commuters are advised to use alternative routes to avoid inconvenience,” the notification added. Residents of the twin cities voiced frustration over the severe traffic disruptions. Shazia Tahir, a resident of Islamabad, told Dawn.com that her usual 20-minute commute to work took more than an hour due to multiple road closures. “I went to Radio Pakistan [office] this morning — the highway from Khanna was closed, and all connecting streets to Rawalpindi were blocked. Faizabad was also sealed. From the highway near Khanna Bridge, I had to take the service road through Sohan, then pass Margalla Town, take the road between Aabpara and F-6 to finally reach the Red Zone via Margalla Road. It took us one hour and fifteen minutes to get there,” she said. Others reported communication disruptions alongside traffic issues. Fauzia Kulsoom, a journalist from Rawalpindi, told Dawn.com that mobile services in Islamabad’s Blue Area remained suspended from 2pm to 5pm the previous day. “The Internet has been down for two days,” she said, adding that her work has been severely disrupted because of that. Some residents described partial closures and heavy congestion in several areas. Riaz Ali, a resident of Bahria Town, Islamabad, told Dawn.com that while containers had been placed and certain routes blocked, movement elsewhere remained possible. “Containers exist, some roads are blocked — Faizabad and GT Road — but things are otherwise open. I haven’t travelled over the past couple of days, but data services are still off,” he said. He added that on GT Road, near City Grammar School, containers had been placed on both sides, causing severe traffic jams. “There were large trucks, and only a few bikers managed to pass through the narrow gaps between the containers. Police presence was minimal, just a couple of officers. At the entrance to Bahria Phase 7, traffic was also backed up. In short, traffic was choked badly in this part of Bahria yesterday,” he said. Meanwhile, citizens in other parts of the country trying to travel to Islamabad also voiced frustration over the road closures and communication outages. Ramna Saeed, an Islamabad resident currently in Gujranwala, said she was unable to travel to the capital for her final LLB exam due to road closures. “All main entry points — Chanda Qila, Sadoki, Kamoki — were shut since morning, and trenches were dug overnight. We haven’t seen such measures here before,” she said. Ramna added that students and commuters were left stranded, with little information on when routes would reopen. “Mobile internet has also been disrupted, and although calls work, 3G and 4G services are barely functioning,” she said. Key intersections, including Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh Turn, DAV College Chowk, MH Chowk, and Naz Cinema, were closed to traffic. In the Saddar area, Haider Road, Suzuki Stand, and Murree Chowk were also blocked, while access roads leading to Kachehri Chowk remained inaccessible, per the traffic police notification. It said partial traffic movement resumed at Sawan Bridge and New Gulzar-i-Quaid, but major interchanges such as Chakri, Thalian, Brahma, and Mandara stayed closed, severing Rawalpindi’s access from major highways. The situation was similar at rural entry points, with Dholtala Mor, Misa Kaswal, Bai Khan Bridge, and GT Road near Gujar Khan all shut down. Meanwhile, motorway authorities said M-1 was open only towards Peshawar, while M-2 remained closed in both the Rawalpindi and Lahore directions. Friday clashes following protest call As many as 50 police officers were injured in Friday’s clashes, a senior police official told AFP , while TLP’s claims that some of its members had been killed could not be verified independently. The TLP said the protests had originally been organised to oppose the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Pakistan backed, but was now intended to express solidarity with Palestinians. “We have no demands, apart from showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad. “We have no idea when we will reach Islamabad, but the government is being brutal with us. We are not negotiating with the government at all,” Irfan said. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry vowed on Thursday not to let the protesters enter Islamabad. “There is no room for any radical activity in Islamabad,” he told reporters. “Why is an agreement that is acceptable to Hamas and Palestine not acceptable to you?” Israel declared a ceasefire and began pulling back its troops at around noon on Friday, as tens of thousands of Palestinians began walking back towards their devastated homes. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the deal on Thursday as a “historic opportunity to secure lasting peace”. “We will continue to work with partners, friends and the leaders of brotherly nations to ensure that peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people are established,” he said.

Video footage attached to the post showed policemen being beaten and cars with shattered windshields. “A peace agreement has been reached in Gaza, the Muslims there are celebrating and thanking Allah for the establishment of peace; why are the TLP demonstrators representing by wreaking havoc in Pakistan?” the police asked in the statement. “It is clear from such actions that the TLP people are also saddened by the establishment of peace in Gaza and this anarchist group is actively supporting the mission of Israeli Jews,” the statement added. The police questioned how kidnapping police personnel and engaging in widespread vandalism displayed loyalty to the people of Gaza. “Some anarchist groups from the TLP are misleading the public in the name of religion and trying to disrupt the peace,” the statement read. “Attacks on police officers and road closures will not be tolerated under any circumstances.” Punjab Police warned that people who take the law into their own hands would be dealt with an iron fist and urged the public to avoid supporting “mischievous elements”, be mindful of misinformation and cooperate with the authorities. Residents in twin cities face disruptions Residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have complained of road closures, traffic jams, and mobile network disruptions. Activities across the twin cities remained disrupted for the second consecutive day amid security measures and traffic restrictions, with authorities also suspending mobile internet connections and closing major roads. Shipping containers were being placed as barriers across major roads in the capital in anticipation of the arrival of the protesters. Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi told Dawn.com that no TLP protesters have entered the city, nor have any within the capital taken to streets to demonstrate. “With the exception of Faizabad, all roads in Islamabad are open,” he said in a voice note. “There are no issues. Some containers have been placed on certain roads, but traffic is still able to move.” According to an earlier notification issued by the Islamabad Traffic Police, “entry of all types of heavy vehicles into the capital will remain suspended until further notice.” “Traffic diversions are being implemented due to the law and order situation in Islamabad’s Faizabad area, and commuters are advised to use alternative routes to avoid inconvenience,” the notification added. Residents of the twin cities voiced frustration over the severe traffic disruptions. Shazia Tahir, a resident of Islamabad, told Dawn.com that her usual 20-minute commute to work took more than an hour due to multiple road closures. “I went to Radio Pakistan [office] this morning — the highway from Khanna was closed, and all connecting streets to Rawalpindi were blocked. Faizabad was also sealed. From the highway near Khanna Bridge, I had to take the service road through Sohan, then pass Margalla Town, take the road between Aabpara and F-6 to finally reach the Red Zone via Margalla Road. It took us one hour and fifteen minutes to get there,” she said. Others reported communication disruptions alongside traffic issues. Fauzia Kulsoom, a journalist from Rawalpindi, told Dawn.com that mobile services in Islamabad’s Blue Area remained suspended from 2pm to 5pm the previous day. “The Internet has been down for two days,” she said, adding that her work has been severely disrupted because of that. Some residents described partial closures and heavy congestion in several areas. Riaz Ali, a resident of Bahria Town, Islamabad, told Dawn.com that while containers had been placed and certain routes blocked, movement elsewhere remained possible. “Containers exist, some roads are blocked — Faizabad and GT Road — but things are otherwise open. I haven’t travelled over the past couple of days, but data services are still off,” he said. He added that on GT Road, near City Grammar School, containers had been placed on both sides, causing severe traffic jams. “There were large trucks, and only a few bikers managed to pass through the narrow gaps between the containers. Police presence was minimal, just a couple of officers. At the entrance to Bahria Phase 7, traffic was also backed up. In short, traffic was choked badly in this part of Bahria yesterday,” he said. Meanwhile, citizens in other parts of the country trying to travel to Islamabad also voiced frustration over the road closures and communication outages. Ramna Saeed, an Islamabad resident currently in Gujranwala, said she was unable to travel to the capital for her final LLB exam due to road closures. “All main entry points — Chanda Qila, Sadoki, Kamoki — were shut since morning, and trenches were dug overnight. We haven’t seen such measures here before,” she said. Ramna added that students and commuters were left stranded, with little information on when routes would reopen. “Mobile internet has also been disrupted, and although calls work, 3G and 4G services are barely functioning,” she said. Key intersections, including Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh Turn, DAV College Chowk, MH Chowk, and Naz Cinema, were closed to traffic. In the Saddar area, Haider Road, Suzuki Stand, and Murree Chowk were also blocked, while access roads leading to Kachehri Chowk remained inaccessible, per the traffic police notification. It said partial traffic movement resumed at Sawan Bridge and New Gulzar-i-Quaid, but major interchanges such as Chakri, Thalian, Brahma, and Mandara stayed closed, severing Rawalpindi’s access from major highways. The situation was similar at rural entry points, with Dholtala Mor, Misa Kaswal, Bai Khan Bridge, and GT Road near Gujar Khan all shut down. Meanwhile, motorway authorities said M-1 was open only towards Peshawar, while M-2 remained closed in both the Rawalpindi and Lahore directions. Friday clashes following protest call As many as 50 police officers were injured in Friday’s clashes, a senior police official told AFP , while TLP’s claims that some of its members had been killed could not be verified independently. The TLP said the protests had originally been organised to oppose the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Pakistan backed, but was now intended to express solidarity with Palestinians. “We have no demands, apart from showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad. “We have no idea when we will reach Islamabad, but the government is being brutal with us. We are not negotiating with the government at all,” Irfan said. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry vowed on Thursday not to let the protesters enter Islamabad. “There is no room for any radical activity in Islamabad,” he told reporters. “Why is an agreement that is acceptable to Hamas and Palestine not acceptable to you?” Israel declared a ceasefire and began pulling back its troops at around noon on Friday, as tens of thousands of Palestinians began walking back towards their devastated homes. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the deal on Thursday as a “historic opportunity to secure lasting peace”. “We will continue to work with partners, friends and the leaders of brotherly nations to ensure that peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people are established,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday night censured Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for remarks during his visit to India and said “deflecting” the responsibility of controlling terrorism could not absolve the Afghan authorities of their responsibilities towards regional peace. Muttaqi visited India earlier this week, marking India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. Speaking about a Thursday night explosion in Kabul during a press conference in New Delhi a day ago, Muttaqi had condemned the incident and Pakistan for its alleged role in it, saying: “Whatever the problems are in each country should be solved by themselves.” He said there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan. “If other countries achieve peace themselves as we did in Afghanistan, then there will be peace in the entire region. Since the last eight months, there has not been even a small incident in Afghanistan. In four years, no one has been harmed from Afghanistan’s soil. So this is the best proof that we have presented.” In a statement issued today, the FO said Pakistan’s strong reservations on the elements of the India-Afghanistan joint statement were conveyed to Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan by the additional foreign secretary (West Asia & Afghanistan) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. “Pakistan also strongly rejected the Afghan acting foreign minister’s assertion that terrorism is Pakistan’s internal problem,” the FO said, adding that Pakistan had repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan terrorist elements “operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan”. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “It was emphasised that by deflecting the responsibility of controlling terrorism towards Pakistan cannot absolve the Interim Afghan Government of its obligations towards ensuring peace and stability in the region and beyond,” the FO said. Elaborating on reservations regarding the joint statement, the FO said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The joint statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self-determination.” The FO said that Pakistan had “generously” hosted nearly four million Afghans for over four decades “in the spirit of good neighbourliness and Islamic brotherhood”. It said that with peace gradually returning to Afghanistan, it was time for unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan to return to their country. “Like all other countries and in line with international norms and practices, Pakistan has the right to regulate the presence of foreign nationals residing inside its territory. At the same time, along with the repatriation of Afghan nationals, Pakistan has also been generously issuing medical and study visas to address the medical and educational needs of Afghan nationals. In the spirit of Islamic brotherhood and good neighbourly relations, Pakistan will continue to extend humanitarian support to the people of Afghanistan.” “Pakistan is desirous of seeing a peaceful, stable, regionally connected and prosperous Afghanistan. Accordingly, Pakistan has extended all possible trade, economic and connectivity facilitation to Afghanistan. Such measures are aimed at promoting cooperation and socio-economic development of the two countries,” the FO added. At the same time, it said the government had the responsibility to “take all possible measures for the safety and security of its people”. The FO concluded by saying that Pakistan “expects the interim Afghan government to play its due role in supporting Pakistan to achieve this noble objective by taking concrete measures to prevent its territory from being used” by terrorist elements against Pakistan. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said earlier that Afghanistan’s export of terrorism would vitiate the atmosphere and cause a fissure in bilateral relations that Pakistan did not desire. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. The past week was particularly charged with statements to and fro from both sides as Pakistan suffered a string of martyrdoms of security forces in intelligence-based operations, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. Addressing the matter in an interview with Geo News , Asif said: “The terrorism they’re exporting to Pakistan, there will be a fissure created in relations in this environment, which is not our desire. We want our relations to continue respectfully.” The defence minister also called on people to monitor and take notice of any suspicious activity in their midst and take action as a community against any terrorist facilitators. “If you remain silent due to fear or any other reason, then I think it is understood as agreement.’’ Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out,” Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly. Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups. Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan a day ago. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.” Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.",
