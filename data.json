      "summary_orig": "COMPARED to the coldness of the Biden administration towards Pakistan, bilateral relations under Donald Trump’s watch have warmed up considerably. Early on Friday, the prime minister and the army chief met the American leader in the White House to mainly discuss , as a PM House readout describes, security, counterterrorism and investment issues. Mr Trump had earlier in the week met Shehbaz Sharif in New York, during a meeting with leaders of Muslim states on the sidelines of the UNGA to discuss the Gaza war. In June, the army chief had an unprecedented lunch with the American president. This is the first time a Pakistani prime minister has had a dedicated bilateral interaction with a US president in six years; the last interaction was between Imran Khan and Mr Trump in 2019. Apart from the photos of beaming leaders and mutual appreciation — Mr Trump referred to Mr Sharif as a “great leader”, while the PM called the US leader “courageous” — the details of what was discussed are sketchy. As per the Pakistani side, tensions in the Middle East and South Asia, along with investment opportunities in Pakistan, were mentioned. The PM lauded Mr Trump’s efforts to end the war in Gaza , calling him a “man of peace”. The US leader may be many things, but a peacemaker he is not, having attacked Iran in June, while if he really wanted to end the Gaza genocide, he could halt all American weapons and funds transfers to the Israeli regime. It is, therefore, hoped that behind closed doors, Mr Sharif convinced the president of the need to immediately end the Gaza slaughter, as well as finding a just solution to the Kashmir dispute. Should this be seen as a great reset in Pakistan-US ties, or simply a temporary phase of positivity? Historically, the relationship has been a transactional one, with the US supporting Pakistan and providing it arms and aid at key junctures — the Cold War, the Afghan Jihad, the ‘war on terror’ — only to turn ambivalent, or even hostile, once its geopolitical aims were achieved. The Biden era was a clear example of American indifference towards Pakistan. Moreover, the incumbent US president is known to change positions overnight, so to formulate future policy on the basis of a few interactions would be unwise. Besides, the foreign policy priorities of Islamabad and Washington diverge considerably in several areas, including the Palestine question, ties with Iran and the relationship with China. Can Pakistan balance relations with the US while maintaining its principled stand on these issues, particularly its ties with China? The lesson of history is that while better ties with the US should be pursued, Pakistan should be prepared for abrupt changes in American policy. Published in Dawn, September 27th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "UNITED NATIONS: As President Donald Trump claimed being close to a deal to end the war in Gaza and bring prisoners home, an increasingly isolated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday tried to rebut what he called “the false charge of genocide”. He also denounced several Western countries for embracing Palestinian statehood, accusing them of pushing his country into “national suicide”. The Israeli leader, who has an International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes, addressed mostly empty chairs in the UN General Assembly , as scores of delegates — including the Pakistan contingent — walked out when he took the stage. At the same time, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters blocked traffic near Times Square in New York to protest the killing of more than 65,000 people in Gaza by Israeli strikes in less than two years. Israeli leader speaks to empty chairs as scores of delegates exit UNGA hall to boycott his address “War criminals don’t deserve any peace of mind. They don’t deserve any sleep,” said Andrea Mirez, a young woman who kept up an overnight noisy protest outside Netanyahu’s hotel. In his speech, days after France, Britain and other Western powers amid worldwide protests against the ongoing war on Gaza recognised the state of Palestine, he showed a map of the Middle East, taking out a pen to cross out adversaries Israel has killed. He also vowed to “finish the job” against Hamas, even as President Donald Trump said he thought he had sealed a deal on a ceasefire. A senior White House official told Reuters that Trump will meet Netanyahu on Monday in Washington with the aim of reaching a framework for a deal. In his speech, Netanyahu claimed that over time, many world leaders buckled. “They buckled under the pressure of a biased media, radical Islamist constituencies and antisemitic mobs… Behind closed doors, many of the leaders who publicly condemn us privately thank us. They tell me how much they value Israel’s superb intelligence services that have prevented, time and again, terrorist attacks in their capitals,” he claimed. However, he did not touch on the issue of annexing the occupied West Bank. Benjamin Netanyahu holds a map of the Middle East during his speech.—AFP Response to speech Gaza authorities described Netanyahu’s speech as one “filled with lies and blatant contradictions” and condemned it as a “desperate attempt to justify the war crimes and acts of genocide.” “Boycotting Netanyahu’s speech is one manifestation of Israel’s isolation and the consequences of the war of extermination,” Taher al-Nunu, the media adviser to the head of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement. Also, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, earlier speaking by video after the US denied him a visa, condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza as “a war of genocide”. He thanked the countries that recognised Palestinian statehood, pledged that Palestinian Authority would be ready to govern post-war Gaza. New coalition to back Palestine On the other hand, 12 countries — Britain, France, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia and Switzerland — announced a new coalition to financially support the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority as Israel withheld tax revenues of Palestinian Authority for past two years. The Emergency Coalition for the Financial Sustainability of the Palestinian Authority “was established in response to the urgent and unprecedented financial crisis” confronting the PA, the Spanish foreign ministry said. It aims to stabilise the Ramallah-based body’s finances, preserve its ability to govern, provide essential services and maintain security, “all of which are indispensable to regional stability and to preserving the two-state solution”, the statement added.

      "summary_orig": "NEW DELHI: An Indian Army officer accused in the Samjhauta Express and Malegaon bombing case was promoted after being freed by a terrorism court, The Wire reported on Friday. It said less than two months after a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court acquitted Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit, the Indian Army has promoted him to the rank of Colonel. Purohit, one of seven accused tried for their roles in the terror blasts, alongside former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament (MP) Pragya Singh Thakur, was acquitted after the prosecution failed to prove the case in court. Special Judge A.K. Lahoti, while acquitting the seven accused, pointed to “grave suspicion” against them but added that “a grave degree of suspicion is established, but not enough to convict the accused persons. Hence, the court has given them the benefit of doubt”. Judge Lahoti further stated, “There can be strong suspicion, but mere suspicion is not enough to punish them”. The NIA, which claimed it would seek legal opinion to decide whether to challenge the acquittal in the Bombay High Court, has shown no commitment to pursuing the case further. Meanwhile, the families of the six individuals killed in the blast have challenged the acquittal, The Wire said. Speaking to the media, Purohit’s wife, Aparna, confirmed the promotion. This promotion can be interpreted as a clear stand by the government in support of an individual who was a terror accused for over 17 years. Minister of Textile Giriraj Singh shared a picture of the pipping ceremony of Purohit and congratulated him. “Congratulations Col. Purohit on being back in uniform. The Govt (government) stands firmly with patriots who serve the nation with courage and integrity,” Singh wrote. A serving army officer, Purohit’s arrest in 2008 was considered key in establishing the “motive” behind the blast. The case was initially handled by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and was later taken over by the NIA after its inception in 2009. According to the ATS, Purohit founded the Abhinav Bharat organisation in 2006, through which funds were allegedly collected and the conspiracy planned. The ATS claimed that Purohit, through this organisation, aimed to establish a “Hindu Rashtra [nation]” with its own constitution, flag, and “government in exile” to be operated from either Israel or Thailand. The ATS also claimed to have established financial links and invoked sections of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA) to investigate pecuniary activities in the case. While the MCOCA charges were dropped in the initial stage of the trial, Purohit and the other accused faced trial under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

The nationalist grandstanding was not anything unusual for the Indian PM; it is just what he has been peddling to Indian voters for 11 years. What makes it worthy of notice at this point — when the world is teetering on the brink of the new order — is that Modi’s brand of Indian nationalism is unwittingly clashing with the ultranationalism of American President Donald Trump. Just as Modi has been preaching a new greatness for India so too is the American president selling the same kind of special sauce to his voter base. On the face of it, none of this would have been a problem. After all, the two sets of ultranationalists, Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) base and Modi’s BJP MIGA (Make India Great Again) base are separated by thousands of miles. If anything, during Trump’s first term and the visits each leader paid the other, it seemed to be a recipe for bromance. Thousands of non-resident Indians gathered in Texas cheered on Trump and Modi. Arguably, the vast majority of these NRIs were eager supporters of Modi’s Hindu nationalism, which preached that Hindus were special, resurgent and the only ‘true’ Indians. In simple terms, many Indians — those who support Modi at home and abroad — formed the MIGA base and believed that India was about to be the next superpower. Clearly, Operation Sindoor was part of this MIGA projection of power. Last May, India calculated that it could attack alleged terrorist bases inside Pakistan and create a spectacle of dominance that would advertise its power both to the MIGA base at home and regional countries. Much has been written about the obvious blunders it made, but the important thing vis-à-vis US-India ties is what happened afterwards. President Donald Trump, eager to burnish his credentials as peacemaker, took credit for the ceasefire. PM Modi, who presents himself to his MIGA base as a demigod, could not allow this. This was the beginning of the end as far as the US-India relationship was concerned. Many Indians supporting Modi believed their country would be the next superpower. Then came the tariffs . Once again, warring narratives on either side revealed the constraints of both leaders. Trump — long in love with the subject of tariffs — saw in them a means of bringing India to the negotiating table. His lingering annoyance over Modi’s refusal to give him credit for bringing about an India-Pakistan ceasefire likely increased his urgency to impose them. In Trump’s eyes, India could not have it both ways — protect its market by refusing to allow Americans to sell agricultural products and also present itself as a superpower. At Modi’s end, Hindu nationalism was the focus. The refusal to allow in dairy products is due in large part to the centralisation of the Hindu identity as Indian identity. The sanctification of cows and cow-related products as part of the Hindu nationalist ethos meant that the market could never be opened to American products that could contain beef byproducts. To Trump and MAGA, this sort of thing was anathema. Just as Hindu supremacy preaches the resurgence of Hindus and their creation of a global network, so too does Christian ultra-nationalism say that these sorts of reservations have to be bulldozed in its own bid for dominance. Domestically, the BJP tried to spin the tariffs as a magic MIGA moment in which Indians could build India and buy Indian. Shrill Modi waxed lyrical about how this was a moment in which India could become self-sufficient. Then they started to predict the imminent collapse of the US, now that it was no longer interested in being friends with them. Irate Indian commentators, steeped in the swoon of nationalism for over a decade, declared that they did not need trade with the US and were better off without it. It is these same delusions that kept a large section of Indians from seeing what was about to happen with the H-1B skilled worker visas . When the $100,000 per applicant fee was announced recently, they were stunned. Few saw how ultra-nationalist Hindutva has led even tech workers to believe that they were indispensable to Americans who they perceived as too unskilled to do the jobs they were doing in the US. Some American publications highlighted the spread of Hindutva in the US, which was not seen as a welcome sign. Add to this the allegations that Indian companies were misusing the programme to bring in underpaid workers and the writing was on the wall. To MAGA ultra-nationalist commentators, like the recently deceased Charlie Kirk and Trump strategist Steve Bannon, Indians had to go so that Americans could take back the jobs that were meant for them. Just as Hindutva preaches Hindu entitlement, so too does nativist white Christian nationalism preach its own brand of entitlement. Indians hold over 70 per cent of H-1B visas. The new fee applies to new applicants but even those in possession of the visa are likely to face trouble with renewals as companies realise that the administration does not want them to have foreign workers on their payroll if they want to stay on its good side. The advent of AI and the increasing availability of local US workers means that it is unlikely that these policies will be reversed in the near future. However loudly the MIGA base may shout about America’s decline, in the clash between Hindutva supremacy and its ‘Make India Great Again’ slogan and the Christian nationalists’ ‘Make America Great Again’ dominance the latter has prevailed. Modi and Trump may make up and even strike a trade deal but the architecture through which the Hindutva-fuelled Indian middle class pursued the American dream has collapsed.

      "summary_orig": "NEW YORK: The foreign ministers of China, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, in a joint statement, have urged Afghan­istan to take “effective, concrete, and verifiable actions” to dismantle terrorist groups operating from its territory. The foreign ministers in a meeting on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session reaffirmed support for Afghanistan as an “independent, united, and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war, and narcotics”, but underlined the need to prevent terrorists from using Afghan soil. The four Asian states have been holding quadripartite consultations on Afghanistan since 2017, aimed at promoting reg­ional stability and coordinating efforts to counter terrorism, narcotics, and extremism emanating from Afghan territory. This informal grouping, which meets at ministerial and special representative levels, also seeks to facilitate political dialogue and regional economic integration in Afghanistan. They expressed deep concern over the presence of groups such as ISIL, Al-Qaida, Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan (TTP), the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Jaish ul-Adl, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the Majeed Brigade, and others, calling them a “serious threat to regional and global security.” The joint statement emphasised that strengthening peace and stability in Afghanistan and countering terrorism, radicalism, and narcotics are “common interests in the region”. The four sides also called for adjustments to the 1988 UN sanctions regime in line with ground realities, including travel exemptions for some Taliban officials; stressed the need for continued humanitarian assistance to Afghans, urging that aid be delinked from political considerations; supported regional economic initiatives to ease Afghan­is­tan’s dire situation and integrate it into regional trade and connectivity; and appealed to the international community to intensify emergency huma­nitarian aid while reaffirming their willingness to exp­and economic cooperation with Afghanistan. The ministers affirmed their support for diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a political settlement of the Afghan issue and backed the role of the international community, particularly the United Nat­ions. They noted the importance of regi­o­nal mechanisms such as the Moscow For­mat, the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting of Afghanistan’s Neighb­ouring Countries, and the Shanghai Co­operation Organisa­tion (SCO) in advancing a political solution. They welcomed the joint meeting of the Special Representatives of China, Iran, Pak­is­­tan, and Russia on Afghan­istan, held on Sept 12 in Dushanbe and encouraged the con­­tinuation of these quadrilateral consultations.

      "summary_orig": "• PM doubles compensation for families of victims to Rs2m • 161,000 houses, 395 health facilities damaged in Punjab, UNOCHA says • Senate panel told deluges left 1,000 dead, millions displaced ISLAMABAD: As millions of people have been affected and hundreds of casualties reported across the country during the recent floods and monsoon rains , the prime minister has raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives from Rs1 million to Rs2m. More than 4.2 million people in 18 districts of Punjab have been affected by the recent floods, with Muzaffargarh alone accounting for over a quarter of the total, according to a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) report released by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). Muzaffargarh, located on the bank of the Chenab River, is followed by Jhang with 646,000 affected people (15.3 per cent), Bahawalpur with 514,000 (12.2pc), Khanewal with 397,000 (9.4pc), and Multan with 347,000 (8.2pc). Other affected districts include Vehari, Bahawalnagar, Hafizabad, Okara, Chiniot, Gujrat, Rahim Yar Khan, Kasur, Sialkot, Mandi Bahauddin, Narowal, Dera Ghazi Khan and Gujranwala. The RNA, conducted from Sept 8 to 18 in collaboration with the government, covered 1,928 mouzas in these 18 flood-hit districts. Out of 161,000 houses assessed, about 115,700 were partially damaged and 46,000 fully or severely damaged, leaving thousands of families without adequate shelter. More than 93pc of the assessed locations reported some level of housing damage, with the highest numbers in Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, Khanewal and Jhang. Approximately 2.8m people have been displaced, many forced to leave flooded, damaged or destroyed homes. According to the report, the affected population faces urgent shelter and non-food item (NFI) needs, particularly tents, tarpaulins, GI sheets, plastic sheeting and winterisation kits, including blankets, bedding, mats, shawls, mosquito nets and warm clothes. Health facilities A total of 742 health facilities were assessed across the 18 districts; 395 were reported damaged — 315 partially and 80 fully or severely — posing a serious threat to the continuity of healthcare services. The highest proportions of damage were observed in Gujranwala, Bahawalnagar and Okara. In absolute terms, Bahawalnagar recorded the greatest impact with 64 facilities damaged, followed by Jhang (55) and Muzaffargarh (46). Other districts also reported significant damage, including Bahawalpur (35), Chiniot (39) and Khanewal (25), with several facilities fully destroyed. By contrast, Mandi Bahauddin (8pc), Vehari (17pc) and Dera Ghazi Khan (22pc) reported relatively limited impact. The scale of damage in the hardest-hit districts underscores the urgent need to restore and reinforce health infrastructure, as disruptions could reduce access to essential care, delay outbreak response and heighten community vulnerability. The RNA highlights a significant disease burden across 1,928 flood-affected villages. Malaria was the most reported health concern (64pc of assessed villages), followed by skin infections and diarrhoea, indicating deteriorating water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Dengue was also reported at considerable levels, adding to the challenge of vector-borne diseases. Educational institutions According to the School Education Department, floods damaged 667 schools across the 18 districts, of which 54pc were girls’ schools. Moreover, 217 schools were repurposed as evacuation centres, affecting 101,263 enrolled students. Most damage was recorded in Sialkot (210 schools), followed by Jhang (110), Gujrat (83), Muzaffargarh and Kot Addu (82 each), and Rahim Yar Khan (15). Nearly 97,000 water supply schemes were reported damaged. Over one-third of the assessed villages reported damage to these schemes. Of the 48,500 fully damaged schemes, 60pc were in Muzaffargarh, 12pc in Jhang, and 10pc in Bahawalpur. Before the floods, communities in most districts relied heavily on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods. Crop farming was the primary source of income for over 85pc of communities in Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Kasur, Khanewal, and Vehari, with similarly high levels in Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Chiniot, Multan, and Narowal. Livestock Livestock rearing engaged more than 70pc of communities in most areas, while daily wage labour was a key income source in Bahawalnagar, Gujranwala, and Khanewal.  Floods have devastated these livelihoods by damaging crops, killing livestock, and disrupting agricultural cycles, leaving many households without produce or animals to sell. As farming activities stall, wage opportunities linked to farm work and local markets are shrinking, pushing vulnerable communities deeper into income loss and food insecurity. Most communities reported having food stocks lasting only a week or less. Food insecurity is most critical in Multan, where 81.7pc of communities reported very limited stocks. Similarly, 76.2pc in Bahawalnagar, 74pc in Muzaffargarh, and 61.5pc in Bahawalpur said their food would run out within days. Ex-gratia assistance Meanwhiel, the Senate standing committee on cabinet secretariat was informed that the premier raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives during the floods from Rs1m to Rs2m. The revised compensation package will have a financial impact of about Rs2.033 billion. The committee’s meeting, chaired by Senator Rana Mehmoodul Hassan, was briefed on the overall flood situation by a member of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). He reported that around 1,000 people had died in the recent floods, while about 1,000 others had sustained various injuries. He added that the numbers were expected to rise once rescue, evacuation, and relief operations were completed and floodwaters receded. The NDMA said around three million people had been rescued or evacuated between June 26 and Sept 19. The committee was also told the floods damaged 12,559 houses and resulted in the loss of 6,509 livestock. The figures are expected to rise as assessments continued. The meeting was attended by senators Saadia Abbasi, Ataur Rehman, Aimal Wali Khan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir, Dr Afnanullah Khan, and Shahadat Awan, along with the secretary of the Establishment Division, special secretary of the Cabinet Division, chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and other senior officials.

      "summary_orig": "As Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif detailed the events of May’s four-day escalation between India and Pakistan at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday, he highlighted the need for “proactive” rather than “provocative” leadership for South Asia. In May, the military confrontation between India and Pakistan had come as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally drop their guns. PM Shehbaz recalled the escalation at the 80th session of the UNGA today, where he led Pakistan’s delegation. He began his address with these words: “Our world is more complex today than ever before. Conflicts are intensifying, international law is being brazenly violated, humanitarian crises are multiplying, terrorism remains a potent threat, disinformation and fake news undermine trust, climate change threatens our very survival, and more so for countries like Pakistan.” He added that today, multilateralism was no more an option but the need of the hour. PM Shehbaz then explained that Pakistan’s foreign policy was based on peace, mutual respect and cooperation. “We believe in the peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and diplomacy,” he asserted. The premier recalled that last year, from this very podium, “I had warned that Pakistan would act most decisively against any external aggression”. @dawn.today Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, delivering his keynote address at the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, recalled that from the same podium last year he had warned Pakistan would respond decisively to any external aggression. “Those words proved true. In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. The enemy came shrouded in arrogance, and we sent them back in humiliation,” he said. For more updates, head to Dawn.com DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com “Those words of mine proved true … In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. Our enemy came shrouded in arrogance, [and] we sent them back in humiliation. “India sought to extract political gains from a human tragedy by spurning my sincere offer of an independent international investigation into the Pahalgam incident. Instead, it attacked our cities and targeted our innocent civilians. When our territorial integrity and our national security were violated, our response was in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.” He hailed Pakistan’s armed forces and the military leadership, saying: “Our valiant armed forces, under the stellar leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir mounted an operation of stunning professionalism, bravey and acumen. Repelling the enemy’s attack under Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Babar Sidhu, our falcons took flight and etched their answer across the skies, resulting in seven of the Indian jets being turned to scrap and dust.” As the premier commended the Pakistani forces and people for their resolve during the escalation with India, slogans of “Pakistan Zindabad ” (long live Pakistan) and “Shehbaz Sharif Zindabad ” (long live Shehbaz Sharif) were heard in the UNGA hall. The prime minister Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire following a four-day escalation with India in May from a position of strength. He also expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump and his tams for “their active role” in bringing about the ceasefire. “President Trump’s efforts for peace helped avert a … war in South Asia. Had he not intervened timely and decisively, the consequences of a full-fledged war would have been catastrophic,” PM Shehbaz said. “Therefore, in recognition of President Trump’s wonderful and outstanding contribution to promote peace in our part of the world, Pakistan nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. This is the least we could do … I think he truly is a man of peace.” He also thanked Pakistan’s “friends and partners”, including China, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Azerbaijan, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and the UN secretary general for extending diplomatic support to Pakistan during the escalation in May. “We have won the war, and now we seek to win peace in our part of the world. This is my most sincere serious offer before this august assembly of the world nations. Pakistan stands ready for a composite, comprehensive and result-oriented dialogue with India on all outstanding issues,” he said. PM Shehbaz emphasised that South Asia required “proactive rather than provocative leadership”. The “unilateral and illegal attempt to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance defies the provisions of the treaty itself, as well as the norms of international law itself,” he said, adding that Pakistan had made it abundantly clear that “we will definitely and ardently defend the … right of our 240m people on these waters”. He expressed solidarity with the people of occupied Kashmir, saying that one day, India’s tyranny in the valley would come to a grinding halt. “Kashmir will gain its fundamental right to self-determination through an impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations,” he said. ‘Heart wrenching’ Turning his attention toward Gaza, he said the plight of the Palestinian people was one of the “most heart-wrenching tragedies of our time”. “This prolonged injustice is a stain on the global conscious and our collective moral failure. For nearly 80 years, the Palestinians have courageously endured Israel’s brutal occupation of their homeland. In the West Bank, each passing day brings new brutality,” he grieved. In Gaza, he said, Israel’s genocidal onslaught had unleashed unspeakable terror upon women and children in a manner that had not been witnessed in the annals of history. “In [the] blind pursuit of its nefarious goals, the Israeli leadership has unleashed a shameful campaign against the innocent Palestinians, which history will remember as one of its darkest chapters,” he added. Emphasising the need to raise voice over the atrocities in Gaza, he said, “We must speak, and speak loud and clear.” He added, “Our words are too little and too late for Hind Rajab. A child, nay a little baby … My agony and the agony of the entire Muslim ummah, and the agony of all the nations on this planet, is that we failed Hind Rajab . And she will not forgive us.” View this post on Instagram The PM continued, “The smallest coffins are the heaviest to carry. I would know, as I carried the coffin of Irtaza Abbas during the recent confrontation with India. He was only six years old. Therefore, we cannot and must not fail these children of Gaza, or any child anywhere in the world. We must find a path to a ceasefire now.” He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for a sovereign Palestinian state with pre-1967 borders and Jerusalem as its capital. “Palestine can no no longer remain under Israeli shackles, it must be liberated and liberated with full commitment and full force.” He also welcomed the recognition of the State of Palestine by several countries recently and urged others to follow suit. Referring to a meeting of Trump with the leaders of some Muslim countries earlier this week, he appreciated the US president’s “timely initiative” to call the moot on Gaza. “I was also a part of that consultative process and I … pray to God that it rekindles hope for a ceasefire in the nearest future,” PM Shehbaz said. He went on to criticise Israel for its recent attack on Doha that targetted Hamas leaders. Condemning the strike, he expressed solidarity with Qatar. The premier also expressed support for efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict in line with the UN Charter,  “to end human suffering and global turmoil cause by this protracted war”. ‘Pakistan condemns all forms of terrorism’ Speaking about terrorism, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations. For two decades, Pakistan had been on the frontline of global counter-terrorism efforts, he highlighted, asking, “What can be a bigger  manifestation of our commitment to fight terrorism and erase it, not only from the face of Pakistan but from the face of this global world?” He asserted that unless terrorism was defeated hands down, this world would not be a peaceful place to live. “For that, Pakistan’s sacrifices are probably the biggest around the globe. It must be respected and appreciated, because we’re a bulwark,” he continued. “Had these terrorists not been encountered by us, they would have been roaming the streets of New York, London and God knows, the Far East.” The premier said Pakistan was today facing the problem of externally sponsored terrorism, particularly from foreign funded groups that were operating from the Afghan soil. He stressed that Pakistan “has a direct stake in a peaceful Afghanistan”. “We believe that the key to development and prosperity lies in regional stability and connectivity. Pakistan continues to engage with all partners to extend humanitarian assistance, promote economic recovery and encourage an inclusive political framework in Afghanistan,” he said. But, he went on to say, “the interim Afghan government must uphold human rights, including women’s rights. Above all, we expect the interim government to take effective action against terrorist groups and to ensure that Afghan soil is not used for terrorism against any country”. Dangers of Islamophobia The prime minister further underlined that “there must be no space for hate speech, discrimination or violence against any person, or against any religion”. “Hate-driven ideologies, like Hindutva-driven extremism in India, pose a danger to the entire world. While there is growing recognition of the dangers posed by Islamophobia, the imperative of effectively combatting this menace can hardly be over emphasised,” he asserted. The premier said Pakistan welcomed the appointment of a UN special envoy to combat this scourge. ‘Urgent collective action’ On the climate crisis, he said Pakistan demands “urgent collective action”. Speaking of the recent floods in the country, he said: “Our nation stands united in these testing times. We are dealing with this natural calamity with remarkable resilience … I have declared a climate emergency to cope with this challenge.” He termed the catastrophic floods of 2022 and 2025  in Pakistan “glaring examples of loss and damage caused due to climate change”. The premier also pointed out that Pakistan’s contribution to emissions annually was less than one per cent. “Yet, it continues to face the relentless brunt and muddy waves of climate change, and then we are told to take loans and add to our debt,” he rued. “This is not fairness, this is not equality, this is not justice, this is not fair play,” he asserted. “I think borrowing loans would be [akin to] destroying our economy. We would be better off … standing on our own feet, working hard and tirelessly.” He concluded his speech, saying: “At the end, let me assure you [that] Pakistan will always stand for peace, justice and development for a revitalised UN and cooperative multilateralism that is fair, inclusive and delivers for all. “Let this 80th anniversary [of the UN] not simply commemorate history. Let’s make history and chart a future for the next 80 years with these united nations as an enduring hope for global good. Let us truly strive to become better together.”",

It must be respected and appreciated, because we’re a bulwark,” he continued. “Had these terrorists not been encountered by us, they would have been roaming the streets of New York, London and God knows, the Far East.” The premier said Pakistan was today facing the problem of externally sponsored terrorism, particularly from foreign funded groups that were operating from the Afghan soil. He stressed that Pakistan “has a direct stake in a peaceful Afghanistan”. “We believe that the key to development and prosperity lies in regional stability and connectivity. Pakistan continues to engage with all partners to extend humanitarian assistance, promote economic recovery and encourage an inclusive political framework in Afghanistan,” he said. But, he went on to say, “the interim Afghan government must uphold human rights, including women’s rights. Above all, we expect the interim government to take effective action against terrorist groups and to ensure that Afghan soil is not used for terrorism against any country”. Dangers of Islamophobia The prime minister further underlined that “there must be no space for hate speech, discrimination or violence against any person, or against any religion”. “Hate-driven ideologies, like Hindutva-driven extremism in India, pose a danger to the entire world. While there is growing recognition of the dangers posed by Islamophobia, the imperative of effectively combatting this menace can hardly be over emphasised,” he asserted. The premier said Pakistan welcomed the appointment of a UN special envoy to combat this scourge. ‘Urgent collective action’ On the climate crisis, he said Pakistan demands “urgent collective action”. Speaking of the recent floods in the country, he said: “Our nation stands united in these testing times. We are dealing with this natural calamity with remarkable resilience … I have declared a climate emergency to cope with this challenge.” He termed the catastrophic floods of 2022 and 2025  in Pakistan “glaring examples of loss and damage caused due to climate change”. The premier also pointed out that Pakistan’s contribution to emissions annually was less than one per cent. “Yet, it continues to face the relentless brunt and muddy waves of climate change, and then we are told to take loans and add to our debt,” he rued. “This is not fairness, this is not equality, this is not justice, this is not fair play,” he asserted. “I think borrowing loans would be [akin to] destroying our economy. We would be better off … standing on our own feet, working hard and tirelessly.” He concluded his speech, saying: “At the end, let me assure you [that] Pakistan will always stand for peace, justice and development for a revitalised UN and cooperative multilateralism that is fair, inclusive and delivers for all. “Let this 80th anniversary [of the UN] not simply commemorate history. Let’s make history and chart a future for the next 80 years with these united nations as an enduring hope for global good. Let us truly strive to become better together.”",

      "summary": "As Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif detailed the events of May’s four-day escalation between India and Pakistan at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday, he highlighted the need for “proactive” rather than “provocative” leadership for South Asia. In May, the military confrontation between India and Pakistan had come as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally drop their guns. PM Shehbaz recalled the escalation at the 80th session of the UNGA today, where he led Pakistan’s delegation. He began his address with these words: “Our world is more complex today than ever before. Conflicts are intensifying, international law is being brazenly violated, humanitarian crises are multiplying, terrorism remains a potent threat, disinformation and fake news undermine trust, climate change threatens our very survival, and more so for countries like Pakistan.” He added that today, multilateralism was no more an option but the need of the hour. PM Shehbaz then explained that Pakistan’s foreign policy was based on peace, mutual respect and cooperation. “We believe in the peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and diplomacy,” he asserted. The premier recalled that last year, from this very podium, “I had warned that Pakistan would act most decisively against any external aggression”. @dawn.today Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, delivering his keynote address at the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, recalled that from the same podium last year he had warned Pakistan would respond decisively to any external aggression. “Those words proved true. In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. The enemy came shrouded in arrogance, and we sent them back in humiliation,” he said. For more updates, head to Dawn.com DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com “Those words of mine proved true … In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. Our enemy came shrouded in arrogance, [and] we sent them back in humiliation. “India sought to extract political gains from a human tragedy by spurning my sincere offer of an independent international investigation into the Pahalgam incident. Instead, it attacked our cities and targeted our innocent civilians. When our territorial integrity and our national security were violated, our response was in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.” He hailed Pakistan’s armed forces and the military leadership, saying: “Our valiant armed forces, under the stellar leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir mounted an operation of stunning professionalism, bravey and acumen. Repelling the enemy’s attack under Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Babar Sidhu, our falcons took flight and etched their answer across the skies, resulting in seven of the Indian jets being turned to scrap and dust.” As the premier commended the Pakistani forces and people for their resolve during the escalation with India, slogans of “Pakistan Zindabad ” (long live Pakistan) and “Shehbaz Sharif Zindabad ” (long live Shehbaz Sharif) were heard in the UNGA hall. The prime minister Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire following a four-day escalation with India in May from a position of strength. He also expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump and his tams for “their active role” in bringing about the ceasefire. “President Trump’s efforts for peace helped avert a … war in South Asia. Had he not intervened timely and decisively, the consequences of a full-fledged war would have been catastrophic,” PM Shehbaz said. “Therefore, in recognition of President Trump’s wonderful and outstanding contribution to promote peace in our part of the world, Pakistan nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. This is the least we could do … I think he truly is a man of peace.” He also thanked Pakistan’s “friends and partners”, including China, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Azerbaijan, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and the UN secretary general for extending diplomatic support to Pakistan during the escalation in May. “We have won the war, and now we seek to win peace in our part of the world. This is my most sincere serious offer before this august assembly of the world nations. Pakistan stands ready for a composite, comprehensive and result-oriented dialogue with India on all outstanding issues,” he said. PM Shehbaz emphasised that South Asia required “proactive rather than provocative leadership”. The “unilateral and illegal attempt to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance defies the provisions of the treaty itself, as well as the norms of international law itself,” he said, adding that Pakistan had made it abundantly clear that “we will definitely and ardently defend the … right of our 240m people on these waters”. He expressed solidarity with the people of occupied Kashmir, saying that one day, India’s tyranny in the valley would come to a grinding halt. “Kashmir will gain its fundamental right to self-determination through an impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations,” he said. ‘Heart wrenching’ Turning his attention toward Gaza, he said the plight of the Palestinian people was one of the “most heart-wrenching tragedies of our time”. “This prolonged injustice is a stain on the global conscious and our collective moral failure. For nearly 80 years, the Palestinians have courageously endured Israel’s brutal occupation of their homeland. In the West Bank, each passing day brings new brutality,” he grieved. In Gaza, he said, Israel’s genocidal onslaught had unleashed unspeakable terror upon women and children in a manner that had not been witnessed in the annals of history. “In [the] blind pursuit of its nefarious goals, the Israeli leadership has unleashed a shameful campaign against the innocent Palestinians, which history will remember as one of its darkest chapters,” he added. Emphasising the need to raise voice over the atrocities in Gaza, he said, “We must speak, and speak loud and clear.” He added, “Our words are too little and too late for Hind Rajab. A child, nay a little baby … My agony and the agony of the entire Muslim ummah, and the agony of all the nations on this planet, is that we failed Hind Rajab . And she will not forgive us.” View this post on Instagram The PM continued, “The smallest coffins are the heaviest to carry. I would know, as I carried the coffin of Irtaza Abbas during the recent confrontation with India. He was only six years old. Therefore, we cannot and must not fail these children of Gaza, or any child anywhere in the world. We must find a path to a ceasefire now.” He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for a sovereign Palestinian state with pre-1967 borders and Jerusalem as its capital. “Palestine can no no longer remain under Israeli shackles, it must be liberated and liberated with full commitment and full force.” He also welcomed the recognition of the State of Palestine by several countries recently and urged others to follow suit. Referring to a meeting of Trump with the leaders of some Muslim countries earlier this week, he appreciated the US president’s “timely initiative” to call the moot on Gaza. “I was also a part of that consultative process and I … pray to God that it rekindles hope for a ceasefire in the nearest future,” PM Shehbaz said. He went on to criticise Israel for its recent attack on Doha that targetted Hamas leaders. Condemning the strike, he expressed solidarity with Qatar. The premier also expressed support for efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict in line with the UN Charter,  “to end human suffering and global turmoil cause by this protracted war”. ‘Pakistan condemns all forms of terrorism’ Speaking about terrorism, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations.

      "summary_orig": "Iran and Russia signed a $25 billion deal to build nuclear power plants in the Islamic republic, Iranian state media reported on Friday, just hours ahead of the likely return of sweeping UN sanctions on Iran. “A deal for the construction of four nuclear power plants with a value of $25 billion in Sirik, Hormozgan was signed between the Iran Hormoz company and Rosatom,” state television said. Iran has just one operational nuclear power plant in Bushehr in the south, with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts — just a fraction of the country’s energy needs. According to state news agency IRNA , each plant will have a capacity of 1,255 megawatts, though no details were provided on the timeline. The move comes as so-called snapback sanctions triggered by the European parties to a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran are set to return by the end of Saturday. Britain, France and Germany triggered the sanctions last month, accusing of Iran of failing to adhere to its commitments under the agreement. At a Security Council session on Friday, China and Russia put forward a draft resolution to allow another half year for talks, but it is unlikely to garner enough support to pass. Western countries have long accused Iran of seeking an atomic bomb — a charge Tehran vehemently denies, defending its right to a civilian nuclear programme. The United States in 2018 unilaterally pulled out of the nuclear accord with Iran, prompting Tehran to begin walking back its commitments. Talks between Washington and Tehran to strike a new deal were underway, before being derailed by unprecedented Israeli strikes on Iran in June that began a 12-day war briefly joined by the United States. Iran had previously signed with Russia a nuclear energy deal in 1993 allowing for the construction of the Bushehr plant, after Germany had abandoned it in the wake of the Islamic revolution of 1979.",

At the same time, “It is understood that Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan was not fined and let off with a warning by Richardson. “Rauf was seen responding to heckling from Indian fans by signalling 6-0 with his hands and making gestures depicting the downing of aircraft, in apparent reference to the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May this year,” the report read. “Farhan had celebrated his fifty by mimicking a gunshot.” Earlier, India captain Suryakumar Yadav was found guilty by the ICC of breaching the code of conduct for his comments that alluded to the brief military skirmish between India and Pakistan this year, after their group stage match in the Asia Cup on September 14, ESPNcricinfo reported . “It is understood Suryakumar’s not-guilty plea was rejected by ICC match referee Richie Richardson and that he was fined 30pc of his match fee. India have appealed against the verdict,” the publication reported. The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its September 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”. At least 24 people had been killed in the April attack , which led to a brief military escalation between India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence. “The PCB had demanded the ICC impose a Level 4 sanction — reserved for the most serious breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct — on Suryakumar. It cited past examples of players who were either prevented from what was deemed political messaging or fined for deploying it,” the ESPNcricinfo report added. Pakistan won by 11 runs after stumbling to 135-8 in the virtual semi-final against Bangladesh in their men’s Asia Cup Super Four fixture at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday. With that win, the Green Shirts bookëd their final date with archrivals India for the first time in the 17th iteration of the Asia Cup on Sunday.",

      "summary_orig": "Indian police on Friday detained prominent activist Sonam Wangchuk over violent protests in the Himalayan territory of Ladakh that left at least five people dead, a lawyer said. Demonstrations demanding greater political autonomy for the sparsely populated, high-altitude region bordering China and Pakistan turned deadly on Wednesday when security forces opened fire. New Delhi blamed the unrest on “provocative speeches” by Wangchuk, who had been on a hunger strike demanding either full federal statehood for Ladakh or constitutional protections for its tribal communities, land and fragile environment. Mustafa Haji, a lawyer for the Apex Body Leh — which is spearheading the protests — told AFP that Wangchuk was “picked up” by the police from his village of Uley Tokpo on Friday. “Charges against him are not known yet,” Haji said. An engineer by training, Wangchuk, 59, is best known for pioneering water conservation projects in the Himalayas. He received the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2018 for his environmental work and contributions to reforming local schooling in Ladakh.\nHis life and work are said to have inspired a character played by Bollywood star Aamir Khan in the hugely popular movie Three Idiots . Wangchuk, who is a vocal advocate for Ladakh’s environmental protection and tribal rights, was briefly detained by Delhi Police last year during a protest march. Indian authorities on Thursday cancelled his non-profit organisation’s foreign funding licence. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said today that it is monitoring the situation. “The developments that unfolded in Leh, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, are extremely disturbing,” the FO told Dawn.com . They demonstrate the Indian authorities’ willingness to go to any extent to curb a protest. They are also another manifestation of India’s iron-fisted approach in that occupied territory.“ Modi’s government split Ladakh off from occupied Kashmir in 2019, imposing direct rule on both. New Delhi has yet to fulfil its promise to include Ladakh in the “Sixth Schedule” of India’s constitution, which allows people to make their own laws and policies. India’s army maintains a large presence in Ladakh, which includes disputed border areas with China. Troops from the two countries clashed there in 2020, killing at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers. Additional reporting by Abdullah Momand",

      "summary_orig": "An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Friday refused to extend the physical remand of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers, according to the group’s lawyer. Advocate Israr Jatak, a member of BYC’s legal team, told Dawn.com , “Quetta ATC-1 refused to extend the physical remand of five accused, namely Mahrang, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Beberg Baloch and Gulzadi and ordered them to be sent to jail on judicial remand.” In a hearing presided over by Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) produced Mahrang and others in court today after the completion of their 15-day physical remand granted on September 11. Advocate Shoaib Mengal, along with Advocate Jatak, appeared in the court on behalf of the accused. The CTD requested the court for an extension to the physical remand of the accused, but Judge Mubeen refused, asking for the accused to be handed over to jail custody. On September 11, a Quetta ATC judge extended the physical remand of Dr Mahrang and other organisers of the group on the police’s request. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.  Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. She was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order — for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April. After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order , extending their imprisonment by another 15 days. Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.",
