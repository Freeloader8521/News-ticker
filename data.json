      "summary_orig": "Three cops were martyred as back-to-back blasts rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu on Friday, according to police. KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed shared these details with Dawn.com , saying that the first blast targeted a police checkpost in the jurisdiction of Baliamina police station. He said no policemen were usually deployed at the checkpost, adding that some policemen were on their way to the site when a second blast took place near their vehicle. Three policemen were martyred in the second blast, which was caused by an improvised explosive device, the IG said. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi sought an immediate report from the IG following the incident and called a session of the apex committee on the law and order situation in the province, a statement from the CM office said. It added that the CM had “strongly condemned” the incident and termed it “unfortunate”. The statement further quoted him as saying that the “elements involved [in the incident] would be taken to task at all costs. Cowardly attacks cannot demoralise the CTD (counter-terrorism department) and police”. He added the sacrifices of the martyred police personnel, which also included a superintendent of police, “will not go in vain” and that  “all resources will be used to establish peace”. CM Afridi also prayed for the martyred personnel and their families, the statement said. Earlier, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also “strongly condemned” the blasts, a statement posted on his ministry’s X account said, adding that he paid tributes to the martyred police, including Superintendent of Police (Operations) Asad Zubair. He also extended condolences to the families of the martyred policemen. “The sacrifice of martyred SP Asad Zubair and two other police personnel will not go in vain. The sacrifices of the officers and personnel of KP Police cannot be forgotten,” the statement quoted him as saying. Former KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur also expressed sorrow over the martyrdom of policemen in the incident. “Saddened to hear about the martyrdom of SP (Operations) Asad Zubair and two [other] policemen during an IED attack in Hangu. KP police, security forces and the brave people of KP have been paying the price for our peace with their blood,” he posted on X. Pakistan has been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan since banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022. Ending the ceasefire agreement, the TTP had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel. Today’s blasts take place five days after law enforcers foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in KP’s Bannu district on Oct 19. According to police, the failed attack was carried out by the TTP and targeted the Baka Khel police station and three terrorists were killed as cops opened fire on them. Previously on Oct 18, unkn­own assailants had l aunched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan. According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the Frontier Corps personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident. Prior to that, on the night of Oct 17, police had intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station. This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters.",

      "title_orig": "Interior ministry notifies ban on TLP following federal cabinet’s approval",
      "summary_orig": "The interior ministry on Friday notified the ban on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), saying that the federal government had “reasonable grounds” to believe the religiopolitical party was connected to terrorism. The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , said: “The federal government has reasonable grounds to believe that TLP is connected with and concerned in terrorism. “In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 11B(1)(a) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (XXVII of 1997), the federal government hereby orders TLP to be a proscribed organisation for the purpose of the Act and list the aforesaid organisation in the first schedule to the said Act,” the notification said. The development comes a day after the federal cabinet approved a proposal to proscribe party under the Anti-Terrorism Act, days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on a proposal from the Punjab government. A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting said the ban was “unanimously” approved by the federal cabinet. The interior ministry briefed the cabinet on what it called the TLP’s “violent and terrorist activities”, stressing that the organisation had repeatedly incited unrest across the country. The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It was previously banned by the PTI government in 2021 after violent protests. The interior ministry informed the cabinet that the 2021 ban on TLP was lifted after six months on the assurance that it would refrain from violence. It added that the current ban on TLP stemmed from its reneging on those guarantees. “In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP,” the PM Office statement said. A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that participants were asked to share their views on TLP’s “firebrand” approach, and “almost everyone was of the view that the organisation must be barred from paralysing the country time and again”. Later, speaking on Geo News, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the intent behind a ban was not to eliminate a party but to purge it of “anti-state and terrorist elements”. He said no one had any issue with the TLP’s religious views. But whenever the party staged protests in the past, it “led to violence and loss of life, such as the 2017 Faizabad demonstrations”. In separate remarks to Geo News , Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the TLP had acted like an extremist group and violated its prior commitments. Chaudhry said the government had no other option in light of reports submitted by the Punjab government than to ban the party. He said the interior ministry had summoned reports from all provinces about the party’s conduct in the past decade regarding its involvement in violence, targeting of minorities, incitement of sectarianism and other such matters. Legal framework Under the country’s legal framework, the Nat­ional Counter-Terrorism Aut­hority (Nacta) maintains lists of proscribed persons and groups. Those designated as terrorists or associated with terrorism face severe consequences, such as travel bans and financial sanctions. Individuals may also be placed on the Fourth Schedule of the ATA for monitoring. Historically, proscribed entities have included the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Hizbut Tahrir, Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Jaish-i-Mohammad and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). The provincial government can request a ban on a party, as in the case of the TLP. In turn, the federal government has the power to refer this request to the Supreme Court by declaring that the party “has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan”, according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution. However, according to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court under the Constitution. “The federal government shall, within 15 days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,” the article says. The government can also invoke Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek the dissolution of a political party. Any declaration is subject to adjudication by the Supreme Court.",

      "summary_orig": "A Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday directed the relevant authorities to block the national identity card (CNIC) and passport of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, over her failure to attend the hearing despite the execution of a non-bailable arrest warrant against her. The development came in a case pertaining to a protest staged by the PTI in November last year, in which the court has issued arrest warrants for her multiple times. The last non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema in the case was issued on October 22 over her persistent absences from the hearings. It was executed yesterday as Punjab Sub-Divisional Police Officer Azhar Shah presented the warrant before an Islamabad High Court bench and obtained Aleema’s signature on the spot. During today’s hearing, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah observed that Aleema “is present everywhere but doesn’t appear before the court”. Her attendance at the court would be ensured, he remarked. The judge directed the National Database and Registration Authority director general (DG), as well as the Passports DG, to block her CNIC and passport. The court also ordered the forfeiture of the properties of her guarantor to the state and directed the State Bank of Pakistan to freeze all of Aleema’s bank accounts. Following these directives, the court adjourned the hearing till Oct 27. Case background The case at hand famously came to be knows as the November 26 protest case. The said protest had seen more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad last year, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone had ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”. Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations. Aleema, along with 10 others, was booked in the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station. The Rawalpindi ATC has issued arrest warrants for her in the case at least four times. The last and third non-bailable arrest warrants for her were issued during the Oct 22 hearing, when the court had also issued show-cause notices to two police of­ficers for submitting a bogus report regarding the non-arrest Aleema Khan. The court had observed that the officers had presented a “fabricated and misleading report” claiming that Aleema Khan had gone into hiding, despite videos circulating on social media showing her addressing the media outside Adiala Jail the previous evening. Prior to that, the court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over her continued absence from the proceedings during an Oct 20 hearing as well. Previously, the court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her during a hearing on Oct 14, noting that she had failed to appear twice before the court. During that hearing, the court had also rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that she was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the Nov 26 protest. The ATC had also issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleem on Oct 8. Aleema was to be indicted during that hearing but didn’t appear before the court.",

      "summary_orig": "India trialled cloud seeding over its smog-filled capital for the first time, spraying a chemical from an aeroplane to encourage rain and wash deadly particles out of the air. Cloud seeding is the practice of using aeroplanes to fire salt or other chemicals into clouds to induce rain. New Delhi city authorities, working with the government’s Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, launched a test run on Thursday afternoon using a Cessna light aeroplane over the city’s northern Burari area. “A trial seeding flight was done … in which cloud seeding flares were fired”, Delhi Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said in a statement late on Thursday. “This flight was the proving flight for checking the capabilities for cloud seeding, the readiness and endurance of the aircraft, the capability assessment of the cloud seeding fitments and flares, and coordination among all involved agencies.” It comes ahead of a planned rollout of the scheme. Delhi’s Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said that “if conditions remain favourable, Delhi will experience its first artificial rain on October 29.” It was not immediately clear what chemical was used in the test to encourage the rain. New Delhi and its sprawling metropolitan region of 30 million people are regularly ranked among the world’s most polluted capitals, with acrid smog blanketing the skyline each winter. Cooler air traps pollutants close to the ground, creating a deadly mix of emissions from crop burning, factories and heavy traffic. Levels of PM2.5 — cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream — at times rise to as much as 60 times the UN daily health limits. Pollution rose this week after days of fireworks launched to mark Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, shooting PM2.5 levels to more than 56 times the limit. That came after the Supreme Court this month eased a blanket ban on fireworks to allow the use of the less-polluting “green” crackers — developed to reduce particulate emissions. At dawn on Thursday, PM 2.5 levels were 154 microgrammes per cubic metre in parts of New Delhi, according to monitoring organisation IQAir, just more than 10 times World Health Organisation limits. A study found in September that the noxious air is even turning Delhi’s iconic 17th-century Red Fort black. Scientists warned that the Unesco World Heritage Site is being steadily disfigured by a black crust, according to a study published in the Heritage journal by a joint team of Indian and Italian researchers. Invented in the 1940s, countries have been seeding clouds for decades to alleviate drought, fight forest fires, and even to disperse fog at airports. China used it in 2008 to try to stop rain from falling on Beijing’s Olympic stadium. But research on the effects of cloud seeding on neighbouring regions is mixed — and some evidence suggests it does not work very well even in the target area.",

      "summary_orig": "VATICAN: Britain’s King Charles and Pope Leo prayed together in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel on Thursday, in the first joint worship including an English monarch and a Catholic pontiff since King Henry VIII broke away from Rome in 1534. Latin chants and English prayers echoed through the chapel, where Leo was elected the first US pope by the world’s Catholic cardinals six months ago in front of frescoes by Michelangelo depicting Christ delivering the Last Judgment. Charles, supreme governor of the Church of England, was seated at the pope’s left near the altar of the chapel as Leo and Anglican Archbishop Stephen Cottrell led a service that featured the Sistine Chapel Choir and two royal choirs. Although Charles has met the last three popes, and Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI travelled to Britain, their previous encounters never included joint prayers. ‘A healing’ The King and Queen Camilla are on a state visit to the Vatican, marking the closening ties between the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion, five centuries after their turbulent separation. “There is a strong sense that this moment in the extraordinary setting of the Sistine Chapel offers a kind of healing of history,” Anglican Rev. James Hawkey, canon theologian of Westminster Abbey, said. “This would have been impossible just a generation ago,” he said.  “It represents how far our churches have come over the last 60 years of dialogue.”  Cottrell, the Ang­lican Archbishop of York, stood in at the Sistine Chapel service for Sarah Mullally. She was recently announced as the first woman to serve as Archbishop of Canterbury, the spiritual head of the Anglican Communion, but will not take the role until next year. The split between the Catholic Church and the Church of England was formalised in 1534, after Pope Clement VII refused to annul King Henry VIII’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Henry’s desire for a male heir—and a new wife who might provide one—was the immediate catalyst, but other factors were also at play, involving the English crown’s seizure of church assets and the growth of Protestant ideas in England. As England swung between Cath­olicism and Protestantism during the reigns of Henry’s daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I, hundreds of Catholics and Prot­estants were executed for their faith, often burned at the stake. Special title, seat Charles and Camilla, who visited the Vatican earlier this year to see Pope Francis, also had a private meeting with Leo on Thursday morning. At home in Britain, Charles’ disgraced brother, Prince Andrew, is engulfed in a deepening crisis over abuse allegations and his ties with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The King will travel in the afternoon to Rome’s Basilica of St Paul Outside the Walls, one of Catholicism’s four most venerated churches, where Leo has approved giving him a new title of  “Royal Confrater”, or brother, at the connected abbey. Charles will also be gifted a special seat in the apse of the basilica. The wooden chair, reserved in the future for use only by British monarchs, is decorated with the king’s coat of arms and the ecumenical motto  “Ut unum sint” (That they may be one). Bishop Anthony Ball, the official Anglican representative to the Vatican, said the honours  “show the commitment that both of our Churches have to working for a shared future.” Ties improving since 60s The Church of England is one of 46 autonomous churches across some 165 countries that together form the Anglican Communion. The Catholic Church, which has 1.4 billion members, and the Anglican Communion, with 85 million members, have been improving ties since the 1960s. The teachings of the two traditions align on many major issues, but the Catholic Church does not ordain women and generally does not allow priests to marry. Published in Dawn, October 24th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The Snow Leopard Foundation estimates only 167 of these animals are left in Pakistan.—File photo GILGIT: Snow leopards living in Pakistan are severely threatened by climate change, poaching, and habitat fragmentation, experts have warned after a first-of-its-kind scientific survey that revealed only 167 of these rare animals remain in the country. The research by the Snow Leopard Foundation of Pakistan (SLF) provides a scientific population estimate for the species, which was previously counted on the basis of suggestions and assumptions, said Dr Hussain Ali, the paper’s author and a senior regional programme manager at the SLF. Conducted between 2010 and 2019, the study used extensive camera trapping over 40,000 square kilometres, with 1,000 cameras and 1,200 genetic samples. Climate change , along with shifting weather patterns, threaten the snow leopard’s habitat, Dr Ali said, a sentiment echoed by other conservationists. “Less snowfall and drought at the mountains force snow leopards either to migrate or move to low-lying areas,” he added. This movement results in snow leopards attacking livestock, and “in retaliation, owners attempt to kill the snow leopard”. The snow leopard is considered a key indicator of the health of mountain ecosystems, which are a vital source of water for billions of people. Threats to its survival signal a danger to the entire region. Increasing human activity, including the development of roads and infrastructure near their habitat, also threatens the elusive cat, Dr Ali added. Meanwhile, the United Nations marked International Snow Leopard Day on Thursday, releasing new videos showing the elusive mountain cat in Pakistan’s northern ranges and other parts of its habitat, while urging stronger efforts to protect the species from extinction. In messages to Pakistan and 12 other range countries, the UN said snow leopards remain at high risk of extinction in the wild, even though they were reclassified as “vulnerable” — rather than “endan­gered” — on the Intern­ational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List in 2017. In 2024, the UN General Assembly declared Oct 23 as International Day of the Snow Leopard to promote international and regional cooperation for conserving the species, which plays a vital role in maintaining the ecosystem of high mountain regions. “The snow leopard is not just a symbol of wilderness; it is vital to the health of our mountain ecosystems,” the UN said, urging local communities, park authorities, and conservation groups in Pakistan to intensify protection efforts.

      "summary_orig": "• Cabinet told 2021 proscription was lifted after party pledged to renounce violence • Talal says TLP acted like an extremist group, reneged on commitments • Rana Sanaullah says ban aims to ‘purge anti-state, terrorist elements’, not erase party • PM unveils three-year ‘Roshan Economy’ power tariff of Rs22.98 per unit ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to proscribe the religion-political group Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) , days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on a proposal from the Punjab government. A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting said the ban was “unanimously” approved by the federal cabinet. The interior ministry briefed the cabinet on what it called the TLP’s “violent and terrorist activities”, stressing that the organisation had repeatedly incited unrest across the country. The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It was previously banned by the PTI government in 2021 after violent protests. The interior ministry informed the cabinet that the 2021 ban on TLP was lifted after six months on the assurance that it would refrain from violence. It added that the current ban on TLP stemmed from its reneging on those guarantees. “In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP,” the PM Office statement said. A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that participants were asked to share their views on TLP’s “firebrand” approach, and “almost everyone was of the view that the organisation must be barred from paralysing the country time and again”. The cabinet meeting was held on a single-point agenda, and no other items were discussed, the source added. Later, speaking on Geo News , Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the intent behind a ban was not to eliminate a party but to purge it of “anti-state and terrorist elements”. He said no one had any issue with the TLP’s religious views. But whenever the party staged protests in the past, it “led to violence and loss of life, such as the 2017 Faizabad demonstrations”. In separate remarks to Geo News , Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the TLP had acted like an extremist group and violated its prior commitments. Mr Chaudhry said the government had no other option in light of reports submitted by the Punjab government than to ban the party. He said the interior ministry had summoned reports from all provinces about the party’s conduct in the past decade regarding its involvement in violence, targeting of minorities, incitement of sectarianism and other such matters. Legal framework Under the country’s legal framework, the Nat­ional Counter-Terrorism Aut­hority (Nacta) maintains lists of proscribed persons and groups. Those designated as terrorists or associated with terrorism face severe consequences, such as travel bans and financial sanctions. Individuals may also be placed on the Fourth Schedule of the ATA for monitoring. Historically, proscribed entities have included the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Hizbut Tahrir, Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Jaish-i-Mohammad and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). The provincial government can request a ban on a party, as in the case of the TLP. In turn, the federal government has the power to refer this request to the Supreme Court by declaring that the party “has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan”, according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution . However, according to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court under the Constitution. “The federal government shall, within 15 days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,” the article says. The government can also invoke Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek the dissolution of a political party. Any declaration is subject to adjudication by the Supreme Court. Electricity package Separately, PM Shehbaz announced a three-year “Roshan Economy Elec­tricity Package” offering additional electricity to the industrial and agriculture sectors at a subsidi­sed rate of Rs22.98 per unit from Nov 2025 to Oct 2028. The current tariffs of around Rs34 for industry and Rs38 for agriculture will be reduced to Rs22.98 for both. During a meeting with a delegation of experts from the industry and agriculture sectors, as well as representatives of the business community, he said the fiscal impact would not be passed on to domestic consumers or other sectors. Appreciating the efforts of Power Minister Awais Leghari and his team, he said lowering energy costs was essential to competitiveness, exports and job creation.

      "summary_orig": "• KP says ‘ban’ on inter-provincial movement of commodity violates Article 151(1) • Warns of shortages, risks to food security • Sindh accuses Punjab of halting supply of wheat seed; seeks PM’s intervention PESHAWAR / KARACHI: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Thursday asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs are disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province. Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed. In a letter to his Punjab counterpart, KP’s food secretary said that lifting the ban was critical to res­t­oring a smooth supply chain, stabilising market prices, and safeguarding his province’s food security. The letter said KP, a wheat-deficient province, depends on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its requirements — roughly 14,500 tonnes per day. “The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,” it read. While KP acknowledged Punjab’s recent permit-based allocation of 2,000 tonnes of flour for transport to KP, it termed the quota “insufficient” relative to actual requirements. KP lamented that despite repeated communications from its chief secretary, food secretary and director of food to Punjab, the ban continued to remain in force. “This situation is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 151(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which guarantees freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country,” the letter said. The letter added that the issue was raised at a high-level meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, on Oct 17 regarding the Interim Wheat Policy 2025, where the smooth inter-provincial movement of wheat and its products was emphasised. “The KP Flour Mills Association has repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that the non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist,” it said. On Wednesday, KP Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi condemned Punjab’s “ban” on wheat and flour transport to KP, calling it a violation of the Constitution and “an attack on the rights” of the people of the province. Chairing a meeting, he directed the food department’s high-ups to write a letter to the Punjab government demanding immediate removal of all restrictions to ensure free movement of wheat and its flour across the provincial borders, according to a statement from the chief minister’s secretariat. Mr Afridi said that hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of necessities was unacceptable. Officials told the meeting that KP consumes about 5.3 million tonnes of wheat and flour annually, of which only 1.5 million tonnes are produced locally, while the remainder is sourced from Punjab and other provinces. Seed supply issues in Sindh Meanwhile, despite an apparent ceasefire between coalition partners, tensions between the PPP and PML-N have escalated once again after the Punjab government allegedly halted the supply of wheat seed to Sindh — a move that sparked strong protests from the PPP, which has called for the prime minister’s urgent intervention. Nisar Khuhro, PPP’s Sindh chapter president and chair of the provincial Public Accounts Committee, accused both the federal and Punjab governments of being “anti-Sindh” and urged PM Shehbaz to take immediate notice of the issue. “As the wheat sowing season begins, the Punjab Agriculture Regulatory Authority and the Food Department, acting on the Punjab government’s directives, have reportedly halted the supply of hundreds of thousands of wheat seed bags to Sindh,” he said. “This disruption has raised serious concerns that wheat cultivation across vast areas of Sindh could be severely affected. If Punjab does not resume seed supply to Sindh immediately, the province’s overall wheat production could decline significantly,” he added. On Wednesday, the PPP’s questions over the wheat procurement mechanism following the recent announcement of the minimum support price (MSP) at Rs3,500 per 40 kilograms created quite a stir between the two sides and drew a strong reaction from the Punjab government. In May, the federal food minister told the National Assembly that Passco was being abolished as part of market deregulation. The policy has since been reversed under a national wheat policy, but procurement modalities remain contested. Against this backdrop, PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza asked at a press conference on Wednesday who would procure wheat and under what mechanism following Passco’s “abolition”. He said farmers were at the mercy of middlemen paying below the MSP. The remarks drew a strong response from the Punjab government. Provincial Information Minister Azma Bokhari urged the PPP leadership to take notice of Mr Murtaza’s remarks, warning the PML-N would otherwise respond in kind. With the dust barely settled, the PPP’s leadership from Sindh has now raised fresh objections, accusing the PML-N of depriving the province’s farmers of their due rights. “It’s a grave injustice to Sindh’s farmers and tantamount to economic exploitation of growers and haris [farm labourers],” said Mr Khuhro. “Pakistan produces about 552,000 tonnes of wheat seed annually, out of which Punjab-based seed companies account for roughly 516,000 tonnes. However, the Punjab government is reportedly preventing these companies from selling their wheat seed to Sindh.” According to the PPP leader, Sindh’s farmers and dealers have already paid Punjab-based suppliers for the seeds, yet the supply has been blocked. He described the move as “anti-Sindh” and discriminatory against the province’s farmers. Published in Dawn, October 24th, 2025",

If Punjab does not resume seed supply to Sindh immediately, the province’s overall wheat production could decline significantly,” he added. On Wednesday, the PPP’s questions over the wheat procurement mechanism following the recent announcement of the minimum support price (MSP) at Rs3,500 per 40 kilograms created quite a stir between the two sides and drew a strong reaction from the Punjab government. In May, the federal food minister told the National Assembly that Passco was being abolished as part of market deregulation. The policy has since been reversed under a national wheat policy, but procurement modalities remain contested. Against this backdrop, PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza asked at a press conference on Wednesday who would procure wheat and under what mechanism following Passco’s “abolition”. He said farmers were at the mercy of middlemen paying below the MSP. The remarks drew a strong response from the Punjab government. Provincial Information Minister Azma Bokhari urged the PPP leadership to take notice of Mr Murtaza’s remarks, warning the PML-N would otherwise respond in kind. With the dust barely settled, the PPP’s leadership from Sindh has now raised fresh objections, accusing the PML-N of depriving the province’s farmers of their due rights. “It’s a grave injustice to Sindh’s farmers and tantamount to economic exploitation of growers and haris [farm labourers],” said Mr Khuhro. “Pakistan produces about 552,000 tonnes of wheat seed annually, out of which Punjab-based seed companies account for roughly 516,000 tonnes. However, the Punjab government is reportedly preventing these companies from selling their wheat seed to Sindh.” According to the PPP leader, Sindh’s farmers and dealers have already paid Punjab-based suppliers for the seeds, yet the supply has been blocked. He described the move as “anti-Sindh” and discriminatory against the province’s farmers. Published in Dawn, October 24th, 2025",

      "title_orig": "Trump says would pull US support if Israel annexes West Bank",
      "summary_orig": "President Donald Trump said Israel would lose its crucial backing from the United States if it annexes the occupied West Bank, in a Time magazine interview published on Thursday. Trump’s comments , which Time said were made by telephone on October 15, were published as both Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned against any annexation. “It won’t happen. It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. And you can’t do that now. We’ve had great Arab support,” Trump said when asked what the consequences would be for Israel if it did so. “Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.” Trump also told Time that he believed Saudi Arabia would join the Abraham Accords, which normalise relations between Israel and Arab states, by the end of the year. “Yes, I do. I do,” he said when asked if he thought Riyadh would join in that timeframe. “See they had a problem. They had a Gaza problem and they had an Iran problem. Now they don’t have those two problems,” he said, referring to Israel’s military onslaught in Gaza and Iran’s nuclear programme, which US airstrikes targeted earlier this year. Trump then said that he would be “making a decision” on whether Israel should release high-profile Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti as part of peace moves. Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — was among the Palestinian prisoners Hamas wanted to see released as part of the Gaza deal, according to Egyptian state-linked media. Trump has dispatched a stream of top officials to Israel in recent days to shore up the fragile Gaza ceasefire he brokered earlier this month. But as Vance wrapped up his three-day visit and Rubio arrived, Israeli lawmakers advanced two bills paving the way for West Bank annexation. A bill applying Israeli law to the West Bank, a move tantamount to annexation of a territory that Palestinians seek for part of a future independent state, won preliminary approval from Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday. Vance said it was a “very stupid political stunt and I personally take some insult to it”. As Rubio left Washington he warned Israel against annexing the West Bank, saying steps taken by parliament and settler violence threatened the Gaza truce. Vance said that Trump would oppose Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank and it would not happen. Vance spoke after Rubio warned that steps toward annexing the territory, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war, could endanger Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict, which has yielded a shaky ceasefire so far. “The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of President Trump is that the West Bank will not be annexed. This will always be our policy,” Vance said at the end of a two-day visit to Israel. Far-right opposition sponsored vote The vote was sponsored by a far-right opposition lawmaker who until recently was in the ruling right-wing coalition, and backed by ultranationalists National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. The reading passed by a vote of 25-24 out of 120 lawmakers. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office later said that the vote was a “deliberate political provocation” that aimed to sow division during Vance’s visit. Netanyahu’s Likud party did not vote for the bill, it said, adding that without its support, attempts to legislate the annexation of the West Bank were “unlikely to go anywhere”. The US has long been Israel’s most powerful and staunch major power ally and the Trump administration is particularly close to Israel with considerable sway over its leadership. Netanyahu has repeatedly ruled out Palestinian statehood. His cabinet has considered the idea of annexation as a response to major Western allies recently recognising a Palestinian state to put pressure on Israel to stop its devastating military onslaught in Gaza, but appeared to shelve it after Trump objected last month. Senior White House officials and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner have been visiting Israel seeking to keep alive the 13-day-old truce between Israel and Hamas after two years of fighting that has upended the Middle East. Rubio is due to arrive in Israel on Thursday. The US State Department said Rubio was visiting Israel to support the implementation of Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan, which envisages eventual reconstruction and stable governance in the enclave along with possible steps towards Palestinian statehood. Vance told reporters at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport that he “feels pretty good” about the Gaza ceasefire after holding talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, other senior officials and the military. Israel and Hamas have reiterated their commitment to the US-mediated ceasefire while trading accusations of repeated violations since it took effect on October 10. The deal has so far seen the release of captives held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel, a handover of bodies of some deceased people and a partial pullout of Israeli troops. West Bank settlements There are hundreds of thousands of people living in Jewish settlements across the West Bank. The United Nations and much of the international community consider the settlements illegal under international law. Israel’s government cites biblical and historical connections to the West Bank, territory that it regards as disputed, and opposes any steps towards Palestinian statehood. The settlements are a highly volatile issue that has for decades loomed as a major obstacle to Middle East peace, as they fragment territory Palestinians want for a viable state. Wednesday’s vote was the first of four needed to pass the law and coincided with Vance’s visit to Israel — a month after Trump said he would not allow Israel to annex the territory. Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkiye and 13 other Muslim-majority nations condemned the vote, as did the key multilateral organisations that represent Arab states and Muslim nations. Trump hopes his Gaza plan will deliver stability across the Middle East and widen normalisation deals known as the Abraham Accords between Israel and Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates to include regional power Saudi Arabia. The kingdom has repeatedly said it would not strike a deal with Israel without the formation of a Palestinian state. Speaking at a conference in Jerusalem, Smotrich had said that, “if Saudi Arabia tells us normalisation in exchange for a Palestinian state, friends, no thank you. “Keep riding camels on the sand in the Saudi desert; we’ll keep truly developing — with an economy, a society, a state and all the great and wonderful things we know how to do.“ He later expressed regret for what he called his “unfortunate” remarks about Saudi Arabia. “My statement regarding Saudi Arabia was unfortunate, and I regret any offence it may have caused,” Smotrich said in a video statement he posted on X. But he said that he also expected Saudis not to offend Israel. “I’m also not willing to accept hypocrisy. Just as I don’t intend to offend the Saudis, I expect from them not to offend me, or rather, offend us,” he said. “And anyone who denies the living and very deep connection we have to the regions of our homeland in Judea and Samaria, offends us,” he added, using the Israeli Biblical term for the occupied West Bank. Smotrich, who lives in a West Bank settlement, is an outspoken supporter of annexing the Palestinian territory. His earlier comments had prompted sharp responses in Israel. Opposition leader Yair Lapid had swiftly denounced the comments. “To our friends in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, Smotrich does not represent the state of Israel,” Lapid posted on X in Arabic, later calling for him to apologise. Former defence minister Benny Gantz, another opposition figure, said that Smotrich’s comments “indicate ignorance, and a lack of internalisation of his responsibility as a senior minister in the government and cabinet”. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco normalised relations with Israel in 2020 under the US-brokered Abraham Accords. But Saudi Arabia’s own normalisation talks with Israel were frozen after Hamas’s October 2023 attack sparked the Gaza war.",
