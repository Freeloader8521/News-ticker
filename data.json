      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Tuesday that there was no question of a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley, whose residents have been vacating there houses in recent days amid concerns about a military action against terrorists. Asif made these remarks during a press conference in Islamabad, where he was flanked by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Information and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan. At the outset of the press conference, he said members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan had been residing in Tirah with their families. “They are around 400-500 in number,” he said. The defence minister further stated that the provincial government had approved a package of Rs4 billion for the people of Tirah Valley, who were to migrate. “The armed forces deployed in that area have nothing to do with it. This is an arrangement between the jirga and the provincial government, and as a result of that, this notification was issued,” he added, holding up a notification that he said was issued by the KP government. The defence minister further stated that a military operation in the area had been carried out years ago. “And it was strategically decided then that intelligence-based operations (IBO) are way more effective than operations; the collateral damage is way less. So, the armed forces have stopped the operation since years now in favour of the IBOs,” he said. The minister added, “This is why this practice has been ongoing there for many years, and that is why there is no question of any operation there.” Moreover, the minister continued, migration in the valley was a routine practice. He also criticised the KP government’s performance, highlighting a lack of hospitals, schools and police stations in the valley. “Even though, it had been agreed between the provincial government and the jirga that hospitals, police stations and girls’ schools will be established there.” More to follow",

      "summary_orig": "The Sindh government on Tuesday denied claims made by factions of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) that the provincial administration has withdrawn personnel deployed for the latter’s security. The MQM-Pakistan (MQM-P) and the PPP have been engaged in a war of words since the Gul Plaza inferno, trading blame over improper governance during the tenure of their respective party mayors. Speaking to Geo News earlier today, MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal replied in the affirmative when asked whether he was among the MQM leaders whose security protocol had reportedly been withdrawn by the Sindh government. The MQM-P leader, who also serves as the federal health minister, insisted that the action was “in response” to his party’s criticism of the Sindh government and to “scare them”. Instead, Kamal argued, the provincial government’s alleged action supported the MQM-P’s stance that Karachi be “taken in the Centre’s control”. “Karachi should not be in control of an incompetent provincial government like Sindh’s,” he said, adding the Sindh government could not “suppress our voices” by taking these measures. He went on to say that the provision of security did not matter to them. The MQM-Haqiqi (MQM-H) also said the Sindh government has withdrawn security from party chairman Afaq Ahmed. In a statement, MQM-H Vice Chairman Shaukat Farooqi condemned the alleged move, saying it indicated that the PPP was afraid of Ahmed. ‘Those entitled have security’ In a statement, Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar clarified that security has not been withdrawn from any MQM leaders. He stated that Kamal, the federal health minister, and Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui were currently in Islamabad, adding that no security granted to any political figure has been revoked. Lanjar added that security arrangements for political leaders, including those from the MQM, will continue unchanged. Speaking to reporters later in the day, Sindh Senior Minister Shajreel Inam Memon also dismissed the MQM-P’s claims. “The home minister has categorically told the media that no security has been withdrawn from MQM,” Memon asserted, saying that the party was engaged in “propaganda” and a “campaign”. The minister clarified that even Sindh Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi still has the security allotted to him. “Whoever is entitled to it, they all have security,” Memon said, adding that those not entitled, needed to submit a request to the government along with their reasons. “Federal ministers in Islamabad roam around with a single police official. Here, they have been allotted 10 police personnel each. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui has 10 police officers; Mustafa Kamal may have more than that.” He also noted that MQM-P leaders who were federal ministers — namely Kamal and Siddiqui — were in Islamabad as per his reports. “So, did you have to take the security along with you?” he asked rhetorically. Earlier in the day, Sindh government spokesperson MPA Sadia Javed told Geo News that she was unaware of any such move to withdraw security, adding that it might have been done due to “shortage of police”. Replying to a question on the disruption of proceedings in the Sindh Assembly, which witnessed a protest on Monday and slogans on Tuesday as well, Memon said protesting was the right of everyone in a democracy. “Opposition can protest, if they want,” he told reporters. Memon raised multiple questions, asking why the MQM-P did not protest after the May 12, 2007 mayhem , the Bolton market blaze and the Baldia factory tragedy . The Sindh senior minister stated: We are not saying them [MQM-P] not to [protest] .. it. We are democratic people. Everything that comes under democracy is allowed. “However, if they opt for undemocratic practices, the government will not sit idle,” he added, calling for the protests to be “peaceful”. “We will support them. However, if they opt for old tactics of … [forcefully] closing shops, … shooting in the city, this time our mood is different,” he said, adding that the government would prioritise the public’s safety if the MQM-P attempted to stage a strike or engage in arson or vandalism. “When this incident (Gul Plaza fire) occurred, everyone was teary-eyed … but the attitude of certain parties … the bodies were not even recovered and calls were made to roll back the 18th Amendment and hand over Karachi to the Centre,” Memon said. In the wake of the Gul Plaza inferno, which has claimed at least 73 lives , the MQM-P demanded that Karachi be made a “federal territory” by making it the country’s “financial capital”. It also assailed the 18th Amendment, which devolved certain ministries to the provinces from the Centre, and claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage” of it. In response, the PPP has assailed the MQM-P for “ politicising ” the Gul Plaza fire. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah detailed the shopping centre’s history, noting former mayors had approved leases to regularise building violations.",

In a statement, MQM-H Vice Chairman Shaukat Farooqi condemned the alleged move, saying it indicated that the PPP was afraid of Ahmed. ‘Those entitled have security’ In a statement, Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar clarified that security has not been withdrawn from any MQM leaders. He stated that Kamal, the federal health minister, and Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui were currently in Islamabad, adding that no security granted to any political figure has been revoked. Lanjar added that security arrangements for political leaders, including those from the MQM, will continue unchanged. Speaking to reporters later in the day, Sindh Senior Minister Shajreel Inam Memon also dismissed the MQM-P’s claims. “The home minister has categorically told the media that no security has been withdrawn from MQM,” Memon asserted, saying that the party was engaged in “propaganda” and a “campaign”. The minister clarified that even Sindh Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi still has the security allotted to him. “Whoever is entitled to it, they all have security,” Memon said, adding that those not entitled, needed to submit a request to the government along with their reasons. “Federal ministers in Islamabad roam around with a single police official. Here, they have been allotted 10 police personnel each. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui has 10 police officers; Mustafa Kamal may have more than that.” He also noted that MQM-P leaders who were federal ministers — namely Kamal and Siddiqui — were in Islamabad as per his reports. “So, did you have to take the security along with you?” he asked rhetorically. Earlier in the day, Sindh government spokesperson MPA Sadia Javed told Geo News that she was unaware of any such move to withdraw security, adding that it might have been done due to “shortage of police”. Replying to a question on the disruption of proceedings in the Sindh Assembly, which witnessed a protest on Monday and slogans on Tuesday as well, Memon said protesting was the right of everyone in a democracy. “Opposition can protest, if they want,” he told reporters. Memon raised multiple questions, asking why the MQM-P did not protest after the May 12, 2007 mayhem , the Bolton market blaze and the Baldia factory tragedy . The Sindh senior minister stated: We are not saying them [MQM-P] not to [protest] .. it. We are democratic people. Everything that comes under democracy is allowed. “However, if they opt for undemocratic practices, the government will not sit idle,” he added, calling for the protests to be “peaceful”. “We will support them. However, if they opt for old tactics of … [forcefully] closing shops, … shooting in the city, this time our mood is different,” he said, adding that the government would prioritise the public’s safety if the MQM-P attempted to stage a strike or engage in arson or vandalism. “When this incident (Gul Plaza fire) occurred, everyone was teary-eyed … but the attitude of certain parties … the bodies were not even recovered and calls were made to roll back the 18th Amendment and hand over Karachi to the Centre,” Memon said. In the wake of the Gul Plaza inferno, which has claimed at least 73 lives , the MQM-P demanded that Karachi be made a “federal territory” by making it the country’s “financial capital”. It also assailed the 18th Amendment, which devolved certain ministries to the provinces from the Centre, and claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage” of it. In response, the PPP has assailed the MQM-P for “ politicising ” the Gul Plaza fire. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah detailed the shopping centre’s history, noting former mayors had approved leases to regularise building violations.",

      "title_orig": "Japan’s beloved last pandas leave for China as ties fray",
      "summary_orig": "Hundreds gathered to say farewell to two popular pandas departing Tokyo for China on Tuesday, leaving Japan without any of the beloved bears for the first time in 50 years as ties between the Asian neighbours fray. Panda twins Lei Lei and Xiao Xiao were transported by truck out of Ueno Zoological Gardens, their birthplace, disappointing many Japanese fans who have grown attached to the furry four-year-olds. “I’ve been coming to watch them since they were born,” Nene Hashino, a woman in her 40s wearing a panda-themed jacket and clutching a bear stuffed toy, told AFP . “It feels like my own children are going somewhere far away. It’s sad.” The pandas’ abrupt return was announced last month during a diplomatic spat that began when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi hinted that Tokyo could intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan. Her comment provoked the ire of Beijing, which regards the island as its own territory. The distinctive black-and-white animals, loaned out as part of China’s “panda diplomacy” programme , have symbolised friendship between Beijing and Tokyo since they normalised ties in 1972. Their repatriation comes a month before their loan period expires in February, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which operates Ueno Zoo. “According to the relevant agreement between China and Japan, the giant pandas who were living in Japan, Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei, today began their return trip to China,” said Guo Jiakun, China’s foreign ministry spokesman. “As always, we welcome the Japanese public to come see giant pandas in China.” Japan has reportedly been seeking the loan of a new pair of pandas. However, a weekend poll by the liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper showed that 70 per cent of those surveyed do not think the government should negotiate with China on the lease of new pandas, while 26pc would like them to. On Sunday, Ueno Zoo invited some 4,400 lucky winners of an online lottery to see the pandas for the last time. ‘Part of my heart’ Well-wishers wearing panda-themed clothes, hats and badges waited for hours on the streets lining the zoo two days later to say their final goodbyes. They called out to the animals as the windowless truck left the gates. “It’s so sad,” said Daisaku Hirota, a 37-year-old shop worker who said he tried to visit the pandas as often as he could on his days off. “I lost one part of my heart,” he said. Lei Lei and Xiao Xiao were delivered in 2021 by their mother Shin Shin , who arrived in 2011 and was returned to China in 2024 because of declining health. Since late last year, China has discouraged its nationals from travelling to Japan, citing deteriorating public security and criminal acts against Chinese nationals in the country. Beijing is reportedly also choking off exports to Japan of rare-earth products crucial for making everything from electric cars to missiles. However, China routinely removes pandas from foreign countries and the latest move may not be politically motivated, said Masaki Ienaga, a professor at Tokyo Woman’s Christian University and an expert in East Asian international relations. “If you talk about [Chinese] politics, the timing of sending pandas is what counts,” and pandas could return to Japan if bilateral ties warm, Ienaga said. Other countries use animals as tools of diplomacy, including Thailand with its elephants and Australia with its koalas, he added. “But pandas are special,” Ienaga said. “They have strong customer-drawing power, and … they can earn money.”",

      "summary_orig": "Jamaat-i-Islami chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Tuesday stressed the formation of a “city government” as the only solution to Karachi’s administrative and governance issues. The remarks come against the backdrop of the Gul Plaza inferno , which has resulted in lawmakers stressing the need to empower local governments (LGs) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) even demanding that Karachi be made a “federal territory”. “The solution to Karachi’s issues is not provincial or federal control. According to the Constitution, the solution is Karachi city government,” the JI chief said while addressing a press conference in the metropolis. Rehman made the case for better local governance by citing Istanbul as an example: “Istanbul’s local governance has its master plan, fire brigade, construction, transportation, water, sewage, education and employment under its jurisdiction.” “This is real governance, not KDA (Karachi Development Authority) or SBCA (Sindh Building Control Authority),” he said, adding that “development cannot result from this”. “This is why a city government is the only solution here — a government that is empowered and represented by an elected official,” he said, alleging that the mayorship was “stolen from JI”. In June 2023, Murtaza Wahab was elected as the first PPP mayor of Karachi, after much controversy, recriminations and protests. During his presser, the JI chief also announced a march on February 1, titled “ Jeenay dou Karachi ko ” (let Karachi live) — on Sharea Faisal, expressing optimism that “it will give young people hope”. “At the march, we will outline our plans,” he said, stressing that “we must free the city from mafia and feudal lords”. He said that the “JI stood with young people of the country — Generation Z”. The JI chief reiterated that the “people’s mandate should be respected, and the city governance plan should be implemented”. He also demanded that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah step down and take accountability for his government’s “incompetence”. Growing calls for local government Last week, the National Assembly echoed with calls for strengthening LGs as lawmakers stressed the need for reforms in the wake of the Gul Plaza fire. The deadly inferno , which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished , has claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins. Only 23 of the deceased have been identified so far . While the first information report (FIR) of the incident has said the blaze was an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”, no identified individuals have been nominated so far. The Karachi police on Monday formed a special team make “ all-out efforts ” to arrest suspects. In the NA, MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units” and for powers to be “handed over” to the mayor, town chairman, and union council chairman. Besides members of the MQM-P, PML-N’s Khawaja Asif has also favoured strengthening LGs for better city administration. Speaking on the floor of the NA last week, Asif called for providing people “representation in their own neighbourhoods”. Days later, he also lamented that LGs continued to be neglected by political parties, ultimately weakening civilian rule.",

      "summary_orig": "The long-awaited announcement of Pakistan’s 15-member squad for the Twenty20 World Cup finally came on Sunday. Among many talking points, the biggest was the exclusion of speedster Haris Rauf; despite his good showing at the Big Bash Down Under. Perhaps he’d lost the trust of chief selector Aaqib Javed. Pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi suffered an injury during the Big Bash League, having missed the previous tri-series against Sri Lanka due to fitness issues. With Haris absent, Shaheen will have to bear greater responsibility; needing to take wickets in the early overs, and the death overs — which will be particularly challenging for him as his performance in that phase has not been great. Salman Mirza has emerged as a good pacer, performing well with both the new and old ball, while Naseem Shah’s fitness and performance were satisfactory, leading to his selection. Many others were overlooked. The selectors did not choose Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jr., or Ahmed Daniyal, opting instead for fast-bowling all-rounder Faheem Ashraf. Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, Saim Ayub, and skipper Salman Ali Agha are the spin-bowling all-rounders in the team, but their increased number, as well as the presence of multiple wicket-keepers seems to disrupt the team balance. The squad includes three wicket-keepers, none of whom were the first choice for their Pakistan Super League franchises. Khawaja Nafay is with Quetta Gladiators, but the keeping is handled by Sri Lankans Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal. Usman Khan played as a batsman for Multan Sultans and occasionally kept wickets, but Mohammad Rizwan was the number one choice. Sahibzada Farhan kept wickets in just one match for Islamabad United, as Andries Gous and Azam Khan were the main wicket-keepers. In comparison, the cricketing world has wicket-keepers who are match-winners. Pakistan’s philosophy is different. Instead of a specialist, any batter who can keep wickets is given a chance without considering how costly it could prove for the team. Babar conundrum Further beyond, there are questions regarding former skipper Babar Azam’s selection, as his performance in the shortest format of the game hasn’t been very impressive of late; the batter coming off a below-par in Big Bash. There is also a striking likeness between Babar and captain Salman Ali Agha. They are similar batters, occupying number three and four spots in the line-up. They may perform well in low-scoring matches, but could face difficulties in high-scoring games. The batting lineup has five openers who are capable of batting at different numbers, including Saim, Sahibzada, Babar, Fakhar Zaman and Nafay, who have all been seen playing in the top order for their franchises. However, when it comes to the middle-order, batters like Irfan Khan Niazi and Abdul Samad have not been given opportunities. The spotlight has been on the performance of Pakistan players in the Big Bash, while overlooking their performance in the Bangladesh Premier League. Opener Sahibzada scored 185 runs in nine innings with a strike rate of 118.58, which is not particularly commendable. Similarly, Saim Ayub scored 68 runs in four innings with a strike rate of only 117.24. Fakhar Zaman, who went to play in the International League T20, performed below his standards, scoring 260 runs in 12 innings with an average of 21.66 and a strike rate of 124.40. Babar, meanwhile, played seven innings in the Big Bash, scoring 131 runs at a strike rate of 99.2. Spin strength Overall, Pakistan’s spin department looks the strongest with two specialist spinners in Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, who are world-class. However, it might be difficult to see both play together since Nawaz, Shadab and Saim are the three spin-bowling all-rounders available. With their presence, it is likely that only one of Usman or Abrar is able to secure a spot in the playing eleven. Pakistan could benefit from the conditions in Sri Lanka, with the team playing all their matches in Colombo. Their biggest test will come against holders India, with the United States, Namibia and the Netherlands the other teams in the group. On paper, Pakistan should advance from the group stage. Further ahead, it remains to be seen whether they can forge a combination that can help them go all the way.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Following back-to-back pet lion attacks in the provincial capital last week, in which two children suffered injuries, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday ordered revocation of the legal permission to keep big cats in Punjab. Separately, a magistrate sent seven people to jail on judicial remand for keeping of dangerous animals in residential areas. Last week, a pet lion attacked an eight-year-old boy in the Sabzazar area of Lahore, in which he lost one arm. According to police, Wajid Ali went close to the lion’s cage while playing when it attacked him. Seven sent to jail on judicial remand in pet lioness attack case The lion chewed off the child’s arm owing to improper enclosure arrangements and negligence by the owner. The owner also hid the incident and misled authorities, claiming the boy was injured after his arm got stuck in a machine. Due to the severity of the injuries, doctors amputated the child’s arm to save his life. In a similar incident, a pet lioness attacked an eight-year-old girl in the Bhekewal Pind area of Lahore and seriously injured her. Police said the lioness was being shifted from one place to another by its owner in an auto-rickshaw when it became disturbed, broke free and attacked and injured the girl. “Following such incidents, CM Maryam Nawaz on Monday decided to revoke the legal permission to keep pet lions across the province,” the Punjab government said in a statement. She also directed that Wajid be provided with a modern bionic arm. Police said they arrested the accused and registered an FIR against him. The government said it had seized 59 big cats from different parts of the province and arrested 10 suspects for violating the SOPs on housing the animals. Judicial remand The local judicial magistrate sent a breeder, Fayaz alias Faizi, along with six other suspects to jail on judicial remand in a case involving the keeping of dangerous animals in residential areas, following a lion attack on a minor girl. Police informed the court that the suspects had been interrogated and their further physical custody was not required. The police requested the court to send the suspects to jail on judicial remand. Magistrate Hassan Sarfraz Cheema accepted the request and remanded the suspects to judicial lock-up, directing the police to produce them again upon completion of the remand period.

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: In a revealing interview with The Sunday Times, former UK Chancellor Sajid Javid reflected on his life journey from a childhood marked by poverty, domestic violence and racism to a career as a multimillionaire, cabinet minister, and home secretary. He also discussed his family’s complex past and integration in Britain and modern immigration policy. Among the most striking revelations, British Pakistani Javid admitted that under the existing immigration rules, he “wouldn’t allow either his unskilled father or his non-English speaking mother entry today”. “The biggest block to good community cohesion is English. We should have set a requirement that if you want to settle in the UK, you should be able to speak fluent English. We should have done that ages ago,” he said. Javid’s parents arrived from Pakistan in the early 1960s. His father, arriving with just £1, worked as a bus driver, mill worker and shop owner, while his mother who was uneducated and initially unable to speak English, struggled to adapt. The Colour of Home, Javid’s new memoir, details a childhood shaped by hardship and family tension. In revealing Sunday Times interview, Sajid Javid says he ‘wouldn’t allow his unskilled father or his non-English speaking mother entry’ into UK under current rules The memoir describes his father’s violence. Javid recounts being beaten with a leather slipper, a wooden spoon and on one occasion a hammer that required a CT scan. He writes about enduring racist attacks from skinheads and school bullies, as well as the emotional toll of growing up in cramped and impoverished living conditions. “Crouching in a ball and covering his face while his father beat him,” Javid recalls, highlights the intensity of these early struggles. Family tensions extended to marriage expectations. His mother initially objected to his white Christian wife Laura refusing to meet her for two years, and had even tried to arrange a marriage with his cousin. His mother also “didn’t want two black workmen her husband employed to come for dinner” though she later learnt English and “came to deeply regret her racism towards the black workmen”. Later in life, his father apologised to Javid for his past violence. Despite these hardships, the family’s story is one of resilience. Javid fulfilled his childhood goal of buying his parents a house in Bristol, writing that one of his proudest moments was achieving “enough to give myself and my family a better life”. He told the interviewer that a “Reform voter… might think this is exactly the kind of family that we want in the UK because they went on a journey and look where they’ve ended”. In politics, Javid was known for his positions on immigration. He supported a post-Brexit points-based system but argued that the UK “lets in too many immigrants” and stressed that language skills are essential for community cohesion.

      "summary_orig": "DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates will not allow attacks on Iran to be launched from its territory, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday. Last week, President Donald Trump said a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely after a crackdown on protesters. The foreign ministry said in a statement it “has reaffirmed the United Arab Emirates’ commitment to not allowing its airspace, territory or waters to be used in any hostile military actions against Iran”. The UAE hosts thousands of US personnel at Al Dhafra airbase near the capital Abu Dhabi, one of several American military bases in the Gulf. US aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln arrives in Middle East; Hezbollah chief warns any war against Iran will ignite the region The UAE also refuses to provide logistical support for attacks, the statement said, adding that “dialogue, de-escalation, adherence to international law, and respect for state sovereignty” were the best way to address “current crises” US aircraft carrier arrives in Middle East The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has arrived in the Middle East, the US military said on Monday, dramatically boosting American firepower in the region at a time of heightened tensions with Iran. The Lincoln and accompanying ships are “currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability”, US Central Command said in a post on X. Hezbollah chief’s warning Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem warned on Monday that any war against the group’s backer Tehran this time will ignite the region as it will also target the group. “Faced with aggression that does not distinguish between us… we are targeted by any potential aggression and determined to defend ourselves,” he said in a televised address to supporters at a solidarity rally for Iran. “We will choose at that time how to act… but we are not neutral,” he said, warning that “a war on Iran this time will ignite the region”. Rubio’s warning to Iraq US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iraq on Sunday against a pro-Iranian government as the expected return of Nouri al-Maliki as prime minister stirs Washington’s concern. Maliki, who left power in 2014 following heated pressure from the United States, has been chosen by Iraq’s largest Shia bloc, which would put him in line to be nominated prime minister. Rubio, in a telephone call with incumbent Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, voiced hope the next government will work to make Iraq “a force for stability, prosperity and security in the Middle East”. “The secretary emphasised that a government controlled by Iran cannot successfully put Iraq’s own interests first, keep Iraq out of regional conflicts or advance the mutually beneficial partnership between the United States and Iraq,” Rubio said, according to State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott. An Iraqi political source said the US had conveyed that it “holds a negative view of previous governments led by former prime minister Maliki”. In a letter, US representatives said that while the selection of the prime minister is an Iraqi decision, “the United States will make its own sovereign decisions regarding the next government in line with American interests”. The US wields key leverage over Iraq as the country’s oil export revenue is largely held at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, in an arrangement reached after the 2003 US invasion toppled military dictator Saddam Hussein. Iraq’s parliament meets Tuesday to elect a new president, who holds a ceremonial role but will appoint a prime minister. A US-based rights group claimed on Monday it had “confirmed” reports of deaths of 5,848 people in a wave of protests in Iran suppressed by security forces. Published in Dawn, January 27th, 2026",

Hezbollah chief’s warning Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem warned on Monday that any war against the group’s backer Tehran this time will ignite the region as it will also target the group. “Faced with aggression that does not distinguish between us… we are targeted by any potential aggression and determined to defend ourselves,” he said in a televised address to supporters at a solidarity rally for Iran. “We will choose at that time how to act… but we are not neutral,” he said, warning that “a war on Iran this time will ignite the region”. Rubio’s warning to Iraq US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iraq on Sunday against a pro-Iranian government as the expected return of Nouri al-Maliki as prime minister stirs Washington’s concern. Maliki, who left power in 2014 following heated pressure from the United States, has been chosen by Iraq’s largest Shia bloc, which would put him in line to be nominated prime minister. Rubio, in a telephone call with incumbent Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, voiced hope the next government will work to make Iraq “a force for stability, prosperity and security in the Middle East”. “The secretary emphasised that a government controlled by Iran cannot successfully put Iraq’s own interests first, keep Iraq out of regional conflicts or advance the mutually beneficial partnership between the United States and Iraq,” Rubio said, according to State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott. An Iraqi political source said the US had conveyed that it “holds a negative view of previous governments led by former prime minister Maliki”. In a letter, US representatives said that while the selection of the prime minister is an Iraqi decision, “the United States will make its own sovereign decisions regarding the next government in line with American interests”. The US wields key leverage over Iraq as the country’s oil export revenue is largely held at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, in an arrangement reached after the 2003 US invasion toppled military dictator Saddam Hussein. Iraq’s parliament meets Tuesday to elect a new president, who holds a ceremonial role but will appoint a prime minister. A US-based rights group claimed on Monday it had “confirmed” reports of deaths of 5,848 people in a wave of protests in Iran suppressed by security forces. Published in Dawn, January 27th, 2026",

      "summary": "DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates will not allow attacks on Iran to be launched from its territory, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday. Last week, President Donald Trump said a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely after a crackdown on protesters. The foreign ministry said in a statement it “has reaffirmed the United Arab Emirates’ commitment to not allowing its airspace, territory or waters to be used in any hostile military actions against Iran”. The UAE hosts thousands of US personnel at Al Dhafra airbase near the capital Abu Dhabi, one of several American military bases in the Gulf.

      "summary_orig": "• State, cities of Minneapolis and St Paul ask court to pause operation • Federal judge hears arguments whether the deployment of federal officers violates state’s sovereignty • White House dismisses concerns as Congress Democrats threaten to hold up funding unless ICE reformed MINNEAPOLIS: In a bid to regain control over an escalating crisis sparked by the second killing of a protester against his administration’s militarised immigration raids, US President Donald Trump dispatched his top border official to Minnesota on Monday. Trump said that Tom Homan, his point man for border security, would arrive in the state later and “will report directly to me”. As Minneapolis has become ground zero in the clash between Trump and growing numbers of Americans over his nationwide immigration crackdown, Trump’s deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, described the city on Fox News as a ‘powder keg’. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been transformed under Trump into the United States’ most heavily funded law enforcement body. But polls show growing anger over its frequently brutal tactics. A huge rally took place despite bitter cold in Minneapolis on Friday to protest the raids and the point blank shooting by an ICE agent of protester Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three on Jan 7. Then on Saturday, immigration agents gunned down Alex Jeffrey Pretti, also 37, after having already tackled him to the ground. Like Good, the intensive care unit nurse was a US citizen. More rallies erupted after his death in Minneapolis, New York and other major cities across the United States. Minnesota’s sovereignty On Monday, a federal judge in Minnea­polis was hearing arguments on whether the deployment of federal officers — often masked, heavily armed and unidentified — violates the state of Minnesota’s sovereignty. The judge would consider a request to temporarily stop Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota, following the fatal shooting of a second US citizen over the weekend that sparked a fierce backlash. The state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are asking the court to pause the 3,000-agent operation, calling it a “completely disproportionate” violation of state sovereignty. The Trump administration, in a court filing, called the request an “absurdity” that would make federal law an afterthought. In Congress, Democrats are threatening to hold up funding for the US government unless immigration enforcement agencies are reformed. Trump has so far dismissed concerns. The 79-year-old Republican’s first reaction to Pretti’s killing was to suggest that the nurse had come intending to shoot at the police. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison then accused Trump of pushing a “flat-out insane” narrative. In Monday’s court action, the judge was hearing arguments from state and city lawyers that the federal deployments amount to an occupying force. Also under consideration was a bid to force federal officials to preserve evidence related to Pretti’s killing. The lawsuits highlight the deep rift between local and federal law enforcement over the deployment, dubbed “Operation Metro Surge”. Trump’s immigration raids have focused deliberately on Democratic-run cities, pitting mayors and governors against the president. Local police have repeatedly confronted federal agents and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has even suggested he could call out the state’s National Guard to push back against Trump’s forces. Trump will also be watching signs of growing disenchantment from his Republican Party in Congress. The party is usually in lockstep with Trump but it has only a slender majority. One of the most prominent cautions came from House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer, who signalled on Sunday that federal agents should withdraw from Minneapolis — an intervention that would normally be unheard of from a figure considered one of Trump’s staunchest loyalists. Sixty of the state’s largest businesses, including Target, 3M, UnitedHealth and US Bancorp, have called for an immediate de-escalation of tensions between the state and the Trump administration. Trump claimed that the immigration agents would leave Minneapolis “at some point”. Published in Dawn, January 27th, 2026",

TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Monday said that the call for a countrywide protest on Feb 8 — the second anniversary of the 2024 general polls —would not be withdrawn under any circumstances. He urged the masses to shut down everything on that day, which falls on a Sunday. Suggesting that the alliance might announce a Jail Bharo Tehreek, he said it would be just the beginning and that more moves would follow. Mr Achakzai was chairing a meeting of the TTAP, attended by alliance’s vice chief Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, former Sindh governor Zubair Umar, Asad Qaiser, Dr Ammar Ali Jan, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Yousufzai and Advocate Khalid Chaudhry. The participants decided that Feb 8 would be observed as a Black Day and that a nationwide strike would be ensured. Ten committees formed They said 10 committees had been formed at international, national and provincial levels to ensure the success of the strike. They termed Feb 8 a day of humiliation for the entire nation, saying people had been deprived of their basic right to elect representatives and rendered powerless. The meeting also expressed concern over the sentences awarded to rights activist, Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, terming them a violation of constitutional rights to freedom of expression and a fair trial. The participants warned of a looming humanitarian crisis in Khyber Agency’s Tirah valley, saying millions could be forced to migrate in harsh weather. They said any deviation from resolutions passed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and decisions of the national jirga would be against provincial autonomy. They further criticised the government’s decision to join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking parliament and the public into confidence, questioning Pakistan’s participation when Palestinians were excluded from the forum. Later, a TTAP delegation led by Mr Achakzai visited the residence of former PTI leader Dr Shireen Mazari to express solidarity with her over the arrest and conviction of her daughter and son-in-law, Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha. JUI-F rally Meanwhile, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has announced that his party would stage a rally in Rawalpindi on Feb 8 to protest against the alleged rigging in the last general elections. According to JUI-F Rawalpindi district spokesperson Hafiz Ziaullah, the party chief will address the public gathering. The party spokesperson said the Feb 8 elections were “tantamount to the killing of the public mandate” and an “insult” to the nation’s vote, and “would not be accepted under any circumstances”. He said the government formed as a result of the 2024 polls would be “rejected through public power”, and the struggle would continue to protect the original principles of democracy. According to the spokesperson, preparations for the rally have been formally started, and instructions have been issued to all tehsils, workers and officials of the Rawalpindi district to ensure full participation. “A large number of people, workers and people belonging to different schools of thought will participate in the rally,” he said. The JUI-F Rawalpindi chapter initially appealed to the public to reach Dera Taji Khokhar on Feb 8 to raise their voices against the “fake” elections and the “illegitimate” government, and to stand with the JUI-F for the restoration of democracy. The spokesperson said under the initial plan, the public gathering would be held at Dera Taji Khokhar near the old airport, but the venue was likely to change. Responding to a question about seeking permission from the district administration, he said a meeting of the JUI-F general council would be held on Jan 31, after which the venue would be decided and an application submitted to the district administration by Feb 1. Hafiz Ziaullah said preparations had already begun and all office-bearers had been informed about the decision to launch a protest against the “rigged” 2024 general elections. He added that tehsil chapters had been asked to form committees for public mobilisation, and the general council would task these committees with bringing the maximum number of people to the meeting. Meanwhile, the district administration has imposed Section 144 in the district since December and extending it on a weekly basis. Under Section 144, public gatherings are not permitted. The current one has been imposed from Jan 23 till Feb 6. A senior district administration official told Dawn that if an application was received from any party, it would be forwarded to the Punjab government after a report from the District Intelligence Committee.

According to JUI-F Rawalpindi district spokesperson Hafiz Ziaullah, the party chief will address the public gathering. The party spokesperson said the Feb 8 elections were “tantamount to the killing of the public mandate” and an “insult” to the nation’s vote, and “would not be accepted under any circumstances”. He said the government formed as a result of the 2024 polls would be “rejected through public power”, and the struggle would continue to protect the original principles of democracy. According to the spokesperson, preparations for the rally have been formally started, and instructions have been issued to all tehsils, workers and officials of the Rawalpindi district to ensure full participation. “A large number of people, workers and people belonging to different schools of thought will participate in the rally,” he said. The JUI-F Rawalpindi chapter initially appealed to the public to reach Dera Taji Khokhar on Feb 8 to raise their voices against the “fake” elections and the “illegitimate” government, and to stand with the JUI-F for the restoration of democracy. The spokesperson said under the initial plan, the public gathering would be held at Dera Taji Khokhar near the old airport, but the venue was likely to change. Responding to a question about seeking permission from the district administration, he said a meeting of the JUI-F general council would be held on Jan 31, after which the venue would be decided and an application submitted to the district administration by Feb 1. Hafiz Ziaullah said preparations had already begun and all office-bearers had been informed about the decision to launch a protest against the “rigged” 2024 general elections. He added that tehsil chapters had been asked to form committees for public mobilisation, and the general council would task these committees with bringing the maximum number of people to the meeting. Meanwhile, the district administration has imposed Section 144 in the district since December and extending it on a weekly basis. Under Section 144, public gatherings are not permitted. The current one has been imposed from Jan 23 till Feb 6. A senior district administration official told Dawn that if an application was received from any party, it would be forwarded to the Punjab government after a report from the District Intelligence Committee.

      "summary": "This image has been floating around for a bit (and posted a few times on the main post of the incident), but this is the plane that crashed at Bangor Airport. Most sources say eight people were on board, but it is unconfirmed -- as of writing -- if there are any survivors. Some are saying there are none, while others say two people survived.
