      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on any country doing business with Iran, ramping up pressure as a crackdown on protests continues. Trump, who has repeatedly threatened Iran with military intervention, said in a social media post on Monday that the new levies would “immediately” hit the Islamic republic’s trading partners who also do business with the United States. “This Order is final and conclusive,” he wrote, without specifying who they will affect. Iran’s main trading partners are China, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, according to economic database Trading Economics. Trump has been mulling his options on Iran, which has been roiled by more than two weeks of demonstrations that have defied a near-total internet blackout and lethal force. Sparked by economic grievances, the nationwide protests have grown into one of the biggest challenges yet to the theocratic system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution ousted the shah. Iranian authorities have blamed foreign interference for stoking the unrest and staged their own nationwide counter-rallies. Rights groups warned that the severed communications were aimed at masking a rising death toll. The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said the internet shutdown has made it “extremely difficult to independently verify reports” of casualties. “The international community has a duty to protect civilian protesters against mass killing by the Islamic republic,” said IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam. The White House said Monday that Trump remained “unafraid” to deploy military force against Iran, but was pursuing diplomacy as a first resort. ‘Four-front war’ Iran on Monday sought to regain control of the streets with mass nationwide rallies that supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed as proof that the protest movement was defeated. In power since 1989 and now 86, Khamenei said the pro-government turnout was a “warning” to the United States. “These massive rallies, full of determination, have thwarted the plan of foreign enemies that were supposed to be carried out by domestic mercenaries,” he said, according to state TV, referring to pro-government demonstrations. In the capital Tehran, state TV showed people brandishing the national flag and prayers read for victims of what the government has termed “riots”. At Enghelab (Revolution) Square, parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told the crowd that Iran was fighting a “four-front war” listing economic war, psychological war, “military war” with the United States and Israel, and “today a war against terrorists” - a reference to the protests. Flanked by the slogans “Death to Israel, Death to America” in Persian, he vowed the Iranian military would teach Trump “an unforgettable lesson” if attacked. But Trump said Sunday that Iran’s leadership had called him seeking “to negotiate”. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran that Iran was “not seeking war but is fully prepared for war”, while calling for “fair” negotiations. Foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said a channel of communication was open between Araghchi and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff despite the lack of diplomatic relations. Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah who has been vocal in calling for protests, told CBS news the government was “trying to trick the world into thinking that (it) is ready to negotiate once again”. He said Trump was “a man that means what he says and says what he means” and who “knows what’s at stake”. “The red line that was drawn has been definitely surpassed by this regime.” ‘Respect for their rights’ State outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning in Tehran, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic. Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”. Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies. The government has declared three days of national mourning for those killed. The European Union has voiced support for the protesters and on Monday said it was “looking into” imposing additional sanctions on Iran over the repression of demonstrations. The European Parliament also announced it had banned all Iranian diplomats and representatives from the assembly’s premises. French President Emmanuel Macron issued a statement condemning “the state violence that indiscriminately targets Iranian women and men who courageously demand respect for their rights”. Tehran ally Russia, for its part, slammed what it called attempts by “foreign powers” to interfere in Iran, state media reported, in Moscow’s first reaction to the protests.",

Jeremy Corbyn recently unfurled the flag with a separate party to challenge the British establishment, which includes his former Labour Party colleagues who he watched with dismay removing the last stitch of morality by abetting Benjamin Netanyahu’s genocide in Gaza. French left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon is leading a mass upsurge against Emmanuel Macron and the EU, accusing European leaders of “prostrate servility” to Trump. Mélenchon homed in on President Emmanuel Macron’s ideas on sending troops and long-range weapons to Ukraine.

A white woman activist raging against MAGA’s nativism was murdered by Trump’s hired guns from ICE. The killing in Minneapolis has set off a prairie fire across states. In the absence of vocal criticism of Trump from the Congress, the left, increasingly joined by Jewish students and senior scholars, is intervening strategically to ensure that Trump gets his comeuppance in the November mid-term polls and thereby can be reined in from doing further damage. Regardless of the outcome the left won’t be accused of sitting on its hands when America was dismembering democracy. Brazil and Colombia have slammed Trump’s abduction of a fellow Latin American president from his home in Caracas. Trump’s toolkit for Iran is different. A colour revolution is being quelled, says Pepe Escobar, a well-regarded Brazilian observer of the Middle East. Regardless of the images posted in Western media, Escobar says the Iranian leadership is braced for another round of war with US and Israel, only this time better prepared. It is a testament to the feckless ways of the left that a group like Mujahideen-i-Khalq, which was instrumental in deposing the Shah of Iran, has become a catspaw for Israeli and US intrusion in its own country. Veteran Iran watchers are sanguine that without the organisational skills and a well-oiled machinery of the deeply camouflaged Mujahideen-i-Khalq, Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince would have no standing with the rioters. The Gulf has also been jolted by the events in Venezuela. “We are entering an era where international guarantees are fragile, institutions are weakened and power speaks louder than principle.

South Asia is inevitably deeply affected by the turn of events unfolding at breakneck speed in the Middle East and in Latin America. Pakistan, currently in the good books of Trump (for no palpable reason), has spoken out boldly on the heist in Venezuela, with its defence minister reportedly calling for the abduction of Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu by the US (instead of Nicolás Maduro who should be freed). Bangladesh has witnessed street protests for Nicolás Maduro. However, India, once a champion of lost causes in the Global South has been slow poisoned into becoming a basket case by its leaders seeking anchor in the West. When George W.

Pulverised as a stag caught in the headlights of an approaching truck, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has left his foreign policy to the tender care of hope and prayer. What excites him, however, is any lurking campaign to win another state election, or even a municipal poll, preferably by communally polarising voters. Modi’s calendar this year perhaps captures the essence of his preferences and fears. To cheer him, assembly polls are due in opposition-ruled West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in May. On the other hand, he is to host the BRICS summit around August, which comes with the terror of having to take an unequivocal stand on Trump’s thuggery and India’s one-sided love with the US.

      "title": "With the sleeves rolled up",
      "summary": "THE world is in ferment as the US lurches dangerously to the extreme right. Europe too has discarded a long cultivated democratic pretence and is eyeing its chance in the melee. Hungary, Poland, Austria and Italy have been singled out by Donald Trump’s strategists, according to their leaked documents, to subvert democracy for a right-wing takeover in Trump’s footsteps. British, French and German establishments are nudging their countries also towards militarism. EU is targeting Russia , Palestine and Iran even as Nato looks poised to implode in the chaos of Trump’s claims over Greenland . The EU seeks to humour Trump over Venezuela while retaining a different yardstick to judge Vladimir Putin’s advances in Ukraine . But the masses are retaliating. Venezuela and Mexico are staging massive rallies with sleeves rolled up to combat Trump’s threat to them. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, sensing enough was enough of his neighbour, is mending his country’s ties with China. He could be visiting Beijing shortly to counter the ultimatums to Canada’s economy. Ideally, this is the time for the left to be initiating and, where possible, spearheading mass movements against the rightward slide. Jeremy Corbyn recently unfurled the flag with a separate party to challenge the British establishment, which includes his former Labour Party colleagues who he watched with dismay removing the last stitch of morality by abetting Benjamin Netanyahu’s genocide in Gaza. French left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon is leading a mass upsurge against Emmanuel Macron and the EU, accusing European leaders of “prostrate servility” to Trump. Mélenchon homed in on President Emmanuel Macron’s ideas on sending troops and long-range weapons to Ukraine. He demanded referendums in Donbass, Crimea and all contested regions because “it’s the people who decide” rather than warmongering elites who “don’t give a damn about people’s lives”. This is the time for the left to be initiating and, where possible, spearheading mass movements against the rightward slide. The left in the US is punching above its weight to hold its ground, using every chink in Trump’s armour to put up a promising fight for democracy. In the absence of trustworthy support from the mainstream media, YouTube channels are abuzz with analysts and activists keeping Trump in their crosshairs. A white woman activist raging against MAGA’s nativism was murdered by Trump’s hired guns from ICE. The killing in Minneapolis has set off a prairie fire across states. In the absence of vocal criticism of Trump from the Congress, the left, increasingly joined by Jewish students and senior scholars, is intervening strategically to ensure that Trump gets his comeuppance in the November mid-term polls and thereby can be reined in from doing further damage. Regardless of the outcome the left won’t be accused of sitting on its hands when America was dismembering democracy. Brazil and Colombia have slammed Trump’s abduction of a fellow Latin American president from his home in Caracas. Trump’s toolkit for Iran is different. A colour revolution is being quelled, says Pepe Escobar, a well-regarded Brazilian observer of the Middle East. Regardless of the images posted in Western media, Escobar says the Iranian leadership is braced for another round of war with US and Israel, only this time better prepared. It is a testament to the feckless ways of the left that a group like Mujahideen-i-Khalq, which was instrumental in deposing the Shah of Iran, has become a catspaw for Israeli and US intrusion in its own country. Veteran Iran watchers are sanguine that without the organisational skills and a well-oiled machinery of the deeply camouflaged Mujahideen-i-Khalq, Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince would have no standing with the rioters. The Gulf has also been jolted by the events in Venezuela. “We are entering an era where international guarantees are fragile, institutions are weakened and power speaks louder than principle. Awareness today is not a luxury; it is a requirement for survival,” cautioned Saudi Arabia’s Arab News . It stressed that the seizure of Russian funds in Western banks was a betrayal of crucial trust that the world took for granted. “The lesson is clear. The time to act is now.” Interestingly, the writer in the Saudi paper is prominent UAE businessman Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor. It says something for the thread that still unifies the two countries despite their recent aloofness. South Asia is inevitably deeply affected by the turn of events unfolding at breakneck speed in the Middle East and in Latin America. Pakistan, currently in the good books of Trump (for no palpable reason), has spoken out boldly on the heist in Venezuela, with its defence minister reportedly calling for the abduction of Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu by the US (instead of Nicolás Maduro who should be freed). Bangladesh has witnessed street protests for Nicolás Maduro. However, India, once a champion of lost causes in the Global South has been slow poisoned into becoming a basket case by its leaders seeking anchor in the West. When George W. Bush was in bad odour right across the world, a PEW survey said India was the rare country where Bush was popular. What does that say about the current leadership? Pulverised as a stag caught in the headlights of an approaching truck, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has left his foreign policy to the tender care of hope and prayer. What excites him, however, is any lurking campaign to win another state election, or even a municipal poll, preferably by communally polarising voters. Modi’s calendar this year perhaps captures the essence of his preferences and fears. To cheer him, assembly polls are due in opposition-ruled West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in May. On the other hand, he is to host the BRICS summit around August, which comes with the terror of having to take an unequivocal stand on Trump’s thuggery and India’s one-sided love with the US. In the meantime, China, Russia and Iran began a week of joint naval exercises in South Africa’s waters on Saturday.

He added, “We have also received an 18-member family of Pakistani pilgrims at the immigration office.” According to them, he said, more pilgrims were on their way to Gabad.

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Despite the passage of about three months, law enforcement agencies (LEAs) remain in the dark about the whereabouts of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Hussain Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi. The issue resurfaced a couple of days ago, after an alleged statement attributed to the proscribed religious outfit surfaced, claiming that both were “in the custody of agencies”. However, senior law enforcement officials are sticking to their earlier stance, maintaining that the two are hiding somewhere in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). They said the Rizvi brothers had fled on the day the Punjab police launched a pre-dawn operation in Muridke to dismantle the TLP protest camp along G.T. Road. “I give you my word that they are not in the custody of any security agency and are still in AJK. They are most likely sheltered by a loyal worker of the banned organisation somewhere in the hilly areas,” said a senior officer. Talking to Dawn , he rejected the alleged TLP statement, terming it a “false, funny and self-generated claim”. A source said a senior Punjab official was tasked with contacting federal authorities to verify the claim after the statement went viral on social media. He said the provincial official conveyed to a senior official in Islamabad the Punjab police intent to arrest the “fleeing Rizvis” in multiple cases if they were in custody of any security agency, but the federal authorities told him the absconding TLP chief and his brother were not in the custody of any agency. The source said the two brothers had assumed the status of “high-profile wanted criminals” in cases registered against them under serious and heinous offences, including anti-terrorism charges. “So far, 44 FIRs have been registered against Saad and Anas in Sheikhupura and 11 in Lahore, in which they are nominated,” he said, adding that the charges were of a grave nature. Asked why the LEAs had failed to trace them, the official said the absconding TLP leaders were not using phones or other devices, making it difficult to track their location or hideouts. “We have activated all systems across the country, and it has been confirmed by relevant state institutions that the TLP chief and his brother are still in Pakistan,” he said, ruling out the possibility of their fleeing abroad. He added that the Punjab police were actively pursuing the fugitives and had constituted several teams. About the charges, the official said both had allegedly instigated TLP workers and hardcore activists to carry out attacks on law enforcement officials, besides damaging government vehicles and property. An SHO lost his life, while dozens of others sustained injuries during repea­ted attacks by TLP workers in Lahore and Sheikhupura. He said the TLP chief and his brother had led the “Gaza March”, launched from Lahore, where the party’s headquarters are located, in October last year, with the stated aim of marching towards Islamabad. Meanwhile, the FIA also moved swiftly, traced around 95 bank accounts allegedly operated by Saad Rizvi, and initiated investigations under money laundering charges, the official said. Dawn tried to contact the spokesperson/representative of the banned TLP to verify the recent statement claiming that Saad and Anas were in the custody of state agencies. However, the representative neither answered the call nor responded to WhatsApp messages. Published in Dawn, January 13th, 2026",

An SHO lost his life, while dozens of others sustained injuries during repea­ted attacks by TLP workers in Lahore and Sheikhupura.

      "summary": "LAHORE: Despite the passage of about three months, law enforcement agencies (LEAs) remain in the dark about the whereabouts of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Hussain Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi. The issue resurfaced a couple of days ago, after an alleged statement attributed to the proscribed religious outfit surfaced, claiming that both were “in the custody of agencies”. However, senior law enforcement officials are sticking to their earlier stance, maintaining that the two are hiding somewhere in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). They said the Rizvi brothers had fled on the day the Punjab police launched a pre-dawn operation in Muridke to dismantle the TLP protest camp along G.T. Road. “I give you my word that they are not in the custody of any security agency and are still in AJK. They are most likely sheltered by a loyal worker of the banned organisation somewhere in the hilly areas,” said a senior officer. Talking to Dawn , he rejected the alleged TLP statement, terming it a “false, funny and self-generated claim”. A source said a senior Punjab official was tasked with contacting federal authorities to verify the claim after the statement went viral on social media. He said the provincial official conveyed to a senior official in Islamabad the Punjab police intent to arrest the “fleeing Rizvis” in multiple cases if they were in custody of any security agency, but the federal authorities told him the absconding TLP chief and his brother were not in the custody of any agency. The source said the two brothers had assumed the status of “high-profile wanted criminals” in cases registered against them under serious and heinous offences, including anti-terrorism charges. “So far, 44 FIRs have been registered against Saad and Anas in Sheikhupura and 11 in Lahore, in which they are nominated,” he said, adding that the charges were of a grave nature. Asked why the LEAs had failed to trace them, the official said the absconding TLP leaders were not using phones or other devices, making it difficult to track their location or hideouts. “We have activated all systems across the country, and it has been confirmed by relevant state institutions that the TLP chief and his brother are still in Pakistan,” he said, ruling out the possibility of their fleeing abroad.

Police said the passer-by who was critically injured in the blast later succumbed to his injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The identity of the civilian victim could not be immediately ascertained. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought a report from senior officials regarding the attack on Tank police.

He said that Lakki Marwat police were responding vigorously to every challenge and were ready to render any sacrifice for the protection of the public. The DPO asserted that police were resolutely tackling Fitna al Khawarij and added that security had been further increased in the area. Two terrorists killed in Lakki Two terrorists were killed in a clash with security forces and police in the Kaichi Kamar area of Lakki Marwat district on Monday. A police official confirmed the development and said that the security forces and police jointly launched an intelligence-based operation after receiving information about the presence of Fitna al Khawarij in the trans-river belt. Fitna al Khawarij is the term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the operation, an intense exchange of fire took place, resulting in the neutralisation of two terrorists”, the official maintained. The slain terrorists were identified as Sheryar alias Sheri and Irfan alias Paan. Police said they were wanted by law enforcement agencies in several terrorism-related cases, including attacks on law enforcement personnel, targeted killings, and IED blasts. Two killed in Bannu IBO In Bannu, the Counter-Terrorism Department, in coordination with local police, carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO), which left two militants dead.

      "title_orig": "Iran condemns ‘interventionist statements’ by Trump, other US officials about its internal affairs",
      "summary_orig": "Iran, which has accused the US and Israel of fomenting the ongoing unrest in the Middle Eastern country, said on Monday it strongly condemned “interventionist statements” by US President Donald Trump and other officials regarding its internal affairs. Trump has warned Tehran of strikes over the crackdown on the protests and also said on Sunday that he was weighing a range of strong responses, including military options, to action against protesters . Iran’s latest condemnation of his statements came in a press release titled “Fact Sheet on Recent Protests in Iran”, which was shared by the Iranian embassy in Islamabad on the social media platform X. In the statement, Tehran expressed “deep concern regarding overt and increasing foreign interference in the country’s internal affairs and recent protests”. “The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns the interventionist statements made by the president of the United States of America and other American officials,” it said. “Such coercive and unlawful positions constitute a flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of UN Charter and international law, particularly the principle of sovereignty and non-intervention, and effectively amount to encouragement of violence and terrorism against Iranian citizens. These reckless statements are not unprecedented.“ It was recalled that days earlier, the US president had “publicly threatened the Islamic Republic of Iran with the use of force, including the prospect of renewed military attacks against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities and its defensive capabilities“. The press release also mentioned economic pressures on Iran, resulting from universal coercive measures. “The extensive imposition of unilateral coercive measures had a direct and adverse impact on the Iranian people’s livelihood and economic situation, severely restricting the country’s financial resources, disrupting trade and investment, impeding access to essential goods and services, and consequently intensifying economic pressure on ordinary citizens,” it said. In a reference to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the statement said: “The prime minister of the Zionist regime has made blatantly interventionist statements regarding Iran’s internal developments and has portrayed himself as sympathetic to the Iranian people. “Such claims are profoundly deceptive, particularly considering the aggressive actions of this regime against Iran, which have resulted in the killing of more than 1,100 Iranian citizens.“ It further stated: “Decades of criminal actions by the Zionist regime against the Iranian people cannot be concealed by rhetorical manoeuvres and or hypocritical behaviour. It is evident that the Zionist seeks to exploit every opportunity to sow division within Iranian society and undermine national cohesion. “Statements by him and certain hardline American officials amount to incitement to violence, terrorism and criminal acts,” it added. The statement also recalled that on December 28, 2025, following an increase in foreign exchange rates, sector-based protest gatherings were formed by some traders in the Tehran Bazaar, motivated by economic concerns. The escalating protests in Iran, which began in December last year in response to soaring prices, now pose one of the biggest challenges to the government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “The Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirm its commitment to its obligation under international human rights law regarding respecting and protecting the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly guaranteed under the Constitution. “Government recognised the lawful demands of peaceful protesters and started utilising all available capacities to address the demands,” the statement added. However, it continued, a distinction should be made between peaceful protests and riots or violent acts. “Just as Iran considers itself fully committed to supporting and protecting the right of its citizens to peaceful and lawful protest, it is equally obliged to prevent threats to public security. “Accordingly, it must adopt necessary legal and preventive measures to confront any form of violence that endangers the lives, property, or psychological well-being” of its citizens and society. Within this framework, the rights of millions of peace-seeking Iranians will not be compromised due to the actions of a very limited number of violent individuals,” it said. It further stated that no international official, mechanism, or human rights body “expect law-enforcement forces to remain indifferent to armed or violent acts occurring simultaneously with or alongside peaceful assemblies, or to allow perpetrators of violence free rein to impose damage, harm, or costs on society and peaceful protesters”. “Nevertheless, a significant portion of the peaceful and fully lawful protests by some bazaar merchants and members of the public, held in protest of the country’s economic conditions, were exploited — due to foreign interference — by a very small group, and in some cases escalated into violent and even armed clashes with law enforcement forces at protest sites. “These acts bore no connection to the legitimate demands of the protesters nor endorsed by most of the population.” At the same time, the statement said, Iranian authorities observed instances of violent unrest perpetrated by a limited number of individuals, including attacks on police stations, the use of incendiary devices such as Molotov cocktails against law enforcement officers and, in some cases, the use of firearms. “Such actions constitute serious crimes involving violence against people and destruction of public property and fall outside the protective scope of peaceful assemblies under international human rights law. “It is evident that such violent acts, including the use of weapons and various types of hand-made explosive devices by terrorist groups, not only harm public security and endanger the lives and property of citizens, but also undermine the peaceful nature of protests and give rise to public concern as explicitly underscored in the remarks of the supreme leader on January 3, 2026.” The statement further added: “Despite the occurrence of violence by some individuals, law enforcement forces have acted with restraint and in accordance with applicable laws, exercising utmost care to restore public order and security while minimising harm and observing human rights principles, including necessity and proportionality.“ Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar discussed “current developments in Iran” with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi during a phone call, the Foreign Office (FO) said. “[The] DPM/FM reaffirmed the importance of sustained dialogue and engagement. Both sides agreed to continue to maintain close contact,” the FO said. Trump weighing tough options Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, Trump said the US may meet Iranian officials and was in contact with the opposition, as he weighed a range of strong responses, including military options, to the protests . He said Iran called to negotiate its nuclear programme, which Israel and the US bombed in a 12-day war in June. “The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.” However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“. Trump was to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a US official told Reuters on Sunday. The Wall Street Journal has reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources. “The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options,” Trump told reporters. Trump also said that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran, where authorities have blacked out services for four days. “He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran. Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday. ‘Not seeking war but fully prepared’ Following Trump’s statement, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on Monday that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“. “We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he said. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf earlier warned Washington against “a miscalculation.” “Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards. Near paralysis In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis. The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse. There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown. One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy. The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States. State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel. Iran has not given an official casualty toll for the protests. After three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday. Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”. The Iranian government on Sunday declared three days of national mourning for “martyrs” including members of the security forces killed. President Masoud Pezeshkian also urged Iranians to join a “national resistance march” Monday to denounce the violence. Son of ousted Iran shah urges security forces to ‘stand with the people’ The US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement in the Islamic Republic. “Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Reza Pahlavi posted on social media. Pahlavi, who has emerged as an opposition figurehead, also called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag. “The time has come for them to be adorned with Iran’s national flag, in place of the disgraceful banner of the Islamic Republic,” he said. In London, protesters managed to swap out the Iranian embassy flag over the weekend, hoisting in its place the tri-coloured banner used under the last Shah. The ceremonial, pre-revolution flag has become an emblem of the global rallies that have mushroomed in support of Iran’s demonstrations. The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the flag swapping, according to the official IRNA outlet.",

      "summary_en": "Iran, which has accused the US and Israel of fomenting the ongoing unrest in the Middle Eastern country, said on Monday it strongly condemned “interventionist statements” by US President Donald Trump and other officials regarding its internal affairs. Trump has warned Tehran of strikes over the crackdown on the protests and also said on Sunday that he was weighing a range of strong responses, including military options, to action against protesters . Iran’s latest condemnation of his statements came in a press release titled “Fact Sheet on Recent Protests in Iran”, which was shared by the Iranian embassy in Islamabad on the social media platform X. In the statement, Tehran expressed “deep concern regarding overt and increasing foreign interference in the country’s internal affairs and recent protests”. “The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns the interventionist statements made by the president of the United States of America and other American officials,” it said. “Such coercive and unlawful positions constitute a flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of UN Charter and international law, particularly the principle of sovereignty and non-intervention, and effectively amount to encouragement of violence and terrorism against Iranian citizens. These reckless statements are not unprecedented.“ It was recalled that days earlier, the US president had “publicly threatened the Islamic Republic of Iran with the use of force, including the prospect of renewed military attacks against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities and its defensive capabilities“. The press release also mentioned economic pressures on Iran, resulting from universal coercive measures. “The extensive imposition of unilateral coercive measures had a direct and adverse impact on the Iranian people’s livelihood and economic situation, severely restricting the country’s financial resources, disrupting trade and investment, impeding access to essential goods and services, and consequently intensifying economic pressure on ordinary citizens,” it said. In a reference to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the statement said: “The prime minister of the Zionist regime has made blatantly interventionist statements regarding Iran’s internal developments and has portrayed himself as sympathetic to the Iranian people. “Such claims are profoundly deceptive, particularly considering the aggressive actions of this regime against Iran, which have resulted in the killing of more than 1,100 Iranian citizens.“ It further stated: “Decades of criminal actions by the Zionist regime against the Iranian people cannot be concealed by rhetorical manoeuvres and or hypocritical behaviour. It is evident that the Zionist seeks to exploit every opportunity to sow division within Iranian society and undermine national cohesion. “Statements by him and certain hardline American officials amount to incitement to violence, terrorism and criminal acts,” it added. The statement also recalled that on December 28, 2025, following an increase in foreign exchange rates, sector-based protest gatherings were formed by some traders in the Tehran Bazaar, motivated by economic concerns. The escalating protests in Iran, which began in December last year in response to soaring prices, now pose one of the biggest challenges to the government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “The Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirm its commitment to its obligation under international human rights law regarding respecting and protecting the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly guaranteed under the Constitution. “Government recognised the lawful demands of peaceful protesters and started utilising all available capacities to address the demands,” the statement added.

      "title_orig": "Govt castigates KP CM for saying state should give evidence of Kabul’s soil being used against Pakistan",
      "summary_orig": "The government on Monday took strong exception to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi saying the state should provide evidence of Kabul’s soil being used against Pakistan. In a media interaction at the home of PTI leader Alamgir Khan on Sunday night, Afridi said that the state should give evidence for the claim that Afghanistan’s soil was being used for terrorism in Pakistan. He said that other countries also shared a border with Afghanistan but they did not have the same complaints. The clip was also shared by state broadcaster PTV on the social media platform X. In a post on X, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Afridi was speaking as Afghanistan’s “spokesperson“ which was highly “condemnable and shameful”. “The whole world has seen evidence of the Afghan Taliban regime’s support for terrorists, and there is also irrefutable evidence that Afghanistan’s soil is being used for terrorist activities,” Tarar said. “Sohail Afridi has reached the peak of lies and hypocrisy. The Pakistani nation has made immense sacrifices while fighting terrorists,“ he said. He added that whenever the party opened its mouth, they always facilitated terrorists. “Pakistan’s development is unacceptable to Fitna al Khawarij which is why Pakistan is targeted,” he said. The minister concluded that Afridi needed to “come to his senses”. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry said that it had been the PTI’s “consistent policy” to create “uncertainty” on national issues, adding that they also refrained from calling perpetrators of terrorism terrorists. “They are always reluctant to call terrorists terrorists and say things that spread doubt amongst the common man,“ he said. He also held neighbouring countries responsible for terrorism, saying that one was “investing” while the second was “implementing”. He took strong exception to Afridi’s remarks, saying: “The KP CM, once again, said in Karachi that we should provide the Afghan government with evidence of terrorist activities. “Do you still not know who’s behind terrorism?“ he asked. He said that at least two dozen countries had pointed out that Afghanistan’s soil was being used for terrorism. “They intentionally spread doubt. They do not want military operations. They do not want to expel illegal Afghans and want to negotiate instead of taking action,“ he said. “There must be a reason for this soft attitude,” Tallal said. “They have something in common, and I’ll say it on record: there has not been even a single attack on any PTI leader, worker, adviser, minister in the past 11 years,“ he alleged, criticising the party for ”spreading doubt“. “You create ambiguity in the minds of common people, so the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other groups may operate in KP and also get the sympathies of the common man,” the state minister added. Speaking about the PTI’s street movement, the state minister questioned whether party leaders had taken the time to meet with the families of martyrs. “You stand against the national narrative because you are a beneficiary,” Tallal said. “Let me say this again: no matter if you are a chief minister or an ordinary representative, speaking against the national narrative or spreading any doubt will not be tolerated,” he warned. Speaking about the PTI’s street movement, the state minister said that the PTI “could run 100 political movements“ but having a soft stance on terrorism or forming a narrative in favour of terrorists would be unacceptable. “We will send you where we are going to send them. If you have such empathy for them, then go to Afghanistan,” Tallal stated. “Over 1,200 people have been martyred; families and children have been killed in bombings; 60-70pc of incidents take place in KP,“ he added. “What is more important: to run a street movement or stand alongside our security forces and martyrs against terrorism?” The state minister accused the PTI of trying to create unrest “so it can be weakened and then blackmailed, and you (PTI) can benefit”. “There will be no softness,” he warned. “We will not tolerate even a word coming in favour of those terrorists from any of your leaders. We will not tolerate the ambiguity anymore. “There is no space for terrorism in Pakistan. Sympathisers will be treated like terrorists. If you love Afghanistan that much, then leave or we’ll send you there,“ he said. The state minister warned that nobody would be allowed to “play with the blood” of Pakistanis, either through narratives or weapons. Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal termed Afridi’s remarks “upsetting” and stated that KP witnessed the most terrorist incidents in the country. “As far as proof is concerned … when we had dialogue with them (Afghan Taliban) in Doha and Istanbul, Afghanistan did not deny that their soil is being used for cross-border terrorism, but they denied that they have control over it,” he said in a video statement posted to X. “Our demand was for them to take control of the situation.” The minister questioned whether the KP CM was acknowledging the sacrifices of security forces and civilians and noted that major terrorist attacks, including the bombing outside an Islamabad district court, were linked to Afghanistan. “If you mistakenly became the chief minister of a province facing such challenges, then please stop giving such upsetting and shameful statements,” Chaudhry said. “Your statement today is like rubbing salt in the wounds of the families of martyrs and slain civilians,” he added. The minister then noted that Pakistan had provided evidence and footage on the international stage, which showed terrorists crossing over from Afghanistan. “Pakistan remains a friendly nation to Afghanistan, but no country forms relations based on internal security,” he said. “We have served the Afghans for 40 years, housing 4 million Afghan refugees as our guests and brothers. There is still a large number of them here.” “However, Pakistan’s security and the safety of the people are our responsibility and we will fulfil it in any circumstance. Afghanistan also wants the Afghan Taliban regime to ensure that no terrorist group can use its soil to attack Pakistan in these cowardly acts,” Chaudhry added. “If they continue to attack, we will deal with them and send a message to Afghanistan telling them to stop engaging in this game.”",

      "summary_orig": "The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has rejected claims circulating on social media alleging that Pakistan is being used as a base or launch corridor to support the United States for a possible military strike on Iran, which has been rocked by protests in recent weeks. The ministry’s fact check account on X attributed the claims to “propaganda machineries in Afghanistan“ and Indian accounts, particularly identifying three handles — Khurasan Media Urdu , Baba Banaras and Afghan Defense . Among them, a post by Khurasan Media Urdu claimed that “special American aircraft have reached Pakistan for an attack on Iran”. The post also mentioned “unusual” flight activity of US aerial refuelling and surveillance aircraft between Pakistan and Iran. A post by Afghan Defense repeated the claim. Baba Banaras’ post made a similar claim, stating: “Multiple US reconnaissance aircraft and cargo planes with weapons landed at Dalbandin Airbase and Pasni Airbase of Pakistan. Looks like the game has been set for Iran.” The ministry’s fact check account said false claims had been made “that the US has moved aerial refuelling (KC-135R) and surveillance aircraft to Pakistan, that these aircraft are conducting unusual flights towards or into Iranian airspace, and that Pakistan is being used as a base or launch corridor to support US stealth fighters (F-35/F-22) for a possible imminent military strike on Iran”. The post added that while it was true that the activity of US aerial refuelling aircraft had increased, it was not from Pakistan. “ Reuters reported the US moved a large number of refuelling aircraft to Europe as Middle East tensions rose,” the ministry clarified, referring to a June 2025 report. It also referred to a June 2025 report by The Washington Post , which it said mentioned Pentagon dispatching “refuelling aircraft to European bases as posture expanded”. The ministry’s post further stated: “No credible outlet confirms that US KC-135R/ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) aircraft are operating in Pakistan.” It reiterated that “US refuelling aircraft movements have been reported, but mostly linked to Europe”. “No credible proof that US aircraft/ISR are based in Pakistan. No credible proof of Pakistan-to-Iran operational flights for strikes,” it added. It recalled that Pakistan had “publicly condemned US strikes on Iran” — ostensibly a reference to Islamabad’s stance during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, during which the US also carried strikes in Iran. “This clearly denied the ‘Pakistan is facilitating strikes’ story,” the information ministry said. “This is a reckless, blame-pushing narrative that tries to drag Pakistan into a US-Iran conflict without any verifiable evidence.” It said that the claim that “US aircraft arrived in Pakistan for Iran strikes’ is purely disinformation”. The claims have surfaced as tensions are growing between Iran and the US, with US President Donald Trump warning Tehran of strikes over the crackdown on ongoing protests in the Middle Eastern country. Iran subsequently issued stern statements in response. On Sunday, the Iranian government — which blames Washington and Tel Aviv for fomenting the unrest — warned the US of retaliation against its military bases and Israel if the Trump administration attacked the country over a crackdown on protesters. The same day, Trump said he was weighing a range of strong responses, including military options, to action against the protests . He also said, “The leaders of Iran called [yesterday], … a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.” A subsequent statement by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“. “We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he added.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Monday that the Sindh government had not upheld the honour of the ajrak and topi and criticised its treatment of its “guests”. The chief minister is currently on a visit to Karachi, where he staged a rally at the Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday. In an address to the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) in Karachi on Monday, Afridi thanked all the SHCBA members for their warm welcome and generous hospitality, adding that people from all over Pakistan — including Pashtuns, Kashmiris, Balochis — of every school of thought were present there. In contrast to this welcome from the public, however, he decried the provincial government’s treatment of him and his guests in Karachi, saying that they had “desecrated” the honour of the Sindhi ajrak and topi . “I think every Sindhi will fully condemn this,” he said amid an outcry of support from the crowd. The KP CM also criticised the fact that the constitution and law were being “toyed with,” saying that it was not only damaging institutions but the whole of Pakistan. “On one hand, they are selling our national assets — they auctioned PIA on OLX,” he said, referring to the recent auction of the national airline. “But here they have sold justice.” Afridi added that the general public at least had hope that the judiciary would provide them justice and stand with them. He said that, although three judges in Islamabad had issued an order that he be allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, “the jail superintendent picks up this order and throws it away”. “We are accused of protest politics,” he added. “But our Constitution allows us to do this, so we will do protest politics.” He further claimed that the judiciary was not cooperating with the party, adding that he had called the chief justice repeatedly but received no answer. “We are being put against the wall, so the only way left is for us to protest,” he said. The chief minister affirmed that he would always stand beside those who turned out in support of the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, saying, “We have to fight for our rights ourselves … we will not get freedom on a plate. “If we do not raise our voice, then more pressure will be put on us.” Afridi further said that the passport of one province’s chief minister had been blocked, saying that the people of the province were being discriminated against. However, he added that his leader, Imran, had always supported peaceful struggle. Regarding the economy, the KP CM said that it was facing a very bad situation, with people “fleeing” Pakistan while unemployment had risen to 7.1 per cent. “These people are building their properties abroad,” he said, adding, “These people are bound to answer to us and one day it will definitely happen”. The chief minister told the crowd that he had come to Karachi as his [Imran] leader had directed him to call for a street movement and that he hoped for “full support” from them. Expressing his thanks, he said, “I hope the rule of law will come to Pakistan one day.” ‘No Section 144 can stop us’: Salman Akram Raja Addressing the ceremony, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said, “We talk about the constitution, we talk about the law, this is our job. No section 144 can stop us”. “Today, our rights are being attacked again and again,” said the PTI general secretary. He stressed that the “living Constitution and law” must be restored. Raja also said that Karachi’s vote had been robbed “in an attempt to take away the rights of the people”. The PTI leader said that whenever the Constitution had been attacked, the SHC had been the first to raise its voice. “The Pakistani nation is alive, due to which the chief minister of KP has been elected,” he said. “If the vote is stolen in front of you, if the judiciary is attacked, how can we remain silent? We are an alive and proud people, we have to fight for our rights.” He added, “This country was not made for the elite. This country is a country of farmers, no matter which province they are from“. “We stand like a lead wall against oppression.” SHCBA President Jamali says lawyers will participate ‘fully’ in KP convention President of the High Court Bar Muhammad Haseeb Jamali, addressing the event, called Sindh a land of peace. “Along with peace, this land also belongs to those who have raised their voice against oppression,” he said. The president stressed that the bar would talk about its rights as it was independent and did not belong to any party. He added that every citizen of this country held equal opportunities under the law. Jamali further said that lawyers of the bar had protested the 26th Amendment, the 27th Amendment and the issue of Karoonjhar as they happened. “We are not part of any revenge politics, nor do we support it.” “Hold a convention in KP — we will participate in it fully,” he said. “This Pakistan is dear to all of us. Lawyers built the country; lawyers will save it,” he added. ‘Only want supremacy of Constitution’: Amir Nawaz Warraich Sindh Bar Council Member and head of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) Amir Nawaz Warraich, also addressed the ceremony, welcoming all those present. He said that when any bad time came about, the bar association raised its voice against it. “Whenever there is talk of supremacy of law and putting a curb on the Constitution, we raise our voice,” he said. “We do not support any party but only want the supremacy of the Constitution.” Warraich added that the KBA would continue to protest against the recently passed Constitutional Amendment until the Constitution was restored to its rightful form. Visit to Mazar-i-Quaid Earlier in the day, the KP chief minister paid a visit to Mazar-i-Quaid, where he had also criticised the Sindh government’s treatment of the PTI delegation. Speaking to the media, he called Sindhis a “proud nation” and said that the imposition of “such people” on a proud nation was a cruelty. “Punjab’s false government also did this; Sindh’s false government also did this,” he said. However, he said that the people of Pakistan were respectable and proud, and always treated the guests from any province with respect. “This is not even one per cent of Pakistan that does such actions,” he said. “The remaining 99pc of the Pakistani nation is extremely proud, brave, courageous and hospitable.” Salman Akram Raja also spoke to reporters at the mausoleum, saying that after “three excellent days” in Karachi, they had seen the public’s “love for democracy, for Imran Khan and for human rights” as well as the force of the state, including its refusal to allow them to hold a rally even after gaining permission. “This is all a part of Pakistan,” he said. “We are fighting for a beautiful Pakistan, for the realisation of the Quaid’s dream for Pakistan under Imran Khan’s leadership. “Today, we have come to renew our pledge that we will create that Pakistan.”",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari on Monday refuted claims by PTI leaders that different and unrelated videos were submitted for a forensic report about the May 9, 2023 riots. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident. “There are two separate videos [of KP CM] and they should not be confused. One of the videos must be from Zaman Park. However, the other one showing [him] vandalising and lighting fire has been deleted [from the social media account],” she said while addressing a press conference in Lahore. “When KP chief minister realised that an effort to rebellion which he termed as revolution failed, he deleted the videos [of May 9, 2023] from social media. However, the videos remained in the record,” said Bokhari. She further claimed their destination was the Corps Commander House, located very close to the Radio Pakistan building. However, they were denied entry there, so they entered the state media building, vandalised it, set fire, and destroyed the records there. In response to the conviction of identified suspects in May 9 cases, she said those involved in cases in Punjab have been convicted and they were serving their sentences in prison. “We don‘t have any political revenge against anyone,” she said, adding the cases on PML-N leadership in PTI’s tenure were politically motivated. Speaking on the PTI’s call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, the information minister said they planned a “new programme of anarchy to subjugate the state and make the law subservient to them, which cannot be made possible”. The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted. At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage. Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad.",
