      "summary_orig": "Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Monday allayed concerns over PTI founder Imran Khan’s vision loss, saying that there was “nothing as such to worry about”. The statement comes days after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that Imran had only 15pc vision left in his right eye, prompting the apex court to form a medical team to examine him before February 16 (today). Subsequently, a team of five doctors arrived at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday, where the ex-premier is incarcerated, and carried out a detailed eye examination, took blood samples and checked his blood pressure. However, the PTI rejected the check-up conducted without his family and personal physicians. Addressing Bar Association Ferozewala in Punjab’s Shahdara on Monday, Tarar referred to the “latest report that had to be submitted” regarding Imran’s health. The minister added that he discussed it with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan and the “relevant” individuals before coming to the bar association. Tarar stated: “They said thanks to God, the examination was carried out again on the Supreme Court’s order and there is no such thing about 35 or 25 [per cent]. “If he uses glasses for his eyesight, then one eye is approximately 70pc fine and the other eye is 6/6. There is nothing as such to worry about.” According to the Cleveland Clinic, having 6/6 vision or 20/20 vision means you see the world with normal clarity and sharpness. Before commenting on Imran’s health, Tarar stressed the need to “pay attention to our national issues”. “We took difficult financial decisions, but the fruits of those can be seen now,” he stated, asserting that Pakistan was now “performing way better economically”. The law minister stressed that political stability was crucial for economic stability. “There is a lot of noise these days that what is about happen and what has been done to the PTI founder,” he noted. Addressing the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, Tarar said it was the “first time that a government was taking official measures to deprive the citizens of their rights”. He then referred to the blockades of major roads and KP’s entry and exit points by PTI protests, which have cut off the province from the rest of the country. “Article 15 [of the Constitution] allows freedom of movement, but the blockage of motorways and GT Road on the official level is unconstitutional,” the law minister pointed out. He expressed the hope that the PTI would “rectify” the situation itself after looking at the latest report. “Otherwise, the federal government will have to take some action,” Tarar warned. He further said it was the responsibility of PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, as well as the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, to “ensure that the KP government adheres to the Constitution”. Imran’s physician urges authorities to allow access Meanwhile, Imran’s long-time personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf released a video statement, saying that last night he spoke on the telephone to the two Islamabad-based eye doctors who were treating the ex-premier for his eye condition. He said he asked his colleague, Dr Khurram Azam Mirza, a Lahore-based retinal specialist, to join the phone call. Dr Yusuf said that the phone call lasted 40 minutes, during which the doctors provided a background of when they first examined Imran, what his symptoms were, details of the treatment prescribed and what the future treatment plan. “Their latest assessment was yesterday afternoon … they told us that, in their view, Imran had shown significant improvement as a result of treatment and his vision had improved significantly as well,” he said. “I would be extremely happy if I was able to confirm that this was the case. Unfortunately, because I have not seen him myself and have not been able to participate in his care or talk to him, I am unable to either confirm or deny the veracity of what we have been told,” he said. Dr Yusuf appealed to the authorities to allow him or Dr Faisal Sultan, ideally both of them, and physicians nominated by Imran’s family to examine the ex-premier and participate in his care. He also called for Imran to be treated at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, saying that it was “appropriately equipped and of a suitable standard” for treating the PTI founder. CRVO in Imran’s right eye Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family. Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 10, last week submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living conditions in the prison. In his report, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”. Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6/6 vision in both eyes”. While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying. A medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC. It stated that a qualified ophthalmologist from Pims conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiala jail of Imran and a “diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made”. This was then followed by Imran undergoing medical treatment at Pims. The ex-premier’s family and the PTI have been demanding that he be moved to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital for a comprehensive check-up, with the opposition even staging a sit-in at Parliament House for the past four days.",

According to a statement by the police, the blast occurred when a time bomb planted in a motorcycle detonated. A child was among those killed in the explosion. Police sources said the blast took place near shops located in front of the station. Although police personnel remained unharmed, civilians in the vicinity were caught in the blast. Several of the injured are reported to be in critical condition. Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) spokesperson, Muhammad Noman Khattab, stated that the victims were brought to District Headquarters Hospital and Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital. Rescue 1122 officials said emergency teams promptly reached the scene and moved the bodies and injured to nearby hospitals. Following the incident, a heavy contingent of the Bannu police reached the scene, along with the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) and the Quick Response Force (QRF). Police and security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation, added the police statement. Evidence is being collected and an investigation has been initiated.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained cut off from rest of the country on Sunday as activists of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf continued their protest on third consecutive day and blocked all entry and exit points of the province. The PTI activists have blocked Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway. Protesters remained present all the time at exit and entry points and did not allow a single vehicle to enter the province, causing serious problems to passengers and motorists destined to Islamabad and other parts of the country. Former governor Shah Farman, PTI Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem, deputy secretary information Ikram Khattana and other leaders of the party were present at Khairabad Bridge, connecting Attock district of Punjab with KP. Commuters, motorists face hardships Protesters have been demanding of the government to shift PTI founder Imran Khan from jail to hospital for treatment of his eye by doctors of his choice. Speaking on the occasion, Shah Farman said that under Article-4 of the Constitution, no authority could deny treatment of his choice to a patient. He said that the people, who were not allowing treatment of Imran Khan through doctors of his choice, would be responsible if his eye was further damaged. PTI workers blocked Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway near Swabi Interchange to all types of traffic, vowing to stay on roads till Imran Khan was shifted to hospital for medical treatment. Vendors were seen selling various eatables while setting up stalls on motorway, converting it into a market. PTI Swabi general secretary Afsar Khan told journalists that they were not ready to go back homes under any circumstances. “We will continue to sit here and if our demand is not accepted. This protest will continue. The federal government is responsible for the prevailing mess in the country,” he said. Stranded commuters said that government should take action against PTI workers to open the motorway to traffic because people, especially patients, were facing difficulties. “Where should we go, who should we beg, who should we ask and who should we request to open the motorway,” questioned Shahzad Khan, a resident of Peshawar. Uzair Khan, a resident of Gundam who was seriously injured in a firing incident on Saturday, was not allowed to reach a hospital in Peshawar through motorway. The circumstances forced his family to pass through Swabi and Mardan but he did not reach hospital and passed away. His relatives said that PTI workers were responsible for his death. During the last three days, it has been observed, that there is no rush at daytime at the venue of protest. In the afternoon youth start to arrive at rest area and in the evening there is a lot of crowd on motorway. PTI workers blocked roads at four key points in Dera Ismail Khan district on Sunday, suspending traffic and causing inconvenience to commuters and motorists. The sit-ins were held on Bhakkar Road, Multan Road, Chashma Road and CPEC route, bringing vehicular movement to a standstill at these locations. As a result, long queues of vehicles were seen on major arteries. Witnesses said that several commuters remained stranded for hours, while alternative routes also experienced heavy congestion due to diverted traffic. The protest is being held on the call of PTI central leaders, who have urged workers to demonstrate over the deteriorating health of Imran Khan and demand his immediate release. The district administration was monitoring the situation while residents called for restoration of traffic flow to ease their hardships. PTI activists continued protest demonstrations in Lakki Marwat and Karak districts on the second consecutive day on Sunday. A good number of party workers led by former district nazim Ishfaq Ahmad Khan Minakhel gathered at Darra Tang Point where they closed Bannu-Mianwali road, linking KP with Punjab and Islamabad via CPEC route. The closure of road on the second consecutive day troubled transporters and commuters as passenger and good transport vehicles queued up on both sides of the main artery. On the occasion, the former district nazim said that denial of access to healthcare and maltreatment by federal government had led to loss of Imran’s vision. He said that PTI activists had come on roads to hold peaceful protests against the PML-N government, which was responsible for the poor health of their party leader. In Karak, the PTI workers gathered outside Nashapa oil and gas field and staged a sit-in there. They stopped supply from the oil and gas field as oil tankers could not enter or come out of the area. An official of district administration confirmed disruption of oil supply from the field. PTI district president Inayat Khattak said that leaders and workers of the party decided in a meeting to shut down oil and gas fields in Makori, Nashapa and Gurguri to record their protest against non-provision of treatment facilities to Imran Khan.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Roads leading to the Parliament House were cleared on Monday morning as the PTI and opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP)’s sit-in over Imran’s health entered its fourth day. The sit-in, which began on Friday, was announced hours after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting a strong response from the opposition alliance. TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Yousafzai, speaking to Dawn , said it was a surprising step that all the routes had been cleared. On Friday, roads leading to Parliament House were blocked ahead of the sit-in. “First of all, we are going to have breakfast after four days, as previously we were eating only dates and biscuits and were being forced to drink tap water. It has been decided to merge the sit-in at the Parliament lodges with the one at Parliament House,” he said. The opposition’s sit-in was initially held at three places, including the Parliament House, led by TTAP head Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. The protest outside the Parliament lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, KP CM Sohail Afridi led the demonstration. “Moreover, as the government is going to file a report regarding Imran Khan’s health in the Supreme Court, we will examine it and will take a further decision,” Yousafzai told Dawn. Yousafzai stated that the sit-in was going to continue until all demands were accepted by the government. On Sunday, a team of doctors examined the PTI founder at Adiala Jail and left the premises after around an hour, sources said. The party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”. Speaking to reporters earlier on Sunday, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital. “We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party. “We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. Moreover, we have also decided to approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday to get justice and the right to medical treatment for Imran,” he told Dawn . A TTAP leader, speaking on condition of anonymity on Sunday, said they had been told the previous night that Imran would be shifted to Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, but later received messages suggesting the sit-in should be called off first. The TTAP had also alleged that access to food, water and medicines had been blocked for protesters inside Parliament House for a third consecutive day, a day earlier, calling it a violation of democratic and constitutional values.",

      "title_orig": "Medical team leaves Adiala Jail after examining Imran Khan, PTI rejects inspection",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A team of doctors examined PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Sunday and left the premises after around an hour, sources said, as the party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”. On February 12, Imran, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday). Although government figures on Saturday had hinted that Imran would soon be taken to a hospital, no such development had occurred till Sunday afternoon. According to sources, Adiala’s jail superintendent, however, dismissed the development as a “rumour”, saying that Imran was only being examined and not being taken anywhere yet. “The medical team will examine Imran’s eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the jail superintendent was quoted as saying by the sources. At about 5:30pm, sources said that the eye examination, carried out by a team of five doctors, was completed. “A detailed eye examination and blood sampling were carried out, while his blood pressure was also checked,” they said. “Senior doctors continued the medical examination for an hour,” they said, adding that the medical team was able to start the examination after waiting for two-and-a-half hours. They said that the team brought eye examination equipment with them and that their report is “likely to be compiled soon”. Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family. On the other hand, shortly after the eye examination was completed, the PTI refused to accept the inspection, saying that without the presence of the PTI family and Imran’s personal doctors, the government’s stance was “deemed malicious”. “Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan’s eye in Adiala Jail. The government’s claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the PTI said in a post on X. “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership. In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan’s family. “And the family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan’s personal doctors are present during the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification.” Aleema demands Imran’s treatment as per personal doctors’ advice Earlier in the day, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said the party would not accept any medical board formed without the approval of the PTI founder’s personal doctors. Aleema referred to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry’s post from Saturday, which announced that a medical board would be set up. She added, “Secondly, we are hearing in the news that Imran Khan is to be taken to Al Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi. “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment WITHOUT the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.” The former prime minister’s sister affirmed: “We do NOT accept any medical board they set up and control! We do NOT accept any reports or results they manufacture.” She added that the family was “extremely worried as to why they are resisting the selection of specialists advised” by Imran’s personal doctors. “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan’s personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan’s family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?” Aleema wondered. Earlier on Sunday, Imran’s longtime personal physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, issued a joint video statement , reiterating that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad,” read the post accompanying their statement. ‘Will continue sit-in to pressure govt’ Meanwhile, the sit-in by the main opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) at Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health entered its third day on Sunday. The alliance had announced staging the sit-in until the ex-premier was taken to a hospital of his personal doctors’ choice. Speaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital. “We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party. “We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. Moreover, we have also decided to approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday to get justice and the right to medical treatment for Imran,” he told Dawn . He said that the government representatives, throughout the day on Sunday, remained in contact with the PTI and TTAP leadership but could not give a proper response that the demands had been approved. TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, while talking to Dawn , said that the sit-ins were being held at all three places, i.e. in the Parliament house, outside the Parliament lodges and at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, where the KP chief minister has been staging a sit-in. “It is unfortunate that even water and food are not being allowed to reach the Parliament House. We have been eating dates and biscuits. Mineral water has been consumed, so now parliamentarians have been drinking tap water,” he claimed. Yousafzai said that the strikes will be continued till the outcome. “History is in the making”, he said. Earlier in the day, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan shared visuals of himself, TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Qaiser and Senator Faisal Javed, among others, sitting at Parliament House. A TTAP leader, wishing not to be named, told Dawn that things have become more confusing rather than being streamlined. “Last night we were informed that Imran Khan will be shifted to Shifa International Hospital [in Islamabad], but a demand was made that doctors in the medical board be changed, as including doctors of our choice will give a message that the government has gone on the back foot. “[Therefore,] we decided to show flexibility and gave names of a few more doctors, and there was an understanding that we will not reveal their names in the media,” the TTAP leader said. He added: “However, today we have been getting messages that first we should call off the sit-in and then Imran Khan will be shifted to the hospital and a medical board will be announced. How can we call off the sit-in without implementation of our demands?” he asked. Replying to a question, the leader said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi — who is staging a sit-in at KP House in the capital — also contacted government representatives to make it clear that the situation could go out of his control if the issue was not resolved soon. He added that the government representatives told them that the interior minister was in Sri Lanka, while the National Assembly and Senate chairs were also abroad, making it “difficult to decide” for the authorities. In the evening, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) issued a statement, saying that Allama Nasir Abbas was in bad health and that a delegation of parliamentarians had arrived at Parliament House to deliver food to TTAP lawmakers. “Delivering food to parliamentarians is not allowed,” he said. “Female members are also inside, concern has grown.” He added that the delegation was at the door but was not allowed to enter the premises. “An atmosphere of fascism and oppression has been imposed on the country … The public mandate is being insulted,” Abbas added. “The leadership of the party that won 180 seats is in jail … it is unjust to give power to those with fewer seats.” ‘Inhumane, blatant violation of constitutional values’ Earlier, the TTAP said today was the “third consecutive day that access to food, water, and medicines has been blocked for the protesters encamped inside Parliament House”. “This action is not only inhumane but a blatant violation of fundamental democratic and constitutional values,” it added. The alliance further alleged that access to medicines was blocked for Senator Abbas, terming it an “extreme and condemnable act”. “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression,” the statement read. The TTAP stated that its leadership was firm on its demands, adding: “History bears witness that yazidi (tyrannical) tricks, sieges and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands. Such tactics only add to the record of cruelty; they cannot silence the voice of truth.” The TTAP reiterated its “clear demand” that Imran be provided full medical facilities at Islamabad’s Al-Shifa International Hospital, emphasising that providing quality medical facilities to a prisoner was the state’s responsibility, “not a favour”. The alliance vowed that it would not be “cowed by tactics of oppression, coercion and siege”. HRCP calls for ‘uninterrupted access’ to treatment The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “grave concern over reports regarding the deteriorating health of prisoners affiliated with the PTI, particularly” Imran and former Punjab health minister Yasmin Rashid. In a statement, the HRCP urged the interior ministry, the Punjab Home Department and the relevant prison authorities to ensure that “all such inmates are allowed immediate, independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to prescribed treatment”. “Their condition must be verified with transparency,” the rights body stressed. It pointed out: “Denial or delay of adequate healthcare to any detainee violates legal and constitutional guarantees, including under the Prison Rules, as well as Pakistan’s human rights obligations.” Awaam Pakistan leader Dr Zafar Mirza, noting the government’s assurances and the development of Imran speaking to his sons on phone, said: “The last two days have proven the power of non-violent peaceful protest, as it has before many times in human history. “Decision to let Imran Khan speak with his sons, move him to hospital, establishment of a medical board, all this has not happened in a vacuum and for nothing.” However, Dr Mirza stressed that the former premier “still needs access to a personal physician, family, and his cases also need to be heard without politically motivated delays”. “Awaam Pakistan is fully supporting the dharna (sit-in) as we are standing with the moral principle of human right to health care, and we are standing on the right side of history,” he affirmed.",

It pointed out: “Denial or delay of adequate healthcare to any detainee violates legal and constitutional guarantees, including under the Prison Rules, as well as Pakistan’s human rights obligations.” Awaam Pakistan leader Dr Zafar Mirza, noting the government’s assurances and the development of Imran speaking to his sons on phone, said: “The last two days have proven the power of non-violent peaceful protest, as it has before many times in human history. “Decision to let Imran Khan speak with his sons, move him to hospital, establishment of a medical board, all this has not happened in a vacuum and for nothing.” However, Dr Mirza stressed that the former premier “still needs access to a personal physician, family, and his cases also need to be heard without politically motivated delays”. “Awaam Pakistan is fully supporting the dharna (sit-in) as we are standing with the moral principle of human right to health care, and we are standing on the right side of history,” he affirmed.",
      "title": "Medical team leaves Adiala Jail after examining Imran Khan, PTI rejects inspection",
      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: A team of doctors examined PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Sunday and left the premises after around an hour, sources said, as the party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”. On February 12, Imran, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday). Although government figures on Saturday had hinted that Imran would soon be taken to a hospital, no such development had occurred till Sunday afternoon. According to sources, Adiala’s jail superintendent, however, dismissed the development as a “rumour”, saying that Imran was only being examined and not being taken anywhere yet. “The medical team will examine Imran’s eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the jail superintendent was quoted as saying by the sources. At about 5:30pm, sources said that the eye examination, carried out by a team of five doctors, was completed. “A detailed eye examination and blood sampling were carried out, while his blood pressure was also checked,” they said. “Senior doctors continued the medical examination for an hour,” they said, adding that the medical team was able to start the examination after waiting for two-and-a-half hours. They said that the team brought eye examination equipment with them and that their report is “likely to be compiled soon”. Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family. On the other hand, shortly after the eye examination was completed, the PTI refused to accept the inspection, saying that without the presence of the PTI family and Imran’s personal doctors, the government’s stance was “deemed malicious”. “Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan’s eye in Adiala Jail. The government’s claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the PTI said in a post on X. “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership. In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan’s family. “And the family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan’s personal doctors are present during the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification.” Aleema demands Imran’s treatment as per personal doctors’ advice Earlier in the day, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said the party would not accept any medical board formed without the approval of the PTI founder’s personal doctors. Aleema referred to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry’s post from Saturday, which announced that a medical board would be set up. She added, “Secondly, we are hearing in the news that Imran Khan is to be taken to Al Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi. “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment WITHOUT the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.” The former prime minister’s sister affirmed: “We do NOT accept any medical board they set up and control! We do NOT accept any reports or results they manufacture.” She added that the family was “extremely worried as to why they are resisting the selection of specialists advised” by Imran’s personal doctors. “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan’s personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan’s family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?” Aleema wondered. Earlier on Sunday, Imran’s longtime personal physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, issued a joint video statement , reiterating that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad,” read the post accompanying their statement. ‘Will continue sit-in to pressure govt’ Meanwhile, the sit-in by the main opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) at Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health entered its third day on Sunday. The alliance had announced staging the sit-in until the ex-premier was taken to a hospital of his personal doctors’ choice. Speaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital. “We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party. “We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. Moreover, we have also decided to approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday to get justice and the right to medical treatment for Imran,” he told Dawn . He said that the government representatives, throughout the day on Sunday, remained in contact with the PTI and TTAP leadership but could not give a proper response that the demands had been approved. TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, while talking to Dawn , said that the sit-ins were being held at all three places, i.e. in the Parliament house, outside the Parliament lodges and at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, where the KP chief minister has been staging a sit-in. “It is unfortunate that even water and food are not being allowed to reach the Parliament House. We have been eating dates and biscuits. Mineral water has been consumed, so now parliamentarians have been drinking tap water,” he claimed. Yousafzai said that the strikes will be continued till the outcome. “History is in the making”, he said. Earlier in the day, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan shared visuals of himself, TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Qaiser and Senator Faisal Javed, among others, sitting at Parliament House. A TTAP leader, wishing not to be named, told Dawn that things have become more confusing rather than being streamlined. “Last night we were informed that Imran Khan will be shifted to Shifa International Hospital [in Islamabad], but a demand was made that doctors in the medical board be changed, as including doctors of our choice will give a message that the government has gone on the back foot. “[Therefore,] we decided to show flexibility and gave names of a few more doctors, and there was an understanding that we will not reveal their names in the media,” the TTAP leader said. He added: “However, today we have been getting messages that first we should call off the sit-in and then Imran Khan will be shifted to the hospital and a medical board will be announced. How can we call off the sit-in without implementation of our demands?” he asked. Replying to a question, the leader said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi — who is staging a sit-in at KP House in the capital — also contacted government representatives to make it clear that the situation could go out of his control if the issue was not resolved soon. He added that the government representatives told them that the interior minister was in Sri Lanka, while the National Assembly and Senate chairs were also abroad, making it “difficult to decide” for the authorities. In the evening, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) issued a statement, saying that Allama Nasir Abbas was in bad health and that a delegation of parliamentarians had arrived at Parliament House to deliver food to TTAP lawmakers. “Delivering food to parliamentarians is not allowed,” he said. “Female members are also inside, concern has grown.” He added that the delegation was at the door but was not allowed to enter the premises. “An atmosphere of fascism and oppression has been imposed on the country … The public mandate is being insulted,” Abbas added. “The leadership of the party that won 180 seats is in jail … it is unjust to give power to those with fewer seats.” ‘Inhumane, blatant violation of constitutional values’ Earlier, the TTAP said today was the “third consecutive day that access to food, water, and medicines has been blocked for the protesters encamped inside Parliament House”. “This action is not only inhumane but a blatant violation of fundamental democratic and constitutional values,” it added. The alliance further alleged that access to medicines was blocked for Senator Abbas, terming it an “extreme and condemnable act”. “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression,” the statement read. The TTAP stated that its leadership was firm on its demands, adding: “History bears witness that yazidi (tyrannical) tricks, sieges and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands. Such tactics only add to the record of cruelty; they cannot silence the voice of truth.” The TTAP reiterated its “clear demand” that Imran be provided full medical facilities at Islamabad’s Al-Shifa International Hospital, emphasising that providing quality medical facilities to a prisoner was the state’s responsibility, “not a favour”. The alliance vowed that it would not be “cowed by tactics of oppression, coercion and siege”. HRCP calls for ‘uninterrupted access’ to treatment The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “grave concern over reports regarding the deteriorating health of prisoners affiliated with the PTI, particularly” Imran and former Punjab health minister Yasmin Rashid. In a statement, the HRCP urged the interior ministry, the Punjab Home Department and the relevant prison authorities to ensure that “all such inmates are allowed immediate, independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to prescribed treatment”. “Their condition must be verified with transparency,” the rights body stressed.

      "summary_orig": "Accused Bondi Beach killer Naveed Akram appeared in an Australian court via video link Monday, in his first public hearing since the nation’s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades. Akram and his father, Sajid, allegedly attacked a Hanukkah celebration in December. Sajid was shot and killed by police during the attack. Akram has been charged with terrorism, 15 counts of murder, dozens of counts of causing wounds to a person with intent to kill and planting explosives. He appeared in a Sydney court for about five minutes via video link from prison, according to a statement from the court and local media. The timeline of evidence was also discussed, the court said. The accused wore a green jersey during the hearing, which dealt mostly with technical matters such as suppressing the identification of some victims, local media said. He reportedly spoke only one word — “yeah” — when asked by the judge whether he had heard a discussion about the extension of suppression orders. Akram will next appear in court on March 9. Speaking outside the court, Akram’s lawyer Ben Archbold said his client was being held in “very onerous conditions”, national broadcaster ABC said. He also said it was too early to say whether Akram would plead guilty. The mass shooting sparked national soul-searching about antisemitism, anger over the failure to shield Jewish Australians from harm and promises to stiffen gun laws . ‘Tactical’ training Police and intelligence agencies are also facing difficult questions about whether they could have acted earlier. Naveed Akram was flagged by Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019, but he slipped off the radar after it decided that he posed no imminent threat. Police documents released following the attack said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting. They said the suspects “meticulously planned” the attack for months, releasing pictures showing them firing shotguns and moving in what they described as a “tactical manner”. The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State terrorist group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said. They made a nighttime reconnaissance trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed. And a few weeks before the Bondi Beach attack, the pair returned to Sydney from a four-week trip to the southern Philippines.",

He appeared in a Sydney court for about five minutes via video link from prison, according to a statement from the court and local media. The timeline of evidence was also discussed, the court said. The accused wore a green jersey during the hearing, which dealt mostly with technical matters such as suppressing the identification of some victims, local media said. He reportedly spoke only one word — “yeah” — when asked by the judge whether he had heard a discussion about the extension of suppression orders. Akram will next appear in court on March 9. Speaking outside the court, Akram’s lawyer Ben Archbold said his client was being held in “very onerous conditions”, national broadcaster ABC said. He also said it was too early to say whether Akram would plead guilty. The mass shooting sparked national soul-searching about antisemitism, anger over the failure to shield Jewish Australians from harm and promises to stiffen gun laws . ‘Tactical’ training Police and intelligence agencies are also facing difficult questions about whether they could have acted earlier. Naveed Akram was flagged by Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019, but he slipped off the radar after it decided that he posed no imminent threat. Police documents released following the attack said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting. They said the suspects “meticulously planned” the attack for months, releasing pictures showing them firing shotguns and moving in what they described as a “tactical manner”. The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State terrorist group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said. They made a nighttime reconnaissance trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed. And a few weeks before the Bondi Beach attack, the pair returned to Sydney from a four-week trip to the southern Philippines.",

      "summary_orig": "• Media reports confirm Francesca Albanese never called Israel ‘common enemy of humanity’ • Amnesty chief brands European ministers’ refusal to retract ‘political cowardice’ • French lawyers file criminal complaint against Barrot over false statements • Ruffalo, Bardem among over 100 celebrities rallying behind UN expert • OIC warns fabricated claims risk undermining credibility of UN Human Rights Council TOP European government officials who led a smear campaign against United Nations special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, have failed to apologise or withdraw their calls for her resignation, even after multiple reports confirmed the allegations were based on a fabricated quote. France 24 and Reuters verified that Albanese did not describe Israel as the “common enemy of humanity” during a forum in Qatar earlier this month, an allegation levelled by Israeli officials and echoed by European ministers. Transcripts of the event show she was referring to a global system of finance and weaponry. Yet diplomats from France, Germany and other nations have so far declined to correct the record. Amnesty International has demanded that European states immediately withdraw their accusations. Its secretary general, Agnès Callamard, said ministers in Austria, Czechia, France, Germany and Italy had attacked Albanese on the basis of a “deliberately truncated video” that gravely misrepresented her remarks. “The ministers that have spread disinformation must act beyond merely deleting their comments on social media — as some have done,” Callamard said. “They must publicly apologise and retract any calls for Francesca Albanese’s resignation.” She described the refusal to issue corrections as political cowardice, pointing to the stark contrast between the speed with which governments condemned a UN expert and their reluctance to hold Israel accountable for actions Amnesty has characterised as genocide and apartheid. Meanwhile, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation added its voice to the chorus of condemnations. In a statement, the bloc said the allegations were “based on misrepresented and fabricated claims” regarding remarks the rapporteur neither made nor endorsed. The OIC warned that distorting the statements of UN mandate holders risked undermining the integrity of the Human Rights Council. Albanese also responded to the diplomatic fallout directly. Addressing the controversy, she clarified that her speech in Doha had identified the “common enemy” as the system enabling violence, specifically “financial capital”, “algorithms” and “weapons”. “A lie was exposed. Instead of retracting it, the SYSTEM that enabled the genocide, attacks the messenger,” Alban­ese wrote on X. “France knows it stepped in something foul, but pride forbids correction.” She noted that three European governments had accused her with a “virulence” they never applied to the perpetrators of violence in Gaza, where the death toll has reportedly surpassed 72,000. Legal complaint filed in Paris Legal pressure is now mounting in France over the government’s refusal to correct its public statements. Middle East Eye reported that Jurdi, the Association of Lawyers for the Respect of International Law, had filed a crime report with the Paris public prosecutor accusing the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, of disseminating false information by a public authority. Barrot told the French parliament that Albanese had made “outrageous and reprehensible remarks”, claiming she had targeted Israel as a nation. Jurdi argues that because the verified transcript proves otherwise, the minister’s statement makes up a misrepresentation that could endanger the UN expert’s safety. Support for Albanese also comes from the cultural sphere. According to AFP, over 100 figures from the entertainment industry — including actors Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon and Javier Bardem — have signed an open letter defending her work. The letter, organised by Artists for Palestine, said the rapporteur was being targeted for her defence of Palestinian rights. Published in Dawn, February 16th, 2026",

      "summary": "• Media reports confirm Francesca Albanese never called Israel ‘common enemy of humanity’ • Amnesty chief brands European ministers’ refusal to retract ‘political cowardice’ • French lawyers file criminal complaint against Barrot over false statements • Ruffalo, Bardem among over 100 celebrities rallying behind UN expert • OIC warns fabricated claims risk undermining credibility of UN Human Rights Council TOP European government officials who led a smear campaign against United Nations special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, have failed to apologise or withdraw their calls for her resignation, even after multiple reports confirmed the allegations were based on a fabricated quote. France 24 and Reuters verified that Albanese did not describe Israel as the “common enemy of humanity” during a forum in Qatar earlier this month, an allegation levelled by Israeli officials and echoed by European ministers. Transcripts of the event show she was referring to a global system of finance and weaponry. Yet diplomats from France, Germany and other nations have so far declined to correct the record. Amnesty International has demanded that European states immediately withdraw their accusations. Its secretary general, Agnès Callamard, said ministers in Austria, Czechia, France, Germany and Italy had attacked Albanese on the basis of a “deliberately truncated video” that gravely misrepresented her remarks. “The ministers that have spread disinformation must act beyond merely deleting their comments on social media — as some have done,” Callamard said. “They must publicly apologise and retract any calls for Francesca Albanese’s resignation.” She described the refusal to issue corrections as political cowardice, pointing to the stark contrast between the speed with which governments condemned a UN expert and their reluctance to hold Israel accountable for actions Amnesty has characterised as genocide and apartheid. Meanwhile, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation added its voice to the chorus of condemnations. In a statement, the bloc said the allegations were “based on misrepresented and fabricated claims” regarding remarks the rapporteur neither made nor endorsed. The OIC warned that distorting the statements of UN mandate holders risked undermining the integrity of the Human Rights Council. Albanese also responded to the diplomatic fallout directly. Addressing the controversy, she clarified that her speech in Doha had identified the “common enemy” as the system enabling violence, specifically “financial capital”, “algorithms” and “weapons”. “A lie was exposed. Instead of retracting it, the SYSTEM that enabled the genocide, attacks the messenger,” Alban­ese wrote on X. “France knows it stepped in something foul, but pride forbids correction.” She noted that three European governments had accused her with a “virulence” they never applied to the perpetrators of violence in Gaza, where the death toll has reportedly surpassed 72,000. Legal complaint filed in Paris Legal pressure is now mounting in France over the government’s refusal to correct its public statements. Middle East Eye reported that Jurdi, the Association of Lawyers for the Respect of International Law, had filed a crime report with the Paris public prosecutor accusing the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, of disseminating false information by a public authority. Barrot told the French parliament that Albanese had made “outrageous and reprehensible remarks”, claiming she had targeted Israel as a nation. Jurdi argues that because the verified transcript proves otherwise, the minister’s statement makes up a misrepresentation that could endanger the UN expert’s safety. Support for Albanese also comes from the cultural sphere. According to AFP, over 100 figures from the entertainment industry — including actors Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon and Javier Bardem — have signed an open letter defending her work. The letter, organised by Artists for Palestine, said the rapporteur was being targeted for her defence of Palestinian rights. Published in Dawn, February 16th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Palestinian presidency calls the move a ‘serious escalation’ • Hamas condemns Tel Aviv’s attempt ‘to steal and Judaise lands’ • Israeli strikes kill 12 more people in less than 24 hours despite truce JERUSALEM: The Israeli government has approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property”, for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of the international law that states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories, Al Jazeera reported. The development was annou­nced by Israeli public broadcaster KAN on Sunday when Israeli forces killed at least 12 Palest­inians in less than 24 hours, according to Gaza’s civil defence agency. The proposal, approved by the Israel security cabinet, was submitted by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defence Minister Israel Katz. “We are continuing the settlement revolution to control all our lands,” Smotrich said. The Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, Wafa news agency reported. Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership. International law states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories. However, Katz described the move as an “essential security and governance measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for the state of Israel in the area”, the Jerusalem Pos t stated. Palestinian group Hamas condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”. In a statement, the group called the approval “a null and void decision issued by an illegitimate occupying power. It is an attempt to forcibly impose settlement and Judaisation on the ground, in flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions.” De facto annexation Analysts describe the move as a de facto annexation of the Palestinian territory, warning that it will profoundly reshape its civil and legal landscape by eliminating what the Israeli ministers cal­led longstanding “legal obstacles” to the expansion of illegal settlements there. Speaking from Ramallah, political analyst Xavier Abu Eid told Al Jazeera that Israel is “packing annexation into some sort of a bureaucratic move”. He said the International Court of Justice in 2024 said that Israeli actions amount to annexation of the occupied West Bank. “People should understand this is not just a step towards annexation, we are experiencing annexation as we speak today. What the Israeli government is doing is implanting their political programme — a policy that has already been presented,” he said. Strikes amid ceasefire In multiple strikes since dawn on Sun­day, Israeli forces killed at least 12 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency reported. Despite a US-brokered truce that entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement. The civil defence agency said five people were killed and several injured in the attack on a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia, five others were killed and several injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Yunis, and another Palestinian was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City. Besides, Israeli gunfire killed one person in Beit Lahia in north Gaza, it added. “Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack. He said the people were killed as they slept. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 601 Palestinians have been killed since the truce began, while Israel claimed at least four of its soldiers were killed in the same period.

      "summary_orig": "JHELUM: A man was arrested on Sunday after he reportedly attacked cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza, the police said. Per a first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn , the incident took place in Jhelum at Mirza’s Qur’an-o-Sunnat Research Academy at the end of a lecture. According to the complainant Muhammad Kashif Qureshi, a core member of the academy, attendees were returning home after listening to the lecture, but some of them stayed back to take selfies with Engineer Mirza. “Just then, a man attacked Engineer Mirza by grabbing his collar, throwing punches at him, and removing his turban,” the FIR quoted Qureshi as saying. “He violently threw his honourable turban onto the ground, strangled him with both hands to suffocate him, and loudly chanted slogans,” he added. Qureshi was quoted as saying that people present at the site of the incident intervened immediately to protect the scholar. “We then handed him over to the police on duty to ensure that legal action is taken against the criminal,” he said in his complaint. District Police Officer (DPO) Jhelum Tariq Aziz Sindhu, while talking to Dawn, said that the police have arrested the alleged attacker and the FIR was filed against him under section 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code. “Further investigations about the background of the attacker are underway,” DPO Sindhu added. The DPO said that a four-tier security of police had been deployed at Mirza’s academy, adding that the police had repeatedly warned him to avoid taking selfies with the strangers entering as audience at his sessions. The officer added that the scholar had previously been attacked too and was taken into the police’s protective custody last year under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) by Jhelum’s deputy commissioner after an activist of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) accused him of blasphemy and registered a case against him. He was later released on bail. Section 3 of the MPO ordinance gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected persons to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order. Mirza, a resident of Machine Mohallah of Jhelum city, frequently uploads his lectures and speeches on his social media accounts and has amassed 3.1 million followers on his YouTube channel . In 2024, he was among 17 clerics whose speeches were banned by then-Jhelum DC during Muharram to prevent any potential sectarian violence. The popular cleric survived an assassination attempt at a religious academy in March 2021. The suspect was taken into custody, and a case of attempted murder was registered against him. The cleric had also been booked and arrested by the Jhelum police in May 2020 for derogatory remarks against some religious figures. However, he was later released on bail .",

In 2024, he was among 17 clerics whose speeches were banned by then-Jhelum DC during Muharram to prevent any potential sectarian violence. The popular cleric survived an assassination attempt at a religious academy in March 2021. The suspect was taken into custody, and a case of attempted murder was registered against him. The cleric had also been booked and arrested by the Jhelum police in May 2020 for derogatory remarks against some religious figures. However, he was later released on bail .",

      "summary": "JHELUM: A man was arrested on Sunday after he reportedly attacked cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza, the police said. Per a first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn , the incident took place in Jhelum at Mirza’s Qur’an-o-Sunnat Research Academy at the end of a lecture. According to the complainant Muhammad Kashif Qureshi, a core member of the academy, attendees were returning home after listening to the lecture, but some of them stayed back to take selfies with Engineer Mirza. “Just then, a man attacked Engineer Mirza by grabbing his collar, throwing punches at him, and removing his turban,” the FIR quoted Qureshi as saying. “He violently threw his honourable turban onto the ground, strangled him with both hands to suffocate him, and loudly chanted slogans,” he added. Qureshi was quoted as saying that people present at the site of the incident intervened immediately to protect the scholar. “We then handed him over to the police on duty to ensure that legal action is taken against the criminal,” he said in his complaint. District Police Officer (DPO) Jhelum Tariq Aziz Sindhu, while talking to Dawn, said that the police have arrested the alleged attacker and the FIR was filed against him under section 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code. “Further investigations about the background of the attacker are underway,” DPO Sindhu added. The DPO said that a four-tier security of police had been deployed at Mirza’s academy, adding that the police had repeatedly warned him to avoid taking selfies with the strangers entering as audience at his sessions. The officer added that the scholar had previously been attacked too and was taken into the police’s protective custody last year under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) by Jhelum’s deputy commissioner after an activist of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) accused him of blasphemy and registered a case against him. He was later released on bail. Section 3 of the MPO ordinance gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected persons to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order. Mirza, a resident of Machine Mohallah of Jhelum city, frequently uploads his lectures and speeches on his social media accounts and has amassed 3.1 million followers on his YouTube channel .

      "summary_orig": "BAJAUR: An additional station house officer was martyred after terrorists attacked a police station in the War Mamund tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district on Saturday night, officials said. According to a police statement, a group of terrorists attacked the police station using both light and heavy weapons. They added that personnel deployed at the station quickly acted and repelled the assault. “The police personnel successfully foiled the overnight attack of militants at the War Mamund station, but Additional SHO Gul Mahmood Din was martyred after fighting bravely,” said a senior police official who visited the area on Sunday morning with his team. The official told Dawn that all the other station personnel were safe and secure following the attack. Attacks on police personnel, law enforcement agencies, and security forces have escalated across KP and Balochistan, especially after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in November 2022. Earlier this week, at least four policemen, including an SHO, were martyred as armed terrorists attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area in Dera Ismail Khan, police said. According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation. Militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire. Four policemen were martyred in the attack, and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire. 1 killed, 8 injured as mortar shell explodes Separately, in the Kardok area of Bajaur’s Salarzai tehsil, an unexploded mortar shell detonated on Sunday afternoon, killing a child and injuring eight other people, including a woman. According to initial reports and rescue sources, eight children and one woman were injured in the incident and were moved to Khar Hospital for medical treatment. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Riaz Ahmed Khan told Dawn that one of the children succumbed to their injuries, while four of the injured were referred to a Peshawar hospital for “advanced treatment”. Preliminary information suggested that the children found an unexploded mortar shell and brought it home. The shell later exploded, injuring nine people at the house. An initial investigation indicated that the incident was accidental in nature, but an investigation was launched. Local administration and security agencies cordoned off the area and began collecting evidence. Last September, at least four teenagers were killed, and two other people were injured when a mortar shell exploded in a field in Bajaur, according to police officials. Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafiq told Dawn about the incident and said that the dead and injured were transported to Khar Hospital. “Initial reports suggest that a mortar shell exploded in the field, killing the young men,” he said, adding that the deceased ranged in age between 13 and 18.",
