      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again praised both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir while reiterating his role in ending a four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May. Earlier this month, Trump had thanked PM Shehbaz and COAS Munir, his “favourite”, for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza. He had also called both of them “great people” while offering to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Today, while addressing a luncheon at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) — which is being hosted in Gyeongju, South Korea this year — Trump talked about both India and Pakistan, as well as the conflict between the countries earlier this year. “I’m doing a trade deal with India and I have great respect and love as you know for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said. “Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the Field Marshal — they have a Field Marshal. You know why he’s a Field Marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy too. “And so I know them all. And I’m reading that seven planes were shot down — they’re going at it and they’re really starting to go, and it’s a big thing. These are two nuclear nations and they’re really going at it,” Trump said. The US president went on to say that he called Modi and said: “We can’t make a trade deal with you. ‘No, no, we must make a trade deal’. I said, “No we can’t. You’re starting a war with Pakistan, we’re not gonna do it.” He added that he then had a similar conversation with Pakistan’s leadership.\n“I said, ‘We’re not gonna do trade with you because you’re fighting with India’. “And they said, ‘No no no … you should let us fight’. They both said that. You know, they’re warring. They’re strong people.” Trump then called Modi the “nicest looking guy”, and proceeded to do an impression of the Indian leader while adding that “he’s a killer” and “tough as hell”. “But after a while — and they’re good people — and after literally two days, they called up and they said, ‘We understand’. And they stopped fighting. How is that? Isn’t that amazing? “You think Biden would’ve done that? I don’t think so,” he tacked on. “Most people wouldn’t have thought of it.” He said, “We’re doing deals. So you add an extra sentence and you say, ‘You have to stop shooting at each other’. Seven planes were shot down … and they stopped the war.” The president attributed the success to his aggressive approach with tariffs , saying, “I said I was going to put 250 per cent tariffs on each country, which means that you’ll never do business … within 48 hours, we had no war, no people killed,” he said. Meanwhile, the May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.",

      "summary_orig": "A constitutional bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the Peshawar High Court (PHC) to decide PTI leader Shibli Faraz’s appeal against his disqualification as a senator. Faraz, along with former National Assembly opposition leader Omar Ayub, first approached the PHC. However, it had decided to adjourn sine die (for indefinite period) the pleas, directing the petitioners to first surrender before the competent court. Later, the PTI leaders challenged the high court’s decision before the SC. Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, a five-member CB resumed proceedings on Shibli’s appeal, after Ayub had withdrawn his during the last hearing on Monday. The bench also included Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Shakeel Ahmad. Faraz’s appeal challenges the PHC’s decision to indefinitely adjourn its hearings on his petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) notification de-seating him as the Senate opposition leader. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for Faraz, while Additional Attorney General for Pakistan (AAG) Aamir Rehman represented the state. “We were removed by the election commission with great disgrace,” Gohar contended as the hearing began. He requested that a stay order be issued on the ECP notification removing his client as a member of the upper house of Parliament, thereby halting the by-election on the vacant seat. Responding to Justice Rizvi’s question, Gohar replied that a by-election on just one Senate seat was to be held tomorrow. Justice Rizvi also wondered why Faraz was seeking a stay order on the by-election when the PTI had also nominated candidates. Subsequently, the bench dismissed Gohar’s request, stating that it would not interfere in the by-election process. A by-election to fill the general seat of the Senate from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday). PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan and Irfan Saleem are contesting against PPP’s Nisar Khan and independent candidates Taj Mohammad Afridi and Abid Khan Yousafzai. During the hearing, the ECP lawyer contended that convicts needed to surrender before a court prior to seeking any relief. Justice Mazhar asked whether the PHC had decided on the maintainability of Faraz’s petition, to which Gohar replied that the court had not disposed of the case. “We cannot do anything in this case at this point,” Justice Mandokhail remarked. AAG Rehman also stated that the PHC should have decided the case. Here, the ECP lawyer said the PHC had observed that the petitioners were seeking to evade the law. At this, Justice Mandokhail asked, “Do the petitioners come to the PHC? If they do, then why are they not arrested there?” The AAG responded that the petitioners “should have also come to the Supreme Court but they did not”. Justice Mandokhail noted that the case before the bench only pertained to rights, to which AAG Rehman replied, “Rights are directly related to punishment. The petitioner was convicted by an anti-terrorism court.” Justice Rizvi remarked, “The Peshawar High Court wrote 31 pages instead of a short order. It should have simply written a paragraph.” After hearing the arguments of all the parties, the bench struck down the PHC order to adjourn its hearings for an indefinite period and ordered the high court to hear the respondents and decide Faraz’s petition. Subsequently, the bench disposed of the PTI leader’s appeal. PHC denies relief On July 31, Faraz, along with Ayub and other lawmakers, was sentenced to 10 years in jail by a Faisalabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) for his involvement in the riots. Subsequently, he was disqualified as the Senate opposition leader under Article 63(1h) (disqualification from parliament due to conviction) of the Constitution. On Aug 25, a Faisalabad ATC again sentenced Faraz and Ayub, among others, to 10 years in prison in a case involving an attack on PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah’s residence during the May 9 protests. The PTI leaders had challenged their disqualifications before the PHC, which initially allowed them interim relief by restraining the ECP from taking any action against them. However, the PHC earlier this month denied the duo, as well as then-MNA Abdul Latif Chitrali, any relief. It ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court and adjourned the petitions for an indefinite period, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats. The court recalled multiple stay orders issued earlier, wherein the ECP , the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker were directed not to proceed further on their impugned notifications. Ayub withdrew his appeal before the SC against his denotification as the NA opposition leader, on the grounds that Mehmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated for the role. Polling on the Haripur (NA-18) seat left vacant due to Ayub’s disqualification will be held on November 23, the ECP has said. According to Gohar, Ayub’s wife would contest the by-election for the seat vacated by her husband.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday issued a strongly worded warning to the Taliban rulers in Kabul, telling them that if they wished to test Islamabad’s resolve, they should do so “at your own peril and doom”. The remarks came hours after a pre-dawn announcement by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar about the collapse of latest round of talks between the two countries in the Turkish capital that were aimed at addressing cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghan soil. “We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Asif posted on social media platform X. The defence minister said that Pakistan had indulged in talks to give peace a chance on the request of brotherly countries, who were persistently being beseeched by the rulers in Kabul, however, “venomous statements by certain Afghan officials clearly reflect the devious and splintered mindset of Taliban regime”. “Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora , with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region.” Asif further accused the Taliban rulers in Kabul of “blindly pushing Afghanistan into yet another conflict, just to retain its usurped rule and maintain the war economy that sustains them”. “Despite fully knowing their inherent limitations and hollowness of their war cries, they are beating the war drums to maintain their crumbling facade. If the Afghan Taliban regime is madly hell-bent upon ruining Afghanistan and its innocent people once again, then so be it,” he said. In his post, Asif also referred to the phrase “graveyard of empires” used for Afghanistan in connection with the historical instances of several nations failing to conquer the country. “As far as the narrative of ‘graveyard of empires’, Pakistan certainly doesn’t claim it to be an empire but Afghanistan is definitely a graveyard, surely for its own people. Never a graveyard of empires but certainly a playground of empires you have been throughout history,” Asif commented. He said the “war mongers amongst the Taliban regime, who have vested interests in the continuation of instability in the region, should know that they have probably misread our resolve and courage”. “If the Taliban regime wants to fight us, the world will Insha Allah (God willing) see that their threats are only performative circus!” UN expresses concern over talk failure In a separate development, the United Nations voiced concern over the collapse of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, hoping that the “fighting will not renew”. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric was asked about the collapse of the negotiations and whether it was a concern for the UN. “Yes, it is, of course. We very much hope that even if the talks are on pause, the fighting will not renew,” he told reporters at the regular noon briefing at UN Headquarters in New York, APP reported. From border skirmishes to talk failure Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter statements and and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from the Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha , which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. The information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists. “The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said. The statement from the information minister came hours after Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations. Earlier, when the second round of talks had begun between the two sides on Oct 25, Asif had warned that failure to reach an agreement would mean “open war”. Additional input from APP",

He said the “war mongers amongst the Taliban regime, who have vested interests in the continuation of instability in the region, should know that they have probably misread our resolve and courage”. “If the Taliban regime wants to fight us, the world will Insha Allah (God willing) see that their threats are only performative circus!” UN expresses concern over talk failure In a separate development, the United Nations voiced concern over the collapse of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, hoping that the “fighting will not renew”. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric was asked about the collapse of the negotiations and whether it was a concern for the UN. “Yes, it is, of course. We very much hope that even if the talks are on pause, the fighting will not renew,” he told reporters at the regular noon briefing at UN Headquarters in New York, APP reported. From border skirmishes to talk failure Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter statements and and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from the Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha , which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. The information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists. “The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said. The statement from the information minister came hours after Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations. Earlier, when the second round of talks had begun between the two sides on Oct 25, Asif had warned that failure to reach an agreement would mean “open war”. Additional input from APP",
      "title": "Test our resolve and capabilities at your own peril, Asif tells Kabul after talks fail in Istanbul",
      "summary": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday issued a strongly worded warning to the Taliban rulers in Kabul, telling them that if they wished to test Islamabad’s resolve, they should do so “at your own peril and doom”. The remarks came hours after a pre-dawn announcement by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar about the collapse of latest round of talks between the two countries in the Turkish capital that were aimed at addressing cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghan soil. “We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Asif posted on social media platform X. The defence minister said that Pakistan had indulged in talks to give peace a chance on the request of brotherly countries, who were persistently being beseeched by the rulers in Kabul, however, “venomous statements by certain Afghan officials clearly reflect the devious and splintered mindset of Taliban regime”. “Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora , with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region.” Asif further accused the Taliban rulers in Kabul of “blindly pushing Afghanistan into yet another conflict, just to retain its usurped rule and maintain the war economy that sustains them”. “Despite fully knowing their inherent limitations and hollowness of their war cries, they are beating the war drums to maintain their crumbling facade. If the Afghan Taliban regime is madly hell-bent upon ruining Afghanistan and its innocent people once again, then so be it,” he said. In his post, Asif also referred to the phrase “graveyard of empires” used for Afghanistan in connection with the historical instances of several nations failing to conquer the country. “As far as the narrative of ‘graveyard of empires’, Pakistan certainly doesn’t claim it to be an empire but Afghanistan is definitely a graveyard, surely for its own people.

Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024 , September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025 , Sept 10, 2025 and October 21, 2025 .

      "title_orig": "Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina warns of mass voter boycott as her party barred from election",
      "summary_orig": "Millions of supporters of Bangladesh’s Awami League will boycott next year’s national election, after the party was barred from contesting the polls, ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told Reuters on Wednesday from her exile in New Delhi. Hasina, 78, said she would not return to Bangladesh under any government formed after elections that exclude her party, and plans to remain in India, where she fled in August 2024 following a deadly student-led uprising. An interim government headed by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has governed Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has pledged to hold elections next February. “The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” Hasina said in emailed responses to Reuters . “The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works.” Hopes Awami League will be allowed to contest Bangladesh has over 126 million registered voters. The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have long dominated the country’s politics, and the BNP is widely expected to win the upcoming vote. The Election Commission suspended the Awami League’s registration in May. Earlier, the Yunus-led government banned all party activities, citing national security threats and war crimes investigations into senior Awami League leaders. “We are not asking Awami League voters to support other parties,” Hasina said. “We still hope common sense will prevail and we will be allowed to contest the election ourselves.” She did not say if she or anyone else on her behalf was holding any back-channel talks with Bangladeshi authorities to let the Awami League participate in the polls. Separately, in comments to AFP , Hasina also warned that holding elections without her party was “sowing the seeds” of further division in her country. Hasina, credited with transforming Bangladesh’s economy but accused of human rights abuses and suppressing dissent, won a fourth consecutive term in 2024. That election was boycotted by the main opposition, whose top leaders were either jailed or in exile. The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court, has concluded proceedings against Hasina, who faces charges of crimes against humanity over the violent crackdown on student protests in mid-2024. According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most from gunfire by security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence. Prosecutors also allege she oversaw enforced disappearances and torture of opposition activists through clandestine detention centres run by security agencies. A verdict is expected on November 13. Hasina denied the charges, saying she was not personally involved in the use of lethal force or other alleged crimes. “These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” she said. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself.” While, in written responses to AFP , Hasina also condemned her crimes against humanity trial as a “jurisprudential joke” No plans to return home yet Despite the political turmoil, Hasina said the Awami League would eventually return to play a role in Bangladesh’s future — whether in government or opposition — and that her family need not lead it. Her son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed, who lives in Washington, told Reuters last year he might consider leading the party if asked. “It’s really not about me or my family,” Hasina said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability. No single person or family defines our country’s future.“ Hasina, whose father and three brothers were killed in a 1975 military coup while she and her sister were abroad, said she lives freely in Delhi but remains cautious given her family’s violent history. A few months ago, a Reuters reporter saw Hasina taking a quiet stroll through Delhi’s historic Lodhi Garden, accompanied by two individuals who appeared to be her personal security detail. She acknowledged passersby with a nod as some recognised her. “I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” she said. Hasina’s departure triggered targeted violence against Awami League workers, though the streets have since remained largely calm. However, clashes erupted earlier this month during the signing of a charter for state reform. ‘Open fire on crowds’ Hasina was defended by a state-appointed lawyer, but said she would only recognise an “impartial” process, such as one at the ICC. “The charge that I personally directed security forces to open fire on crowds is bogus,” she told AFP , although she admitted that “some mistakes were certainly made within the chain of command”. “But on the whole, the decisions made by senior government officials were proportionate in nature, made in good faith and intended to minimise the loss of life.” The prosecution, who insist the trial was fair, have played audio tapes verified by police that suggested Hasina directly ordered her security forces to “use lethal weapons” against protesters. Hasina claimed the recordings had been “taken out of context”. She also pointed to a crackdown on her loyalists since her fall, including when security forces in February launched “ Operation Devil Hunt ”, arresting thousands accused of trying to “destabilise” the country. At the same time, she gave no information on the fate of the hundreds, if not thousands, of missing victims reported to have vanished into secret detention centres during her rule. Earlier this month, lawyers for the Awami League requested that the ICC investigate reported “retaliatory violence”. This includes allegations of “beatings and lynchings” which have “no realistic prospect” of being prosecuted in Bangladesh, senior British barrister Steven Powles KC said in a statement. As for the future, when asked by AFP if she plans a return to politics, Hasina replied: “My priority is the welfare and stability of Bangladesh.”",

An interim government headed by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has governed Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has pledged to hold elections next February. “The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” Hasina said in emailed responses to Reuters . “The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works.” Hopes Awami League will be allowed to contest Bangladesh has over 126 million registered voters. The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have long dominated the country’s politics, and the BNP is widely expected to win the upcoming vote. The Election Commission suspended the Awami League’s registration in May. Earlier, the Yunus-led government banned all party activities, citing national security threats and war crimes investigations into senior Awami League leaders. “We are not asking Awami League voters to support other parties,” Hasina said. “We still hope common sense will prevail and we will be allowed to contest the election ourselves.” She did not say if she or anyone else on her behalf was holding any back-channel talks with Bangladeshi authorities to let the Awami League participate in the polls. Separately, in comments to AFP , Hasina also warned that holding elections without her party was “sowing the seeds” of further division in her country. Hasina, credited with transforming Bangladesh’s economy but accused of human rights abuses and suppressing dissent, won a fourth consecutive term in 2024. That election was boycotted by the main opposition, whose top leaders were either jailed or in exile. The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court, has concluded proceedings against Hasina, who faces charges of crimes against humanity over the violent crackdown on student protests in mid-2024. According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most from gunfire by security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence. Prosecutors also allege she oversaw enforced disappearances and torture of opposition activists through clandestine detention centres run by security agencies. A verdict is expected on November 13. Hasina denied the charges, saying she was not personally involved in the use of lethal force or other alleged crimes. “These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” she said. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself.” While, in written responses to AFP , Hasina also condemned her crimes against humanity trial as a “jurisprudential joke” No plans to return home yet Despite the political turmoil, Hasina said the Awami League would eventually return to play a role in Bangladesh’s future — whether in government or opposition — and that her family need not lead it. Her son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed, who lives in Washington, told Reuters last year he might consider leading the party if asked. “It’s really not about me or my family,” Hasina said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability. No single person or family defines our country’s future.“ Hasina, whose father and three brothers were killed in a 1975 military coup while she and her sister were abroad, said she lives freely in Delhi but remains cautious given her family’s violent history. A few months ago, a Reuters reporter saw Hasina taking a quiet stroll through Delhi’s historic Lodhi Garden, accompanied by two individuals who appeared to be her personal security detail. She acknowledged passersby with a nod as some recognised her. “I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” she said. Hasina’s departure triggered targeted violence against Awami League workers, though the streets have since remained largely calm. However, clashes erupted earlier this month during the signing of a charter for state reform. ‘Open fire on crowds’ Hasina was defended by a state-appointed lawyer, but said she would only recognise an “impartial” process, such as one at the ICC. “The charge that I personally directed security forces to open fire on crowds is bogus,” she told AFP , although she admitted that “some mistakes were certainly made within the chain of command”. “But on the whole, the decisions made by senior government officials were proportionate in nature, made in good faith and intended to minimise the loss of life.” The prosecution, who insist the trial was fair, have played audio tapes verified by police that suggested Hasina directly ordered her security forces to “use lethal weapons” against protesters. Hasina claimed the recordings had been “taken out of context”. She also pointed to a crackdown on her loyalists since her fall, including when security forces in February launched “ Operation Devil Hunt ”, arresting thousands accused of trying to “destabilise” the country. At the same time, she gave no information on the fate of the hundreds, if not thousands, of missing victims reported to have vanished into secret detention centres during her rule. Earlier this month, lawyers for the Awami League requested that the ICC investigate reported “retaliatory violence”. This includes allegations of “beatings and lynchings” which have “no realistic prospect” of being prosecuted in Bangladesh, senior British barrister Steven Powles KC said in a statement. As for the future, when asked by AFP if she plans a return to politics, Hasina replied: “My priority is the welfare and stability of Bangladesh.”",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump said on Wednesday “nothing” would jeopardise the ceasefire in Gaza, after Israel carried out air strikes on the Palestinian territory accusing Hamas of violating the truce, which the group denied. Gaza’s civil defence agency said that Israeli attacks had killed at least 50 people, including 22 children, and wounded around 200. “At least 50 killed, including 22 children and a number of women and children, as a result of the ongoing Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since last night,” Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the agency, told AFP . Around 200 people were wounded “in a clear and flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement”, he said, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic and terrifying”. Trump defended Israel’s actions on Wednesday, saying it “should hit back” if Israeli soldiers were killed, but added that “nothing’s going to jeopardise” to truce. “They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his tour of Asia. US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire was holding despite the “skirmishes”. “We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an IDF soldier …\nbut I think the president’s peace is going to hold,” he said. A Palestinian man inspects the site of an overnight Israeli strike on a house in Gaza City on Oct 29, 2025. — Reuters Yesterday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered “ powerful strikes ” on Gaza, after his Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli troops in the enclave. While Katz did not say where the troops were attacked, Hamas said its fighters had “no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah” and reaffirmed its commitment to the US-brokered ceasefire . The Israeli military said today that a soldier was killed during fighting in southern Gaza. Escalations Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least three strikes were carried out, while the territory’s main Al Shifa hospital said one hit its backyard. Al Awda Hospital said it had received several bodies, including those of four children, killed in the bombing of Gaza’s central Nuseirat refugee camp. Hamas announced it would delay handing over the body of another hostage, due on Tuesday, saying Israeli “escalation will hinder the search, excavation, and recovery of the bodies”. A row over the last remaining bodies of deceased hostages has threatened to derail the ceasefire agreement. Israel accuses Hamas of reneging by not returning them, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate the remains buried in Gaza’s war-ravaged ruins. Hamas later said on Telegram it had found the bodies of two hostages on Tuesday, but did not specify when it would hand them over. ‘Act decisively’ Hamas came under mounting pressure on Monday after it returned the partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce. Hamas had said the remains were the 16th of 28 hostage bodies it had agreed to return under the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on October 10. But Israeli forensic examination determined Hamas had in fact handed over partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to Netanyahu’s office. Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian accused Hamas of staging the discovery of the remains. “Hamas dug a hole in the ground yesterday, placed the partial remains …\ninside of it, covered it back up with dirt, and handed it over to the Red Cross,” she told journalists. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the government to “act decisively against these violations” and accused Hamas of knowing the location of the missing hostages. ‘We want to rest’ On the ground in Gaza, 60-year-old Abdul-Hayy al-Hajj Ahmed told AFP he was afraid the bombing would start again. “Now they accuse Hamas of stalling, and that is a pretext for renewed escalation and war,” he said. “We want to rest. I believe the war will come back. “ Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected claims the group knows where the remaining bodies are, arguing that Israel’s two-year military campaign had left locations unrecognisable. “The movement (Hamas) is determined to hand over the bodies of the Israeli captives as soon as possible once they are located,” he told AFP . The Palestinian group has already returned all 20 living hostages as agreed in the ceasefire deal. Hamas members carry a dead body during a search for deceased hostages seized by Hamas during the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel, in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, on Oct 28, 2025. — Reuters Hamas’s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s subsequent relentless assault on Gaza killed at least 68,531 people, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry. Despite the ceasefire, the toll has continued to climb as more bodies are found under the rubble.",

      "title_orig": "Pak-Afghan talks in Istanbul failed to bring about any workable solution, says information minister",
      "summary_orig": "Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said early on Wednesday that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”, adding that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. After days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, the two countries had come together for a dialogue in Doha which had resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks between the two sides had begun in the Turkish capital. In a post on social media platform X early on Wednesday, the information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by Indian-abetted Fitna-al-Khawarij and Indian proxy Fitna-al-Hindustan . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said. “Since the Taliban regime bears no responsibility towards the people of Afghanistan and thrives on a war economy, it desires to drag and mire the Afghan people into a needless war,” he said. The minister asserted that Pakistan had always desired, advocated, and sacrificed for the peace and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan. “In the same spirit, Pakistan has held countless rounds of talks and parleys with the Afghan Taliban regime but, unfortunately, they have always remained indifferent to Pakistan’s losses. Sadly, after sustaining such huge losses of men and material for four long years, Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” he said. He said that in an effort to “give peace a chance” and at the request of Qatar and Turkiye, Pakistan engaged with the Afghan Taliban earlier in Doha and then in Istanbul on a single-point agenda — soliciting action by the Afghan Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan soil by terrorist organisations as a “training-cum-logistics base and jump off point for terrorist activities in Pakistan”. He thanked Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating this dialogue and their efforts in convincing Kabul to “desist from the use of terror proxies as leverage against Pakistan”, but said that the neighbouring country repeatedly deviated from the core issue. “Over the last four days of dialogue, the Afghan Taliban delegation repeatedly agreed to Pakistan’s logical and legitimate demand for credible and decisive action against [militant] organisations and terrorists. “Sufficient and irrefutable evidence was provided by Pakistan which was acknowledged by Afghan Taliban and the hosts, however, regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurance,” the minister said. “The Afghan side kept deviating from the core issue, evading the key point upon which the dialogue process was initiated. Instead of accepting any responsibility, the Afghan Taliban resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses. The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution,” he said. The minister again thanked the government of Qatar, Turkiye as well as those of other friendly states for their efforts to “bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of terrorism, for the prosperity and security of the two countries and the region at large”. “The security of its people is of paramount importance to Pakistan. We will continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from the menace of terrorism and assure them that the government of Pakistan will continue to employ all the resources which are required in this regard to decimate the terrorists, their sanctuaries, their abetters and supporters,” he said. The statement from the information minister came hours after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath ’, the defence minister stated that negotiators had backpedalled on an agreement “four or five times” after receiving instructions from Kabul. “Whenever we got close to an agreement — either in the last four days or last week — when negotiators reported to Kabul, then there was intervention and the agreement was withdrawn,” he said. “I believe that the negotiations were sabotaged. We had an agreement, but then they called Kabul and backpedalled from the deal.” “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi,” he added. The defence minister believed that the Kabul government lacked authority, as it had been “penetrated” by India, which was using Afghanistan to stage a proxy war against Pakistan. “India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,” Asif said. “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.” When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out. “They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists.” “There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said. Turkiye, Qatar step in to salvage talks On Tuesday, Turkish and Qatari mediators had tried to salvage negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban regime after the talks briefly collapsed over what officials described as “unbridgeable differences”. A Pakistani security source told reporters that the talks had “collapsed following the Afghan Taliban’s lack of commitment and seriousness to address terrorism-related issues, as well as their refusal to provide any written guarantees”. From the Afghan side, journalists were informed that the negotiations had ended “inconclusively”, with officials in Kabul accusing the Pakistani delegation of “improper conduct” and making “demands that are unacceptable to Afghanistan”. However, within hours of those reports emerging, the rupture had reportedly been repaired. By noon negotiators were back at the table following intense diplomatic efforts by Turkish and Qatari mediators, who pressed both sides to return for what officials described as a “final attempt” to achieve at least a limited agreement. “The negotiations in Istanbul have resumed at the insistence of the host country and the other mediator,” a Pakistani official confirmed, adding that talks continued late into the evening. Diplomatic sources said the Afghan Taliban delegation’s stance had shifted multiple times over the course of four days, often due to fresh instructions from Kabul. “They came close to a deal four or five times,” one official said, “but each time, new guidance from Afghanistan scuttled the progress.” The divisions within the Taliban’s ranks, split among factions based in Kandahar, Kabul, and Khost was cited as another reason. “If the Kandahar group agrees at some point, the differences of the Kabul group come to the fore,” a source briefed on the negotiations said. Adding to the complications, the Afghan side reportedly introduced a new demand, insisting that Pakistan should prevent US drones from entering Afghan airspace from Pakistani territory. Observers noted the irony that many of those drones originated from Qatar, which itself is mediating the Istanbul dialogue. Despite the latest setback, Turkish and Qatari officials were said to have worked intensively to keep the process alive, warning both sides that the collapse of the talks could lead to renewed border tensions. Pak­istani officials reiterated their long-standing position that no agreement would be acceptable without verifia­ble guarantees that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against Pakistan. “Our stance has been consi­stent,” a senior security source said. “Without concrete assurances on counterterrorism, there can be no deal.”",

      "title_en": "Pak-Afghan talks in Istanbul failed to bring about any workable solution, says information minister",
      "summary_en": "Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said early on Wednesday that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”, adding that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. After days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, the two countries had come together for a dialogue in Doha which had resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks between the two sides had begun in the Turkish capital. In a post on social media platform X early on Wednesday, the information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by Indian-abetted Fitna-al-Khawarij and Indian proxy Fitna-al-Hindustan . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said. “Since the Taliban regime bears no responsibility towards the people of Afghanistan and thrives on a war economy, it desires to drag and mire the Afghan people into a needless war,” he said. The minister asserted that Pakistan had always desired, advocated, and sacrificed for the peace and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan. “In the same spirit, Pakistan has held countless rounds of talks and parleys with the Afghan Taliban regime but, unfortunately, they have always remained indifferent to Pakistan’s losses. Sadly, after sustaining such huge losses of men and material for four long years, Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” he said. He said that in an effort to “give peace a chance” and at the request of Qatar and Turkiye, Pakistan engaged with the Afghan Taliban earlier in Doha and then in Istanbul on a single-point agenda — soliciting action by the Afghan Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan soil by terrorist organisations as a “training-cum-logistics base and jump off point for terrorist activities in Pakistan”. He thanked Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating this dialogue and their efforts in convincing Kabul to “desist from the use of terror proxies as leverage against Pakistan”, but said that the neighbouring country repeatedly deviated from the core issue. “Over the last four days of dialogue, the Afghan Taliban delegation repeatedly agreed to Pakistan’s logical and legitimate demand for credible and decisive action against [militant] organisations and terrorists. “Sufficient and irrefutable evidence was provided by Pakistan which was acknowledged by Afghan Taliban and the hosts, however, regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurance,” the minister said. “The Afghan side kept deviating from the core issue, evading the key point upon which the dialogue process was initiated. Instead of accepting any responsibility, the Afghan Taliban resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses. The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution,” he said. The minister again thanked the government of Qatar, Turkiye as well as those of other friendly states for their efforts to “bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of terrorism, for the prosperity and security of the two countries and the region at large”. “The security of its people is of paramount importance to Pakistan. We will continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from the menace of terrorism and assure them that the government of Pakistan will continue to employ all the resources which are required in this regard to decimate the terrorists, their sanctuaries, their abetters and supporters,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped out on attending an Asean summit in Malaysia to avoid broaching the issue of Pakistan in a possible meeting with United States President Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Modi had backtracked from his proposed visit to Malaysia over the weekend to attend an Asean summit and opted to join the discussions “virtually” instead. The opposition Congress party had blamed the change of plan on Modi’s fear of meeting Trump. The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, was held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur. “Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stayed away from a regional leaders summit in Malaysia this week to avoid meeting US President Donald Trump and having a possible discussion about Pakistan,” people familiar with the matter said. “Officials in the government were apprehensive that Trump would repeat his claim that he mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day armed conflict in May, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private,” Bloomberg reported about the alleged actual reason behind the skipping out on the summit. It added that Modi was campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the crucial Bihar election and he “didn’t want to risk a meeting with Trump that could end up being embarrassing for the prime minister, the people said. “Modi is the main face of his party’s campaign in Bihar state and any comments by Trump, especially regarding Pakistan, could be used by the prime minister’s rivals against him and damage his party’s chances at the polls, they said.” Bloomberg similarly reported in August that Modi had turned down an invitation from Trump to visit the White House over concern that he would set up a meeting with Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil. Also fueling the tensions has been Trump’s insistence of ending the May conflict between Pakistan and India — something that New Delhi adamantly refuses still. Earlier today, Trump again stated that seven aircraft were shot down during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India in May. Tensions between Pakistan and India escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” which targeted sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory operation called “Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.",

      "summary_orig": "PAKISTAN has banned the TLP again. It is the second time in four years that the violent religio-political group has been outlawed. The action has been taken by the federal government after the group had turned Lahore into a virtual battlefield, destroying public property and attacking law-enforcement agencies. Several people, including policemen, were killed and wounded. It was the worst incident of violence perpetrated by a religious group in Lahore in recent times. The government says the state will not succumb to any kind of threat or blackmail this time. The crackdown on the group, which has strong mass support in Punjab, has been intensive. But given its past record of appeasement, there are still doubts over the seriousness of the latest government action. There is also the question of the policy dealing with violent extremism that is now so deeply entrenched in society. The TLP is just a symptom of a menace that threatens our social fabric and the state’s unity. The rise of religious extremism in Pakistan is, to a large extent, the result of the state’s own policies. In fact, the TLP is a product of the impunity allowed by the state to extremist ideology. Has there been a genuine shift in state policy towards religious extremism? Just banning the TLP won’t solve the problem of religious extremism in the country. There is no indication of the state willing to completely root out violent extremism. It is necessary to address the root causes of religious extremism in the country. A TLP ban in 2021 lasted for only a few months before the state caved in under pressure of the extremist group. Not only was the ban lifted, the party, which was accused of mutiny and killing policemen, was allowed to participate in the general elections. It emerged as the country’s fourth largest party in terms of the number of votes, with its main support in Punjab. That shows how deeply religious extremism has seeped into the mainstream. A party which was born of a movement in support of the killer of a governor of Punjab, who was accused falsely of blasphemy and murdered in 2011, has turned into a major political force in Pakistan’s biggest and most powerful province. It could not have happened without the state allowing it impunity. The group saw a meteoric rise after its infamous dharna in Islamabad in 2017 that left the federal capital paralysed for more than a month over a law passed by parliament. It is curious that the state appeared helpless before a mob of few hundreds challenging parliament and the government’s writ. The dharna ended after the administration accepted their demands. Interestingly, the agreement also had the signature of a senior ISI officer. A Supreme Court observation in the case questioned the role of the intelligence agency in the TLP protest. It became quite a scandal when a picture of a senior army officer distributing money among the dispersing crowds after the agreement appeared in the media. Most alarming was the role of the TLP in weaponising the blasphemy law. There has been a marked increase in mob lynchings on false blasphemy accusations. The lynching of a Sri Lankan employee at a garment factory in Sialkot some years ago, the burning to death of a man in Swat, as well as the shooting of a doctor by a police officer in Mirpurkhas are just a few examples of the misuse of blasphemy laws. There is also question about the Election Commission’s decision to not only register a group with a violent record as a political party but to also allow it to contest elections. The decision violated the law. With its more extremist religious ideology, the TLP managed to eat into the vote bank of other moderate mainstream religio-political parties. Now the government has decided to ban the TLP and delist it as a political party. The reference is being sent to the Supreme Court for its approval, and it could be that the court won’t object to the government’s action. But there is still the question of whether merely banning the party can tackle the issue of violent religious extremism. The government action against the TLP was in response to the group’s violent protests and not because of its extremist ideology and attacks on religious minorities and their places worship, which have become rampant particularly in Punjab. All that has been happening for a long time without any action by the administration against the perpetrators. Just banning a party will not be effective if the state is not fully committed to enforcing the law against all religious extremist forces. The real issue is not the group but the extremist ideology it espouses. We have many examples of banned outfits resurfacing under different names. That could also happen in the TLP’s case. It is necessary to address the root causes of religious extremism in the country. Support for the TLP and other extremist groups largely come from semi-educated and deprived sections of society, which are easily swayed. It does not mean, however, that other sections are not influenced as well by radical groups. A country where over 40 per cent of the population live below the poverty line and 25 million children are out of school provides fertile ground for extremist religious groups to mobilise support. Moreover, the TLP and other extremist groups try to legitimise their actions through some faulty provisions in the law. Exploitation of religion for political gains also provides sustenance to extremist groups. If the state is sincere about eradicating religious extremism, it needs to address socioeconomic issues. The growing population is adding to the ranks of the unemployed in the country, which means it is also providing easily swayed recruits to extremist groups. Our education system itself creates extremist mindsets. Just banning the TLP without addressing these issues is not going to solve the problem of religious extremism.

      "summary": "QUETTA: One security official was martyred and three others were injured in an armed attack on a security post in the Buleda area of Kech district on Tuesday. Officials said that unidentified gunmen riding motorcycles opened indiscriminate fire on a check post of Frontier Corps in the Reko area of Buleda. As a result, one FC man lost his life while three others sustained injuries. The security personnel deployed at the post retur­ned fire in retaliation, but the attackers managed to escape. Following the incident, additional security forces rushed to the site and shif­ted the body and injured personnel to a nearby government health facility. Security forces launch search operation to trace assailants Officials said that a search operation has been launched in the area to trace the attackers invol­ved in the incident. Earlier, police had foiled an attempt by armed militants to storm a police station in Noshki late on Sunday evening. Officials said that a group of militants hurled a hand grenade at the police station and opened fire with automatic weapons. The grenade exploded near the building, but no casualties were reported. Police personnel immediately retaliated, returning fire after taking positions. The exchange of fire lasted for more than half an hour. “A police team successfully foiled the militants’ attempt to enter the station after a fierce gun battle,” a senior police officer said, adding that the attackers fled the area after facing resistance.

Sources told Dawn that the names of Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Chaudhry Yasin, Faisal Rathore and Sardar Yaqub are under consideration for the top slot. Under the AJK Constitution, the movers of a no-confidence resolution are required to name a successor to the sitting prime minister. The no-trust motion will be submitted soon after the PPP finalises its candidate. A PPP source said there was ‘no hurry’ to form the new government, adding that the PML-N’s decision not to join the treasury benches was “its democratic right”. The party insists it will move ahead “with consensus”. According to sources, a detailed charge sheet highlighting the AJK prime minister’s alleged governance failures has been prepared. These complaints include his failure to consult cabinet members, his harsh attitude toward bureaucracy, and cuts to development funds for ministers and assembly members. His unilateral decisions and weak handling of public protests have reportedly deepened dissatisfaction within the coalition. In a related development, Faryal Talpur, head of the PPP’s women wing and the AJK political affairs wing, called on AJK President Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry to seek support from six members of the forward bloc belonging to his group. She discussed matters pertaining to formation of the new government in Azad Kashmir during the meeting. Speaking to Dawn , PML-N leader Mushtaq Minhas clarified that if the Azad Jammu and Kashmir prime minister resigns, the party will not vote for the PPP candidate, though it will support a no-confidence motion, if tabled. He said the PML-N had been seeking Anwarul Haq’s removal for the past six months over governance concerns. PTI to file references Meanwhile, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has decided to file references against its defected members who have joined other parties or plan to support the no-confidence motion. PTI AJK President Abdul Qayyum Niazi held consultations with Opposition Leader Khawaja Farooq Ahmed and summoned the party’s legal team. According to sources, references will be filed under Section 30 of the Elections Act 2020, which allows the disqualification of members who switch parties. PTI had earlier sent a reference to the speaker against four members — Akmal Sargala, Rafiq Nayyar, and Ali Shan Soni among them. Now, 12 members of the PTI forward bloc who have joined the PPP could face disqualification if they vote for the no-confidence motion. Published in Dawn, October 29th, 2025",
