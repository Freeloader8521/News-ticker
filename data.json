      "summary_orig": "The White House said on Thursday that diplomacy is President Donald Trump’s first choice for dealing with Iran and he will wait to see whether a deal can be struck at high-stakes talks , but also warned that he has military options at his disposal. Final preparations were under way for Friday’s meeting in Oman amid heightened tensions as the US builds up forces in the Middle East, which Trump has called a massive “ armada ,” and regional players seek to avert what many fear could escalate into a wider war. The talks were set to go ahead even though the two sides have had differences over the agenda, and that has increased doubts about the prospects for a deal. Trump has threatened to carry out strikes on Iran if an agreement cannot be reached. View this post on Instagram The US previously said it wanted the discussions to include Iran’s missile arsenal and other issues, while Tehran has insisted on focusing exclusively on its disputed nuclear program. It was unclear whether that disagreement had been resolved. “The president’s diplomacy is always his first option when it comes to dealing with countries all around the world, whether it’s our allies or our adversaries,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters when asked about the coming talks. She reiterated Trump’s position that “zero nuclear capability is something he’s been very explicit about” in his demands for Iran. “He wants to see if a deal can be struck,” Leavitt said. “And while these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at his disposal, aside from diplomacy, as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world.” Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi departed for Oman on Thursday. His spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Tehran would engage “with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue.” “We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness,” Baghaei added. Araqchi is expected to meet in Muscat with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser. On the eve of the talks, Iran’s state-run Press TV said “one of the country’s most advanced long-range ballistic missile(s),” the Khorramshahr 4, has been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guards underground missile sites. The missile has a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) and is capable of carrying 1,500-kg (3,300-pound) warhead, it added. The US has pressed Iran to accept a much more limited range for its missiles. Mutual threats Trump’s blunt warnings and Iran’s vows of counter-strikes have spurred regional governments’ efforts to calm the situation. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said his government was working hard to prevent US-Iran tensions from tipping the Middle East into a new conflict. He has spent years cultivating a close relationship with Trump while expanding Ankara’s diplomatic influence across the region. Speaking to reporters on a return flight from a visit to Egypt, Erdogan added that talks at the level of the US and Iranian leadership would be helpful after lower-level nuclear negotiations due in Oman on Friday, according to a transcript of his comments shared by his office on Thursday. Tensions ratcheted up this week amid uncertainty over the location and format for the talks, which will follow Tehran’s bloody crackdown on street protests last month. Asked on Wednesday whether Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be worried, Trump told NBC News: “I would say he should be very worried. Yeah, he should be.” After Trump spoke, US and Iranian officials said the two sides had agreed to shift the talks’ location to Muscat after initially accepting Istanbul. At a press conference in Doha, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Thursday that “great concern” had been expressed about potential escalation in the conflict with Iran during his meetings with officials in a visit to the Gulf region. He urged Iran to end what he called aggression and help bring stability to the region. Gulf Arab states fear that Iran will carry out its threat to target US bases on their territory if the United States attacks the Islamic Republic. China, meanwhile, said it supported Iran’s legitimate right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and opposed the “threat of force and sanction pressure.” Trump warns of ‘bad things’ if no Iran deal reached Iran has said the talks must be confined to its long-running nuclear dispute with Western powers. But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that talks would have to include the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles, its support for armed proxy groups around the Middle East and its treatment of its own people, besides nuclear issues. Iranian sources say the US is demanding Tehran limit the range of Iran’s missiles to 500 km (310 miles). Tehran’s regional sway has been weakened by Israel’s attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - and by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Iran says its nuclear activities are meant for peaceful, not military purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons. The US has sent thousands of troops to the Middle East, as well as an aircraft carrier, other warships, fighter jets, spy planes and air-refueling tankers. Trump has warned that “bad things“ would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.",

This must include the kinetic factor, as evidenced by Operation Radd-ul-Fitna 1 , which the authorities launched after last week’s deadly terrorist attacks in the province. However, beyond this, there must be complementary legal actions, as well as political and socioeconomic steps to address both the immediate threat of separatist violence and the underlying factors that fuel it. The need to recalibrate the national counterterrorism policy to address fresh threats has been recently mentioned in this space. Yet the state must also mount a campaign on the foreign front to confront inimical actors in the region who appear to be playing a role in fuelling terrorism in both Balochistan and KP. In this regard, Pakistan has urged the UN Security Council to “act swiftly” and list the BLA as a terrorist outfit. The BLA and other separatist terrorist groups have already been proscribed in Pakistan, while the US and UK have taken similar steps. But if the UNSC were to formally proscribe these groups, it would help in tightening the dragnet around them and squeezing their finances, while those foreign actors who aid them would have to think twice about providing material support to globally proscribed terrorists. While the Taliban regime in Kabul provides a safe haven for the banned TTP, the state believes that India supports Baloch groups in their efforts to destabilise Pakistan. Therefore, the state must step up its campaign at the UN and other international forums to ensure that no foreign player is able to aid these bloodthirsty outfits. In the past, Pakistan has provided several dossiers containing evidence of Indian involvement in terrorist activities within its borders. A similar effort is needed now to help end foreign interference in Balochistan. Yet simply proscribing groups will not be enough. For example, Pakistan has over the decades banned several terrorist and sectarian groups. While some have been dismantled, others continue to operate with lower profiles. Therefore, it is important to pursue legal steps against the individuals involved in terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Their finances must be cut off, and their arms supply severed. These groups claim to fight for the ‘Baloch cause’, yet are involved in the heinous crimes of murdering innocent Baloch and non-Baloch civilians. But as we have said before, the kinetic and legal battle against terrorism in Balochistan must be supported by efforts to uplift the socioeconomic profile of the province, as well as creating the groundwork for an inclusive democratic process where all non-violent groups that respect the Constitution can work to politically address Balochistan’s problems.

While the Taliban regime in Kabul provides a safe haven for the banned TTP, the state believes that India supports Baloch groups in their efforts to destabilise Pakistan. Therefore, the state must step up its campaign at the UN and other international forums to ensure that no foreign player is able to aid these bloodthirsty outfits. In the past, Pakistan has provided several dossiers containing evidence of Indian involvement in terrorist activities within its borders. A similar effort is needed now to help end foreign interference in Balochistan. Yet simply proscribing groups will not be enough. For example, Pakistan has over the decades banned several terrorist and sectarian groups. While some have been dismantled, others continue to operate with lower profiles. Therefore, it is important to pursue legal steps against the individuals involved in terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Their finances must be cut off, and their arms supply severed. These groups claim to fight for the ‘Baloch cause’, yet are involved in the heinous crimes of murdering innocent Baloch and non-Baloch civilians. But as we have said before, the kinetic and legal battle against terrorism in Balochistan must be supported by efforts to uplift the socioeconomic profile of the province, as well as creating the groundwork for an inclusive democratic process where all non-violent groups that respect the Constitution can work to politically address Balochistan’s problems.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has protested against the proposed positive quarterly tariff adjustments (QTA) sought by power distribution companies (Discos), arguing that the claims are based on flawed data and that costs should, in fact, have declined. In a letter to Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Leghari and the chairman and members of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), FPCCI Research Team Head Rehan Javed said a select group of consumers was given a benefit of Rs1.53 billion under a cheaper incremental consumption package in December 2025, but this resulted in an additional burden of about Rs6.6bn on consumers nationwide. He said Discos were claiming a net national quarterly adjustment of Rs10.83bn for the second quarter of FY26 after accounting for capacity charges, transmission and use-of-system charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, the impact of transmission and distribution losses on fuel cost adjustment, and the incremental consumption package. Under Nepra’s uniform tariff mechanism, this amount would be socialised across about 28.75 billion units of national electricity sales for the quarter, translating into a system-wide impact of around 38 paise per unit. While Disco-wise adjustments ranged from a negative Rs5.1bn to a positive Rs5.6bn, these variations fully offset each other at the national level, leaving the consolidated per unit impact as the only outcome relevant for consumers. Mr Javed contended that a material portion of the quarterly adjustment did not stem from unavoidable cost variations but arose directly from the defective design of the incremental consumption package. He said the issue had been raised repeatedly in regulatory hearings, written submissions and stakeholder engagements, but continued implementation without correction raised serious concerns about policy responsiveness and governance. He said system data showed that national electricity demand had remained broadly flat at around 2,400-2,500 gigawatt hours per month from July 2025 onwards. Sales stood at about 2,439 GWh in Nov 2025 and 2,431 GWh in Dec 2025, confirming that no incremental demand had been generated. Despite this, around 600 GWh in Dec 2025 was billed at a discounted rate of Rs11.02 per unit below the normal tariff, using an outdated reference consumption of about 1,900 GWh from Dec 2023. As a result, base-load consumption was misclassified as incremental, and existing demand was merely repriced at a lower tariff, he said. While the reported benefit to selected industrial consumers, mainly in B3 and B4 categories, amounted to about Rs1.533bn, the resulting revenue shortfall was estimated at around Rs6.6bn. This shortfall neither reduced capacity payments nor increased system utilisation, nor did it generate additional energy sales, he said, adding that it would instead be passed on through quarterly adjustments and socialised across the entire consumer base, including those who received no benefit from the package. Mr Javed argued that had this Rs6.6bn revenue loss not occurred and the same energy been sold at the full tariff, the quarterly adjustment would have been lower by about 23 paise per unit. The Q2 adjustment of 38 paise per unit would then have fallen to roughly 15 paise per unit, demonstrating that more than half of the impact was policy-induced. Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: British police have charged three more men in an investigation into a series of violent incidents targeting Pakistani dissidents in the United Kingdom, according to a statement released by the Metropolitan Police on Wednesday night. The latest charges bring the total number of people arrested in connection with the investigation to seven. The charges relate to attacks on properties in Cambridge and Chesham in late December 2025 and form part of a wider counter-terrorism investigation being led by Counter Terrorism Policing London. Although the police statement did not name the victims, earlier reports indicate that the arrests are linked to attacks reported by former Imran Khan adviser Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber-blogger Adil Raja. Adil Raja’s home was targeted on December 24, 2025, while Shahzad Akbar’s residence was attacked on December 24 and 31, 2025, and again on January 10, 2026. Following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service, Asaf Afsar, 38, of Birmingham; Liam McGarry, 24, of Warwickshire; and Mark Regan, 52, also of Birmingham, were charged on February 4 with conspiracy to assault and to occasion bodily harm. Mr Afsar and Mr Regan face two counts each, linked to incidents in both Chesham and Cambridge on December 24, 2025. Mr McGarry was charged with one count relating to the Cambridge incident on the same date. All three men were in police custody and appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. The men were arrested a day earlier, on February 3, as part of what police described as an “ongoing investigation” into alleged coordinated attacks. Two other men, aged 55 and 30, were also arrested in Birmingham and London, respectively, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault and criminal damage. Both have since been released on bail until May while inquiries continue. Police said the arrests in the West Midlands and Warwickshire were carried out with support from local forces and Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. Officers also conducted five searches across the West Midlands, Warwickshire and London. The latest charges bring the total number of people charged in the investigation to seven.

      "summary_orig": "MANDLA Mandela, grandson of Nelson Mandela, joins members of the Global Sumud Flotilla activist group.—Reuters • Last year, Israel had stopped 40 boats of the Global Sumud Flotilla from reaching the occupied territory • UN warns violence by Israeli settlers against West Bank residents ‘peaked in January’, 700 Palestinians displaced • NGO says settlers harassing, evicting Palestinians ‘with IDF, govt backing’ JOHANNESBURG/RAMAL­LAH: Activists behind a flotilla intercepted at sea by Israel last year while trying to bring aid to Gaza will try again this year, expecting more than twice as many boats carrying up to 1,000 medics, they said on Thursday. The Israeli military halted the roughly 40 boats in the Global Sumud Flotilla in October as they attempted to reach blockaded Gaza, arresting Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and more than 450 other participants. Organisers, who gathered at the foundation of the late South African leader Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg on Wednesday, said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt. “It is a cause … for those that want to rise and stand for justice and dignity for all,” Mandela’s grandson Mandla Mandela, who was among activists detained last time, told the gathering. “We want to mobilise the … global community to join forces with us.” Israeli officials repeatedly denou­nced last year’s mission, and previous smaller-scale attempts to reach Gaza by sea, as publicity stunts. Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents. Palestinians and international aid bodies say supplies reaching the enclave are still insufficient, despite a ceasefire reached in October which included guarantees of increased aid. Following the ceasefire, Israeli forces now control more than 53 per cent of Gaza Strip where they have ordered residents out. Nearly the entire population is crowded into a narrow strip along the coast, mostly living in makeshift tents and damaged buildings. If the flotilla is blocked again, the activists said it would still be worth it to highlight Gaza’s plight. “We may not have reached Gaza physically, (but) we have reached … the people in Gaza,” said one of the activists, Susan Abdallah. “They know that we care, that we will not stop at anything until we actually break the siege.” Settler attacks cause record displacement Violence and harassment by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank displaced nearly 700 Pales­tinians last month, the UN said on Thursday, the highest rate since the Gaza conflict erupted in Oct 2023. At least 694 Palestinians were forcefully driven from their homes last month, according to figures from the UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA, which compiles data from various United Nations agencies. The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said in late January that settler violence has become a key driver of forced displacement in Israeli-occupied West Bank. January’s numbers were particularly high in part due to the displacement of an entire herding community in the Jordan Valley, whose 130 families left after months of harassment. “What is happening today is the complete collapse of the community as a result of the settlers’ continuous and repeated attacks, day and night, for the past two years,” Farhan Jahaleen, a Bedouin resident, said at the time. Settlers in West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, use herding to establish a presence on agricultural lands used by Palestinian communities and gradually deny them access to these areas, according to a report by Israeli NGO Peace Now. To force Palestinians out, settlers resort to harassment, intimidation and violence, “with the backing of the Israeli government and military”, the settlement watchdog said. “No one is putting the pressure on Israel or on the Israeli authorities to stop this and so the settlers feel it, they feel the complete impunity that they’re just free to continue to do this”, said Allegra Pacheco, director of the West Bank Protection Consortium, a group of NGOs working to support Palestinian communities against displacement. She pointed to a lack of attention on the West Bank as another driving factor. “All eyes are focused on Gaza when it comes to Palestine, while we have an ongoing ethnic cleansing in the (occupied) West Bank and nobody’s paying attention to the West Bank,” she said. Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank is home to around 490,000 Israelis living in settlements and outposts considered illegal under international law. Around three million Palestinians live in the territory. Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• US envoy says ‘significant work remains’ to end war • No update from any side on territorial dispute • Russia attacks Ukraine’s energy supplies ABU DHABI: Ukraine and Russia swapped over 300 prisoners following “productive” talks in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, as a US mediator conceded that “significant” work lay ahead in the quest for a broader deal to end the war. The negotiations are the latest bid in diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting — Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II, with hundreds of thousands killed, millions forced to flee their homes and much of eastern and southern Ukraine left decimated. As talks were underway, large swathes of the Ukrainian capital were still without heating in sub-zero temperatures, after successive Russian strikes knocked out energy supplies to hundreds of apartment blocks in Kyiv. “Today, delegations from the United States, Ukraine, and Russia agreed to exchange 314 prisoners — the first such exchange in five months,” US envoy Steve Witkoff said on social media during the second day of talks in Abu Dhabi. Russia’s defence ministry later confirmed the two sides changed 157 prisoners each. While Witkoff described the negotiations as “detailed and productive,” he dimmed hopes for a breakthrough saying “significant work remains”. On Wednesday, Kyiv had described the first day of negotiations as “substantive and productive”. Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev also said talks were going well. “There is definitely progress, things are moving forward in a good, positive direction,” he said. But there was no update from any side on the contentious issue of territory, or any sign of concession from Moscow, which entered the talks refusing to compromise on its key demands. The Russian envoy also slammed what he called attempts from European nations to “disrupt the progress,” without elaborating. In a rare official admission of battlefield losses, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday that at least 55,000 of his country’s troops had been killed since Russia invaded in February 2022 — a figure lower than many independent estimates. Russia has not disclosed how many of its soldiers have been killed. Tracking of obituaries and family announcements by the BBC and independent Mediazona outlet has found the names of more than 160,000 Russian soldiers killed in the conflict. ‘Concrete steps’ Ahead of the two-day talks, Russia launched its latest massive attack on Ukraine’s power infrastructure, leaving many people without power and shivering through temperatures as low as minus 20C. Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov said on Wednesday that “concrete steps and practical solutions” had been discussed in the first day of the talks. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters fighting would persist “until the Kyiv regime makes the appropriate decisions”. The main sticking point in the negotiations is the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine. Moscow is demanding that Kyiv pull its troops out of swathes of the Donbas, including heavily fortified cities atop vast natural resources, before any deal. It also wants international recognition that land seized in the invasion belongs to Russia. ‘Maintain pressure’ Kyiv has said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected a pull-back of forces. The talks in Abu Dhabi are the second round of trilateral negotiations between the US, Russia and Ukraine. US President Donald Trump has been pushing both sides to negotiate an end to the war since he returned to office, boasting he could strike a deal in hours. Zelensky said the US president’s role was crucial, telling French television in an interview that “Putin is only scared of Trump”. Trump could use economic sanctions against Russia or transfer weapons to Ukraine to “maintain this pressure on Putin”, Zelensky said. Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The leadership of the PTI and the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Thursday unanimously announced that they would not compromise on the health of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, and urged the nation to join the nationwide shutter-down strike scheduled for February 8 (Sunday). The remarks were made during a meeting of the PTI’s joint parliamentary committee at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The meeting was attended by prominent political leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, and PTI stalwarts Asad Qaiser and Taimoor Saleem Jhagra, among others. The meeting was closed off to the media. Addressing the participants, Qaiser said that the meeting was called because of Imran’s health. He said that representatives of 40 million people were in attendance and unanimously announced that they would not compromise on the health of the PTI founder. “Don’t push us against the wall; otherwise, all options are open,” Qaiser said in a warning to the ‘powers that be’. Talking about the Feb 8 protest, he said, “Today, we pledge that we will make the protest successful.” He further said that the PTI would meet the Supreme Court chief justice at 10am on Friday and share the resolution passed by today’s meeting regarding Imran’s health. Reading out the declaration, Qaiser said that the meeting, chaired by Achakzai, expressed concerns over the PTI founder’s health and demanded that his visitation rights be restored. The meeting also expressed concern over the law and order situation in Balochistan, which witnessed a spate of attacks over the weekend, and showed solidarity with the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country. Additionally, the participants demanded that steps be taken to ensure the welfare of the people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah and to rehome those who had been displaced . They also elected to intensify the PTI’s ongoing street movement , so that the nationwide protest would be successful. The participants also condemned the arrest of party leaders and workers in Sindh and announced that rallies would be staged after Isha prayers on February 8. They also showed solidarity with the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir and emphasised their right to self-determination. They also denounced the revocation of Article 370-A by the Indian parliament in 2019, which stripped the region of its autonomy. However, the participants expressed their appreciation for the meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and KP CM Afridi, demanding that the province’s dues be cleared. Before attending the meeting, Raja said that all issues, including the upcoming protests, would be discussed during at the gathering. He further said that a statement by Achakzai and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas had been misunderstood, as they said that it would not be a one-day protest. “They meant that the struggle for democracy will carry on even after February 8,” he clarified. The development comes after the government last week admitted that Imran was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), days after reports regarding the treatment of the ex-premier emerged in mainstream media. Speaking to Geo News , Tarar said the former premier, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, was taken to Pims in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24. He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”. Subsequently, the Pims executive director, Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, said that Imran’s eye procedure was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention. Achakzai on Tuesday wrote a letter to PM Shehbaz, seeking his “personal intervention” for the PTI founder’s medical examination by the jailed leader’s “trusted” doctors. Meanwhile, the PTI has called a massive nationwide shutter-down strike on February 8 against the alleged rigging in the 2024 general elections.",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Train services were restored in Balochistan on Thursday, after five days of suspension, as the tense security situation eased following a series of counter-terrorism operations in response to a spate of attacks in the province. However, mobile data services remained suspended for the sixth day in Quetta and some other districts. “Train services within Balochistan and to other provinces have been,” Muhammad Kashif, spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, confirmed to Dawn . He particularly mentioned that the services of the Jaffar Express train on the Quetta-Peshawar route and the Karachi-bound Bolan Mail had been suspended since January 31. The railway official added that both had been restored now. He further said that operations of the Quetta-Chaman passenger train had also resumed, and it departed today at its scheduled time. On the other hand, mobile data services remained suspended in the provincial capital for the sixth consecutive day. The mobile internet was still inaccessible in Quetta, Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat told Dawn . However, it was expected to be restored till 12am, he said. Mobile data also reportedly remained suspended in the Nushki, Sibi and Mastung districts. The services have also been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns. Separately, Balochistan Special Assistant to the Balochistan CM on Politics Shahid Rind said during a press conference in Quetta that examinations for grades 8 and 9 in the provincial capital would be held as per the schedule, and the polio campaign would continue as planned except in Nushki. “National highways in the province have been cleared, except for an area of Noshki, which is disturbed,” Rind added. “The PDMA (Provincial Disaster Management Authority) is working on it, it will be cleared within the next 12 to 24 hours.” The spokesperson said that all roads were open, though the standard operating procedure barring night travel remained in place. “In Noshki, the road was damaged by bombs, so teams from CNW (Communication and Works Department) and the PDMA (Provincial Disaster Management Authority) are working on repairs,” Rind said, adding that the repair work should be completed within the next 12 to 24 hours. After several days of “mop-up” actions in some parts in the wake of January 31 attacks , the military announced earlier today that security forces successfully concluded “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 ” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 36 civilians, including women and children, and 22 security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel were martyred as a result of the operations. “[…] a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR detailed. On January 31, police said suspected explosive materials were found on a railway track in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district. Railway tracks are a frequent target of terrorists, with the Jaffar Express coming under attack several times over the past year. On the night of January 26, a blast on the railway track linking Sindh to Balochistan derailed four bogies of the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express train coming from Peshawar and damaged the track. The Jaffar Express had also escaped attacks in Nasirabad in October and November last year. Similar attempts also occurred during the two months in Kachhi and Sindh’s Shikarpur district.",

      "title_orig": "216 terrorists killed as security forces conclude ‘Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1’ in Balochistan: ISPR",
      "summary_orig": "Security forces have successfully concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in the days-long clearance actions against “Indian-sponsored terrorist elements”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday. “Security forces have successfully concluded Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 in Balochistan under which a series of coordinated, swift, and intelligence-driven operations were conducted against Indian-sponsored terrorist elements seeking to disrupt peace and development by targeting innocent civilians, including women and children,” the ISPR said in a press release. The development comes as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days . “As a result of these well-coordinated engagements and subsequent clearance operations, 216 terrorists have been sent to hell, significantly degrading the leadership, command-and-control structures and operational capabilities of terrorist networks,” the military’s media affairs wing said. “Through meticulous planning, actionable intelligence, and seamless joint execution, Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs), with support of intelligence agencies, under Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 responded with precision and resolve,” the statement read. “During these operations, 36 innocent civilians, including women and children, embraced martyrdom, while 22 brave security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of Pakistan’s territorial integrity and the protection of its citizens,” the ISPR stated. “Their courage, professionalism, and unwavering commitment reflect the highest traditions of service. The nation honours their sacrifice and stands in solidarity with the families of all martyrs,” the military said. Detailing the forces’ timely actions, the ISPR recalled that on January 29, “operations were initiated in Panjgur and the outskirts of Harnai District after credible and verified intelligence confirmed the presence of terrorist elements posing an imminent threat to local public”. “During this phase, security forces undertook operations against identified terrorist hideouts, resulting in the elimination of 41 terrorists affiliated with Indian proxy networks,” it noted. “Subsequently, aggressive and steadfast responses by the brave security forces effectively thwarted the desperate attacks of Fitna-al-Hindustan to destabilise the peace of Balochistan. “Sequel to these, a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR detailed. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR stated that a “substantial cache of foreign-origin weapons, ammunition, explosives and equipment has also been recovered during the process”. “Preliminary analysis indicates systematic external facilitation and logistical support to these extremist proxies,” it observed. The military reaffirmed that the armed forces remained steadfast in their “resolve to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations under the ambit” of the government’s National Action Plan (NAP). It asserted that “counter-terrorism operations will continue with full determination until the complete elimination of terrorist threats”. “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 stands as a testament to Pakistan’s and particularly Balochistan’s proud peoples’ unwavering commitment to always prefer peace over violence, unity over division and development over violence,” the ISPR said. Following the January 31 attacks at multiple locations across Balochistan, security forces and LEAs continued “mop-up” actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province on Tuesday. Mobile internet had remained suspended in parts of the province for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, with provincial authorities also halting train services. President, PM hail forces for ‘crippling’ terrorists President Asif Ali Zardari commended security forces and law enforcement agencies over the successful completion of the operation in Balochistan, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.

It further said that President Zardari paid tribute to the innocent civilians and security personnel who were martyred during the operation, and expressed condolences to their families. “The nation salutes the sacrifices of martyrs and stands united against terrorism,” he said. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the officers and security forces personnel, as well as the leadership of the armed forces, for the success of Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1, Radio Pakistan reported. In his statement, PM Shehbaz praised the professional capabilities of the security forces for “breaking the backbone of enemies for peace and development” in Balochistan during the operation. The prime minister emphasised that the nation could never forget the sacrifices of its martyrs, Radio Pakistan said. “He vowed that the cowardly and malicious attempts by the terrorists to sabotage the peace of Balochistan through targeting innocent civilians would always be crushed,” the report read. “The terrorists have proved that they are enemies of development in the province and its people by targeting innocent civilians,” it quoted the premier as saying.

Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti, in a post on X, stated that the operation was a “clear message to those committing acts of bloodshed in Balochistan”. He maintained that the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was “a fitna targeting innocent civilians and labourers”, stressing that the group was working “at the behest of India”. “Pakistan will not compromise on its unity, development, and the protection of its people,” Bugti said. The chief minister warned that any effort to destabilise the country will be met with “a decisive response”. “The nation stands united, and any hand raised against Pakistan will not only be dealt with law and full force but will be broken,” he vowed. ‘Search and combing operations ongoing in Quetta’ Later, Balochistan CM’s spokesperson Shahid Rind said that while most areas had been cleared, search and combing operations were still ongoing in Quetta. “The situation across the province is normal, including in Nushki and Quetta,” he told reporters at a press conference in Quetta. “At least 100 suspects have been arrested during the combing and search operations in Quetta. They are being investigated.” Rind added that during the operations, “illegal small arms, recoilless rifles, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers were found in some homes”. “The identification of terrorists killed in the operations is ongoing,” further stated. He recalled that Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti previously said that “families whose children [had links] with terrorist organisations were requested to inform security institutions, district administration and political people about those children,” Rind said.“If they do not inform [the authorities] … action can be taken against the families, and the law has the provision for it.” Responding to a question, he said the terrorists’ target was the red zone in Quetta. “Balochistan police personnel and Frontier Corps soldiers kept the terrorists on their target until they were forced to move their vehicles from the spot.” Rind added that one of the challenges faced during the operation was that the terrorists had blended themselves among the people. “So, there was risk of collateral damage,” he said, adding that a similar problem was faced in Noshki. “We had to prevent collateral damage.” Asked if the Balochistan Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) was on the target in the red zone, Rind said that the apparent target was the red zone itself. He then answered a question about any existing threats, noting that amid the current situation, “multiple threats are generated” to which security forces respond. “There were some threats pertaining to these incidents in the past,” he added. “When the red zone was attacked, it was not as if high-ranking officials were at home; the CTD DIG was leading the situation and the IG (Inspector General of Police) was present there. “It means that there was a threat or alert, which was why high-ranking officials were present.” In response to a question about attacks on prisons, Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary on Interior Hamza Shafqaat stated that the Nushki jail superintendent was in stable condition and was receiving medical care. “Two prisons were attacked, and prisoners under trial and serious criminals are at large,” he said. “There is a hot pursuit [for them] and combing and sanitisation operations are ongoing. As soon as we get updates from Nushki and Mastung, we will share them with you within 24 hours.” Provincial Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar stated that when the attacks were reported, the health ministry promptly responded and announced an emergency. He also expressed gratitude to healthcare providers and medical staff who cared for the injured. “These incidents affect people’s mental health,” he said, adding that a project related to mental health was ongoing. “Work on that will continue. The health department and the people are mentally ready for these kinds of situations.” Rind added that those who attacked police stations had been identified. “Most of them appeared to be civilians, but action has been taken against them after their identification,” he said. In response to another question, he two female terrorists had been killed during the operations while three civilian women had lost their lives in the attacks in Gwadar.",

      "summary_en": "Security forces have successfully concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in the days-long clearance actions against “Indian-sponsored terrorist elements”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday. “Security forces have successfully concluded Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 in Balochistan under which a series of coordinated, swift, and intelligence-driven operations were conducted against Indian-sponsored terrorist elements seeking to disrupt peace and development by targeting innocent civilians, including women and children,” the ISPR said in a press release. The development comes as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days . “As a result of these well-coordinated engagements and subsequent clearance operations, 216 terrorists have been sent to hell, significantly degrading the leadership, command-and-control structures and operational capabilities of terrorist networks,” the military’s media affairs wing said. “Through meticulous planning, actionable intelligence, and seamless joint execution, Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs), with support of intelligence agencies, under Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 responded with precision and resolve,” the statement read. “During these operations, 36 innocent civilians, including women and children, embraced martyrdom, while 22 brave security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of Pakistan’s territorial integrity and the protection of its citizens,” the ISPR stated. “Their courage, professionalism, and unwavering commitment reflect the highest traditions of service. The nation honours their sacrifice and stands in solidarity with the families of all martyrs,” the military said. Detailing the forces’ timely actions, the ISPR recalled that on January 29, “operations were initiated in Panjgur and the outskirts of Harnai District after credible and verified intelligence confirmed the presence of terrorist elements posing an imminent threat to local public”. “During this phase, security forces undertook operations against identified terrorist hideouts, resulting in the elimination of 41 terrorists affiliated with Indian proxy networks,” it noted. “Subsequently, aggressive and steadfast responses by the brave security forces effectively thwarted the desperate attacks of Fitna-al-Hindustan to destabilise the peace of Balochistan. “Sequel to these, a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR detailed. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR stated that a “substantial cache of foreign-origin weapons, ammunition, explosives and equipment has also been recovered during the process”. “Preliminary analysis indicates systematic external facilitation and logistical support to these extremist proxies,” it observed. The military reaffirmed that the armed forces remained steadfast in their “resolve to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations under the ambit” of the government’s National Action Plan (NAP). It asserted that “counter-terrorism operations will continue with full determination until the complete elimination of terrorist threats”. “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 stands as a testament to Pakistan’s and particularly Balochistan’s proud peoples’ unwavering commitment to always prefer peace over violence, unity over division and development over violence,” the ISPR said. Following the January 31 attacks at multiple locations across Balochistan, security forces and LEAs continued “mop-up” actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province on Tuesday. Mobile internet had remained suspended in parts of the province for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, with provincial authorities also halting train services.

      "summary_orig": "The nation is observing Kashmir Solidarity Day today with a renewed pledge to support the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination. The day will feature rallies, demonstrations and seminars throughout the country. Human chains will also be formed at all entry points of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). One-minute silence was observed across the country at 10am to pay homage to the martyrs of the Kashmir freedom movement, state-run Radio Pakistan reported . In his message to mark the occasion, President Asif Ali Zardari reiterated Pakistan’s steadfast moral, diplomatic and political support for the Kashmiri people, reaffirming their “inalienable right to self-determination” as enshrined in the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). The president said the people of Pakistan across the globe stand united with their Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their just struggle. He recalled that the observance of Kashmir Solidarity Day was initiated 36 years ago by ex-premier Benazir Bhutto following the historic Kashmiri uprising of 1989, a movement that continues to this day. President Zardari urged the international community to press India to end human rights violations in held Kashmir. He said India had intensified efforts to entrench its control through “administrative and legislative measures, curbing media freedoms, incarcerating Kashmiri leadership and attempting to alter the demographic composition of the territory”. The president also highlighted what he described as grave human rights violations by Indian occupation forces, citing international reports that point to a rise in arbitrary detentions, collective punishment and punitive house demolitions. He added that the “suppression of digital freedoms, including the blocking of thousands of social media accounts, reflected attempts to conceal the realities on the ground”.

In their message , issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the services chiefs strongly condemned “grave violations of human rights in IIOJK, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and attempts to alter the demographic and political landscape of the region, with blatant disregard for international law”. They reiterated that a “just and peaceful resolution” of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, “remains essential for lasting peace and stability in South Asia”. “The international community must take concrete and meaningful action to alleviate the suffering of the Kashmiri people,” the services chiefs added. They reaffirmed that the armed forces remain “steadfast in their duty to safeguard Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and unwavering in their solidarity with their Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their rightful quest for freedom and dignity”. “Long live Pakistan!

He “offered rich tributes to the Shuhada of Kashmir movement, acknowledging their enduring legacy of valour and selfless sacrifice,” the statement said.

India’s ‘persistent defiance’ undermines UN Charter, UNSC resolutions: Dar FM Dar, in a statement , highlighted that the Kashmiri people “remain deprived of their fundamental rights”. “Yet, their resilience testifies the legitimacy of their just cause.” “At the heart of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute lies India’s failure to implement the United Nations Security Council resolutions guaranteeing the Kashmiri people a free and impartial plebiscite,” the foreign minister noted. He pointed out that India’s “persistent defiance” undermines the UN Charter, the relevant UNSC resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention. The situation on the ground in occupied Kashmir has “moved beyond episodic violations to a sustained system of repression”, Dar remarked. He accused India of taking actions after Aug 5, 2019 for “artificially altering the demographic composition to change Muslim majority into majority into minority”. “Under the Hindutva-driven framework, people in IIOJK face constant discrimination. The recent profiling of mosques in IIOJK, where religious functionaries are forced to provide their personal details, photographs, and sectarian affiliations, shows the extent of institutionalised Islamophobia,” the statement read. FM Dar took note of “grave human rights violations, including fake encounters, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and restrictions on fundamental freedoms”. He urged the international community to take “decisive action to address the worsening human rights situation in IIOJK, ensure accountability for India’s illegal and unilateral actions, persuade India to implement the [UNSC] resolutions and allow the Kashmiri people their promised right to self-determination”. In his message, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq noted that the Kashmir issue remained one of the fundamental disputes stemming from the incomplete promises of the partition of the subcontinent. He stressed that sustainable peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without granting the Kashmiri people their internationally recognised right to self-determination.

He also visited a forward post, where he interacted with troops deployed on the frontlines, the ISPR statement said, adding that during the visit, the CDF reiterated that any act of aggression would be instantaneously met with a swift and befitting response. “He underscored that the armed forces remain fully prepared to counter both conventional and hybrid threats in an evolving security environment,” the statement said. India’s ‘persistent defiance’ undermines UN Charter, UNSC resolutions: Dar FM Dar, in a statement , highlighted that the Kashmiri people “remain deprived of their fundamental rights”. “Yet, their resilience testifies the legitimacy of their just cause.” “At the heart of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute lies India’s failure to implement the United Nations Security Council resolutions guaranteeing the Kashmiri people a free and impartial plebiscite,” the foreign minister noted. He pointed out that India’s “persistent defiance” undermines the UN Charter, the relevant UNSC resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention. The situation on the ground in occupied Kashmir has “moved beyond episodic violations to a sustained system of repression”, Dar remarked. He accused India of taking actions after Aug 5, 2019 for “artificially altering the demographic composition to change Muslim majority into majority into minority”. “Under the Hindutva-driven framework, people in IIOJK face constant discrimination. The recent profiling of mosques in IIOJK, where religious functionaries are forced to provide their personal details, photographs, and sectarian affiliations, shows the extent of institutionalised Islamophobia,” the statement read. FM Dar took note of “grave human rights violations, including fake encounters, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and restrictions on fundamental freedoms”. He urged the international community to take “decisive action to address the worsening human rights situation in IIOJK, ensure accountability for India’s illegal and unilateral actions, persuade India to implement the [UNSC] resolutions and allow the Kashmiri people their promised right to self-determination”. In his message, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq noted that the Kashmir issue remained one of the fundamental disputes stemming from the incomplete promises of the partition of the subcontinent. He stressed that sustainable peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without granting the Kashmiri people their internationally recognised right to self-determination. Rallies held Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam led a rally from China Chowk to D-Chowk in Islamabad to mark the day, APP reported. A ceremony marking Kashmir Solidarity Day was also held at Kohala Bridge, where participants formed a human chain and reaffirmed support for the people of Kashmir. The event included flag hoisting and the playing of the national anthem, with officials, community representatives and citizens in attendance. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah led a Kashmir Solidarity Day rally in Karachi, marching from People’s Chowrangi to Mazar-i-Quaid. Members of the provincial cabinet, the Sindh chief secretary and police chief, and other government officials participated in the rally. Addressing an event, CM Murad recalled that in 1973, “when Kashmiris decided to join Pakistan, India illegally deployed troops” there. “Ever since, Kashmiris’ right to self-determination has been suppressed by India,” he added. “It is clear that this is not a decision between two countries, but India must be held accountable and the world must fulfil its promise to Kashmiris,” the chief minister said. “In the Kashmir issue, everyone is united; there’s no political difference, no ethnicity. Everyone speaks as one on Kashmir,” he highlighted. ‘Kashmir fundamental pillar of Pakistan’s identity’ Separately, at a ceremony held at Pakistan’s embassy in Kabul, Pakistan’s envoy to Afghanistan Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani also reaffirmed the country’s “commitment to the struggle of the Kashmiri people”. According to a press statement issued by the embassy, Ambassador Nizamani “framed the Kashmir cause as a fundamental pillar of Pakistan’s own spiritual and national identity”. Addressing the event, the envoy also “emphasised that the stability, security, and very ideological foundation of Pakistan are inextricably linked to the freedom of Kashmiri brethren from Indian occupation”.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi held an “important meeting” with Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong in Islamabad on Thursday and told him that providing “maximum security” to Chinese nationals was Pakistan’s top priority. A press release issued by he interior ministry detailed the exchange that took place during the Chinese envoy’s visit to the ministry, where Naqvi also briefed him about the situation in Balochistan. The province saw a spate of attacks on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days while security forces carried out retaliatory action. Meanwhile, Chinese citizens and projects have also come under attack multiple times in Pakistan in the past, including in Balochistan. According to data shared by the National Counter Terrorism Authority in December 2024, as many as 20 Chinese citizens had been killed and 34 injured in terror attacks in the country from 2021 until then. During his meeting with Naqvi today, the Chinese envoy condemned the terrorist attacks on civilians and security forces in Balochistan and expressed heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the affected families, the interior ministry’s statement said. It quoted the envoy as saying that “China stands in complete solidarity with the victims in this hour of grief. China condemns terrorism in all its forms and stands firmly with Pakistan in the fight against terrorism”. For his part, Naqvi conveyed to Zaidong that terrorism in Balochistan was carried out under an “organised and premeditated plan, and that the security forces responded in a timely and effective manner”. He briefed the Chinese ambassador on the prompt and effective operations conducted by security forces in Balochistan, the ministry’s statement said, adding that Naqvi also briefed the envoy on measures taken for the protection of Chinese citizens and Chinese projects. “The safety of Chinese citizens and projects is of paramount importance. No enemy can undermine the Pakistan–China friendship. Providing maximum security to Chinese nationals is our top priority,” the statement quoted the interior minister as saying. The statement said that a special protection unit was being established for the security of Chinese nationals and modern Chinese technology and equipment would prove supportive for coordinated counter-terrorism operations. Naqvi also briefed the Chinese ambassador on his recent successful visit to China. ‎During the meeting, detailed discussions were held on counter-terrorism, internal security, and security cooperation. Both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in intelligence sharing and the field of cybercrime, the statement said.

      "summary_orig": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa apex committee has termed “consultation, cooperation and coordination” with the federal government and all political parties “essential” for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy, it emerged on Thursday. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi chaired his first meeting of the provincial apex committee since assuming office on Wednesday. The panel discussed the “general rise in terrorism incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and an action plan to eradicate the menace of Fitna-al-Khawarij and establish complete peace and stability”, as per a press release issued by the KP CM’s office today. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). During the meeting, the press release said, the committee agreed that “joint consultation, mutual cooperation, and practical coordination between all political parties, public representatives, and the federal government is essential for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy”. The meeting was attended by provincial ministers, the Peshawar corps commander, the chief secretary and the KP inspector general. Senior civil, military and law enforcement officials were also present. The apex committee “firmly resolved that the KP government will utilise all its resources, including the armed forces, police, CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department) and other institutions, to combat terrorism and will not hesitate to make any sacrifices”. The committee hoped that the “long-term strategy would identify all the causes of terrorism and eliminate them, and as a result, ensure the restoration of public confidence so that the government and the public” can work together for the country’s progress. “The KP government’s agenda is that only good governance and public interest can unite the nation against terrorism,” read the meeting’s press release. Under this agenda, it was decided that in the “first phase, areas affected by terrorism will be converted into model good governance districts”. It further said “all government resources will be utilised to compensate for the lack in the provision of development, social services and economic growth” in terrorism-afflicted areas. The committee also announced a “special package to provide security, communication, health, education, employment, basic amenities and other services in these areas under an organised programme”. “The forum decided that the government will ensure complete care, rehabilitation, and the provision of basic needs for the welfare of the people affected in the areas where temporary relocation took place for sustainable stability, so that this temporary difficulty can form the base for peace, development and prosperity in the future,” the statement read. “Their dignified return is a top priority for the [KP] government,” it stressed. The federal and KP governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists. Speaking during the meeting, CM Afridi stressed that the provincial government “will not make any compromise on peace” in the province. He asserted that the “civil government, authorities, armed forces, and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are on the same page for law and order and will continue their joint efforts”. He reiterated that the fight against terrorism was a “collective one and can only be won through joint efforts”. The statement comes days after CM Afridi met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, where the two discussed issues related to KP’s finances and counterterrorism. On counter-terrorism, PM Shehbaz had termed the KP government’s cooperation in establishing peace in the province as “unavoidable”. “There is a need to improve the provincial government’s efforts to establish law and order,” he said, urging the KP government to strengthen provincial departments to combat terrorism. Affirming that both the Centre and the provincial government would continue their efforts to combat militancy, the premier said the KP administration should fulfil its constitutional duties to ensure peace and public welfare. The PTI-led KP government and the Centre have mostly been at odds over counter-terrorism policies in the province, particularly military operations, with the former objecting to “decisions taken behind closed doors”. CM Afridi has repeatedly called for a “ policy shift ” and urged the inclusion of the provincial government in counter-terrorism policy-making. The debate on the right approach to establish law and order comes on the heels of heightened militancy. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Lahore Qalandars announced on Thursday that it had directly signed Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman for PSL’s 11th edition, spending over Rs60 million. “Our Bangladeshi brother, Mustafizur, picked in 2016 and 2018, is now our direct signing and finally back with the family. Once a Qalandar, always a Qalandar. “Amount spent on DS: PKR6.44 crore,” the announcement on Lahore Qalandar’s X account said. Mustafizur had registered for the PSL in early January, following his release from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL). The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by KKR for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December. He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season. KKR announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The decision came amid strained relations between India and Bangla­desh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh. In response, Bangladesh banned IPL broadcasts in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board requested the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shift its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka. ICC, however, rejected the request, replacing Bangladesh with Scotland in the 20-team tournament. Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously also featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars. Mustafizur’s direct signing has been made possible after the PCB announced sweeping changes to the player acquisition mechanism for PSL 11 last month, replacing the long-running draft with a full-fledged auction and raising the player purse to $1.6m per franchise. Under the new framework, each franchise is allowed one direct signing of a foreign player who did not feature in the previous season, giving teams an additional avenue to bolster their squads with new international talent. PSL 11 will begin on March 26, and will also mark the return of Faisalabad as a host city, expanding the league’s footprint beyond the existing venues of Karachi, Lahore, Multan and Rawalpindi.",
