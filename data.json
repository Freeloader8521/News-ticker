      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Monday stressed the need for a national identity as the National Assembly passed a resolution condemning the attack at an imambargah in Islamabad. Speaking on the floor of the house, Asif said, “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees.” Talking about terrorism, he said, “The spike in terrorism in the country; I am sad to say that we are not even united in the condemnation of terrorism.” He said that in order to protect political interests, some refrained from attending the funerals of martyrs. “At least on national issues — all of us sitting here, regardless of which party they belong to … this is one thing on which there needs to be consensus on and that is Pakistan and its integrity as well as respect for those sacrificing their lives,” he said. In his remarks, the minister said that two dictators in the past had joined the war in Afghanistan to please a superpower. He said terrorism was a blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past. The minister said religious hatred was being fanned in Pakistan under an international conspiracy. He said the last four presidents of the United States were responsible for the killings of millions of Muslims. “But we always try to get support from the world powers,” he added. He said India was sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan, adding that it was the need of the hour that all Pakistanis be united to foil India’s plan. He said that the Afghan government in the past had agreed with Pakistan’s stance but now were reluctant to give any guarantee for controlling terrorism. “Now, India is using Afghan terrorists against us. India is fighting a proxy war in Pakistan,” he added. He said there were differences among our religious sects which could be sorted out in Parliament instead of in mosques and imambargahs. “Let us make this parliament functional in a real manner,” he added. “History gives us an opportunity for course correction but we have to be loyal to the Constitution. All issues can be resolved here. All problems can be addressed if our politics becomes subservient to the state. Our loyalties to the motherland should not be conditional,” he said. Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai, in his speech, said that a three-day debate should be held on terrorism. He said all stakeholders should sit together to find solutions to the problems plaguing the country. He also offered unconditional support to the government for strengthening Parliament. “If today we decide that Parliament will be the hub of power and all decisions will be taken here, all our problems will be resolved,” he added. He also urged the government to ask the United Nations secretary general to hold an international conference on Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the NA also passed a resolution condemning the suicide bombing at the imambargah. The resolution — tabled by PML-N lawmaker Hameed Hussain — called the attack “a direct attack on the Constitution of Pakistan, religious freedom, national security and interfaith harmony”. “This house demands that the suicide bombers, facilitators, planners and patrons involved in this incident be exposed and brought to justice,” it said. It further demanded indiscriminate action be taken against banned organisations and their networks, social media propaganda and public activities. “Effective and permanent arrangements should be made for the security of places of worship, especially mosques and imambargahs,” the resolution added. “Immediate and adequate financial assistance should be provided to the families of martyrs, while the injured should be provided with the best medical facilities,” it further demanded. The resolution further called for an effective counterterrorism strategy at the national level, which should be practically implemented by authorities. “This house reiterates its resolve that terrorism, sectarianism and hate-based violence will not be tolerated in Pakistan, and will ensure the protection of lives and property of the citizens at all costs,” it said.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for all financial sanctions being lifted, its atomic chief said on Monday, one of the most direct indications so far of its position at talks with Washington. US and Iranian diplomats held talks through Omani mediators in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy, after US President Donald Trump positioned a naval flotilla in the region, raising fears of new military action. The talks follow a crackdown on anti-government demonstrations in Iran last month. Trump joined an Israeli bombing campaign last year and hit Iranian nuclear sites. He also threatened last month to intervene militarily during the protests, but ultimately held off. Washington has demanded Iran relinquish its stockpile — estimated last year by the UN nuclear agency at more than 440 kilogrammes — of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent fissile purity, a small step away from the 90pc that is considered weapons grade. The head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation, Mohammad Eslami, said on Monday: “The possibility of diluting 60pc enriched uranium … depends on whether, in return, all sanctions are lifted or not”. Eslami, whose remarks were reported by Iran’s ISNA news agency, said, however, that another proposal, sending Iran’s highly enriched uranium abroad to another country, had not been discussed at the talks with US officials. Khamenei adviser to visit Oman Ali Larijani, a close adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and secretary of its national security council, will visit Oman on Tuesday following the US-Iranian talks there, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. “During this trip, (Larijani) will meet with high-ranking officials of the Sultanate of Oman and discuss the latest regional and international developments and bilateral cooperation at various levels,” Tasnim said. The date and venue of the next round of talks have yet to be announced. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Monday that a new round of talks would be “an appropriate opportunity for a fair and balanced resolution of this case,” and that a desired outcome could be reached if the US avoids maximalist positions and respects its commitments. Iran would continue to demand the lifting of sanctions and insist on its nuclear rights, including enrichment, he said. Iran and the US held five rounds of talks last year on curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme, with the process breaking down mainly due to disputes over uranium enrichment inside Iran. Since Trump struck Iran’s facilities, Tehran has said it has halted enrichment activity. It has always said its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes. The United States wants to include Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal in negotiations, but Tehran has ruled this out. In a televised statement aired on Monday, Khamenei called on Iranians to participate in the coming anniversary of the 1979 revolution. “The presence of the people in the march and their expression of loyalty to the Islamic Republic will cause the enemy to stop coveting Iran,” Khamenei said.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Data from hospitals showed that the death toll of the suicide attack on an imambargah in Islamabad reached 38 on Monday. Speaking in the National Assembly, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that 33 people were killed in the attack while more than 150 were injured. However, hospital records show that the toll has increased. On the day of the incident, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) spokesperson Dr Aneeza Jalil said that 28 dead bodies were brought to the hospital. On the other hand, Polyclinic said that four dead bodies were brought to the hospital, which added up to 32 deaths, as reported by the media. A day later, on Saturday, the Pims Spokesperson confirmed that a patient had died. The same day, it was also learnt that some of the injured were shifted to the HBS Institute of Healthcare and Allied Health Sciences, out of which three had died. The hospital’s representative, Dr Riaz Janjua, told Dawn that three deaths were reported at his hospital. He informed that as many as 67 injured were brought to the medical facility. Therefore, with the addition of three deaths at the private hospital, the death toll reached 36. On Monday, two more deaths were confirmed; one of the injured died at Polyclinic while another, who was shifted from Pims to a private hospital, also breathed his last, taking the toll to 38. Moreover, a document from Polyclinic shows that five deaths involving the incident have been recorded so far, with the first four being on Friday and the latest on Monday. The document also showed that seven patients were in critical condition and one was on the ventilator. According to the Pims spokesperson, 40 of those injured were still being treated at the hospital. Out of these, seven were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). She said that 29 deaths had been recorded at the hospital so far. Friday’s suicide blast at the Tarlai Imambargah was the second major terrorist attack in the federal capital in less than three months despite heightened security measures adopted by the police and the capital administration. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday said that four facilitators behind the incident, including the mastermind, had been arrested, saying the suspects were detained in overnight raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A judicial magistrate on Monday declared two PTI leaders — former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur and ex-National Assembly opposition leader Omar Ayub — absconders in two case pertaining to the party’s 2022 ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi March ’. The march is one of several protests that the party has carried out following the ouster of PTI founder Imran Khan as the prime minister through a no-confidence vote in 2022. Judicial Magistrate Mubashir Hassan Chishti heard the two cases related to the protest, registered at Islamabad’s Bara Kahu police station, declaring Ayub and Gandapur absconders and issuing their perpetual arrest warrants over their persistent absence from hearings. Judge Chishti observed that the two had failed to appear before the court despite the issuance of summons multiple times. They also did not furnish any plausible justification for their absence, the judge noted. They were summoned several times, but they continued to evade the proceedings, the judge remarked. Making these observations, he declared both PTI leaders absconders and directed the issuance of permanent arrest warrants for them so that they are presented before the court. Over Gandapur and Ayub’s persistent absence from the proceedings, the court had formalised their status as proclaimed offenders at a previous hearing. Meanwhile, the court had acquitted several others accused in the case, including PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Zartaj Gul, in the two cases on the basis of insufficient evidence to establish their involvement in the allegations levelled by the police. According to the prosecution, the two cases were registered in connection with alleged violations of law and order during the ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi March ’, with police claiming that the accused had incited people to commit unlawful activities and obstructed officials from performing their duties. The defence, however, had consistently maintained that the cases were politically motivated.",

Judicial Magistrate Mubashir Hassan Chishti heard the two cases related to the protest, registered at Islamabad’s Bara Kahu police station, declaring Ayub and Gandapur absconders and issuing their perpetual arrest warrants over their persistent absence from hearings. Judge Chishti observed that the two had failed to appear before the court despite the issuance of summons multiple times. They also did not furnish any plausible justification for their absence, the judge noted. They were summoned several times, but they continued to evade the proceedings, the judge remarked. Making these observations, he declared both PTI leaders absconders and directed the issuance of permanent arrest warrants for them so that they are presented before the court. Over Gandapur and Ayub’s persistent absence from the proceedings, the court had formalised their status as proclaimed offenders at a previous hearing. Meanwhile, the court had acquitted several others accused in the case, including PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Zartaj Gul, in the two cases on the basis of insufficient evidence to establish their involvement in the allegations levelled by the police. According to the prosecution, the two cases were registered in connection with alleged violations of law and order during the ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi March ’, with police claiming that the accused had incited people to commit unlawful activities and obstructed officials from performing their duties. The defence, however, had consistently maintained that the cases were politically motivated.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has dispatched another 100-tonne consignment of humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Monday. Since the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out on Oct 7, 2023, Pakistan has sent numerous aid items intended for the Gaza Strip, which was besieged at least until a ceasefire was secured in October 2025. According to NDMA, the consignment comprised 100 tonnes of tents and was sent with the support of Alkhidmat Foundation. This was the 28th relief consignment sent by Pakistan, bringing the total volume of humanitarian assistance sent to 2,727 tonnes. The relief goods were dispatched through a special flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore to Egypt’s El Arish International Airport “for onward delivery to Gaza”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported. Punjab housing minister Bilal Yasin was a special guest at the dispatch, which was attended by officials of the NDMA and the foreign ministry, NDMA stated. Pakistan had first sent aid , including medicines and tents, for the people of Gaza on Oct 19, 2023 — days after the Israeli bombardment began. The activists who were behind the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which was intercepted at sea by Israel in September 2025, said last week they will try again this year. The organisers said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt, carrying up to 1,000 medics. Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents. On Sept 27, 2025, Israeli drones hit the GSF — a collection of boats carrying humanitarian aid with rights activists, doctors, parliamentarians, journalists and others — as they entered the final stretch of their journey to Gaza. The aid boats were carrying delegations from over 40 countries, including Pakistan , which aimed to distribute vital humanitarian aid such as baby formula, food, water and medicine to the malnourished, forcibly displaced and injured civilians suffering from almost two years of genocide , as classified by the United Nations. Israel’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, displaced most of its population and left much of the strip in ruins. Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.",

      "summary_orig": "• PM aide’s contention that ‘innocents may get caught up’ in the wake of action following terror attacks prompts heckling, walkout • Dr Malik, Akhtar Mengal stress need for political, not military-based solutions LAHORE: At a charged discussion about the situation in Balochistan, PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah ignited controversy when he implied that innocent civilians were bound to get caught up in the fallout of attacks such as the ones witnessed across the province on Jan 31. The PM’s aide was speaking during a session, titled ‘Is There a Political Will to Solve the Crisis in Balochistan’, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday. The minister was part of a distinguished panel, which also incl­uded BNP-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal and National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, and was moderated by Mujahid Barelvi. PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday. The controversy reared its head when Mr Sanaullah was responding to points raised by the other speaker regarding the treatment meted out to the people from Balochistan. Referring to demands such as the abolition of checkpoints from across the province, he said that this could not happen unless terrorism and violence were rooted out. “If incidents like Jan 31 happen, then security forces will take act­ion, and there is a possibility that some of the people taken into custody could be innocent,” he said. This prompted a reaction from the audience, and some — like rights activist Sheema Kermani — got up from her seat and began to heckle the minister. He responded by chiding the hecklers, saying that their refusal to listen to him had ‘exposed them’. Ms Kermani then walked out of the venue, with many people following suit. Speaking to Dawn outside the hall, she said: “Asma Jahangir must be turning in her grave”. “Asma’s name is a symbol for people’s rights, for resistance, defiance and justice. If in this conference, you give a platform to such people who justify state violence, then we will not sit and hear it… If [Asma] had been here, she herself would have walked out and wouldn’t have let such persons speak.” ‘Political people’ Earlier, in his remarks, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch termed insurgency and enforced disappearances as the two major issues facing the province, which did not seem to have a solution. “Whenever I go to my area, four or five people come [up to me] daily, complaining about a missing person.” The state and political leadership should find a solution to these issues, he demanded. “If you deal with Balochistan as a security issue, then conditions would get worse by the day. If you involve political people and parties, then the situation may improve,” he suggested. “For parties which have roots among the masses, in Balochistan as well as [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa, space is shrinking on a daily basis,” he regretted. He also regretted how those who got the votes from the people were not allowed to enter parliament, but others were sent there ‘symbolically’. Dr Baloch, who was also part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, recalled that they had agreed on a number of points, including an end to enforced disappearances. He called for political reforms and the handover of resources to the province, and stressed the need to protect the 1972 Constitution, the 18th Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award. ‘Military solution to a political issue’ At the outset, BNP-M leader Akhtar Mengal posited that while the Balochistan issue was a political one, successive rulers had tried to solve it through military means, and warned that continued reliance on the coercive approach could lead to further tensions. Going into history, he recalled the original arrangement between the Khan of Kalat and the Quaid-i-Azam, where it was agreed that most administrative powers would remain with Balochistan. However, he regretted that this and subsequent pacts were not implemented. He also referred to past periods of conflict, including operations under different governments, the killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti and the issue of enforced disappearances, which he said had deeply affected many families, including his own. He also criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined, while expressing concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties. He also referred to jailed human rights lawyers and activists, Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying that they had been jailed for 17 years over a mere tweet, while those who had harmed the country and looted had not spent a single day behind bars, or were accorded A or B class prison facilities. Sanaullah’s response Responding to these grievances, Mr Sanaullah said nothing could be done about the past, as it could not be changed. “Right now Balochistan had two crises, one is being represented by Akhtar Mengal and Dr Malik, and the other side being Bashir Zaib and his accomplices,” he said, referring to one of the leaders of the banned BLA. “In my view, both these crises have different solutions and different demands. We are making a mistake by taking them as one.” He also maintained that enforced disappearances and violence in Balochistan started simultaneously, calling it a ‘chicken and egg story’, adding that they would also end together, just as they had started.

If you involve political people and parties, then the situation may improve,” he suggested. “For parties which have roots among the masses, in Balochistan as well as [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa, space is shrinking on a daily basis,” he regretted. He also regretted how those who got the votes from the people were not allowed to enter parliament, but others were sent there ‘symbolically’. Dr Baloch, who was also part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, recalled that they had agreed on a number of points, including an end to enforced disappearances. He called for political reforms and the handover of resources to the province, and stressed the need to protect the 1972 Constitution, the 18th Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award. ‘Military solution to a political issue’ At the outset, BNP-M leader Akhtar Mengal posited that while the Balochistan issue was a political one, successive rulers had tried to solve it through military means, and warned that continued reliance on the coercive approach could lead to further tensions. Going into history, he recalled the original arrangement between the Khan of Kalat and the Quaid-i-Azam, where it was agreed that most administrative powers would remain with Balochistan. However, he regretted that this and subsequent pacts were not implemented. He also referred to past periods of conflict, including operations under different governments, the killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti and the issue of enforced disappearances, which he said had deeply affected many families, including his own. He also criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined, while expressing concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties. He also referred to jailed human rights lawyers and activists, Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying that they had been jailed for 17 years over a mere tweet, while those who had harmed the country and looted had not spent a single day behind bars, or were accorded A or B class prison facilities. Sanaullah’s response Responding to these grievances, Mr Sanaullah said nothing could be done about the past, as it could not be changed. “Right now Balochistan had two crises, one is being represented by Akhtar Mengal and Dr Malik, and the other side being Bashir Zaib and his accomplices,” he said, referring to one of the leaders of the banned BLA. “In my view, both these crises have different solutions and different demands. We are making a mistake by taking them as one.” He also maintained that enforced disappearances and violence in Balochistan started simultaneously, calling it a ‘chicken and egg story’, adding that they would also end together, just as they had started.

      "summary_orig": "Injury-hit Australia limp into the T20 World Cup without leading fast bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, but Nathan Ellis says the team’s depleted attack can still carry the nation to glory. Cummins pulled out with a back injury and Hazlewood lost a race to be fit after sustaining Achilles and hamstring injuries . With Mitchell Starc having quit the format, Australia will be without all three of their top quicks for the first World Cup in over a decade. Ellis, the default leader of a pace attack featuring Xavier Bartlett and Ben Dwarshuis, said the new trio would be able to cover for the loss of their more experienced teammates. “We’ve had 18-24 months of cricket together where the big three haven’t been playing and have had big workloads in the test arena,” he told reporters on Monday. “I actually think we work together really, really well. “We’ve all got different skill-sets and can gel together on the night in different phases of the game. “A squad without ‘Hoff’ (Hazlewood) and Cummo (Cummins) is a strong squad obviously, but without them I feel like we’re just as well placed to go deep.” Ellis will go into Australia’s opener against Ireland in Colombo on Wednesday without any recent match practice, having suffered a hamstring strain bowling for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League. In his absence, Australia were whitewashed 3-0 in a warm-up series against Pakistan. Ellis has been used more as a specialist death bowler than a powerplay enforcer, but conceded his role might need to change in the absence of Hazlewood. “Obviously, you have to take each game, conditions as they come. But losing one of the better white ball bowlers in the world in Hoff, things are always going to have to change,” he said. “My role will try to be adaptable as much as I can.”",

      "summary_orig": "A Hong Kong court sentenced pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison on Monday for national security crimes, a punishment rights groups condemned as “effectively a death sentence” and a symbol of the city’s shrivelling press freedoms. The 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper was found guilty in December on two counts of foreign collusion under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing, as well as one count of seditious publication. His sentence is by far the harshest handed out under the national security law, surpassing the previous record of 10 years given to legal scholar Benny Tai in 2024. A summary document from the judges said they had settled on 20 years’ imprisonment “after considering the serious and grave criminal conduct of Lai”. Two of those years will overlap with Lai’s existing prison term, meaning that he will serve an additional 18 years, the judges wrote. Lai, who has been behind bars since 2020, sat impassively in the dock as his sentence was read out, an AFP journalist in the court saw. As he was led away, he waved solemnly to people in the public gallery, including his wife Teresa, former Hong Kong bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen, and former Apple Daily reporters. His defence lawyer Robert Pang, declined to comment on whether Lai would lodge an appeal, which can be done in the next 28 days. Asked if the sentence was in line with expectations, Pang told AFP : “In these times I don’t know what to expect.” Teresa Lai was grim-faced during the hearing and made no comment as she left the court, but the family condemned the sentence in a statement. “Sentencing my father to this draconian prison sentence is devastating for our family and life-threatening for my father,” Lai’s son Sebastien said. His daughter Claire called it “a heartbreakingly cruel sentence” given his declining health in prison, and if carried out, “he will die a martyr behind bars”. ‘Effectively a death sentence’ Rights groups also said Lai’s punishment amounted to a grave injustice. “The harsh 20-year sentence against 78-year-old Jimmy Lai is effectively a death sentence. A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. Amnesty International called the case “another grim milestone in Hong Kong’s transformation from a city governed by the rule of law to one ruled by fear”. Jodie Ginsberg, the CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said “today’s egregious decision is the final nail in the coffin for freedom of the press in Hong Kong”. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously said he had raised the issue of Lai, a British citizen, during his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing last month, while US President Donald Trump has also called for his release. Beijing has dismissed critics as smearing Hong Kong’s judicial system, while Hong Kong authorities say Lai’s case “has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press”. Staunch supporters Dozens of former Apple Daily employees and others braved the cold to queue overnight outside the West Kowloon court for a spot in court, while journalists gathered outside the building’s entrance. The mood was tense as police deployed dozens of officers, an armoured car and a bomb disposal van to the area. “I think this is equivalent to sentencing Lai to life imprisonment,” Lam Ying-kit, a former history teacher in his 50s, told AFP . Lai’s supporters, children, lawyers and rights groups have all raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison. Lai was kept in solitary confinement at his own request to avoid harassment, according to prosecutors, while authorities maintain he receives “adequate” care. Long a thorn in Beijing’s side, Lai was prosecuted under the national security law imposed by China on Hong Kong in 2020, following huge pro-democracy protests in the finance hub. Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 following police raids. Eight other defendants, including six Apple Daily executives, are due to be sentenced alongside Lai on Monday, all of whom pleaded guilty. As of the start of the month, Hong Kong had arrested a total of 386 people for various national security crimes, with 176 of them being convicted.",

Long a thorn in Beijing’s side, Lai was prosecuted under the national security law imposed by China on Hong Kong in 2020, following huge pro-democracy protests in the finance hub. Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 following police raids. Eight other defendants, including six Apple Daily executives, are due to be sentenced alongside Lai on Monday, all of whom pleaded guilty. As of the start of the month, Hong Kong had arrested a total of 386 people for various national security crimes, with 176 of them being convicted.",

      "summary_orig": "A white supremacist who shot and killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in 2019 launched an appeal Monday seeking to overturn his conviction. Brenton Tarrant, an Australian former gym instructor, admitted carrying out New Zealand’s deadliest modern-day mass shooting before being sentenced to life in jail in August 2020. Now, the convicted killer argues that his “torturous and inhumane” detention conditions during his trial made him incapable of making rational decisions when he pleaded guilty, according to a court synopsis of the case. Tarrant is being held in a specialist unit for prisoners of extreme risk at Auckland Prison, seldom interacting with inmates or other people. “I did not have the mind frame or mental health required to be making informed decisions at that time,” Tarrant told the court, according to the New Zealand Herald. Tarrant said his state of mind was such that he had considered trying to implicate President Donald Trump in the crime. Life without parole “What I said at the time is ‘perhaps I could go out and say there was a second shooter on the roof, perhaps I could say it was Donald J Trump’,” he said, according to national broadcaster RNZ. If the Court of Appeal in Wellington upholds Tarrant’s conviction, it would hold a separate hearing later in the year to consider an appeal against his sentence. His penalty of life imprisonment without parole was the stiffest in New Zealand history. Armed with an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons, Tarrant attacked worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019. He published an online manifesto before the attacks and then livestreamed the killings for 17 minutes. His victims were all Muslim and included children, women and the elderly. ‘Not prepared’ There are heavy restrictions on who can be in court during Monday’s appeal hearing, with only counsel, media and court officials allowed. Families and friends of those killed or wounded in the attacks have been invited to watch proceedings in Christchurch remotely by video with a one-hour delay. Members of the public are also able to watch the hearing by video link with a one-hour delay at a separate courtroom in Wellington. Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed by Tarrant inside the Linwood mosque, told Christchurch’s The Press newspaper she had thought “this is the end of it” when Tarrant was sentenced. “Little did you know that you are allowed to do this six years later. I was not prepared to do this,” she said. The hearing is being held before three Court of Appeal judges. In most Court of Appeal hearings the judges reserve their decision to be published at a later date, meaning a verdict is unlikely this week. After Tarrant’s livestream, Facebook said it removed 1.5 million videos that proliferated within the first 24 hours showing the harrowing viral footage. Then-prime minister Jacinda Ardern quickly moved to tighten gun laws in the aftermath and put pressure on social media giants to curb online extremism. In 2021, Tarrant’s former lawyer, Tony Ellis, said his client had believed “the simplest way out was to plead guilty”, arguing the plea was made under duress. The names of Tarrant’s current lawyers have been suppressed by the court.",

      "summary_orig": "• Opposition claims Modi surrendered to Trump over Epstein files • Growers fears the disastrous impact of the agreement; nationwide protests set for Feb 12 NEW DELHI: Indian farmers on Monday slammed a new US trade deal as “a surrender to multinational agricultural giants”, calling for the commerce minister’s resignation as Congress accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of capitulating to US President Donald Trump over the “Epstein files ” release. Congress leaders claimed an Indian minister, a businessman and individuals close to the prime minister were mentioned in the files, along with Modi. According to a report in The Hindu , the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) demanded Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s immediate resignation as soon as he explained the details of the bilateral pact. Leaders of the union representing apple and cotton growers said any relaxation on the import of cotton would be disastrous for the economies of Jammu and Kashmir, Him­­­­achal Pradesh, Mah­ar­ashtra and Gujarat. Talking to reporters at a press conference on Saturday, SKM leaders called the framework for the interim agreement on bilateral trade a “total surrender” to America’s agriculture sector. They cited the inclusion of dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits in the joint statement. The leaders warned that the animal feed market would be completely monopolised by US companies. SKM leaders urged farmers across the country to join protest demonstrations on Feb 12 and to support a general strike of workers as a “befitting reply to the anti-people Modi government”. The leaders said Goyal’s claim that the agriculture and dairy sectors were excluded from the agreement was incorrect. “Dairy products are part of the FTAs signed with the UK, New Zealand and European Union and the fresh revelations have undoubtedly proved the Commerce Minister is consciously propagating falsehood and betraying the farmers and the entire people,” the SKM statement said. “SKM considers the role of Commerce Minister as a traitor and demands his immediate resignation.” The organisation demanded that Prime Minister Modi desist from signing the India-US Free Trade Agreement or face “massive pan-India united mass struggles”. Farmers’ leaders highlighted tariff disparities, noting that US tariffs on Indian goods rose from zero in 2023-24 to 18pc, while Indian tariff rates on US agriculture products dropped from between 30pc and 150pc to zero. They said this would make Indian agriculture hang by the noose of US MNCs. The SKM also questioned Goyal’s position that the animal husbandry sector had requested imported feed. The group said poultry groups were the ones demanding feed based on maize and soybean to reduce minimum support prices for domestic crops. “We have heard that the animal feed in US may contain non-vegetarian items too. Why does the government want our cows to eat non-vegetarian food?” asked Rakesh Tikait, a prominent SKM leader. The statement also targeted the ruling party’s ideological parent organisation. “The RSS had been claiming no import of milk of animals fed with meat. That was a non-tariff barrier,” the statement said. “Now, the RSS has been made to eat its own claim by ‘Master’ Donald Trump and they have cowed down completely.” M.Y. Tarigami, leader of the Apple Farmers Federation of India and a Jammu and Kashmir lawmaker, said the trade deal would devastate regional economies. “We have been facing problems in apple cultivation due to lack of marketing facilities and climatic challenges,” Tarigami said. “Farmers in both the states are already in distress. This announcement will be a huge setback for apple and tree nut growers.” “In a state like Jammu and Kashmir, where there are no other economic avenues such as industry, the only source of income was cultivation of apples and dry fruits,” Tarigami added. “The Union government does not care about farmers here and is working for their masters in the United States.” Protesting against the government’s lack of transparency regarding the deal, the Congress party on Friday displayed a poster reading “Trap Deal” at the main entrance of the Parliament complex. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters that President Trump pressured Modi into signing the deal because of the Epstein files. “The truth is that over the past few days, Narendra Modi has been troubled because matters related to him have come up in the Epstein files. After that, Narendra Modi surrendered before Trump and struck a trade deal,” Kharge said. “He sacrificed the country’s farmers. Modi is making our people poor and making America’s farmers rich.” Published in Dawn, February 9th, 2026",

      "title": "Angry Indian farmers want minister’s ouster over US trade deal",
      "summary": "• Opposition claims Modi surrendered to Trump over Epstein files • Growers fears the disastrous impact of the agreement; nationwide protests set for Feb 12 NEW DELHI: Indian farmers on Monday slammed a new US trade deal as “a surrender to multinational agricultural giants”, calling for the commerce minister’s resignation as Congress accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of capitulating to US President Donald Trump over the “Epstein files ” release. Congress leaders claimed an Indian minister, a businessman and individuals close to the prime minister were mentioned in the files, along with Modi. According to a report in The Hindu , the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) demanded Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s immediate resignation as soon as he explained the details of the bilateral pact. Leaders of the union representing apple and cotton growers said any relaxation on the import of cotton would be disastrous for the economies of Jammu and Kashmir, Him­­­­achal Pradesh, Mah­ar­ashtra and Gujarat. Talking to reporters at a press conference on Saturday, SKM leaders called the framework for the interim agreement on bilateral trade a “total surrender” to America’s agriculture sector. They cited the inclusion of dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits in the joint statement. The leaders warned that the animal feed market would be completely monopolised by US companies. SKM leaders urged farmers across the country to join protest demonstrations on Feb 12 and to support a general strike of workers as a “befitting reply to the anti-people Modi government”. The leaders said Goyal’s claim that the agriculture and dairy sectors were excluded from the agreement was incorrect. “Dairy products are part of the FTAs signed with the UK, New Zealand and European Union and the fresh revelations have undoubtedly proved the Commerce Minister is consciously propagating falsehood and betraying the farmers and the entire people,” the SKM statement said. “SKM considers the role of Commerce Minister as a traitor and demands his immediate resignation.” The organisation demanded that Prime Minister Modi desist from signing the India-US Free Trade Agreement or face “massive pan-India united mass struggles”. Farmers’ leaders highlighted tariff disparities, noting that US tariffs on Indian goods rose from zero in 2023-24 to 18pc, while Indian tariff rates on US agriculture products dropped from between 30pc and 150pc to zero. They said this would make Indian agriculture hang by the noose of US MNCs. The SKM also questioned Goyal’s position that the animal husbandry sector had requested imported feed. The group said poultry groups were the ones demanding feed based on maize and soybean to reduce minimum support prices for domestic crops. “We have heard that the animal feed in US may contain non-vegetarian items too. Why does the government want our cows to eat non-vegetarian food?” asked Rakesh Tikait, a prominent SKM leader. The statement also targeted the ruling party’s ideological parent organisation. “The RSS had been claiming no import of milk of animals fed with meat. That was a non-tariff barrier,” the statement said. “Now, the RSS has been made to eat its own claim by ‘Master’ Donald Trump and they have cowed down completely.” M.Y. Tarigami, leader of the Apple Farmers Federation of India and a Jammu and Kashmir lawmaker, said the trade deal would devastate regional economies. “We have been facing problems in apple cultivation due to lack of marketing facilities and climatic challenges,” Tarigami said. “Farmers in both the states are already in distress. This announcement will be a huge setback for apple and tree nut growers.” “In a state like Jammu and Kashmir, where there are no other economic avenues such as industry, the only source of income was cultivation of apples and dry fruits,” Tarigami added. “The Union government does not care about farmers here and is working for their masters in the United States.” Protesting against the government’s lack of transparency regarding the deal, the Congress party on Friday displayed a poster reading “Trap Deal” at the main entrance of the Parliament complex.

      "summary_orig": "“This bargain no longer works. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition… You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration, when integration becomes the source of your subordination.” — Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada, at Davos 2026 “After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? But we did it, but we gave it back. But how ungrateful are they now? And then after the war, which we won, we won it big — without us, right now, you’d all be speaking German and a little Japanese, perhaps.” — Donald Trump, US President, at Davos 2026 “If anyone thinks that the European Union, or Europe as a whole, can defend itself without the US, keep on dreaming. You can’t. We can’t.” — Mark Rutte, Secretary-General Nato, speaking at EU Parliament Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney went to the World Economic Forum at Davos and told the world that his country — by extrapolation, all US allies — had lived a “pleasant fiction” that is now over. That fiction was grounded in the assumption that the United States would continue to lead a global order and that such order would perpetually guarantee stability, provide limitless liquidity, and manage all systemic risks. Under this global order, American hegemony would continue to “provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes.”  This does not obtain anymore. For decades, America’s Western allies lived comfortably with a system in which the US was the \n  accepted hegemon and which benefitted them as its satraps. That system is now unravelling \n  because of the brazenness and boorishness of US President Donald Trump and because the \n  allies are now being treated like others were always treated in the Global South. For the first time, Canada and Europe are being forced to confront the fact that power creates its own dynamics… This is where the irony lies. For Carney, as also other US allies, US hegemony worked and made them prosper as long as its application of force targeted states and societies in what we loosely describe as the Global South: Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, to name just the most obvious regions. These are also the regions where a number of states or leaders within those states decided to remove the signboard, to not live the lie that Canada was so content to live with until recently and acquiesced in. Those leaders were picked off — the list is long from Mohamed Mosaddegh to Patrice Lumumba to Ngo Din Diem to Salvador Allende to hundreds of failed attempts on Fidel Castro — those states suffered and most, like Iran, continue to suffer. The system’s power did not come from its truth, but from Canada’s willingness, as also of other US allies, to perform as if it were true. Now, “its fragility comes from the same source”, as identified by Carney. I argue that the challenge faced by the US allies is not that the United States has suddenly become more of a hegemon. The entire post-WWII system was grounded in unequal power distribution and accepted hegemony of the US by its allies. The fiction Carney spoke about was (and remains) an elaborate mise en scène, put together not just by the US but also its allies. In fact, as we shall discuss later, the centrality of a dominant power is the core tenet of an integrated alliance system that must also have a unifying perception of threat and shared values. Carney’s assertion that “when we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness”, and his invocation of Thucydides’ Melian Dialogue are, therefore, about the direction of the exercise of US hegemony, not hegemony itself. What is true, however, is the fact and Carney’s realisation of it, that a hegemon’s intent can change. That is what has happened. To that end, I propose to briefly look at how the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) came about and what exactly is the Greenland issue about. Finally, I argue that, while this moment may not be a Wagnerian frenzy, it could lead to that in the years to come, quite possibly unravelling Europe, which is not a single, seamless entity but a conglomeration of multiple states and ethnolinguistic groupings. EUROPE, AMERICA AND NATO: FROM RELUCTANCE TO PRIMACY What follows is based on a number of works, including those by US international affairs academic Lawrence Kaplan, Canadian diplomat Escott Reid and US historian Melvyn Leffler and several declassified documents from the Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) volumes. Today, Nato is taken for granted. But the idea and its actualisation did not evolve as a premeditated American design. It emerged from European insecurity, economic and military, and involved a drawn-out and complex diplomatic process. The US was still grappling with its new global role and was reluctant to get involved in Europe’s affairs again. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and National Policy Volume II 1947-1949 by military historian Kenneth Condit makes clear that post-war demobilisation had left the US military (all branches) starved of manpower and materiel. A good example of such pressures was the crisis in Greece (Civil War 1946-49) and the decision by Britain to withdraw its troops from there in 1947. The US wanted the British to keep the troops in Greece, even as the JCS’s own study had concluded that “the United States was not capable of deploying sufficient armed forces to Greece to defeat a combined attack by Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria. Any US force sent should therefore be small. It should be solely for the purposes of stiffening morale of the Greeks and of contributing to stability in areas where it was stationed.” The details are too many and complicated. The essential point, however, is that the period from December 1947 to March 1948 marked the critical point where the idea of a transatlantic military pact moved from a British proposal to an accepted, if still vague, American objective. On December 17, 1947, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin made a case to the US Secretary of State George Marshall for a “Western Union.” Bevin’s concept, which he described as a “spiritual federation of the West”, encompassed Western European nations, the British dominions and, crucially, the United States. This entity would be “an understanding backed by power, money and resolute action”, with its essential task being to create a “feeling of security” and the confidence that “further communist inroads [into Eastern Europe] would be stopped.” The US presence in the Union would provide Europe the confidence to resist the Soviet political threat. While agreeing with the general idea and its importance, Marshall struck a cautious tone. He believed the union should be purely European, with the US providing only material assistance. He refused to approve any specific course of action or make public promises. This was in line with the Truman administration’s reluctance to undertake formal military commitments despite the March 1947 Truman Doctrine, which pledged American political, military and economic aid to democratic nations under threat from authoritarian (specifically communist) forces. Protesters take part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark on January 17, 2026: Greenlanders have already rebuffed Trump’s desire to take control of the island | Reuters Bevin elaborated his proposal in a formal paper in January 1948. He argued for a union, formal or informal, that included Scandinavia, the Low Countries, France, Italy, Greece, Portugal and, eventually, Spain and Germany. As a first step, he proposed expanding the 1947 Dunkirk Treaty — a bilateral Anglo-French pact solely against future German aggression — into a treaty with the Benelux countries. This “solid core” could then expand into the full Western Union. Bevin’s proposals at this stage were far ahead of American thinking. Marshall or his aides had not seriously considered a military alliance with the Europeans, despite the emerging Soviet threat. The British initiative did spark a debate within the US State Department. Two distinct camps emerged. One comprised the sceptics, led by Marshall, Under Secretary Robert Lovett and George Kennan, head of the Policy Planning Staff and the writer of the famous ‘Long Telegram’ and the ‘X Article’, which analysed Soviet ideology and advocated containment. Kennan welcomed the idea of a European union under Franco-British leadership, believing it could restore the balance of power. However, he opposed direct US military commitment, arguing that a military pact should flow from political and economic union, not precede it. He also warned that using the anti-German Dunkirk Treaty as a model was “a poor way” to prepare for Germany’s eventual inclusion. Like Marshall, Kennan insisted the initiative and hard work must come from Europe itself. When that happened, the US could then offer support. The other camp had advocates of an Atlantic pact, primarily John D. Hickerson, director of the Office of European Affairs, and his deputy Theodore Achilles. Hickerson agreed the Dunkirk model was flawed but argued that a European union backed only by US aid would be insufficient. He believed only a direct American moral commitment — a promise to fight if necessary — could generate the “confidence and energy” needed to restore a stable, solvent Europe. He proposed modelling a new pact on the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (the Rio Treaty), which would be linked to the UN Charter. This “Atlantic security system” would explicitly include the US and Canada alongside the Western European states. Initially, the sceptics held sway. On January 20, 1948, Marshall informed the British ambassador that the US welcomed Bevin’s initiative and would assist it “to the fullest” but would not be a part of it. This marginalised Hickerson and Achilles. Marshall’s position was rooted in several powerful strands of opposition within the US government, the Congress and the military. From a strategic perspective, Kennan et al viewed the Soviet threat in early 1948 as primarily politico-economic, not military. The preferred instrument to counter the Soviets was the European Recovery Program (ERP, or Marshall Plan). They feared that a sudden push for a military alliance could jeopardise Congressional approval of this vital economic aid package. They were also hedging politically and anticipated resistance from three quarters: traditional isolationists who opposed entangling alliances because they drained US resources; internationalists who saw such a pact as undermining the United Nations; and the military establishment, which did not have the capacity for unsustainable commitments and wanted to withdraw troops from an indefensible Western Europe. Secretary of Defence James Forrestal warned of the danger of letting military commitments outpace capabilities. Faced with American reluctance, Bevin and French foreign minister Georges Bidault decided Europe must take the first step, hoping to ‘lure’ the US in later. On March 17, 1948, Britain, France and the Benelux countries signed the Brussels Treaty, establishing the Western Union. This coincided with a shift in American opinion, catalysed by an escalation of Cold War tensions in February and March 1948. The Soviet-backed communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February, combined with Soviet pressure on Finland and Norway and intensified communist agitation in Italy and France, ignited a palpable ‘war-scare’ in Washington. This climate of crisis helped remove key barriers to American action. While US leaders still did not believe that war was imminent, they now concluded that economic aid alone was insufficient to provide the psychological stability needed for recovery. Only a US security guarantee could create the necessary confidence to resist Soviet political subversion. On March 11, Bevin formally invited the US to discuss a North Atlantic treaty. The following day, Marshall agreed to proceed with joint talks on an “Atlantic security system.” In a speech to Congress on March 17, the very day the Brussels Treaty was signed, President Truman endorsed the pact and pledged that the US would “extend to the free nations the support that the situation requires.” By late March 1948, the fundamental US position on a transatlantic security pact had reversed. The objective was now to design a form of military commitment to Europe. The consensus purpose was not to prepare for a likely Soviet invasion, but to “strengthen the determination of the free nations to resist… Soviet-directed world Communism” and “increase their confidence.” The commitment would serve as a psychological and political stabiliser to ensure the success of the Marshall Plan. The remaining debates were to be worked out in the subsequent Pentagon Talks. The path to Nato had opened up, forged by European fear, British diplomacy, and an American realisation that economic power required a security complement to be effective in the upcoming Cold War. But there was something else too. If this were to work, the alliance needed a dominant state. That state was to be the US. The path was also cleared from reluctance to configuring Nato with the US at the apex. Despite belonging to different theoretical schools, John Mearsheimer, John Ikenberry and Melvyn Leffler converge on this point: US hegemony in Nato was not an accidental outcome but a logical result of the alliance’s foundational conditions and strategic purpose. Once committed, the US used its unmatched power to shape Nato’s institutions in ways that locked in its leadership, ensuring the alliance would remain an extension of American grand strategy, while providing Europe with indispensable security. This ‘bargain’ — European subordination to and participation in the American-led financial and security architecture for American protection — was the stable, if unequal, core of the transatlantic relationship for decades. The post-Cold War evolution — with Nato expanding eastward under continued US impetus, and recent developments about Nato’s future and the US role — further demonstrate the nature and extent of this configured hegemony. This structural imperative (predominance of US power — economic, industrial, human resource, military, technological) was wedded to Nato’s strategic logic and influenced Nato’s institutional design both politically and operationally. The Europeans, since the end of the Cold War — the so-called peace dividend — have become niche auxiliaries. Budgets were slashed, conscription abolished, personnel reduced. It has been the same story regarding capabilities and inventories. This is precisely what Trump began talking about in his first term. While the Russo-Ukraine War and slacking US commitment to Europe have forced a rethink, it will take at least a decade-and-half’s sustained effort for Europe to develop the strategic capabilities for which they entirely rely on the US. This is the reason Mark Rutte bluntly told the EU parliamentarians that Europe can’t defend itself without the US. We shall return to this issue of US hegemony but let’s first get to Greenland. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivering his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 20, 2026: for Carney, as also other US allies, US hegemony worked and made them prosper as long as its application of force targeted states and societies in the Global South | AFP GREENLAND, JUST TRUMP’S OBSESSION? Short answer, no. Let’s go for the longish answer. The US has a history with Greenland. In recent years, melting Arctic glaciers and warming waters, as also Russia and China’s interest in the Arctic waterways, have revived the conversation among US policymakers. But it’s also the geography. As Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told the BBC, “If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland. That’s why the Pituffik [pronounced bee-doo-feek] Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.” When Nazi forces occupied Denmark during World War II, the US invaded Greenland and established military and listening posts on the island. The Danish Ambassador to the US during World War II was Henrik Kauffmann, a pivotal figure who, after Germany occupied Denmark in 1940, acted independently as the representative of “Free Denmark” and signed crucial defence agreements for Greenland with the US. On April 9, 1941, he signed an agreement with the US allowing American military bases in Greenland, a critical move to prevent German seizure of the island. After the war, the US expanded the Pittufik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base. A 1951 defence agreement with Denmark also granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases. But before the 1951 agreement, in 1946, the US expressed the desire to purchase Greenland from Denmark for a sum of $100 million in gold bars. US officials at the time described the interest in Greenland as a “military necessity”, precisely the language used by Trump when he suddenly mentioned Greenland. The 1946 offer remained classified until documents were declassified in 1991. But it wasn’t the first time the US had shown interest in Greenland, though. US Secretary of State William Seward raised the idea of annexing it along with Iceland in 1867. Seward had earlier purchased Alaska from Russia in March of the same year. Trump himself talked about buying Greenland in 2019. A Wall Street Journal report at the time revealed the plan. All these offers have been rebuffed by Denmark. In January this year, Trump stated that “the fact that they [Danes] had a boat land there 500 years ago [sic] doesn’t mean that they own the land.” So what’s the legal status of Greenland? The 1933 Eastern Greenland Case before the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) centred on a sovereignty dispute between Denmark and Norway. In 1931, Norway occupied and claimed a portion of Eastern Greenland, arguing it was terra nullius [unowned land] outside Danish control. Denmark countered that its sovereignty historically extended over all of Greenland, supported by continuous and peaceful displays of authority, such as a trade monopoly and granting of concessions. A key diplomatic point was the 1919 Ihlen Declaration, where Norway’s foreign minister had informally assured Denmark that Norway would not challenge Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The PCIJ ruled 12-2 in favour of Denmark by arguing that Denmark had demonstrated sufficient intention and exercise of sovereignty to claim title over all of Greenland. The Court also held that Norway was bound by the Ihlen Declaration and thus obligated not to contest Danish sovereignty or occupy any part of Greenland. The case remains a significant precedent in international law, particularly regarding territorial acquisition, the binding nature of unilateral declarations by state officials, and the requirements for effective occupation even in sparsely populated areas (contrast this with Occupied Palestine). That said, the ruling was a product of a colonial era. Today, the right to self-determination of Indigenous peoples, such as the Inuit of Greenland, would be a central consideration, fundamentally altering the legal context for such disputes. In essence, this means, legally speaking, that any decision about Greenland must come from the Greenlanders and no one else. They have already rebuffed Trump’s desire to take control of the island. But the issue for our purpose is different. Just to recap, my argument is that US hegemony was built into the post-WWII alliance system. So what was the fiction? THE PREDICTABLE FICTION US allies, including Canada, were perfectly fine with the yarn woven by a benign hegemon. As Carney himself noted, it was a predictable system, despite being fictitious. But no one cared because it allowed Canada and Europe to play along, act bigger than they were and are, get prosperous and be protected. For the US too, it was a win-win. Nato is a force multiplier for the US military power and it also provides legitimacy to American power projection. As noted above, the Europeans bring niche capabilities and diplomatic support. Freedom from bearing the full cost of defence, they could focus on economic growth and industrialisation and punched above their weight because of the US backing. In that, they were and are also willing partners in bullying states the US wants to sanction and beat up. Like the child in Ursula Le Guin’s story, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, the town’s (read US allies’) happiness requires the child’s misery. In the real world, that child can be found in many parts of the world: occupied Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Venezuela… the list is long. To be precise, Carney et al don’t want to walk away from Omelas. They aren’t particularly concerned about the misery of the child in the basement of a building. Or to use Carney’s invocation of Vaclav Havel’s green grocer, they don’t want to remove the sign. In the Q&A at Davos after his speech, Carney was far more circumspect, especially when asked about Greenland and Nato. Their concern is how ‘Daddy’ is behaving, mocking them for what the allies really are: subordinates — children who hold cushy jobs in the global US enterprise but must behave if they are to retain their houses and cars and yachts and place on the board. Those, like Iran, who never signed up to the signboard, belong to a different story — the real, sordid one, not the pleasant fiction. None of the US allies is prepared to speak the truth on Iran — at least not for some time to come. But something else has also happened. And that has the allies running helter-skelter. In this fiction there was (and is) one big reality: US preponderance. What if the sudden malignancy of hegemony becomes a practice? While the fiction lasted, no one thought about it. The fact that allies were satraps was only occasionally put on overt display: Suez (Britain/France); Nixon Shock (devastating currency reserves of allies, especially Japan); Kissinger’s 1973 exhortation to allies that they subordinate their regional interests to US global leadership; 1973 oil shock; extraterritorial bullying through the Helms-Burton Act 1996; Old Europe/New Europe statements during the illegal invasion of Iraq. With Trump, it’s more brazen and boorish. If the US is the dominant power and if allies expect it to protect them, why can’t it make some demands? Oh, there’s a bit of a problem. It’s called a rules-based order. Really, thinks Trump. Didn’t I just abduct a head of state? What are these Europeans talking about. They were fine with it. Wait, the rules-based part of the fiction had some reality within the camp. You didn’t pee inside the tent. Now the camp is being treated the same way as others. That sucks. Even if Trump were to be an aberration 2.0, the historical rule has been established. Power creates its own dynamics. That’s the rupture Carney has pointed to. The question is, can Canada, in collaboration with Europe, develop an alternative power pole? Contiguity works against Canada; distance works against Europe. Trump is not the only thing happening to Europe. There are other strands and pressures within Europe that will likely determine Europe’s future and whether and for how long one could use a collective noun for Europe. In October 2022, during the inauguration of the European Diplomatic Academy in Bruges, Josep Borrell, EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy stated: “Europe is a garden. Most of the rest of the world is a jungle and the jungle could invade the garden.” It’s kind of ironic! The serpent is already in the garden and going by the Book of Genesis, he is an irrevocable part of the story of Man. The writer is a journalist interested in security and foreign policies.

Protesters take part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark on January 17, 2026: Greenlanders have already rebuffed Trump’s desire to take control of the island | Reuters Bevin elaborated his proposal in a formal paper in January 1948. He argued for a union, formal or informal, that included Scandinavia, the Low Countries, France, Italy, Greece, Portugal and, eventually, Spain and Germany. As a first step, he proposed expanding the 1947 Dunkirk Treaty — a bilateral Anglo-French pact solely against future German aggression — into a treaty with the Benelux countries. This “solid core” could then expand into the full Western Union. Bevin’s proposals at this stage were far ahead of American thinking. Marshall or his aides had not seriously considered a military alliance with the Europeans, despite the emerging Soviet threat. The British initiative did spark a debate within the US State Department. Two distinct camps emerged. One comprised the sceptics, led by Marshall, Under Secretary Robert Lovett and George Kennan, head of the Policy Planning Staff and the writer of the famous ‘Long Telegram’ and the ‘X Article’, which analysed Soviet ideology and advocated containment. Kennan welcomed the idea of a European union under Franco-British leadership, believing it could restore the balance of power. However, he opposed direct US military commitment, arguing that a military pact should flow from political and economic union, not precede it. He also warned that using the anti-German Dunkirk Treaty as a model was “a poor way” to prepare for Germany’s eventual inclusion. Like Marshall, Kennan insisted the initiative and hard work must come from Europe itself. When that happened, the US could then offer support. The other camp had advocates of an Atlantic pact, primarily John D. Hickerson, director of the Office of European Affairs, and his deputy Theodore Achilles. Hickerson agreed the Dunkirk model was flawed but argued that a European union backed only by US aid would be insufficient. He believed only a direct American moral commitment — a promise to fight if necessary — could generate the “confidence and energy” needed to restore a stable, solvent Europe. He proposed modelling a new pact on the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (the Rio Treaty), which would be linked to the UN Charter. This “Atlantic security system” would explicitly include the US and Canada alongside the Western European states. Initially, the sceptics held sway. On January 20, 1948, Marshall informed the British ambassador that the US welcomed Bevin’s initiative and would assist it “to the fullest” but would not be a part of it. This marginalised Hickerson and Achilles. Marshall’s position was rooted in several powerful strands of opposition within the US government, the Congress and the military. From a strategic perspective, Kennan et al viewed the Soviet threat in early 1948 as primarily politico-economic, not military. The preferred instrument to counter the Soviets was the European Recovery Program (ERP, or Marshall Plan). They feared that a sudden push for a military alliance could jeopardise Congressional approval of this vital economic aid package. They were also hedging politically and anticipated resistance from three quarters: traditional isolationists who opposed entangling alliances because they drained US resources; internationalists who saw such a pact as undermining the United Nations; and the military establishment, which did not have the capacity for unsustainable commitments and wanted to withdraw troops from an indefensible Western Europe. Secretary of Defence James Forrestal warned of the danger of letting military commitments outpace capabilities. Faced with American reluctance, Bevin and French foreign minister Georges Bidault decided Europe must take the first step, hoping to ‘lure’ the US in later. On March 17, 1948, Britain, France and the Benelux countries signed the Brussels Treaty, establishing the Western Union. This coincided with a shift in American opinion, catalysed by an escalation of Cold War tensions in February and March 1948. The Soviet-backed communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February, combined with Soviet pressure on Finland and Norway and intensified communist agitation in Italy and France, ignited a palpable ‘war-scare’ in Washington. This climate of crisis helped remove key barriers to American action. While US leaders still did not believe that war was imminent, they now concluded that economic aid alone was insufficient to provide the psychological stability needed for recovery. Only a US security guarantee could create the necessary confidence to resist Soviet political subversion. On March 11, Bevin formally invited the US to discuss a North Atlantic treaty. The following day, Marshall agreed to proceed with joint talks on an “Atlantic security system.” In a speech to Congress on March 17, the very day the Brussels Treaty was signed, President Truman endorsed the pact and pledged that the US would “extend to the free nations the support that the situation requires.” By late March 1948, the fundamental US position on a transatlantic security pact had reversed. The objective was now to design a form of military commitment to Europe. The consensus purpose was not to prepare for a likely Soviet invasion, but to “strengthen the determination of the free nations to resist… Soviet-directed world Communism” and “increase their confidence.” The commitment would serve as a psychological and political stabiliser to ensure the success of the Marshall Plan. The remaining debates were to be worked out in the subsequent Pentagon Talks. The path to Nato had opened up, forged by European fear, British diplomacy, and an American realisation that economic power required a security complement to be effective in the upcoming Cold War. But there was something else too. If this were to work, the alliance needed a dominant state. That state was to be the US. The path was also cleared from reluctance to configuring Nato with the US at the apex. Despite belonging to different theoretical schools, John Mearsheimer, John Ikenberry and Melvyn Leffler converge on this point: US hegemony in Nato was not an accidental outcome but a logical result of the alliance’s foundational conditions and strategic purpose. Once committed, the US used its unmatched power to shape Nato’s institutions in ways that locked in its leadership, ensuring the alliance would remain an extension of American grand strategy, while providing Europe with indispensable security. This ‘bargain’ — European subordination to and participation in the American-led financial and security architecture for American protection — was the stable, if unequal, core of the transatlantic relationship for decades. The post-Cold War evolution — with Nato expanding eastward under continued US impetus, and recent developments about Nato’s future and the US role — further demonstrate the nature and extent of this configured hegemony. This structural imperative (predominance of US power — economic, industrial, human resource, military, technological) was wedded to Nato’s strategic logic and influenced Nato’s institutional design both politically and operationally. The Europeans, since the end of the Cold War — the so-called peace dividend — have become niche auxiliaries. Budgets were slashed, conscription abolished, personnel reduced. It has been the same story regarding capabilities and inventories. This is precisely what Trump began talking about in his first term. While the Russo-Ukraine War and slacking US commitment to Europe have forced a rethink, it will take at least a decade-and-half’s sustained effort for Europe to develop the strategic capabilities for which they entirely rely on the US. This is the reason Mark Rutte bluntly told the EU parliamentarians that Europe can’t defend itself without the US. We shall return to this issue of US hegemony but let’s first get to Greenland. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivering his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 20, 2026: for Carney, as also other US allies, US hegemony worked and made them prosper as long as its application of force targeted states and societies in the Global South | AFP GREENLAND, JUST TRUMP’S OBSESSION? Short answer, no. Let’s go for the longish answer. The US has a history with Greenland. In recent years, melting Arctic glaciers and warming waters, as also Russia and China’s interest in the Arctic waterways, have revived the conversation among US policymakers. But it’s also the geography. As Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told the BBC, “If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland. That’s why the Pituffik [pronounced bee-doo-feek] Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.” When Nazi forces occupied Denmark during World War II, the US invaded Greenland and established military and listening posts on the island. The Danish Ambassador to the US during World War II was Henrik Kauffmann, a pivotal figure who, after Germany occupied Denmark in 1940, acted independently as the representative of “Free Denmark” and signed crucial defence agreements for Greenland with the US. On April 9, 1941, he signed an agreement with the US allowing American military bases in Greenland, a critical move to prevent German seizure of the island. After the war, the US expanded the Pittufik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base. A 1951 defence agreement with Denmark also granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases. But before the 1951 agreement, in 1946, the US expressed the desire to purchase Greenland from Denmark for a sum of $100 million in gold bars. US officials at the time described the interest in Greenland as a “military necessity”, precisely the language used by Trump when he suddenly mentioned Greenland. The 1946 offer remained classified until documents were declassified in 1991. But it wasn’t the first time the US had shown interest in Greenland, though. US Secretary of State William Seward raised the idea of annexing it along with Iceland in 1867. Seward had earlier purchased Alaska from Russia in March of the same year. Trump himself talked about buying Greenland in 2019. A Wall Street Journal report at the time revealed the plan. All these offers have been rebuffed by Denmark. In January this year, Trump stated that “the fact that they [Danes] had a boat land there 500 years ago [sic] doesn’t mean that they own the land.” So what’s the legal status of Greenland? The 1933 Eastern Greenland Case before the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) centred on a sovereignty dispute between Denmark and Norway. In 1931, Norway occupied and claimed a portion of Eastern Greenland, arguing it was terra nullius [unowned land] outside Danish control. Denmark countered that its sovereignty historically extended over all of Greenland, supported by continuous and peaceful displays of authority, such as a trade monopoly and granting of concessions. A key diplomatic point was the 1919 Ihlen Declaration, where Norway’s foreign minister had informally assured Denmark that Norway would not challenge Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The PCIJ ruled 12-2 in favour of Denmark by arguing that Denmark had demonstrated sufficient intention and exercise of sovereignty to claim title over all of Greenland. The Court also held that Norway was bound by the Ihlen Declaration and thus obligated not to contest Danish sovereignty or occupy any part of Greenland. The case remains a significant precedent in international law, particularly regarding territorial acquisition, the binding nature of unilateral declarations by state officials, and the requirements for effective occupation even in sparsely populated areas (contrast this with Occupied Palestine). That said, the ruling was a product of a colonial era. Today, the right to self-determination of Indigenous peoples, such as the Inuit of Greenland, would be a central consideration, fundamentally altering the legal context for such disputes. In essence, this means, legally speaking, that any decision about Greenland must come from the Greenlanders and no one else. They have already rebuffed Trump’s desire to take control of the island. But the issue for our purpose is different. Just to recap, my argument is that US hegemony was built into the post-WWII alliance system. So what was the fiction? THE PREDICTABLE FICTION US allies, including Canada, were perfectly fine with the yarn woven by a benign hegemon. As Carney himself noted, it was a predictable system, despite being fictitious. But no one cared because it allowed Canada and Europe to play along, act bigger than they were and are, get prosperous and be protected. For the US too, it was a win-win. Nato is a force multiplier for the US military power and it also provides legitimacy to American power projection. As noted above, the Europeans bring niche capabilities and diplomatic support. Freedom from bearing the full cost of defence, they could focus on economic growth and industrialisation and punched above their weight because of the US backing. In that, they were and are also willing partners in bullying states the US wants to sanction and beat up. Like the child in Ursula Le Guin’s story, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, the town’s (read US allies’) happiness requires the child’s misery. In the real world, that child can be found in many parts of the world: occupied Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Venezuela… the list is long. To be precise, Carney et al don’t want to walk away from Omelas. They aren’t particularly concerned about the misery of the child in the basement of a building. Or to use Carney’s invocation of Vaclav Havel’s green grocer, they don’t want to remove the sign. In the Q&A at Davos after his speech, Carney was far more circumspect, especially when asked about Greenland and Nato. Their concern is how ‘Daddy’ is behaving, mocking them for what the allies really are: subordinates — children who hold cushy jobs in the global US enterprise but must behave if they are to retain their houses and cars and yachts and place on the board. Those, like Iran, who never signed up to the signboard, belong to a different story — the real, sordid one, not the pleasant fiction. None of the US allies is prepared to speak the truth on Iran — at least not for some time to come. But something else has also happened. And that has the allies running helter-skelter. In this fiction there was (and is) one big reality: US preponderance. What if the sudden malignancy of hegemony becomes a practice? While the fiction lasted, no one thought about it. The fact that allies were satraps was only occasionally put on overt display: Suez (Britain/France); Nixon Shock (devastating currency reserves of allies, especially Japan); Kissinger’s 1973 exhortation to allies that they subordinate their regional interests to US global leadership; 1973 oil shock; extraterritorial bullying through the Helms-Burton Act 1996; Old Europe/New Europe statements during the illegal invasion of Iraq. With Trump, it’s more brazen and boorish. If the US is the dominant power and if allies expect it to protect them, why can’t it make some demands? Oh, there’s a bit of a problem. It’s called a rules-based order. Really, thinks Trump. Didn’t I just abduct a head of state? What are these Europeans talking about. They were fine with it. Wait, the rules-based part of the fiction had some reality within the camp. You didn’t pee inside the tent. Now the camp is being treated the same way as others. That sucks. Even if Trump were to be an aberration 2.0, the historical rule has been established. Power creates its own dynamics. That’s the rupture Carney has pointed to. The question is, can Canada, in collaboration with Europe, develop an alternative power pole? Contiguity works against Canada; distance works against Europe. Trump is not the only thing happening to Europe. There are other strands and pressures within Europe that will likely determine Europe’s future and whether and for how long one could use a collective noun for Europe. In October 2022, during the inauguration of the European Diplomatic Academy in Bruges, Josep Borrell, EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy stated: “Europe is a garden. Most of the rest of the world is a jungle and the jungle could invade the garden.” It’s kind of ironic! The serpent is already in the garden and going by the Book of Genesis, he is an irrevocable part of the story of Man. The writer is a journalist interested in security and foreign policies.

      "title": "THE RUPTURE IN THE WESTERN WORLD ORDER",
      "summary": "“This bargain no longer works. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition… You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration, when integration becomes the source of your subordination.” — Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada, at Davos 2026 “After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? But we did it, but we gave it back. But how ungrateful are they now? And then after the war, which we won, we won it big — without us, right now, you’d all be speaking German and a little Japanese, perhaps.” — Donald Trump, US President, at Davos 2026 “If anyone thinks that the European Union, or Europe as a whole, can defend itself without the US, keep on dreaming. You can’t. We can’t.” — Mark Rutte, Secretary-General Nato, speaking at EU Parliament Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney went to the World Economic Forum at Davos and told the world that his country — by extrapolation, all US allies — had lived a “pleasant fiction” that is now over. That fiction was grounded in the assumption that the United States would continue to lead a global order and that such order would perpetually guarantee stability, provide limitless liquidity, and manage all systemic risks. Under this global order, American hegemony would continue to “provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes.”  This does not obtain anymore. For decades, America’s Western allies lived comfortably with a system in which the US was the \n  accepted hegemon and which benefitted them as its satraps. That system is now unravelling \n  because of the brazenness and boorishness of US President Donald Trump and because the \n  allies are now being treated like others were always treated in the Global South. For the first time, Canada and Europe are being forced to confront the fact that power creates its own dynamics… This is where the irony lies. For Carney, as also other US allies, US hegemony worked and made them prosper as long as its application of force targeted states and societies in what we loosely describe as the Global South: Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, to name just the most obvious regions. These are also the regions where a number of states or leaders within those states decided to remove the signboard, to not live the lie that Canada was so content to live with until recently and acquiesced in. Those leaders were picked off — the list is long from Mohamed Mosaddegh to Patrice Lumumba to Ngo Din Diem to Salvador Allende to hundreds of failed attempts on Fidel Castro — those states suffered and most, like Iran, continue to suffer. The system’s power did not come from its truth, but from Canada’s willingness, as also of other US allies, to perform as if it were true. Now, “its fragility comes from the same source”, as identified by Carney. I argue that the challenge faced by the US allies is not that the United States has suddenly become more of a hegemon. The entire post-WWII system was grounded in unequal power distribution and accepted hegemony of the US by its allies. The fiction Carney spoke about was (and remains) an elaborate mise en scène, put together not just by the US but also its allies. In fact, as we shall discuss later, the centrality of a dominant power is the core tenet of an integrated alliance system that must also have a unifying perception of threat and shared values. Carney’s assertion that “when we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness”, and his invocation of Thucydides’ Melian Dialogue are, therefore, about the direction of the exercise of US hegemony, not hegemony itself. What is true, however, is the fact and Carney’s realisation of it, that a hegemon’s intent can change. That is what has happened. To that end, I propose to briefly look at how the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) came about and what exactly is the Greenland issue about. Finally, I argue that, while this moment may not be a Wagnerian frenzy, it could lead to that in the years to come, quite possibly unravelling Europe, which is not a single, seamless entity but a conglomeration of multiple states and ethnolinguistic groupings. EUROPE, AMERICA AND NATO: FROM RELUCTANCE TO PRIMACY What follows is based on a number of works, including those by US international affairs academic Lawrence Kaplan, Canadian diplomat Escott Reid and US historian Melvyn Leffler and several declassified documents from the Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) volumes. Today, Nato is taken for granted. But the idea and its actualisation did not evolve as a premeditated American design. It emerged from European insecurity, economic and military, and involved a drawn-out and complex diplomatic process. The US was still grappling with its new global role and was reluctant to get involved in Europe’s affairs again. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and National Policy Volume II 1947-1949 by military historian Kenneth Condit makes clear that post-war demobilisation had left the US military (all branches) starved of manpower and materiel. A good example of such pressures was the crisis in Greece (Civil War 1946-49) and the decision by Britain to withdraw its troops from there in 1947. The US wanted the British to keep the troops in Greece, even as the JCS’s own study had concluded that “the United States was not capable of deploying sufficient armed forces to Greece to defeat a combined attack by Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria. Any US force sent should therefore be small. It should be solely for the purposes of stiffening morale of the Greeks and of contributing to stability in areas where it was stationed.” The details are too many and complicated. The essential point, however, is that the period from December 1947 to March 1948 marked the critical point where the idea of a transatlantic military pact moved from a British proposal to an accepted, if still vague, American objective. On December 17, 1947, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin made a case to the US Secretary of State George Marshall for a “Western Union.” Bevin’s concept, which he described as a “spiritual federation of the West”, encompassed Western European nations, the British dominions and, crucially, the United States. This entity would be “an understanding backed by power, money and resolute action”, with its essential task being to create a “feeling of security” and the confidence that “further communist inroads [into Eastern Europe] would be stopped.” The US presence in the Union would provide Europe the confidence to resist the Soviet political threat. While agreeing with the general idea and its importance, Marshall struck a cautious tone. He believed the union should be purely European, with the US providing only material assistance. He refused to approve any specific course of action or make public promises. This was in line with the Truman administration’s reluctance to undertake formal military commitments despite the March 1947 Truman Doctrine, which pledged American political, military and economic aid to democratic nations under threat from authoritarian (specifically communist) forces.

In that, they were and are also willing partners in bullying states the US wants to sanction and beat up. Like the child in Ursula Le Guin’s story, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, the town’s (read US allies’) happiness requires the child’s misery. In the real world, that child can be found in many parts of the world: occupied Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Venezuela… the list is long. To be precise, Carney et al don’t want to walk away from Omelas. They aren’t particularly concerned about the misery of the child in the basement of a building. Or to use Carney’s invocation of Vaclav Havel’s green grocer, they don’t want to remove the sign. In the Q&A at Davos after his speech, Carney was far more circumspect, especially when asked about Greenland and Nato. Their concern is how ‘Daddy’ is behaving, mocking them for what the allies really are: subordinates — children who hold cushy jobs in the global US enterprise but must behave if they are to retain their houses and cars and yachts and place on the board. Those, like Iran, who never signed up to the signboard, belong to a different story — the real, sordid one, not the pleasant fiction. None of the US allies is prepared to speak the truth on Iran — at least not for some time to come. But something else has also happened. And that has the allies running helter-skelter. In this fiction there was (and is) one big reality: US preponderance. What if the sudden malignancy of hegemony becomes a practice? While the fiction lasted, no one thought about it. The fact that allies were satraps was only occasionally put on overt display: Suez (Britain/France); Nixon Shock (devastating currency reserves of allies, especially Japan); Kissinger’s 1973 exhortation to allies that they subordinate their regional interests to US global leadership; 1973 oil shock; extraterritorial bullying through the Helms-Burton Act 1996; Old Europe/New Europe statements during the illegal invasion of Iraq. With Trump, it’s more brazen and boorish. If the US is the dominant power and if allies expect it to protect them, why can’t it make some demands? Oh, there’s a bit of a problem. It’s called a rules-based order. Really, thinks Trump. Didn’t I just abduct a head of state? What are these Europeans talking about. They were fine with it. Wait, the rules-based part of the fiction had some reality within the camp. You didn’t pee inside the tent. Now the camp is being treated the same way as others. That sucks. Even if Trump were to be an aberration 2.0, the historical rule has been established. Power creates its own dynamics. That’s the rupture Carney has pointed to. The question is, can Canada, in collaboration with Europe, develop an alternative power pole? Contiguity works against Canada; distance works against Europe. Trump is not the only thing happening to Europe. There are other strands and pressures within Europe that will likely determine Europe’s future and whether and for how long one could use a collective noun for Europe. In October 2022, during the inauguration of the European Diplomatic Academy in Bruges, Josep Borrell, EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy stated: “Europe is a garden. Most of the rest of the world is a jungle and the jungle could invade the garden.” It’s kind of ironic! The serpent is already in the garden and going by the Book of Genesis, he is an irrevocable part of the story of Man. The writer is a journalist interested in security and foreign policies.

      "summary_orig": "PAKISTAN’S boycott of its T20 World Cup match against India raises two fundamental questions: why the PCB took this decision, and what it hopes to achieve by it. The fact that neither answer is particularly clear invites a deeper concern, whether this dramatic gesture was fully thought through at all. To begin with, let’s be clear on a few points. The ICC is controlled by India. It is a governing body that behaves like a wholly owned subsidiary of the BCCI. The ICC does not run international cricket, the BCCI — and therefore the Indian government — does. This is realpolitik. The rule of “might is right”. India is in charge, both as policymaker and paymaster, however you describe it. India’s malign dictatorship of international cricket is to be condemned, just as the previous dominance of England and Australia had been condemned. Today, India is the Pied Piper of cricket, playing a seductive tune that brings the rats of the world’s cricket boards under its control. Something does need to be done, namely ICC’s power and independence must be restored. But is this what Pakistan’s unilateral boycott will achieve? India has a political dispute with Pakistan, which it chooses to operationalise by “boycotting” bilateral series with Pakistan and refusing to set foot in the country. No other nation would be allowed to behave in this despotic manner. We’ve just seen what has happened to Bangladesh . Despotic rule is hypocritical. It is self-serving, and it is brutish. India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole where its money and friends should be The next tier of cricket nations, when it comes to financial might, England and Australia, are reliant on India for their revenues. They have sold their integrity and independence for Indian rupees. The remaining countries are too weak and irrelevant when it comes to tackling the excesses of India’s cricketing hegemony. The same applies to the corporations and the broadcasters who invest in cricket. Without India’s billion-plus population, they don’t have a big enough market. In the world of cricket commerce, India’s gravitational pull is too great. Fans might care about some of these hypocrisies and inequalities, but the global audience doesn’t care enough about whether Bangladesh is expelled or Pakistan boycotts. There is, of course, value in a Pakistan-India contest in a major tournament, otherwise why else would it be a manufactured feature of every single major competition. The match is a money spinner; it is good for India’s coffers. And given the fact that Pakistan seems unable to compete on these occasions, it is a perfect morale booster for the Indian nation, with profit built in. Therefore, Pakistan’s boycott of the India match will hurt India a little. India will feel the pinch in its pocket, and so too will the other ICC members. But that pinch will only be a pinch. India will pocket the points instead and move closer to the next round of the tournament. Pakistan will lose valuable revenue and the points. Would Bangladesh have done the same for Pakistan? It hasn’t in the past. Indeed, considering the long history of India’s unfair sidelining of Pakistan, we know other nations have not and would not do the same for Pakistan. Pakistan is now a middle nation, at best, in the world of international cricket. It does not have financial muscle and it is not good enough on the field to pull other nations to its side. India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole in its pocket where its money and its friends should be. In the language of Donald Trump, Pakistan has no cards. All this leaves Pakistan in a mess. It cannot genuinely hope to achieve anything meaningful as a result of its boycott. The deck is stacked against Pakistan. Principle, then, is all that Pakistan has left. But what is the principle here? If the principle is taking a stand in support of Bangladesh, then it is an empty gesture, admittedly a noisy one. If the principle is to protest India’s long history of mistreatment of Pakistan, the mistreatment will continue. If the principle is to protest India’s unconstitutional rule of international cricket, the cause is just but the means of protest amateurish. What Pakistan really wants here is a shift in the balance of power in international cricket. It is entirely fair to think that must happen by freeing international cricket from India’s grip. But to achieve this, Pakistan requires a long-term strategy with two primary objectives: to become commercially and politically powerful in international cricket, and to become a force again on the field. It might feel good to shout about a boycott, to savour a perceived blow to India’s giant ego, but this is no more than a captive shouting into a straitjacket, or an opiate for the masses. If Pakistan is serious about a reset in cricket’s international order, it must begin by working out how it can become a cricketing superpower again, a superpower that is financially strong and independent of India. Do that and others might follow. Sadly, for the current leaders of Pakistan and its cricket, doing just that seems to be too much like hard thinking. Published in Dawn, February 3rd, 2026",

What Pakistan really wants here is a shift in the balance of power in international cricket. It is entirely fair to think that must happen by freeing international cricket from India’s grip. But to achieve this, Pakistan requires a long-term strategy with two primary objectives: to become commercially and politically powerful in international cricket, and to become a force again on the field. It might feel good to shout about a boycott, to savour a perceived blow to India’s giant ego, but this is no more than a captive shouting into a straitjacket, or an opiate for the masses. If Pakistan is serious about a reset in cricket’s international order, it must begin by working out how it can become a cricketing superpower again, a superpower that is financially strong and independent of India. Do that and others might follow. Sadly, for the current leaders of Pakistan and its cricket, doing just that seems to be too much like hard thinking. Published in Dawn, February 3rd, 2026",
