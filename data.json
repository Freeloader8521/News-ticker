      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said on Friday he is directing the government to stop work with Anthropic, and the Pentagon said it would declare the start-up a supply-chain risk, dealing a major blow to the artificial intelligence lab after a showdown about technology guardrails. Trump added there would be a six-month phase-out for the Defence Department and other agencies that use the company’s products. If Anthropic does not help with the transition, Trump said, he would use “the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow”. The actions mark an extraordinary rebuke by the United States against one of the premier companies that has kept it in the lead on national security-critical AI, threatening to give Anthropic a pariah status that Washington until now had reserved for enemy suppliers. Google and Amazon are among Anthropic’s financial backers. The moves further set a precedent that US law alone would constrain how AI is deployed on the battlefield, with the Pentagon seeking to preserve all flexibility in defence and not be limited by warnings from the technology’s creators against powering weapons with unreliable AI. In a statement, Anthropic said it would challenge any risk designation in court by the Department of Defence, which the Trump administration has renamed the Department of War. “We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government,” the company said. “No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons.” Late on Friday, rival OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, Amazon and others, announced its own deal to deploy technology in the Defence Department’s classified network. CEO Sam Altman on X said the Pentagon shared its principles for human responsibility over weapon systems and for having no mass US surveillance. “We put them into our agreement,” Altman said of the points. “We also will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted.” It was not immediately clear whether these contractual details differed from the red lines proposed by Anthropic. The Pentagon and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ‘Nuclear War’ Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said Anthropic would be designated a supply-chain risk, following an impasse in months of talks on whether the company’s policies could constrain military action. Meeting with Hegseth this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei argued for weapons and surveillance limits and irked Pentagon officials. The Pentagon said US law, not a private company, would determine how to defend the country. The designation could bar tens of thousands of contractors from using Anthropic’s AI when working for the Pentagon. That represents an existential threat to its business with the government and could harm its private-sector relationships, said Franklin Turner, an attorney who specialises in government contracts. “Blacklisting Anthropic is the contractual equivalent of nuclear war,” he said. Similar US action was taken to remove Chinese tech giant Huawei from the Pentagon’s supply chains. Starting in 2017, the US restricted Defence Department use of Huawei equipment, prohibited federal agencies from purchasing its technology, and halted federal grant and loan funds for Huawei equipment. Anthropic has raced to win fierce competition to sell novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of a widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision. Saif Khan, who served in the National Security Council in former President Joe Biden’s White House, said the Defence Department’s action “may be the most draconian domestic AI regulation any government has ever issued.” “The Department is arguably treating Anthropic as a greater national security threat than any Chinese AI companies, none of whom they’ve designated supply-chain risks,” Khan said. ‘Killer Robots’ Tech companies and the Pentagon have repeatedly locked horns since at least 2018, when employees at Google protested against the Pentagon’s use of its AI to analyse drone footage. A rapprochement ensued with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jousting for defence business, while several big-tech CEOs pledged co-operation last year with the Trump administration. But theoretical “killer robots” have worried human-rights and technology activists as wars in Ukraine and Gaza showcased increasingly automated systems. Bolder US military action in the past year has added to these concerns, said Jack Shanahan, who had directed the Pentagon’s algorithmic warfare effort Project Maven. “People might be a little bit more nervous about no restrictions,” Shanahan said. The White House’s legal sign-off could be “top cover for anybody that does anything that would potentially result in lack of due process, civilian casualties, collateral damage.” The Pentagon signed agreements worth up to $200 million each with major AI labs in the past year, including Anthropic, OpenAI and Google. Anthropic, negotiating for awards under that ceiling, had flagged concerns about the legal system’s ability to keep up with AI progress. At present, for instance, US laws do not prevent the use of technology to compile seemingly innocuous data to reveal information about people’s private lives, its CEO Amodei has said. Anthropic’s AI has been in use across the intelligence community and armed services, and it was first among peer AI companies to work with classified information, through a supply deal via cloud provider Amazon.",

Addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Volker Turk slammed “social systems that silence women and girls” and allow powerful men to abuse them with impunity. “Violence against women, including femicide, is a global emergency,” the High Commissioner for Human Rights told the UN’s top rights body. He highlighted the extreme situation in Afghanistan, warning that the “system of segregation imposed on women is reminiscent of apartheid, based on gender rather than race”. He also pointed to two cases that have recently caused shock waves around the world: those of convicted Epstein and of French rape survivor Gisele Pelicot. Both cases “show the extent of the exploitation and abuse of women and girls”, Turk said, asking: “does anyone think there are not many more men like Dominique Pelicot or Jeffrey Epstein?” Epstein associated with the world’s rich, famous and powerful despite his conviction in 2008 to procuring a child for prostitution. He died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while facing trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Gisele Pelicot gave the public insight into her shocking case when she waived her right to anonymity during the 2024 trial in France of her ex-husband Dominique and dozens of strangers who he brought in to rape her while she was unconscious. “Such horrific abuse is enabled by social systems that silence women and girls, and insulate powerful men from accountability,” Turk charged. “States must investigate all alleged crimes, protect survivors, and ensure justice without fear or favour,” he insisted.­ Published in Dawn, February 28th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "WITH a breakdown in diplomatic channels, mainly because of the Afghan Taliban’s lack of will to control cross-border terrorism, and relentless attacks targeting Pakistan traced to its western neighbour, the clashes that broke out on Thursday between the two states were not unexpected. Pakistan had long been warning the Taliban regime to take action against terrorist groups such as the TTP and IS-K based on Afghan soil. But clearly, these calls fell on deaf ears as attacks on civilians and security personnel in Pakistan continued. It is under these circumstances that Pakistan took action on Feb 22 against terrorist bases in Afghanistan. Yet with Thursday’s attacks along the border, Kabul has shown that instead of addressing Pakistan’s concerns about violent actors with seriousness, it has chosen to militarily engage this country, further aggravating already hostile ties. Pakistan has responded to the latest Taliban aggression by targeting military sites and terrorist bases at several locations in Afghanistan. Faced with an obdurate neighbour and an unrelenting wave of terrorism, Pakistan had little choice but to take military action, especially when faced with cross-border attacks from territory controlled by the Taliban. Now that Pakistan has demonstrated its ability to defend itself, and go after those who seek to do it harm, both sides should de-escalate. China has called for a ceasefire, while Iran has offered its good offices to both sides to help bring temperatures down. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has also discussed the issue with his Turkish and Saudi counterparts. The fact is that while Pakistan must defend itself against all threats, in a region already on edge, more war is in no one’s interest. Yet the biggest irritant standing in the way of peace is the Taliban’s stubbornness and lack of appetite to confront the real problem: terrorist groups on its soil that threaten Afghanistan’s neighbours. While some thought that Taliban 2.0 may have shed their rigid ways, these assumptions have proved erroneous. The group seems to have learnt nothing from history. In the past, its refusal to sever ties with terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda paved the way for the American invasion and two decades of war and suffering for the Afghan people. It seems to be intent on repeating this dark chapter by continuing to shield the TTP and other banned actors. Pakistan has strong evidence that TTP and IS-K terrorists based out of Afghanistan have caused havoc in this country, while Tajikistan has similar concerns. Even China has reportedly used diplomatic channels to let the Taliban know that they must take action against violent groups. The need is for an immediate ceasefire and substantive negotiations, with the onus on the Taliban to rein in cross-border attacks on neighbouring states, and end this cycle of violence.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s Afghan policy — an endeavour spanning the more than forty years since the Soviet int­ervention in Afghanis­tan — of supporting a motley crew of local, Afghan and international jihadis in pursuance of its and Wes­­tern allies’ strategic goals, has now come full circle. The relationship betw­e­­en the two western neighbours stand ruptured and completely collapsed; the second such moment, perhaps, after the 1960s when the Afghans invaded Bajaur and Tirah in the Khyber tribal region. Then, like now, border and transit trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan had remained suspended. But this week’s escalation perhaps marks perh­aps the first time since 1992 that the two countries have actually come to blows. While Pakistan’s Afghan policy has seemingly entered a decisive phase, those weary of Islamabad’s handling of its western neighbour are still wondering whether there really is a long-term strategy Such episodes occurred previously du­­ring the tenure of Dr Najibullah, Afghan­istan’ Peo­ple’s Democratic Party lea­­der whose regime would occasionally fire Rus­­sian Scuds into Pakistan’s tribal regions. Diplomatic failures The current state of affairs, in the words of a senior Pakistani official, comes “after fully exhausting all diplomatic channels, including hundreds of meetings with the Afghan Taliban.” Islamabad, the official says, had alrea­­dy put the Afghan Taliban regime on notice, saying Pakistan is tired of lifting coffins and burying its dead because of terrorism originating from Afghanistan. “The October 2025 strikes inside Afg­hanistan, targeting Tehreek-i-Taliban Pa­­­­kistan (TTP) positions, should have made things clear to their Afghan patrons. They didn’t.” Mediation by the Qataris and the Turks, following the October engagements, did­n’t go well: Pakistan demanded written guarantees; the Afghan Taliban backed off from signing a document and confined themselves to verbal assurances. The latest attempt came from the Sau­dis themselves. “It was a positive effort”, according to an official familiar with the efforts by Riyadh to bring about rappro­chement between Islamabad and Kabul, but that too trailed off, predictably. The Saudis had presented a draft of a possible agreement, the official said. The Afghan Taliban regime declined to put anything to paper, offering to provide verbal guarantees to rein in the outlawed TTP and other outfits operating from the Afghan soil. The Saudis — like Pakistan, China and Uzbekistan — have their own respective lists of ‘individuals of interest’ in Afghanistan, according to the official. “The problem with the Afghans is that they want to negotiate, but they don’t deliver. What is the point of talking when you don’t deliver?” the official asked. While the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan remained largely intact last year, attacks by the TTP and other militant outfits registered a sharp uptick, putting renewed pressure on the already strained relationship between the two neighbours. The recent attacks on security forces triggered another round of response, which was to be expected. Strikes were carried out on what Pakistan insisted were TTP bases in the border region, while the Taliban regime claimed civilians had been targeted. But what followed was rather unexpected. Pakistan watched as the Taliban regime amassed its forces in the border regions overnight. It was clear to Islamabad that, this time, it wouldn’t just small arms clashes and skirmishes. Policy makers in Islamabad believe they have garnered moral support from the region and internationally, to defend themselves. Much like the Taliban, who had publicly threatened to unleash a torrent of suicide bombers in retaliation to any Pakistani strikes, Islamabad made it clear it would target the regime’s military installations next, alongside those of the TTP and others. Officials in Pakistan blame the Taliban regime for the escalation. “They upped the ante. We didn’t. We have lost close to 4,000 people. How much more restraint must one exercise?” “This is not just escalation. This is escalation plus,” an official told Dawn. Government officials don’t see an end to the current situation between the two sides any time soon. Meanwhile, those dealing with the subject are now convinced that Kandahar — the spiritual headquarters of the Afghan Taliban — holds little sway when it comes to addressing the issue of TTP and other militant outfits. Aides close to Hibatullah Akhundzada have reportedly conveyed to Pakistan that the Taliban supreme leader does not approve of the regime’s policy vis-à-vis the TTP and others. While some figures within the Afghan regime see Pakistani militants as an increasing liability, it is the more powerful Haqqani-led cabal who could, if it wanted, deliver for the Pakistanis. Know­ledgeable sources insist Islam­ab­­ad is not seeking regime change in Kabul, but they are adamant that Pakistan is currently in no mood to back down. “We have crossed the Rubicon. Keep up the pressure and keep raising the cost until the regime there understands that their policy is counter-productive and non-sustainable.” While Pakistan’s current Afghan policy has seemingly entered a decisive pha­se, many who are weary of Islamabad’s handling of its western neighbour still wonder whether there really is a long-term strategy. There are also many who believe that Pakistan missed a trick working with the Ashraf Ghani-led administration, which in 2019 approved its National Security Paper, declaring the TTP a security threat to Afghanistan and jailed more than 2500 of them. “They understood. It was easy to deal with them”, said one source who experience dealing with the Ghani regime in the past. But a combination of factors — including India’s growing influence and Ghani’s courting of pan-Pakhtun nationalism and larger strategic goals — led Islam­­abad to continue backing the Taliban. “With 20/20 hindsight, backing Ghani’s administration would have been a good option. Pakistan fully backed him in his election. But this is in the past now. We are in a different situation, which requires a different approach. Now that the bullet has been fired, the level of pressure must not be reduced till the Taliban relent and give in.” Published in Dawn, February 28th, 2026",

The Saudis — like Pakistan, China and Uzbekistan — have their own respective lists of ‘individuals of interest’ in Afghanistan, according to the official. “The problem with the Afghans is that they want to negotiate, but they don’t deliver. What is the point of talking when you don’t deliver?” the official asked. While the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan remained largely intact last year, attacks by the TTP and other militant outfits registered a sharp uptick, putting renewed pressure on the already strained relationship between the two neighbours. The recent attacks on security forces triggered another round of response, which was to be expected. Strikes were carried out on what Pakistan insisted were TTP bases in the border region, while the Taliban regime claimed civilians had been targeted. But what followed was rather unexpected. Pakistan watched as the Taliban regime amassed its forces in the border regions overnight. It was clear to Islamabad that, this time, it wouldn’t just small arms clashes and skirmishes. Policy makers in Islamabad believe they have garnered moral support from the region and internationally, to defend themselves. Much like the Taliban, who had publicly threatened to unleash a torrent of suicide bombers in retaliation to any Pakistani strikes, Islamabad made it clear it would target the regime’s military installations next, alongside those of the TTP and others. Officials in Pakistan blame the Taliban regime for the escalation. “They upped the ante. We didn’t. We have lost close to 4,000 people. How much more restraint must one exercise?” “This is not just escalation. This is escalation plus,” an official told Dawn. Government officials don’t see an end to the current situation between the two sides any time soon. Meanwhile, those dealing with the subject are now convinced that Kandahar — the spiritual headquarters of the Afghan Taliban — holds little sway when it comes to addressing the issue of TTP and other militant outfits. Aides close to Hibatullah Akhundzada have reportedly conveyed to Pakistan that the Taliban supreme leader does not approve of the regime’s policy vis-à-vis the TTP and others. While some figures within the Afghan regime see Pakistani militants as an increasing liability, it is the more powerful Haqqani-led cabal who could, if it wanted, deliver for the Pakistanis. Know­ledgeable sources insist Islam­ab­­ad is not seeking regime change in Kabul, but they are adamant that Pakistan is currently in no mood to back down. “We have crossed the Rubicon. Keep up the pressure and keep raising the cost until the regime there understands that their policy is counter-productive and non-sustainable.” While Pakistan’s current Afghan policy has seemingly entered a decisive pha­se, many who are weary of Islamabad’s handling of its western neighbour still wonder whether there really is a long-term strategy. There are also many who believe that Pakistan missed a trick working with the Ashraf Ghani-led administration, which in 2019 approved its National Security Paper, declaring the TTP a security threat to Afghanistan and jailed more than 2500 of them. “They understood. It was easy to deal with them”, said one source who experience dealing with the Ghani regime in the past. But a combination of factors — including India’s growing influence and Ghani’s courting of pan-Pakhtun nationalism and larger strategic goals — led Islam­­abad to continue backing the Taliban. “With 20/20 hindsight, backing Ghani’s administration would have been a good option. Pakistan fully backed him in his election. But this is in the past now. We are in a different situation, which requires a different approach. Now that the bullet has been fired, the level of pressure must not be reduced till the Taliban relent and give in.” Published in Dawn, February 28th, 2026",
      "title": "The Afghan gauntlet",
      "summary": "Pakistan’s Afghan policy — an endeavour spanning the more than forty years since the Soviet int­ervention in Afghanis­tan — of supporting a motley crew of local, Afghan and international jihadis in pursuance of its and Wes­­tern allies’ strategic goals, has now come full circle. The relationship betw­e­­en the two western neighbours stand ruptured and completely collapsed; the second such moment, perhaps, after the 1960s when the Afghans invaded Bajaur and Tirah in the Khyber tribal region. Then, like now, border and transit trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan had remained suspended. But this week’s escalation perhaps marks perh­aps the first time since 1992 that the two countries have actually come to blows. While Pakistan’s Afghan policy has seemingly entered a decisive phase, those weary of Islamabad’s handling of its western neighbour are still wondering whether there really is a long-term strategy Such episodes occurred previously du­­ring the tenure of Dr Najibullah, Afghan­istan’ Peo­ple’s Democratic Party lea­­der whose regime would occasionally fire Rus­­sian Scuds into Pakistan’s tribal regions. Diplomatic failures The current state of affairs, in the words of a senior Pakistani official, comes “after fully exhausting all diplomatic channels, including hundreds of meetings with the Afghan Taliban.” Islamabad, the official says, had alrea­­dy put the Afghan Taliban regime on notice, saying Pakistan is tired of lifting coffins and burying its dead because of terrorism originating from Afghanistan. “The October 2025 strikes inside Afg­hanistan, targeting Tehreek-i-Taliban Pa­­­­kistan (TTP) positions, should have made things clear to their Afghan patrons. They didn’t.” Mediation by the Qataris and the Turks, following the October engagements, did­n’t go well: Pakistan demanded written guarantees; the Afghan Taliban backed off from signing a document and confined themselves to verbal assurances. The latest attempt came from the Sau­dis themselves. “It was a positive effort”, according to an official familiar with the efforts by Riyadh to bring about rappro­chement between Islamabad and Kabul, but that too trailed off, predictably. The Saudis had presented a draft of a possible agreement, the official said. The Afghan Taliban regime declined to put anything to paper, offering to provide verbal guarantees to rein in the outlawed TTP and other outfits operating from the Afghan soil.

Justice Muhammad Asif took up the matter amid a request from the state to transfer the appeal to another bench. During the proceedings, the assistant attorney general submitted that a case of similar nature had earlier been heard by Justice Azam Khan and reques­ted that the present appeal also be placed before his court. He argued that it would be appropriate for the same bench to hear related matters. Rights activists granted bail by anti-terrorism court in two other cases However, the counsel for the appellants, Advocate Riasat Ali Azad, opposed the request, maintaining that no such case was pending before any other court of the country. He pointed out that the present appeal had been heard by Jus­tice Muhammad Asif since its inception and questioned how the government could raise objections to the bench at this stage. Expressing full confidence in the court, Mr Azad urged the ju­­dge to fix the matter for hearing before Eid, saying an early date would bring relief to his clients. Justice Asif asked the state to clarify which case was pending before Justice Azam Khan. Observers present in the courtroom noted that while other cases involving the accused might be pending elsewhere, the instant appeal had consistently remained before the same bench. The judge later rose and proceeded to his chambers after re­­marking, “Let’s see,” in response to the request for an early date. The state counsel informed the court that it had no objection if a date was fixed. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned without immediate scheduling of the suspension pleas. Bail granted In a separate development, Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Abul Hasanat Muhammad Zulqarnain granted bail to Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha in two other cases. The bail was allowed against surety bonds of Rs5,000 each in cases related to an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court and a protest outside the National Press Club. In the case concerning the al­­leged altercation outside the high court, an affidavit submitted by the complainant and Islamabad High Court Bar Association president Syed Wajid Ali Gillani was made part of the record. However, in the controversial tweets case — in which both rights activists have been convicted — bail has yet to be granted.

      "summary_orig": "• Israel’s Supreme Court freezes ban on foreign aid organisations in enclave • US public sympathy shifts to Palestinians over Israel, new Gallup poll reveals CAIRO: Relentless Israeli attacks killed at least seven Palestinians in Gaza on Friday, medics said, adding to a death toll of at least 600 people killed by Israeli fire since a US-brokered ceasefire agreement came into effect last October. Gaza’s health officials reported that in southern Gaza, five people were killed and several others were injured, some critically, in Israeli drone strikes. The strikes targeted two police checkpoints in Khan Yunis and in the Abu Hujair area northwest of the Bureij refugee camp later in the day, medics said. Separately, an Israeli airstrike against a group of Palestinians in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood in northern Gaza killed two people and wounded several others. Ban on NGOs frozen Meanwhile, Israel’s Supreme Court decided in a ruling published on Friday to freeze a government ban on 37 foreign NGOs working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank pending a final decision. “Without taking any position, a temporary interim order is hereby issued,” the court said in a ruling responding to a petition from more than a dozen NGOs, seeking to reverse the ban after Israel’s government revoked their status in Israel. The decision theoretically allows the NGOs to work in Gaza and the West Bank until a final ruling, but aid groups are unsure about the freeze’s implementation. Organisations like MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and CARE were informed on Dec 30, 2025, that their Israeli registrations expired and they had 60 days to renew them by providing Palestinian staff lists. If they failed to do so, they would have to cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, from March 1. The NGOs, through AIDA, petitioned the Supreme Court after losing their charity registration in Israel, following a year-long refusal to disclose their Palestinian employees to Israeli authorities. The court said in its ruling that there existed a “genuine legal dispute” due to the foreign NGOs’ responsibilities to their employees’ privacy under European law. “We are still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate”, Athena Rayburn, AIDA director, told AFP, calling it “a step in the right direction”. Sympathy shifts to Palestinians Separately, a fresh Gallup poll shows that for the first time, Americans sympathise more with Palestinians than with Israelis in their decades-long conflict. The poll, released on Friday, found that 41 per cent of Americans sympathise more with the Palestinians and 36pc sided with Israel, a sharp reversal from just a year ago when Israel led in sympathies 46 to 33pc. For the first time in over two decades, Israel is not leading in Gallup’s poll, though the gap is not significant. Partisan views on the Middle East show more independents shifting towards Palestinians, with an 11-point preference over Israel in the past year. Democrats overwhelmingly support Palestinians, with 65pc sympathising with them versus 17pc for Israel. Democrats blame ex-president Joe Biden for insufficient action to curb Israel’s offensive in Gaza after October 7,2023, escalation. Gallup surveyed 1,001 US adults by telephone from February 2 to 16.

      "title": "Israeli strikes kill seven more Palestinians across Gaza",
      "summary": "• Israel’s Supreme Court freezes ban on foreign aid organisations in enclave • US public sympathy shifts to Palestinians over Israel, new Gallup poll reveals CAIRO: Relentless Israeli attacks killed at least seven Palestinians in Gaza on Friday, medics said, adding to a death toll of at least 600 people killed by Israeli fire since a US-brokered ceasefire agreement came into effect last October. Gaza’s health officials reported that in southern Gaza, five people were killed and several others were injured, some critically, in Israeli drone strikes. The strikes targeted two police checkpoints in Khan Yunis and in the Abu Hujair area northwest of the Bureij refugee camp later in the day, medics said. Separately, an Israeli airstrike against a group of Palestinians in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood in northern Gaza killed two people and wounded several others. Ban on NGOs frozen Meanwhile, Israel’s Supreme Court decided in a ruling published on Friday to freeze a government ban on 37 foreign NGOs working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank pending a final decision. “Without taking any position, a temporary interim order is hereby issued,” the court said in a ruling responding to a petition from more than a dozen NGOs, seeking to reverse the ban after Israel’s government revoked their status in Israel. The decision theoretically allows the NGOs to work in Gaza and the West Bank until a final ruling, but aid groups are unsure about the freeze’s implementation. Organisations like MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and CARE were informed on Dec 30, 2025, that their Israeli registrations expired and they had 60 days to renew them by providing Palestinian staff lists. If they failed to do so, they would have to cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, from March 1. The NGOs, through AIDA, petitioned the Supreme Court after losing their charity registration in Israel, following a year-long refusal to disclose their Palestinian employees to Israeli authorities. The court said in its ruling that there existed a “genuine legal dispute” due to the foreign NGOs’ responsibilities to their employees’ privacy under European law. “We are still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate”, Athena Rayburn, AIDA director, told AFP, calling it “a step in the right direction”. Sympathy shifts to Palestinians Separately, a fresh Gallup poll shows that for the first time, Americans sympathise more with Palestinians than with Israelis in their decades-long conflict. The poll, released on Friday, found that 41 per cent of Americans sympathise more with the Palestinians and 36pc sided with Israel, a sharp reversal from just a year ago when Israel led in sympathies 46 to 33pc. For the first time in over two decades, Israel is not leading in Gallup’s poll, though the gap is not significant. Partisan views on the Middle East show more independents shifting towards Palestinians, with an 11-point preference over Israel in the past year. Democrats overwhelmingly support Palestinians, with 65pc sympathising with them versus 17pc for Israel. Democrats blame ex-president Joe Biden for insufficient action to curb Israel’s offensive in Gaza after October 7,2023, escalation. Gallup surveyed 1,001 US adults by telephone from February 2 to 16.

      "summary_orig": "• Qatar, Saudi Arabia lead diplomatic scramble; Iran offers to facilitate talks • Trump ‘refuses’ to intervene because of ‘fondness’ for Pakistan • UN, China, Russia, UK call for immediate ceasefire ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers said on Friday they were willing to negotiate after Pakistan unleashed air strikes on major Afghan cities, killing dozens in the most serious clashes between the allies-turned-foes, which Defence Minister Khawaja Asif described as an “open war”. The Afghan Taliban, who claimed to have launched “retaliatory attacks” over strikes against terrorists’ hideouts last weekend, said on Friday that they were “ready for dialogue”. “Afghanistan… has always preferred to reso­lve issues based on mutual understanding and respect,” the Afghan foreign ministry quoted Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi as telling Qatar’s junior Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khalifi by telephone. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid echoed that sentiment, saying “now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue”. Key regional powers are also quickly mobilising to prevent the conflict from spiralling. Iran, which borders both nations, offered to mediate. “The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue and to enhance understanding and cooperation between the two countries,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X. Saudi Arabia and Qatar were also engaged in a diplomatic drive to halt the hostilities, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP. “Saudi Arabia, in coordination with Qatar, is making efforts to reduce tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the source said, adding the goal is to “de-escalate the situation and prevent it from spiralling out of control”. Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, in a phone call with his Afghan counterpart Muttaqi, expressed concern over the recent situation. Meanwhile, during a phone call with Paki­stan’s Ishaq Dar, the Saudi foreign minister agreed to stay closely engaged. Similarly, Turkish Fore­ign Minister Hakan Fidan held separate calls with his counterparts from Paki­stan, Afghanistan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia to discuss the conflict, a Turkish diplomatic source said. From Moscow to Beijing, international powers also issued urgent calls for de-escalation. China, a neighbour and major investor in the region, expressed deep concern over the violence. “China supports combating all forms of terrorism and calls on both parties to remain calm and exercise restraint, properly resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation, achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, and avoid further loss of life,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. She confirmed that China was mediating through its own channels and had requested both sides ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and projects. Moscow urged an immediate halt to the attacks and a return to diplomacy. Russia, which is the only country to officially recognise the Taliban government and also maintains good relations with Pakistan, said the clashes were a dangerous development. “We call on our friends Afghanistan and Pakistan to abandon this dangerous confrontation and return to the negotiating table to resolve all differences through political and diplomatic means,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that Moscow was “closely monitoring this situation.” From Europe, Britain expressed grave concern. “We are deeply concerned by the significant escalation in tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan,” UK Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said on X. “We urge both sides to take immediate steps toward de-escalation, avoid further harm to civilians, and re-engage in mediated dialogue.” Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, known for his enthusiasm in mediating conflicts and a strong desire for a Nobel Peace Prize, offered a stance that diverged from his usual eagerness to resolve disputes. In Washington, Trump suggested he would not be willing to step in, highlighting his strong ties with Pakistan’s leadership. Spe­aking to reporters before heading to Texas, Trump was asked about Pakistan’s retaliation to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban. Asked whether someone had asked for him to intervene, Trump said, “Well, I would but I get along with Pakistan, as you know, very well. Very, very well. “[They] have a great prime minister, a great general there … two of the people I really respect a lot,” he said. “And I think that Pakistan is doing terrifically well,” he said. The United Nations added its voice to the global chorus for peace. UN Secretary-General Ant­onio Guterres “is deeply concerned by the escalation of violence we’re seeing,” his spokesman Step­hane Dujarric said. “He calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and he reiterates his call on the parties to resolve any differences through diplomacy.” The International Comm­­ittee of the Red Cross also echoed calls to protect civilians. The organisation’s president has called for a de-escalation of hostilities between Afghanistan and Pakistan, AFP reports. ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement that her organisation was “preparing an operational response to humanitarian needs on the ground”. Published in Dawn, February 28th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The upper House of Parliament on Friday passed a bill for regulating virtual assets as well as the ‘establishment’ of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) — a body already set up under an ordinance approved by the president in July last year. The development comes as the ordinance was set to lapse in early March. The rules were suspended in the Senate to take up the bill, which was moved by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, for immediate consideration. The preamble of the bill, a copy of which is available with Dawn , stated that it was expedient to establish a dedicated virtual assets regulatory authority to licence, regulate and supervise virtual assets and virtual asset service providers to “ensure investor protection, transparency and market integrity in Pakistan”. It further stated that it was necessary to provide a comprehensive legal framework to empower the said authority to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing and other illicit activities involving virtual assets, in accordance with international standards. Regulatory authority The bill provides for the establishment of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, envisioning it as an autonomous corporate body empowered to licence, regulate and supervise virtual asset service providers and issuers in the country. Elaborating on the body’s functions, the legislation says it will “protect customers and investors and the integrity of Pakistan’s virtual asset markets by establishing and enforcing appropriate safeguards and conduct of business requirements, prudential and operational-resilience, risk-management standards, and measures to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit use of virtual assets”. It shall also attract investment and encourage companies operating in the field of virtual assets to base their businesses in Pakistan. Moreover, PVARA shall “promote responsible innovation, digital financial inclusion and the development of compliant virtual asset markets within a framework that manages risks and supports financial stability and market integrity”. The body shall promote, develop, govern, and regulate the adoption, deployment, and scalable use of blockchain technology and distributed ledger technology across Pakistan, the bill further states. The legislation also states that PVARA will coordinate with the Financial Monitoring Unit, National Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Authority and other relevant authorities, as well as law enforcement agencies, to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities associated with virtual assets, in accordance with the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2010, other applicable laws and international standards. The regulatory body will also advise the government on “regulatory, supervisory, technical or emerging-risk matters relating to virtual assets, digital asset markets, tokenisation, stablecoin structures, blockchain, distributed ledger technology, cyber-risks or any matter connected with its mandate”. The bill also authorises PVARA to devise “regulations, standards, directives, guidelines, handbooks and circulars, or any other instrument”, consistent with the objectives of the legislation and other applicable laws. It will also be authorised to set risk-management, cybersecurity, data protection and technical standards and “issue, vary, suspend or revoke licences, approvals or directives under this Act and prescribe conditions for such actions”. The bill further states that it may prescribe licencing conditions, eligibility criteria, renewal requirements and any additional obligations for those issued licences under the yet to be formalised PVARA law. It will also be authorised to conduct on-site inspections and off-site monitoring of licencees and other entities to ensure compliance with this PVARA law and other relevant rules and regulations. Moreover, the bill states, the body may also ensure compliance with “data protection, data governance and cyber security obligations by virtual asset service providers subject to supervisory follow-up”. It will also be empowered to impose administrative sanctions in accordance with the provisions of the PVARA law and “levy such fees, charges and penalties as may be prescribed by rules” devised under this law. PVARA will also operate regulatory sandboxes in a “transparent and accountable manner” and “enter into cooperation or mutual assistance arrangements with domestic and foreign regulators and law enforcement agencies to facilitate information sharing and coordinated action, including mutual recognition of regulations and licences”, the bill states. It further details that the body will comprise a chairperson — who will be appointed by the federal government — two secretaries, from the law and finance ministries each, State Bank of Pakistan’s governor, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan chairperson, National Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Authority chairman, Pakistan Digital Authority chairperson and two independent directors “with proven expertise and a strong track record possessing expertise relevant to virtual asset markets, digital technology and digital finance”. The directors will also be appointed by the federal government. “The members of the authority, other than ex-officio members, shall hold office for a term of three years and shall be eligible for one further term of three years,” the bill states. Penalties The bill states that “whoever, willfully, provides an unlicenced virtual asset service shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term up to five years, or with fine up to Rs50 million, or both”. It adds that whoever conducts an initial virtual asset offering in contravention” of the rules and regulations established under the PVARA law shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term up to three years or with fine up to Rs25m or with both. The bill also penalises market manipulation and insider trading. It further states that “a virtual assets appellate tribunal shall be established and no court shall take cognisance of a legal dispute under this Act or the rules or regulations made thereunder to which the jurisdiction of the Virtual Assets Appellate Tribunal extends”. The tribunal’s jurisdiction has been described as: “Any virtual asset service provider, licencee, or any other person aggrieved by an order of the PVARA may prefer an appeal before the Virtual Assets Appellate Tribunal within 30 days of the date on which the order was communicated.” In July last year, the government had announced that President Asif Ali Zardari had approved the ‘Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025’ to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and cryptocurrencies. However, an official statement from the office of the state minister referred to it as the ‘Virtual Assets Act, 2025’, leading to confusion and concerns about why the draft law had not been moved to the National Assembly or Senate, as required for a bill to become an act of parliament. The confusion was clarified later when the authorities confirmed to Dawn that the regulation was not an act of parliament but rather an ordinance, issued under Article 89 of the Constitution. The provision allows the president to issue an ordinance in urgent matters when both houses are not in session; such ordinances remain in effect for 120 days and do not require passage through the National Assembly and Senate. In November last year, the Senate extended the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025 , for another 120 days.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: After Afghan Taliban forces used “rudimentary drones” to target various parts of the country, a ban has been imposed on flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of any kind across the country. The development comes as several ‘drone attacks’ were reported from across part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Subsequently, during his press briefing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) chief Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry stated that Afghan forces attempted to use “rudimentary drones” to attack areas like Swabi and Abbottabad. “However, the anti-drone system over there and the effective deployment took them out,” he said. According to local reports, at least six people were injured in three drone attacks in Bannu, Swabi and Abbotabad. In Bannu, a mosque in the Mirbaz Barkazai area was targeted by a quadcopter around Iftar, leaving five worshippers injured. The attack occurred in the evening, while people were inside the mosque breaking their fast. The incident in Swabi, which occurred near a girls’ school, was one of the first reported incidents of a drone attack in the area. According to Assistant Superintendent of Police Muhammad (ASP) Numan, at least one schoolgirl was injured, while other children narrowly escaped. The incident occurred in Pabbini, a village located in the mountainous region of Gadoon Amazai, when children were playing near the school. The school had closed early on account of Friday, and the injured girl, identified as Amna, had just stepped out when the drone struck. ASP Numan said that the injured girl was taken to the hospital for treatment, while residents of the village gathered in large numbers at the site of the attack. “It was a self-made drone that also contained explosives,” he told Dawn . Meanwhile, in Abbotabad, no loss of life or property was reported when a drone flying over the cantonment area was brought down by forces around 1pm, the local DPO confirmed. Ban on drone flying In view of drones being used, ostensibly by Afghan Taliban forces, to stage attacks inside Pakistani territory, drone-flying has been banned across the country. In a letter addressed to the chief secretaries of Punjab, Karachi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan as well as the Islamabad chief commissioner, the interior ministry said, “It has been decided to impose an immediate ban on outdoor flying of quadcopters/ UAVs with immediate effect and until further orders.” It added: “In this regard, the provincial governments are requested to ensure strict enforcement of said ban.” Subsequently, the administrations of Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Sindh and Balochistan notified a comprehensive ban on flying UAVs of any sort, for different periods of time. Punjab had already banned the flying of drones and UAVs in its jurisdiction for 30 days, starting on Wednesday. The Islamabad administration banned the use of drones, phantoms and camcopters in the federal capital for a period of two months under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which can be extended for another two months. The ban applies to everyone, except law enforcement agencies and the Islamabad administration. A spokesperson for Gilgit-Baltistan police told Dawn that flying drones had been banned in all districts with immediate effect, on the orders of the interior ministry. The region witnessed demonstrations in favour of the Pakistan Army, and security checking was also heightened following the skirmishes between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Home and Tribal Affairs Department issued a notification banning the use of drones, quadcopters and UAVs for one month, classifying it as a “direct or indirect threat and … potential risk to the lives and properties of citizens as well as infrastructure of the government”. In a separate notification, the additional chief secretary of Sindh also imposed a similar restriction on the use of helicams, drones, UAVs and quadcopters for two months. The ban, however, would not apply to law enforcement or intelligence agencies and would be enforced by local police. The Balochistan home department also imposed an immediate and complete ban on the use, possession, and operation of drones, UAVs, quadcopters, camcopters, and other remote-controlled aerial devices across the province. According to an official notification, the decision was taken in view of security concerns, including the potential use of such devices for surveillance, espionage, transportation of prohibited items and explosives, spreading fear and panic, and disrupting law and order. The measure was described as necessary to safeguard public safety and protect sensitive installations, public gatherings, key personalities, and official convoys. Syed Irfan Raza and Iftikhar A.

      "title_orig": "UN nuclear watchdog report says Iran must allow inspections, points at Isfahan as place of interest",
      "summary_orig": "The UN nuclear watchdog issued a confidential report on Friday urging Iran to let it inspect all its nuclear sites and pointing at Isfahan as a place of interest because of a new enrichment plant and near-bomb-grade uranium that was stored there. The report was sent to members of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ahead of a quarterly meeting next week of its 35-country board, amid nuclear talks between the United States and Iran, the latest round of which was held on Thursday with no breakthrough. Like previous IAEA reports, it could be used by Washington to support its argument that Tehran has not been transparent about its nuclear activities, at a time when US President Donald Trump has massed forces in the region and threatened new military action. The United States and Israel bombed Iranian nuclear sites last June, and Iran has since refused to show what happened to its stockpile of highly enriched uranium or allow IAEA inspectors access to sites where enrichment took place. “While the Agency acknowledged that the military attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities had created an unprecedented situation, it is critical for it to conduct verification activities in Iran without any further delay,” the report seen by Reuters said. Indispensable and urgent Allowing inspections was “indispensable and urgent”, it said. It also said a successful outcome in the US-Iranian negotiations would have a “positive impact on the effective implementation of safeguards in Iran and the resolution of issues described in this report”. The IAEA estimates that Iran had 440.9 kilogramme of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent before last year’s Israeli-US attacks — enough, if enriched further, for 10 nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA yardstick. The agency and Western powers believe the bulk of that is still intact. Washington wants Tehran to give it up. The report provided new details about activity at Isfahan, where diplomats have said much of the Islamic Republic’s most highly enriched uranium has been stored in a tunnel complex that appears to have averted destruction last June. For the first time, the report confirmed that material enriched to up to 20 pc and 60 pc had been kept there. In satellite imagery, the IAEA had observed “regular vehicular activity around the entrance to the tunnel complex at Isfahan in which (uranium) enriched up to 20 pc and 60 pc U-235 … was stored,” it said. The US-Israeli attacks are believed to have destroyed or badly damaged the three uranium enrichment sites known to have been operating at the time. Shortly before Israel launched its attack, Iran said it was setting up a fourth enrichment plant in Isfahan, though the IAEA still does not know its precise location or whether it is operational, the report said. “It is a matter of increasing concern that Iran has never provided the Agency with access to its fourth declared enrichment facility since it was first declared by Iran in June last year,” the report said.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday underscored Pakistan’s resolve to provide a secure environment for Chinese personnel and investments in the country, according to a handout by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The development comes after Pakistan’s security forces launched an operation, dubbed Ghazab lil-Haq, against the Afghan Taliban after the latter launched unprovoked attacks along the border between both countries on Thursday. According to the PMO handout, PM Shehbaz held a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong at the Prime Minister’s House. During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on regional and international issues of mutual interest, agreeing to maintain close coordination and consultation to contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region and beyond. The statement said that PM Shehbaz underscored Pakistan’s resolve to “provide a secure and conducive environment for Chinese personnel, investments, and institutions in Pakistan“. During the meeting, the prime minister reaffirmed the enduring all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China, characterised by deep mutual trust, ironclad friendship, and shared commitment to mutual support on core interests, it added. The prime minister conveyed his warm greetings and best wishes to President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang, and the Chinese leadership and people, particularly on the occasion of the Chinese New Year, the handout said. It stated: “He expressed appreciation for China’s consistent and steadfast support to Pakistan on economic, security, and developmental fronts, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which remains a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative and a cornerstone of bilateral cooperation.” While highlighting the importance of accelerating ongoing CPEC projects, the handout said the prime minister stressed the need to enhance cooperation in agriculture, IT, and mining and minerals. The handout said that Ambassador Zaidong briefed PM Shehbaz on recent developments in China-Pakistan relations and conveyed the warm greetings from the Chinese leadership. “He reiterated China’s firm support for Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and socio-economic development.” China calls for Pakistan-Afghanistan ceasefire Earlier on Friday, China had called for a ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan, adding it was talking to both sides to try to end clashes that have left Beijing “deeply concerned”. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said China was “deeply concerned about the escalation of the conflict” after Pakistan carried out air strikes in Afghanistan, including the capital Kabul. China “calls on both sides to remain calm and exercise restraint… achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, and avoid further bloodshed”, she told a regular press briefing. “China has consistently mediated the conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan through its own channels and is willing to continue playing a constructive role in easing tensions.” The ministry and China’s embassies in Pakistan and Afghanistan were “working with relevant parties in both countries on this matter”, she said.

      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Friday that the Afghan Taliban had to choose between standing with Pakistan or with terrorist organisations. “I want to make one thing clear: the oppressive Afghan Taliban regime has to make a clear choice. The choice is to choose between Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Baloch Liberation Army, Daesh, Al Qaeda, the terrorists and terrorist organisations and Pakistan,” he said while giving a briefing on security forces’ response to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban on Thursday. “They have to make this choice. It has been made clear by the government of Pakistan. It is not something new I am saying … They have to make this choice. Whether they choose terrorists and terrorism or Pakistan. We are clear … Let it be known that our choice is absolutely clear. It will always be Pakistan over everything,” he said. “The Pakistan Army and the people of Pakistan have never hesitated in making any sacrifice for this choice and they never will,” he asserted. At the outset of the briefing, the DG ISPR gave a breakdown of the security forces’ response. “The Afghan Taliban regime, which is the master proxy of all these terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan … that master proxy … came into action last night … along with the terrorists of Fitna al Khawarij ,” he said. Fitna al Khawarij is a term that the state used for banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The DG ISPR said that Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij opened fire and carried out physical raids on 53 locations along the Pak-Afghan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “This aggression was done by this master proxy in coordination, in collusion and in support of a terrorist organisation. That’s what happened last night,” he said. Talking about Pakistan’s response to the aggression, he said: “We were ready.” He said that Pakistan’s armed forces responded “immediately and effectively”, adding that the attack was repulsed at all 53 locations. “They came with armed quadcopters [and] big and small weapons. We shot down their quadcopters and silenced their weapons,” he said. He added that not only were the attacks effectively repulsed, but Pakistan, exercising self-defence, responded and gave a “befitting reply”. Giving details of Operation Ghazab lil-Haq — which was launched in response to the attacks by Afghan Taliban — he said so far 274 Taliban regime personnel and khawarij had been killed and more than 400 were injured. “Seventy-three posts of the Afghan Taliban along the Pak-Afghan border have been totally destroyed. Eighteen posts have been captured,” he said. As per conservative estimates, 115 tanks, armoured vehicles, and artillery pieces of the Afghan Taliban forces had been destroyed, he said. He further said that the headquarters and military installations — which were providing support to terrorist organisations and helped them plan — were targeted and hit. In these airstrikes, 22 locations in Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia, Nangarhar, Khost, and Paktika were targeted, he said. “All these targets were very carefully selected based on intelligence. They are military targets, and great care was exercised so that there is no civilian collateral damage,” he asserted. He said that these targets included corps headquarters, brigade headquarters, battalion headquarters, sector headquarters, ammunition depots, logistics bases, and places providing shelter to terrorists and their supporters. He further said that at several places, the “cowardly Afghan Taliban forces and the khawarij with them” not only fled but also abandoned the dead bodies of their accomplices, which had been “secured” in accordance with the Geneva protocols. He said that 12 Pakistan Army soldiers had been martyred, while 27 were injured and one soldier was missing in action. He then played several video clips of the action undertaken against the Afghan Taliban. He further stated that Afghan media and their proxies were floating lies on social media regarding the targeting of civilians. “At no place was any civilian infrastructure targeted. These are all military targets. These are all the infrastructure from where Pakistan was attacked,” he asserted. He also played a clip showing Pakistan Army soldiers taking down the Afghan flag and hoisting Pakistan’s flag at a checkpost along the Pak-Afghan border. “The nation is proud of these soldiers who have rendered their lives, their sweat and their blood for the protection of the land and the honour of the people of Pakistan,” he said. “Whether on ground or in the air, the armed forces of Pakistan gave an effective, immediate and brutal response; a well-deserved response to the terrorists and their facilitators,” he said. He went on to say that the Afghan Taliban were threatening that they would respond to Pakistan. “We saw that they also tried to use some rudimentary sort of drones for attacking Abbottabad and Nowshera. However, the anti-drone system over there and the effective deployment took them out,” he said. He added that this “again showed” how Afghan Taliban had become a “master proxy”. “It is difficult to distinguish where the Taliban regime ends and where the terrorism starts. The lines have blurred. Therefore, it is necessary to make it clear that if anyone tries to carry out any terrorist activity in Pakistan … its response will be given to terrorists, their guardians, and those who protect them. No place will be safe for them as we also have equal rights,” he said. During the question-answer portion, the DG ISPR was asked about credible information pointing to India’s involvement in the recent attack. “It is absolutely clear that Indian sponsorship, abettment and design are behind any terrorist incident in Pakistan. The base of the operation is… they use the area that is under the oppressive regime of the Afghan Taliban. So that is how they work.” He further said: “Pakistan armed forces … are always vigilant.” In response to another question, the DG ISPR said that the Afghan Taliban regime had signed the Doha accord and had made certain promises “while presenting a different face to the world”. “They made promises in writing. They promised an inclusive government. Is there an inclusive government there? That women’s rights will be respected. Are women’s rights being respected there? Do they get equal opportunity?” He said that the Afghan Taliban had also vowed that its territory would not be used for terrorism. He said that while “clarity” regarding the Afghan Taliban did not exist before, it did now. “We now have supreme clarity. Your civil leadership, your military leadership, your intelligentsia, your media, the children of this country; there is absolute clarity about what the Afghan Taliban regime is,” he said. He said that the whole world was also saying the same. “We are the bulwark state which is standing against this terrorism. It is not only Pakistan; the threat is to the whole region. Not to the whole region [but] to the whole world,” he said. The DG ISPR said that “everyone understands” that the actions taken by Pakistan last night were in self-defence and for the safety of the people. “Everyone understands that,” he said. He recalled clashes with Afghanistan in October last year, saying friendly countries had understood Pakistan’s stance at that time. He further stated that the whole nation was united in the war against terrorism. “Let there be no doubt — whatever political divisions we may have, whatever different political perspectives we may have; all political parties, all political leaderships are absolutely clear that no place can be given to terrorism and its facilitation in Pakistan,” he said. He recalled the National Action Plan of 2014, saying that political parties were behind it. “Since then, all political parties … have always respected, followed, and said yes to this revised NAP, which is now called vision Azm-i-Istehkam,” he said. He also talked about Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, paying tribute to the province’s police force. “Is there anyone who denies their sacrifices and martyrdom. [Is there anyone who] … is not standing with them. No one. The whole nation is together,” he said. “I must take this opportunity to give our biggest homage to the very brave and proud police of KP, which are on the frontline,” he said, adding: “We are proud of them. The nation salutes them.” In response to another question, the DG ISPR said that the number of Afghan Taliban operatives and terrorists killed was 274 as of now, but was “much higher”. “I have said it earlier, that the distinction between the master proxy and terrorists … it has blurred,” he said, adding that they were acting “more or less” the same. He further said that the operation against the Taliban regime was ongoing. “The operation is continuing. It is under the instructions of the prime minister of Pakistan, the civil leadership. And we are achieving the desired results,” he said. He reiterated that the Afghan Taliban regime “has to make a choice”. “They have to choose between Pakistan, and the terrorists and terrorism. Our choice is absolutely clear. Our first and last choice is Pakistan, its security, and the protection of its people,” he said.",

He recalled the National Action Plan of 2014, saying that political parties were behind it. “Since then, all political parties … have always respected, followed, and said yes to this revised NAP, which is now called vision Azm-i-Istehkam,” he said. He also talked about Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, paying tribute to the province’s police force. “Is there anyone who denies their sacrifices and martyrdom. [Is there anyone who] … is not standing with them. No one. The whole nation is together,” he said. “I must take this opportunity to give our biggest homage to the very brave and proud police of KP, which are on the frontline,” he said, adding: “We are proud of them. The nation salutes them.” In response to another question, the DG ISPR said that the number of Afghan Taliban operatives and terrorists killed was 274 as of now, but was “much higher”. “I have said it earlier, that the distinction between the master proxy and terrorists … it has blurred,” he said, adding that they were acting “more or less” the same. He further said that the operation against the Taliban regime was ongoing. “The operation is continuing. It is under the instructions of the prime minister of Pakistan, the civil leadership. And we are achieving the desired results,” he said. He reiterated that the Afghan Taliban regime “has to make a choice”. “They have to choose between Pakistan, and the terrorists and terrorism. Our choice is absolutely clear. Our first and last choice is Pakistan, its security, and the protection of its people,” he said.",

      "summary": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Friday that the Afghan Taliban had to choose between standing with Pakistan or with terrorist organisations. “I want to make one thing clear: the oppressive Afghan Taliban regime has to make a clear choice. The choice is to choose between Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Baloch Liberation Army, Daesh, Al Qaeda, the terrorists and terrorist organisations and Pakistan,” he said while giving a briefing on security forces’ response to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban on Thursday. “They have to make this choice. It has been made clear by the government of Pakistan. It is not something new I am saying … They have to make this choice. Whether they choose terrorists and terrorism or Pakistan. We are clear … Let it be known that our choice is absolutely clear. It will always be Pakistan over everything,” he said. “The Pakistan Army and the people of Pakistan have never hesitated in making any sacrifice for this choice and they never will,” he asserted. At the outset of the briefing, the DG ISPR gave a breakdown of the security forces’ response. “The Afghan Taliban regime, which is the master proxy of all these terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan … that master proxy … came into action last night … along with the terrorists of Fitna al Khawarij ,” he said. Fitna al Khawarij is a term that the state used for banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The DG ISPR said that Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij opened fire and carried out physical raids on 53 locations along the Pak-Afghan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “This aggression was done by this master proxy in coordination, in collusion and in support of a terrorist organisation. That’s what happened last night,” he said. Talking about Pakistan’s response to the aggression, he said: “We were ready.” He said that Pakistan’s armed forces responded “immediately and effectively”, adding that the attack was repulsed at all 53 locations. “They came with armed quadcopters [and] big and small weapons. We shot down their quadcopters and silenced their weapons,” he said. He added that not only were the attacks effectively repulsed, but Pakistan, exercising self-defence, responded and gave a “befitting reply”. Giving details of Operation Ghazab lil-Haq — which was launched in response to the attacks by Afghan Taliban — he said so far 274 Taliban regime personnel and khawarij had been killed and more than 400 were injured. “Seventy-three posts of the Afghan Taliban along the Pak-Afghan border have been totally destroyed. Eighteen posts have been captured,” he said. As per conservative estimates, 115 tanks, armoured vehicles, and artillery pieces of the Afghan Taliban forces had been destroyed, he said. He further said that the headquarters and military installations — which were providing support to terrorist organisations and helped them plan — were targeted and hit. In these airstrikes, 22 locations in Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia, Nangarhar, Khost, and Paktika were targeted, he said. “All these targets were very carefully selected based on intelligence. They are military targets, and great care was exercised so that there is no civilian collateral damage,” he asserted. He said that these targets included corps headquarters, brigade headquarters, battalion headquarters, sector headquarters, ammunition depots, logistics bases, and places providing shelter to terrorists and their supporters. He further said that at several places, the “cowardly Afghan Taliban forces and the khawarij with them” not only fled but also abandoned the dead bodies of their accomplices, which had been “secured” in accordance with the Geneva protocols. He said that 12 Pakistan Army soldiers had been martyred, while 27 were injured and one soldier was missing in action. He then played several video clips of the action undertaken against the Afghan Taliban. He further stated that Afghan media and their proxies were floating lies on social media regarding the targeting of civilians. “At no place was any civilian infrastructure targeted. These are all military targets. These are all the infrastructure from where Pakistan was attacked,” he asserted. He also played a clip showing Pakistan Army soldiers taking down the Afghan flag and hoisting Pakistan’s flag at a checkpost along the Pak-Afghan border. “The nation is proud of these soldiers who have rendered their lives, their sweat and their blood for the protection of the land and the honour of the people of Pakistan,” he said. “Whether on ground or in the air, the armed forces of Pakistan gave an effective, immediate and brutal response; a well-deserved response to the terrorists and their facilitators,” he said. He went on to say that the Afghan Taliban were threatening that they would respond to Pakistan. “We saw that they also tried to use some rudimentary sort of drones for attacking Abbottabad and Nowshera. However, the anti-drone system over there and the effective deployment took them out,” he said. He added that this “again showed” how Afghan Taliban had become a “master proxy”. “It is difficult to distinguish where the Taliban regime ends and where the terrorism starts. The lines have blurred. Therefore, it is necessary to make it clear that if anyone tries to carry out any terrorist activity in Pakistan … its response will be given to terrorists, their guardians, and those who protect them. No place will be safe for them as we also have equal rights,” he said. During the question-answer portion, the DG ISPR was asked about credible information pointing to India’s involvement in the recent attack. “It is absolutely clear that Indian sponsorship, abettment and design are behind any terrorist incident in Pakistan. The base of the operation is… they use the area that is under the oppressive regime of the Afghan Taliban. So that is how they work.” He further said: “Pakistan armed forces … are always vigilant.” In response to another question, the DG ISPR said that the Afghan Taliban regime had signed the Doha accord and had made certain promises “while presenting a different face to the world”. “They made promises in writing. They promised an inclusive government. Is there an inclusive government there? That women’s rights will be respected. Are women’s rights being respected there? Do they get equal opportunity?” He said that the Afghan Taliban had also vowed that its territory would not be used for terrorism. He said that while “clarity” regarding the Afghan Taliban did not exist before, it did now. “We now have supreme clarity. Your civil leadership, your military leadership, your intelligentsia, your media, the children of this country; there is absolute clarity about what the Afghan Taliban regime is,” he said. He said that the whole world was also saying the same. “We are the bulwark state which is standing against this terrorism. It is not only Pakistan; the threat is to the whole region. Not to the whole region [but] to the whole world,” he said. The DG ISPR said that “everyone understands” that the actions taken by Pakistan last night were in self-defence and for the safety of the people. “Everyone understands that,” he said. He recalled clashes with Afghanistan in October last year, saying friendly countries had understood Pakistan’s stance at that time. He further stated that the whole nation was united in the war against terrorism. “Let there be no doubt — whatever political divisions we may have, whatever different political perspectives we may have; all political parties, all political leaderships are absolutely clear that no place can be given to terrorism and its facilitation in Pakistan,” he said. He recalled the National Action Plan of 2014, saying that political parties were behind it. “Since then, all political parties … have always respected, followed, and said yes to this revised NAP, which is now called vision Azm-i-Istehkam,” he said.

Officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using the same technology on loan from the military to combat drug-smuggling, fired a high-energy laser at what they thought was a drone, but turned out to be a metallic balloon. The F.A.A. briefly closed the airspace. In both cases, the lasers were used without the F.A.A.’s approval, which many aviation safety experts maintain is a violation of the law. The latest strike was met with alarm from Democratic lawmakers, and was sure to add to scrutiny of a seeming communications breakdown among powerful government agencies over the use of lasers in sensitive airspace. A preliminary internal report on the incident said Customs and Border Protection had not notified the Defense Department it was launching a drone in that area, so to the military, it was an unknown drone, a Pentagon official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an investigation into the matter. submitted by /u/Hemmschwelle [link] [comments]",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday warned that any further provocation by the Afghan Taliban regime and terrorist groups “will be met with a measured, decisive and befitting response”. The statement came in the aftermath of Pakistan launching Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban after “unprovoked firing” from across the border overnight. In its statement, the FO said that Pakistan’s actions came in response to “repeated terrorist attacks by Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan against Pakistan emanating from Afghan soil, as well as the latest unwarranted and provocative actions by the Taliban regime”. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. It said that the armed forces carried out “precise operations, inflicting heavy losses on terrorist outfits and targeting their logistical support bases in Afghanistan” on the night of February 26. The statement maintained that the actions taken by Pakistan were “in exercise of its right to self-defence and to ensure the safety and security of its citizens, as well as that of the wider region and beyond”. It warned the Afghan Taliban regime and terrorist groups against “any further provocations” in attempts to “undermine the security and welfare of the people of Pakistan”, stating that they will be met with “a measured, decisive and befitting response”. The FO reiterated Pakistan’s desire for “peace and stability” in the region, adding that the country had “remained patiently engaged in political and diplomatic efforts aimed at addressing the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”. “However, it is unfortunate that Pakistan’s numerous goodwill gestures and highly responsible approach were misconstrued, resulting in increased terrorist attacks from Afghan soil, with the active support and backing of the Taliban regime, as well as India,” the statement read. The FO reaffirmed Pakistan’s “strong resolve and determination” towards eliminating terrorism emanating from the Afghan soil. It also called upon the “Afghan regime to end the impunity with which Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan continue to operate from Afghan soil”. It expressed the faith that the international community will “play its role in sending a clear message to the Taliban regime that it must not continue to renege on its obligation to take concrete and verifiable action against these terrorist outfits and end its support for them”. The statement reiterated that Pakistan held the right to “take all appropriate actions in its self-defence and to protect its citizens in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter”.",

      "title_orig": "Senate passes resolution condemning unprovoked Afghan Taliban aggression, calls on Kabul to cease hostile acts",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The upper house of Parliament on Friday unanimously adopted a resolution that condemned the unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban, and demanded that the neighbouring country immediately cease all hostile actions and prevent the use of its soil for terrorism or aggression against Pakistan The House, through the resolution moved by PPP Parliamentary Leader Sherry Rehman, condemned the recent unprovoked aggression and hostile cross-border actions from Afghanistan, describing them as blatant violations of international law, established diplomatic norms, and the principles of peaceful neighbourly relations. The Senate declared that any attempt to challenge the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or national security of Pakistan constituted a direct affront to the dignity of the nation and would be met with a firm, proportionate, and decisive response. “For over forty years, Pakistan has borne extraordinary economic, social, and security burdens in hosting millions of Afghan nationals, extending humanitarian assistance, facilitating peace efforts, and consistently advocating for Afghanistan’s stability in international forums often at immense cost to its own national development and internal security,” it said. It expressed deep disappointment that instead of reciprocal goodwill, Pakistan continued to face hostile rhetoric, cross-border violations, and the persistent presence of anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil, reflecting a troubling pattern of ingratitude and disregard for bilateral understandings. “While Pakistan remains committed to constructive engagement, regional peace, and mutually respectful relations, its patience must not be misconstrued as weakness, nor its desire for stability mistaken for inability to respond decisively,” the resolution said. It demanded that the Afghan Taliban regime immediately cease all hostile actions, prevent the use of Afghan soil for terrorism or aggression against Pakistan, and honour their international obligations and commitments to peaceful coexistence. The Senate also called upon the international community to take serious note of these developments and to urge the Afghan Taliban regime to adhere to international norms and prevent further destabilisation of the region. Speaking in the Senate, Rehman said that Pakistan had exercised maximum restraint and upheld all diplomatic avenues, but recent hostile actions from Afghan soil had compelled the state to respond within the framework of the international law. “The agreements that the Afghan Taliban signed in Doha have now been forgotten. Everyone can see the level of adherence to the commitments made in the presence of important stakeholders,” she remarked. She emphasised that “Pakistan did not close the door on diplomacy at any stage, but was forced to respond”. “Under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, every country has the right to defend itself,” she said. “A fundamental question before Afghanistan is whether it accepts responsibility for its own territory or not.” She strongly rejected the mischaracterisation of Pakistan’s defensive measures. Meanwhile, PTI Parliamentary Leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said, “Pakistan always comes first and that the entire Pakistani nation stands united against terrorism.” He further stated: “In case of aggression, the nation has both the right and the resolve to respond decisively in defence of its sovereignty.” Senator Zafar said that since the birth of Pakistan, two countries — India and Israel had tried to damage it. “These two nations came together and decided a long time ago that they would use Afghanistan’s soil to destabilise Pakistan,” he said. “Today, two well-known criminals of the world, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have again gotten together,” he said. “One is committing genocide in Gaza while the other is committing genocide in occupied Kashmir. Both have declared that they will use Afghan soil for their nefarious designs against Pakistan,” he stated. “If any country commits terrorism on Pakistani soil, then it deserves full and mighty retaliation. No aggressor can be spared,” he said. He said the Senate should use its collective wisdom and go beyond merely passing resolutions and propose practical regional long-term solutions. “This is the Senate’s real job,” he added. Senator Zafar also suggested establishing a permanent regional body, comprising neighbouring and regional stakeholder states, like China, to ensure compliance with a collective security framework addressing terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Such a mechanism, he said, would facilitate coordinated regional action, intelligence sharing, and monitoring of counter-terrorism commitments to effectively address cross-border security threats. He also cited Article 4, which guarantees protection of law and due process, and Article 9, which protects the right to life and liberty. Speaking on PTI founder’s health, Senator Zafar said, “The life, health, safety and release of former premier Imran are matters of paramount importance for the entire nation. “The issues affecting Imran’s health directly relate to his right to life,” he said. Senator Zafar emphasised that it was the state’s constitutional obligation to ensure the proper medical treatment and well-being of a former prime minister. Addressing Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah’s calls for political dialogue, Senator Zafar said that meaningful dialogue required the government to fulfil its constitutional obligations first by allowing the PTI founder’s trusted doctors and legal representatives to be involved in his medical treatment. “If the government maintains that proper treatment was already being provided, there should be no objection to permitting independent doctors chosen by Imran to participate in the process, particularly at a time when national unity is essential,” he said. What is wrong with this request?” he asked. Zafar stressed that adherence to constitutional principles, protection of fundamental rights, and national unity were essential for effectively confronting terrorism and safeguarding Pakistan’s future.",

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: The upper house of Parliament on Friday unanimously adopted a resolution that condemned the unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban, and demanded that the neighbouring country immediately cease all hostile actions and prevent the use of its soil for terrorism or aggression against Pakistan The House, through the resolution moved by PPP Parliamentary Leader Sherry Rehman, condemned the recent unprovoked aggression and hostile cross-border actions from Afghanistan, describing them as blatant violations of international law, established diplomatic norms, and the principles of peaceful neighbourly relations. The Senate declared that any attempt to challenge the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or national security of Pakistan constituted a direct affront to the dignity of the nation and would be met with a firm, proportionate, and decisive response. “For over forty years, Pakistan has borne extraordinary economic, social, and security burdens in hosting millions of Afghan nationals, extending humanitarian assistance, facilitating peace efforts, and consistently advocating for Afghanistan’s stability in international forums often at immense cost to its own national development and internal security,” it said. It expressed deep disappointment that instead of reciprocal goodwill, Pakistan continued to face hostile rhetoric, cross-border violations, and the persistent presence of anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil, reflecting a troubling pattern of ingratitude and disregard for bilateral understandings. “While Pakistan remains committed to constructive engagement, regional peace, and mutually respectful relations, its patience must not be misconstrued as weakness, nor its desire for stability mistaken for inability to respond decisively,” the resolution said. It demanded that the Afghan Taliban regime immediately cease all hostile actions, prevent the use of Afghan soil for terrorism or aggression against Pakistan, and honour their international obligations and commitments to peaceful coexistence. The Senate also called upon the international community to take serious note of these developments and to urge the Afghan Taliban regime to adhere to international norms and prevent further destabilisation of the region. Speaking in the Senate, Rehman said that Pakistan had exercised maximum restraint and upheld all diplomatic avenues, but recent hostile actions from Afghan soil had compelled the state to respond within the framework of the international law. “The agreements that the Afghan Taliban signed in Doha have now been forgotten. Everyone can see the level of adherence to the commitments made in the presence of important stakeholders,” she remarked. She emphasised that “Pakistan did not close the door on diplomacy at any stage, but was forced to respond”. “Under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, every country has the right to defend itself,” she said. “A fundamental question before Afghanistan is whether it accepts responsibility for its own territory or not.” She strongly rejected the mischaracterisation of Pakistan’s defensive measures. Meanwhile, PTI Parliamentary Leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said, “Pakistan always comes first and that the entire Pakistani nation stands united against terrorism.” He further stated: “In case of aggression, the nation has both the right and the resolve to respond decisively in defence of its sovereignty.” Senator Zafar said that since the birth of Pakistan, two countries — India and Israel had tried to damage it. “These two nations came together and decided a long time ago that they would use Afghanistan’s soil to destabilise Pakistan,” he said. “Today, two well-known criminals of the world, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have again gotten together,” he said. “One is committing genocide in Gaza while the other is committing genocide in occupied Kashmir. Both have declared that they will use Afghan soil for their nefarious designs against Pakistan,” he stated. “If any country commits terrorism on Pakistani soil, then it deserves full and mighty retaliation. No aggressor can be spared,” he said. He said the Senate should use its collective wisdom and go beyond merely passing resolutions and propose practical regional long-term solutions. “This is the Senate’s real job,” he added. Senator Zafar also suggested establishing a permanent regional body, comprising neighbouring and regional stakeholder states, like China, to ensure compliance with a collective security framework addressing terrorism emanating from Afghanistan.

      "summary_orig": "Iran said on Friday that in order to reach a deal, the United States will have to drop its “excessive demands”, tempering the optimism expressed after talks seen as a last-ditch bid to avert war. The Oman-mediated talks follow repeated threats from US President Donald Trump to strike Iran, and with the United States conducting its biggest military build-up in the region in decades. Trump, on February 19, gave Iran 15 days to reach a deal, and while Iran has insisted the discussions focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran’s missile programme and its support for armed groups curtailed. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Trump’s negotiating team would demand that Iran dismantle its three main nuclear sites and hand over all its remaining enriched uranium to the United States. Without specifying what demands he was referring to, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Friday told his Egyptian counterpart that “success in this path requires seriousness and realism from the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands”. Following the talks in Geneva on Thursday, Araghchi told state TV that the negotiations “made very good progress and entered into the elements of an agreement very seriously, both in the nuclear field and in the sanctions field”. He said the next round would take place in “perhaps less than a week”, with technical talks at the UN’s nuclear agency to begin in Vienna on Monday. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi also announced technical discussions were to be held next week in Vienna. “We have finished the day after significant progress in the negotiation between the United States and Iran,” he said in a post on X. Araghchi, in a post on X, called the latest round of talks “the most intense so far”. “It concluded with the mutual understanding that we will continue to engage in a more detailed manner on matters that are essential to any deal — including sanctions termination and nuclear-related steps,” he wrote. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi joined the negotiations, a source close to the talks told AFP. ‘Big lies’ US President Donald Trump said in his State of the Union address that Iran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”. He also accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes. The accusations were delivered in the same forum in which then-President George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Iran is “not enriching right now, but they’re trying to get to the point where they ultimately can”, adding that Tehran “refuses” to discuss its ballistic missile programme and “that’s a big problem”. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic Republic was not “at all” seeking a nuclear weapon. US Vice President JD Vance told the Washington Post on Thursday there was “no chance” that a long-threatened strike on Iran would result “in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight”. Parallel to the talks is a dramatic US military buildup in the region, with the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week. Washington currently has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier — the USS Abraham Lincoln — nine destroyers, and three other combat ships. It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers in the region. The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed. However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000 km — less than a third of the distance to the continental United States. A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that the US briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. In January, Tehran launched a mass crackdown on nationwide protests . Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.",
