Two Chinese military planes and seven Russian aircraft successively entered the KADIZ at around 10 a.m. prompting the military to dispatch Air Force fighter jets in preparation for a possible accidental situation, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). They did not violate Korea's air space, the JCS said, adding it detected the aircraft before they entered the air defense zone. The air defense zone is not territorial airspace but is delineated to call on foreign planes to identify themselves so as to prevent accidental clashes. The aircraft, including bombers and fighter jets, intermittently entered and left the KADIZ for about an hour before completely retreating from the air defense zone, a JCS official said. Since 2019, the two countries have sent their military planes into the KADIZ once or twice a year during joint exercises, without prior notice. In the last such incident, 11 military plan",

      "summary_orig": "Aleema Khan, the sister of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, on Tuesday led a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail after once again being denied a meeting with the ex-premier. The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”. Speaking in video statements as she made her way to the prison today, Aleema alleged that the state had been breaking the law, while maintaining that the PTI had done nothing illegal. “If they do operate illegally and we do our work according to the law, and if they are right and we are wrong, then that shows just how our system works,” she said, She then highlighted that Imran has not been allowed to meet his personal physician for the past 14 months. “What is the issue in allowing one doctor to meet Imran Khan?” she asked. “When Nawaz Sharif went to jail, a doctor was with him all day, counting his platelets. “What sort of system is this?” Aleema then exited her car and began to walk towards Adiala jail, accompanied by a large crowd of party members and supporters. She made it to Gorakhpur Market on Adiala Road — roughly a kilometre southwest of the prison — before being stopped by riot police. Sitting at the police barricade, Aleema delivered another statement on video. “This is unconstitutional and illegal. Why are they keeping Imran Khan isolated and tortured?” she asked. “These people are violating the Constitution and breaking the law. “We will not move from here; they can beat us with sticks or shoot us,” Aleema added. “Do what you will.” Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan spoke to reporters at the site and urged authorities to allow meetings with Imran, stating that it would “improve the situation”. “We have a right to come here, and there is a court order allowing us to be here,” Gohar argued. “We had an agreement and a consent order that family and legal counsel could meet him (Imran), but even today, we have been stopped.” “There are a lot of things we are trying to do, but they are not in our control. But if we are allowed to meet, it will improve the situation.” Gohar also said that there cannot be division in the country and while there is disagreement in politics, there should not be hostility. Last Tuesday, Uzma was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as she went inside the prison to meet her brother. When she exited, she delivered remarks on Imran’s behalf, which were later posted to his X account. These remarks were critical of army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and prompted a fiery response from the military’s spokesperson last Friday, who branded Imran “mentally ill” and a “narcissist”. Last Thursday the federal government barred Uzma and others from meeting Imran over alleged violations of the prison code. “There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen,” said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar. That same day, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the ninth time. He addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access and said he would update the media on the future course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not. The next day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “the gloves are off” and that anyone protesting outside Adiala jail, where PTI founder Imran Khan is currently incarcerated, would be dealt with harshly . The minister said that strict action would be taken against any individual who creates a law and order situation outside the prison, including arrests and the registration of legal cases.",

      "summary_orig": "As militant attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa surge, the provincial police force has asked the government to grant a special allowance to its personnel, which would cost around Rs4.2 billion per month. Attacks on police personnel have increased by around 56 per cent during the current year. In this regard, the Central Police Office (CPO) moved a summary to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. The summary stated that the provincial government prioritised the enhancement of police capacity and welfare in view of militancy and security challenges. “Due to the government’s focused efforts and effective administrative measures, not only has the law and order situation improved, but the government’s overall public image has also strengthened,” the summary read. The summary further stated that special financial incentives, such as a militancy allowance, were being provided to police personnel in view of the grave risks, operational responsibilities, and constant exposure to threats they face on a routine basis. It added that these measures were intended to boost the morale of the force and enable them to discharge their duties with greater confidence. The summary further stated that KP police continuously confronted terrorists and insurgents, often at great personal risk, due to their role on the front lines. “KP police have made countless sacrifices, including the loss of precious lives and serious injuries,” the document reads. The department pointed out that police duty in the province remained extremely risky, and exposed personnel to the threats of bombings, targeted attacks and other violent activities carried out by extremist elements. It further stated that the KP police were currently performing their duties without any additional financial incentive, despite the challenging security environment and the operational nature of their assignments, in view of the continuous high-risk duties performed by all cadres of the force. It was proposed that a special allowance, equivalent to one basic pay, be granted to all ranks of the provincial force. “The provision of this allowance will not only recognise the extraordinary services and sacrifices of KP police but will significantly enhance their morale, efficiency, and motivation in carrying out critical security operations throughout the province,” the summary stated. The summary stated that the special allowance would amount to Rs4.2bn per month. Data showed that attacks on police personnel have increased by 56 per cent during the first 11 months of the current year as compared to the corresponding period of last year. Till December 1 of this year, 137 KP police personnel were martyred, while 236 were injured in 510 incidents, as compared to the same period of 2024, in which 147 personnel were martyred in 327 attacks. According to the police officials, the casualties during the current year have decreased by 7pc due to the police department’s focus on strengthening check posts, police stations and up-armouring of vehicles. According to officials, the number of militant attacks repelled at police installations increased by 102pc. Police personnel repelled 320 attacks during the current year, compared to 158 last year “This showed a high level of training, rapid response capacity and effective operational strategy,” an official said. In addition, the KP police’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted 2,791 intelligence-based operations (IBOs), arrested 1,244 terrorists, and killed 420 during the first 11 months of the year — an increase of 61pc and 43pc, respectively. The CTD also arrested 25 high-value targets. On Monday, KP CM Afridi handed over the newly-purchased armoured vehicles, modern weapons and security gadgets to the police at an event at the Malik Saad Shaheed Police Lines. The equipment includes drones, anti-drone guns, anti-drone systems, thermal cameras, jammers, body armour, ballistic helmets, armoured vehicles, sniper rifles, Dragunov marksman rifles, M-16s, sub-machine guns, heavy machine guns, and various other advanced security tools, according to a statement.",

      "summary_orig": "Fresh clashes along the Thai-Cambodia border are being met with grim resignation by civilians, as they flock again to makeshift shelters still standing from the last bout of combat. Displaced children chased each other on the tarmac of Thailand’s Chang International Circuit race track, where hundreds of families were sheltering in vast silo-shaped tents. “I want the government to deal with this decisively so it stops for good,” said handyman Boonsong Boonpimay at the racecourse in Buriram city, 70 kilometres from the fraught frontier. “Otherwise we’ll have to keep living like this — unable to work and constantly on edge,” the 51-year-old told AFP. Thailand and Cambodia have a long-standing dispute over portions of their boundary dating back to their colonial-era demarcation. Residents rest inside a temple after they evacuated following clashes along the Cambodia-Thailand border, in Siem Reap province on December 9. — AFP Five days of combat in July killed dozens of people and displaced around 300,000 on both sides of the border before a truce took effect. But all-out fighting flared again along their jungle-clad frontier this week — with Thailand launching air strikes and Cambodia announcing retaliatory attacks on Tuesday. At least seven Cambodian civilians and three Thai soldiers have been killed so far, according to officials, while more than 125,000 people have been evacuated on the Thai side alone. Chang International Circuit owner Newin Chidchob told AFP he was ready for the surge of his displaced compatriots, sceptical this summer’s armistice would hold. Residents rest inside a temple after they evacuated following clashes along the Cambodia-Thailand border, in Siem Reap province on December 9. — AFP “After the clashes last time, when things quieted down, and villagers returned home, we did not believe it would truly be peaceful,” the former MP said. “So we worked with the province to set up this system and prepare the site, because we felt that real peace or stability was unlikely.” ‘Ears open all the time’ Thai and Cambodian troops laid down their arms in July after intervention by US President Donald Trump as well China and Malaysia — current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Conflict monitors said a follow-on pact failed to adjudicate their core conflict, but Trump nonetheless touted it as a major peace-making achievement of his presidency. Residents take shelter in a bunker following clashes along the Thai-Cambodia border in Thailand’s Sa Kaeo Province on December 9. — AFP Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has said he nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for halting the violence. But cradling her five-year-old son at a makeshift shelter at a temple, Cambodian Ros Sambok lamented how her life was still being uprooted by the conflict. “It is my third time fleeing home, and we have been on alert every day,” the 31-year-old said. “I just want peace so the kids can go to school together.” She fled with around 20 family members from her village, about seven kilometres from the front line, on Monday morning — but her mental peace has remained broken since the original clashes. “I could barely sleep in recent months. Authorities told us to be ready all the time,” she said. “It is not easy. Our ears [are] open all [the] time.” Though divided by a contested border, Thai evacuees expressed near-identical complaints about the conflict disrupting their lives again after a brief interlude of peace. “We live day to day, and we have debts and children to take care of,” said 60-year-old Thai rubber farmer Painee Khengnok, displaced from the borderland where he earns his keep. “Whatever the government needs to do, I just want them to solve this quickly so we can get back to making a normal living.”",

      "summary_orig": "“The echo of the mother’s screams still rings in my ears,” said a cop who was on duty near Karachi’s Nipa Chowrangi on the fateful night of November 30. The constable was at the site when the incident occurred; a three-year-old child had fallen to his death in an open manhole. Ibrahim and his parents were exiting the Chase Department Store in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, from where they had purchased monthly groceries. The father was on the motorcycle, while the mother-son duo followed behind. Suddenly, the excited three-year-old boy ran towards his dad, who was a few footsteps away, but instead of falling into the safe arms of his father, he fell into a pitch-black manhole. What ensued was witnessed by most of Karachi on television and mobile screens: a hysterical mother begging for her child, a search operation that lasted 15 long hours and an apathetic city administration that barely batted an eye. “The manhole had been uncovered for days,” the constable, who wished to remain anonymous, told Dawn as he stood at the same spot a day later. Behind him, several labourers were working to repair the sewage pipes that had been dug up and sliced during the rescue operation to search for the child. Construction work continues at Nipa Chowrangi days after Ibrahim’s death. The manhole, on the other hand, was still uncovered. “ Ab kya faida? Bacha to gir gaya (what is the use now? the child fell and died) ,” the policeman lamented, as a group of nine- and 10-year-old boys passed by. In 2023, some 68 people were reportedly lost to manholes in Karachi. From January to November this year, another 22 people have died by falling into manholes and open sewers, according to data compiled by the Edhi Foundation. Of the latter, eight were children, all of whom were 10 years old or younger. The rescue operation Three-year-old Ibrahim Nabeel, budding with life, the only child of his parents, became the 23rd victim of the year. His body was found almost a kilometre away, the day after he fell into the manhole at Nipa Chowrangi. That fateful night, teams of the Rescue 1122 and Edhi Foundation scrambled through Karachi’s dilapidated underground sewage network that comprises 43 major drains and 516 drain water channels, until the operation had to be halted due to visibility issues. Realistically, the timespan within which a person can be rescued from a manhole alive is two minutes or less. For a child as young as Ibrahim, this window is even shorter. “At 10:29pm, we received a complaint at the Command and Control Centre,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan ul Haseeb told Dawn. By 10:56pm, the first responder unit had reached the site, where a mob-like situation had formed — angry and agitated residents had gathered. A search operation was immediately commenced. “One of our divers went to the bottom of the manhole in which the child fell, but the flow of the sewage water was rapid, and he couldn’t find anything,” he explained, adding that water from four other nullahs was also flowing through the same site. Subsequently, heavy machinery — called in by Ibrahim’s family and locals for Rs15,000 from the nearby BRT construction site — was used to dig into the sewerage lines, but to no avail. The excavation was done 2km along the service lane adjacent to the Chase department store. “The delay in this was caused because we didn’t have a blueprint or map of Karachi’s underground water drainage system.” The rescue team, Haseeb continued, was unaware of the inlets and outlets of the sewage drains and their choke points. “We were relying on the judgment and knowledge of locals,” he said, explaining that relevant departments — district administration, town municipal corporation and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation — were responsible for providing the blueprint. But they were unavailable on the night of the tragedy. Even if they were present, they wouldn’t be able to do anything because no structural documentation exists for Karachi’s sewerage and stormwater network. Eventually, a few hours past midnight, the search operation was halted due to a lack of visibility, which Haseeb said was in accordance with international protocols for underwater rescue and search. The operation resumed early the next morning. “We had positioned our volunteers at eight sewage points along a one to two kilometre stretch of the service lane,” he told Dawn , adding that the child’s body was finally found near the Sir Syed University, around a kilometre from where he had fallen into the manhole. Edhi workers conduct rescue operation to find Ibrahim’s body on Dec 1. Meanwhile, Farooq, an Edhi worker who was also involved in the rescue operation, said that the Foundation received a call at the control centre at around 11:15pm. It took him about 20-25 minutes to gather a team to reach the site, where he recalled Rescue 1122 officials were already present. “We took some directions from them and divided the areas for the search operation,” he said. “But around 3:30am, the operation was halted due to visibility issues.” When the rescue operation commenced again in daylight, Farooq decided that it was time to go down inside the sewage pipes, as otherwise the chances of finding Ibrahim’s body were slim. “After crossing 40-50 pipes, we found ourselves in front of two pipes that were choked with garbage.” But underneath Karachi’s uneven roads, oxygen was deficient due to toxic gases, and with every passing moment, it became difficult to breathe. “So we drilled two holes into the pipes, and as they began clearing, the sewage water flow increased exponentially.” Ultimately, along with the water, Ibrahim’s body too floated out from a sewage drain at a short distance, where a teenage boy identified as Tanveer found it. The three-year-old boy was subsequently moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in an Edhi ambulance. Banners calling for resignation of Mayor Murtaza Wahab hung opposite Chase store. At JPMC, Ibrahim’s grandfather, Mehmoodul Hasan, received the body. The three-year-old’s mother was unconscious, and his father stricken with grief. Meanwhile, relatives of the grieving family, along with residents and political workers of Jamaat-i-Islami, reached the site the same day and held a protest . Murtaza Wahab must resign immediately, they demanded angrily. Later that evening, Ibrahim was laid to rest. Who is to blame? The city’s mayor, on the other hand, only focused on the rhetoric surrounding the incident. At a press conference the same day, he said: “Unfortunately, when this kind of thing happens, we immediately go toward blame […] if there is a human tragedy, then is it necessary to bring politics into it?” View this post on Instagram The nonchalance in Wahab’s tone, who was likened by the Sindh chief minister to New York’s Zohran Mamdani until a few weeks back, was too evident to be ignored. It worsened when a journalist tried to hold him accountable by asking why he was addressing a media talk instead of visiting the family, why he hadn’t visited the site of the incident, and where he was during the 15-hour-long rescue operation. The exchange grew heated, responsibility was deflected, and frustration piled up until finally, the mayor apologised; an apology that was forced, an apology that didn’t sound so sincere, an apology that Karachi has heard several times but lacks any subsequent action. Thus began a blame game. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) blamed the TransKarachi and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line, which blamed the Karachi Water and Sewage Corporation, which said the stormwater drain involved in the incident does not fall under its jurisdiction. A vicious cycle with no end in sight. Dawn reached out to Murtaza Wahab but did not hear back from him until the filing of the story. Today, six days after the incident, authorities have failed to determine who is responsible for leaving the manhole open. But Dawn found that the KMC had already been alerted to the manhole problem between Hassan Square and Nipa Chowrangi on October 20. “We wrote three letters to the mayor and the chief minister this year regarding the problems caused due to the BRT construction work (traffic, open sewers, holey roads),” said Riaz Azhar, the UC chairman of the locality. “But we never received any response.” Finally, on Oct 20, Azhar met with the BRT committee to discuss the aforementioned issues, after which a document detailing the minutes of the meeting was sent to the KMC. The second pointer of the document, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said: “covered all manholes through rings and covers on service lanes (at Asr-e-Shirin shop block 13-A). No output.” In a response on Oct 29, Azhar was told that the contractor assigned for manhole covers had fled due to a dispute, and there was nothing that could be done. “A month later, a child was gulped down,” he said. “Had the chief minister and mayor acted on time, a tragedy of such a proportion could have been prevented.” He explained that the KWSC, headed by Mayor Wahab, was responsible for all sewage-related concerns, for which it had launched a 1334 helpline. “Unfortunately, it was only responsive for so long.” A few years back, the UC-02 chairman recalled, the KWSC provided 20-25 manhole covers per month to each union committee free of cost. But the process is usually so long and tedious that it is preferred to purchase the covers from the market, where they cost Rs700, Azhar said. Following the Nipa manhole incident, the KMC approved a day earlier nearly Rs300 million per year —Rs100,000 per month each — for all union committees to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights. When asked why the UC did not purchase a manhole cover for the one in which Ibrahim fell, the chairman lamented, “How would we know which manhole is missing where?” He further explained that each UC was given a monthly fund of Rs1.2 million, half of which was spent on salaries. The other half was used for contracts and quotations — each of which cost Rs300,000 — and the remaining was spent on bills. Separately, the expenditure for each of the four UC wards was Rs25,000. “And when we use our own funds for any such repairs, we are reprimanded for it by the KMC,” Azhar added. However, he did admit that the town chairman, who had reached the incident site at 11pm on the night of Nov 30, should have made efforts to expedite the rescue operation instead of waiting for the machinery to be arranged. For its part, the KWSC spokesperson Abdul Qadir Sheikh told Dawn that they had a comprehensive complaint management system where anyone — from the city and town council to ordinary citizens — could lodge their queries by calling the helpline. The aim, according to Sheikh, was to resolve them at the earliest. He, however, did not admit or deny whether a complaint, as mentioned by Azhar, was sent to the KWSC regarding the missing manhole covers. To another question, Sheikh concurred that 25 manhole covers were indeed provided to the UC. “In the case of a need for more, they can write to the concerned department.” He explained that apart from the complaints, executive engineers also undertook efforts to ensure that all manholes were covered in their respective areas. From Oct 23, 2024, to Dec 1, 2025, the KWSC received a total of 1,543 complaints regarding open manholes, of which 89.94 per cent were resolved, data provided by the corporation showed. In the Gulshan-i-Iqbal Town, 107 out of 110 such queries were resolved. Ibrahim fell into one of the three remaining manholes. “I don’t want to place responsibility on any one department; we are all to blame for it … nothing is dearer to us more than the people of Karachi,” Sheikh remarked. But when asked if an internal inquiry or investigation had been initiated by the KWSC to determine why the manhole in question was left open, he did not have an answer. Meanwhile, UC Chairman Azhar, after complaining about the state of affairs, held Ibrahim’s parents and the Chase department store responsible. “They [the parents] should have been more careful, and the department store, where hundreds and thousands of people come every day, should have installed a manhole.” “Should have been more responsible” — the phrase is Karachi’s favourite absolution. A dumper truck crushes a motorcyclist? The driver should have been careful . A child goes missing? The family should have been careful . A three-year-old slips from his mother’s hand and disappears into an open manhole within seconds? The parents, too, should have been careful . Ultimately, all Karachiites must be “careful” because the responsibility of their well-being does not lie with those who build, manage or govern the city — instead, it lies with the people who are simply trying to live in it. Where safety depends not on systems, but luck. Where we tell parents, pedestrians, and drivers to be vigilant — because the city will not be vigilant for them. Here, you survive if you can. And if you don’t, well … you should have been more “careful”. The systematic collapse Karachi’s pressing infrastructural gaps are not a new topic of discussion. Unfortunately, they are only brought up when a life is lost, especially that of a three-year-old innocent child. The pattern is almost recognisable now: visit the victims with photographers and videographers in tow, feign empathy and concern, sack a bunch of ‘not so important’ officials, and give it a few days until the incident fades into a painful memory. Or better yet, turn it into a controversy. In the case of this one, a grieving grandfather’s love was questioned, as he had to sit before the media and clarify that he did not take any money from the KMC for issuing statements in favour of them. @timesofkarachi The grandfather of three-year-old Ibrahim has rejected claims made in the media regarding the Nipa Chowrangi manhole incident, stating that he never confirmed that Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) recovered the child’s body. TOKReports Ibrahim NipaIncident ♬ original sound - Times of Karachi - Times of Karachi “All institutions linked to this tragedy are responsible,” he stressed by the end of his media talk. The institutions he referred to are the confluence of Karachi’s three-tier local government structure, which comprises about 250 UCs, 25 town municipal corporations, and the KMC — read mayor — that reigns above them all. Within this organogram are also various state institutions that are a part of the structure: here, the KWSC. “Open manholes are essentially reflective of a systematic failure,” said urban planner Bilal Khalid. “It is not a one-off incident.” He explained that a missing manhole is a problem that lies right at the local level because it exists in gallis and muhallas. And it should be solved by the UC, because the people higher up in the hierarchy have a broader scope of work. “You cannot expect the mayor to personally ensure that every manhole is covered, and this is why UCs exist.” But here, the power was never devolved, and so, the mayor is responsible because he is the head of the KWSC, which looks after all sewage-related matters. “It is simple: a manhole is missing, the UC chairman is told, he collects a cover from the council inventory and gets it installed.” Instead, what happens is that even if the UC is told of a missing manhole, he will first have to file a complaint at the KWSC office because neither the TMC nor the KMC have the authority to solve the issue. “The hierarchy that is shown to you or any other citizen of Karachi is far from the ground reality. “The solution is very clear: the devolution of power. In this case, the best solution can come from the local representatives.” He emphasised that the authority for local muhalla -related matters should lie with the TMC, terming it “crucial”. It should be authorised, funded and provided with inventory, among other things. Khalid added that regular monitoring by TMCs would ultimately lead to mapping of sewage and water lines, which is the most critical for Karachi. “This is something that the KWSC cannot do because it does not have localised wings.” Urban planner Farhan Anwar concurred. He termed young Ibrahim’s death “symbolic of a larger level of institutional bankruptcy that presently defines Karachi’s governance construct”, a problem that has existed in the port city of 20.3 million residents for years. “Years of political battles over control of power and resources have rendered all our institutions impotent,” he deplored. “It is like flogging a dead horse because the mandate of these institutions has been twisted completely.” Basically, the merit and capacity required to solve Karachi’s issues have eluded key organisations. Despite housing a big chunk of the country’s economic and human capital, the city lacks people-centric planning and development, he explained. “The problems are political, the problems are institutional, the problems are related to a complete dysfunctionality that exists within the governance construct of Karachi.” The only solutions, he went on to say, lie at the political level. “There has to be a show of strong political will to completely redo and overhaul the governance architecture in Karachi, whereby the relevant institutions are given the power, authority, and functions that are relevant at that tier/level.” The manhole in which Ibrahim fell. Ibrahim did not die because of one missing manhole cover. He died because Karachi is governed by institutions built to fight each other rather than serve the people who live in . What’s needed is not another committee, another apology, or another reshuffling of duties. It is the political will to return power to the level where problems actually exist — the street, the lane, the neighbourhood. Without that, no document, no plan, and no new model of manhole will save lives. Because in Karachi, people do not fall into manholes — they fall through the gaps of a system that refuses to hold itself accountable.",

Khalid added that regular monitoring by TMCs would ultimately lead to mapping of sewage and water lines, which is the most critical for Karachi. “This is something that the KWSC cannot do because it does not have localised wings.” Urban planner Farhan Anwar concurred. He termed young Ibrahim’s death “symbolic of a larger level of institutional bankruptcy that presently defines Karachi’s governance construct”, a problem that has existed in the port city of 20.3 million residents for years. “Years of political battles over control of power and resources have rendered all our institutions impotent,” he deplored. “It is like flogging a dead horse because the mandate of these institutions has been twisted completely.” Basically, the merit and capacity required to solve Karachi’s issues have eluded key organisations. Despite housing a big chunk of the country’s economic and human capital, the city lacks people-centric planning and development, he explained. “The problems are political, the problems are institutional, the problems are related to a complete dysfunctionality that exists within the governance construct of Karachi.” The only solutions, he went on to say, lie at the political level. “There has to be a show of strong political will to completely redo and overhaul the governance architecture in Karachi, whereby the relevant institutions are given the power, authority, and functions that are relevant at that tier/level.” The manhole in which Ibrahim fell. Ibrahim did not die because of one missing manhole cover. He died because Karachi is governed by institutions built to fight each other rather than serve the people who live in . What’s needed is not another committee, another apology, or another reshuffling of duties. It is the political will to return power to the level where problems actually exist — the street, the lane, the neighbourhood. Without that, no document, no plan, and no new model of manhole will save lives. Because in Karachi, people do not fall into manholes — they fall through the gaps of a system that refuses to hold itself accountable.",

      "summary": "“The echo of the mother’s screams still rings in my ears,” said a cop who was on duty near Karachi’s Nipa Chowrangi on the fateful night of November 30. The constable was at the site when the incident occurred; a three-year-old child had fallen to his death in an open manhole. Ibrahim and his parents were exiting the Chase Department Store in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, from where they had purchased monthly groceries. The father was on the motorcycle, while the mother-son duo followed behind. Suddenly, the excited three-year-old boy ran towards his dad, who was a few footsteps away, but instead of falling into the safe arms of his father, he fell into a pitch-black manhole. What ensued was witnessed by most of Karachi on television and mobile screens: a hysterical mother begging for her child, a search operation that lasted 15 long hours and an apathetic city administration that barely batted an eye. “The manhole had been uncovered for days,” the constable, who wished to remain anonymous, told Dawn as he stood at the same spot a day later. Behind him, several labourers were working to repair the sewage pipes that had been dug up and sliced during the rescue operation to search for the child. Construction work continues at Nipa Chowrangi days after Ibrahim’s death. The manhole, on the other hand, was still uncovered. “ Ab kya faida? Bacha to gir gaya (what is the use now? the child fell and died) ,” the policeman lamented, as a group of nine- and 10-year-old boys passed by. In 2023, some 68 people were reportedly lost to manholes in Karachi. From January to November this year, another 22 people have died by falling into manholes and open sewers, according to data compiled by the Edhi Foundation. Of the latter, eight were children, all of whom were 10 years old or younger. The rescue operation Three-year-old Ibrahim Nabeel, budding with life, the only child of his parents, became the 23rd victim of the year. His body was found almost a kilometre away, the day after he fell into the manhole at Nipa Chowrangi. That fateful night, teams of the Rescue 1122 and Edhi Foundation scrambled through Karachi’s dilapidated underground sewage network that comprises 43 major drains and 516 drain water channels, until the operation had to be halted due to visibility issues. Realistically, the timespan within which a person can be rescued from a manhole alive is two minutes or less. For a child as young as Ibrahim, this window is even shorter. “At 10:29pm, we received a complaint at the Command and Control Centre,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan ul Haseeb told Dawn. By 10:56pm, the first responder unit had reached the site, where a mob-like situation had formed — angry and agitated residents had gathered. A search operation was immediately commenced. “One of our divers went to the bottom of the manhole in which the child fell, but the flow of the sewage water was rapid, and he couldn’t find anything,” he explained, adding that water from four other nullahs was also flowing through the same site. Subsequently, heavy machinery — called in by Ibrahim’s family and locals for Rs15,000 from the nearby BRT construction site — was used to dig into the sewerage lines, but to no avail. The excavation was done 2km along the service lane adjacent to the Chase department store. “The delay in this was caused because we didn’t have a blueprint or map of Karachi’s underground water drainage system.” The rescue team, Haseeb continued, was unaware of the inlets and outlets of the sewage drains and their choke points. “We were relying on the judgment and knowledge of locals,” he said, explaining that relevant departments — district administration, town municipal corporation and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation — were responsible for providing the blueprint. But they were unavailable on the night of the tragedy. Even if they were present, they wouldn’t be able to do anything because no structural documentation exists for Karachi’s sewerage and stormwater network. Eventually, a few hours past midnight, the search operation was halted due to a lack of visibility, which Haseeb said was in accordance with international protocols for underwater rescue and search. The operation resumed early the next morning. “We had positioned our volunteers at eight sewage points along a one to two kilometre stretch of the service lane,” he told Dawn , adding that the child’s body was finally found near the Sir Syed University, around a kilometre from where he had fallen into the manhole. Edhi workers conduct rescue operation to find Ibrahim’s body on Dec 1. Meanwhile, Farooq, an Edhi worker who was also involved in the rescue operation, said that the Foundation received a call at the control centre at around 11:15pm. It took him about 20-25 minutes to gather a team to reach the site, where he recalled Rescue 1122 officials were already present. “We took some directions from them and divided the areas for the search operation,” he said. “But around 3:30am, the operation was halted due to visibility issues.” When the rescue operation commenced again in daylight, Farooq decided that it was time to go down inside the sewage pipes, as otherwise the chances of finding Ibrahim’s body were slim. “After crossing 40-50 pipes, we found ourselves in front of two pipes that were choked with garbage.” But underneath Karachi’s uneven roads, oxygen was deficient due to toxic gases, and with every passing moment, it became difficult to breathe. “So we drilled two holes into the pipes, and as they began clearing, the sewage water flow increased exponentially.” Ultimately, along with the water, Ibrahim’s body too floated out from a sewage drain at a short distance, where a teenage boy identified as Tanveer found it. The three-year-old boy was subsequently moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in an Edhi ambulance. Banners calling for resignation of Mayor Murtaza Wahab hung opposite Chase store. At JPMC, Ibrahim’s grandfather, Mehmoodul Hasan, received the body. The three-year-old’s mother was unconscious, and his father stricken with grief. Meanwhile, relatives of the grieving family, along with residents and political workers of Jamaat-i-Islami, reached the site the same day and held a protest . Murtaza Wahab must resign immediately, they demanded angrily. Later that evening, Ibrahim was laid to rest. Who is to blame? The city’s mayor, on the other hand, only focused on the rhetoric surrounding the incident. At a press conference the same day, he said: “Unfortunately, when this kind of thing happens, we immediately go toward blame […] if there is a human tragedy, then is it necessary to bring politics into it?” View this post on Instagram The nonchalance in Wahab’s tone, who was likened by the Sindh chief minister to New York’s Zohran Mamdani until a few weeks back, was too evident to be ignored. It worsened when a journalist tried to hold him accountable by asking why he was addressing a media talk instead of visiting the family, why he hadn’t visited the site of the incident, and where he was during the 15-hour-long rescue operation. The exchange grew heated, responsibility was deflected, and frustration piled up until finally, the mayor apologised; an apology that was forced, an apology that didn’t sound so sincere, an apology that Karachi has heard several times but lacks any subsequent action. Thus began a blame game. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) blamed the TransKarachi and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line, which blamed the Karachi Water and Sewage Corporation, which said the stormwater drain involved in the incident does not fall under its jurisdiction. A vicious cycle with no end in sight. Dawn reached out to Murtaza Wahab but did not hear back from him until the filing of the story. Today, six days after the incident, authorities have failed to determine who is responsible for leaving the manhole open. But Dawn found that the KMC had already been alerted to the manhole problem between Hassan Square and Nipa Chowrangi on October 20. “We wrote three letters to the mayor and the chief minister this year regarding the problems caused due to the BRT construction work (traffic, open sewers, holey roads),” said Riaz Azhar, the UC chairman of the locality. “But we never received any response.” Finally, on Oct 20, Azhar met with the BRT committee to discuss the aforementioned issues, after which a document detailing the minutes of the meeting was sent to the KMC. The second pointer of the document, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said: “covered all manholes through rings and covers on service lanes (at Asr-e-Shirin shop block 13-A). No output.” In a response on Oct 29, Azhar was told that the contractor assigned for manhole covers had fled due to a dispute, and there was nothing that could be done. “A month later, a child was gulped down,” he said. “Had the chief minister and mayor acted on time, a tragedy of such a proportion could have been prevented.” He explained that the KWSC, headed by Mayor Wahab, was responsible for all sewage-related concerns, for which it had launched a 1334 helpline. “Unfortunately, it was only responsive for so long.” A few years back, the UC-02 chairman recalled, the KWSC provided 20-25 manhole covers per month to each union committee free of cost. But the process is usually so long and tedious that it is preferred to purchase the covers from the market, where they cost Rs700, Azhar said. Following the Nipa manhole incident, the KMC approved a day earlier nearly Rs300 million per year —Rs100,000 per month each — for all union committees to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights. When asked why the UC did not purchase a manhole cover for the one in which Ibrahim fell, the chairman lamented, “How would we know which manhole is missing where?” He further explained that each UC was given a monthly fund of Rs1.2 million, half of which was spent on salaries. The other half was used for contracts and quotations — each of which cost Rs300,000 — and the remaining was spent on bills. Separately, the expenditure for each of the four UC wards was Rs25,000. “And when we use our own funds for any such repairs, we are reprimanded for it by the KMC,” Azhar added. However, he did admit that the town chairman, who had reached the incident site at 11pm on the night of Nov 30, should have made efforts to expedite the rescue operation instead of waiting for the machinery to be arranged. For its part, the KWSC spokesperson Abdul Qadir Sheikh told Dawn that they had a comprehensive complaint management system where anyone — from the city and town council to ordinary citizens — could lodge their queries by calling the helpline. The aim, according to Sheikh, was to resolve them at the earliest. He, however, did not admit or deny whether a complaint, as mentioned by Azhar, was sent to the KWSC regarding the missing manhole covers. To another question, Sheikh concurred that 25 manhole covers were indeed provided to the UC. “In the case of a need for more, they can write to the concerned department.” He explained that apart from the complaints, executive engineers also undertook efforts to ensure that all manholes were covered in their respective areas. From Oct 23, 2024, to Dec 1, 2025, the KWSC received a total of 1,543 complaints regarding open manholes, of which 89.94 per cent were resolved, data provided by the corporation showed. In the Gulshan-i-Iqbal Town, 107 out of 110 such queries were resolved. Ibrahim fell into one of the three remaining manholes. “I don’t want to place responsibility on any one department; we are all to blame for it … nothing is dearer to us more than the people of Karachi,” Sheikh remarked. But when asked if an internal inquiry or investigation had been initiated by the KWSC to determine why the manhole in question was left open, he did not have an answer. Meanwhile, UC Chairman Azhar, after complaining about the state of affairs, held Ibrahim’s parents and the Chase department store responsible. “They [the parents] should have been more careful, and the department store, where hundreds and thousands of people come every day, should have installed a manhole.” “Should have been more responsible” — the phrase is Karachi’s favourite absolution. A dumper truck crushes a motorcyclist? The driver should have been careful . A child goes missing? The family should have been careful . A three-year-old slips from his mother’s hand and disappears into an open manhole within seconds? The parents, too, should have been careful . Ultimately, all Karachiites must be “careful” because the responsibility of their well-being does not lie with those who build, manage or govern the city — instead, it lies with the people who are simply trying to live in it. Where safety depends not on systems, but luck. Where we tell parents, pedestrians, and drivers to be vigilant — because the city will not be vigilant for them. Here, you survive if you can. And if you don’t, well … you should have been more “careful”. The systematic collapse Karachi’s pressing infrastructural gaps are not a new topic of discussion. Unfortunately, they are only brought up when a life is lost, especially that of a three-year-old innocent child. The pattern is almost recognisable now: visit the victims with photographers and videographers in tow, feign empathy and concern, sack a bunch of ‘not so important’ officials, and give it a few days until the incident fades into a painful memory. Or better yet, turn it into a controversy. In the case of this one, a grieving grandfather’s love was questioned, as he had to sit before the media and clarify that he did not take any money from the KMC for issuing statements in favour of them. @timesofkarachi The grandfather of three-year-old Ibrahim has rejected claims made in the media regarding the Nipa Chowrangi manhole incident, stating that he never confirmed that Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) recovered the child’s body. TOKReports Ibrahim NipaIncident ♬ original sound - Times of Karachi - Times of Karachi “All institutions linked to this tragedy are responsible,” he stressed by the end of his media talk. The institutions he referred to are the confluence of Karachi’s three-tier local government structure, which comprises about 250 UCs, 25 town municipal corporations, and the KMC — read mayor — that reigns above them all. Within this organogram are also various state institutions that are a part of the structure: here, the KWSC. “Open manholes are essentially reflective of a systematic failure,” said urban planner Bilal Khalid. “It is not a one-off incident.” He explained that a missing manhole is a problem that lies right at the local level because it exists in gallis and muhallas. And it should be solved by the UC, because the people higher up in the hierarchy have a broader scope of work. “You cannot expect the mayor to personally ensure that every manhole is covered, and this is why UCs exist.” But here, the power was never devolved, and so, the mayor is responsible because he is the head of the KWSC, which looks after all sewage-related matters. “It is simple: a manhole is missing, the UC chairman is told, he collects a cover from the council inventory and gets it installed.” Instead, what happens is that even if the UC is told of a missing manhole, he will first have to file a complaint at the KWSC office because neither the TMC nor the KMC have the authority to solve the issue. “The hierarchy that is shown to you or any other citizen of Karachi is far from the ground reality. “The solution is very clear: the devolution of power. In this case, the best solution can come from the local representatives.” He emphasised that the authority for local muhalla -related matters should lie with the TMC, terming it “crucial”. It should be authorised, funded and provided with inventory, among other things. Khalid added that regular monitoring by TMCs would ultimately lead to mapping of sewage and water lines, which is the most critical for Karachi. “This is something that the KWSC cannot do because it does not have localised wings.” Urban planner Farhan Anwar concurred.

The move comes after Texas Governor Greg Abbott last month designated the CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood as foreign terrorist and transnational criminal organisations. Since then, US President Donald Trump has also issued an executive order directing agencies to initiate the formal process for designating certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organisations. According to Fox News , Florida’s designation of the CAIR is at the state level.

In a post on X, the Florida governor said, “Florida is designating the Muslim Brotherhood and the CAIR as foreign terrorist organisations. “Florida agencies are hereby directed to undertake all lawful measures to prevent unlawful activities by these organisations, including denying privileges or resources to anyone providing material support,” he said in the post, which also shared images of the governor’s executive order. In response, the CAIR and its Florida chapter announced that a lawsuit would be filed against DeSantis in response to his “defamatory and unconstitutional” order. “From the moment Ron DeSantis took office as Florida governor, he has prioritized serving the Israeli government over serving the people of Florida,” the joint statement said. “Like Greg Abbott in Texas, Ron DeSantis is an Israel-first politician who wants to smear and silence Americans, especially American Muslims, critical of US support for Israel’s war crimes,” it said. “We look forward to defeating Governor DeSantis’ latest Israel-first stunt in a court of law, where facts matter and conspiracy theories have no weight. In the meantime, we encourage all Floridians and all Americans to speak up against this latest attempt to shred the Constitution for the benefit of a foreign government,” the statement added.",

      "summary_orig": "At least one person was injured after unknown assailants opened fire on PTI Senator Khurram Zeeshan’s in-laws’ home located in Hayatabad area on the outskirts of Peshawar during the early hours of Tuesday. Zeeshan was elected to the Senate in October on a general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz. According to the incident report filed at the Tatara police station, the attack occurred around 3:15am, with unidentified attackers opening fire on the home located in Phase 2 of Hayatabad. According to police, Syed Azhar Hussain Bukhari, the senator’s brother-in-law, said he was at his home when it came under attack. He said that one of the people working at his home, identified as Absar Ahmed, had sustained a bullet injury in the attack. He further said that his property was also damaged in the incident. The spokesperson for the PTI’s KP chapter, Ikram Khatana, also confirmed the attack. He further said that the senator was not present at the residence when it occurred. He said that the attackers had tried to persuade the occupants to open the gate, and upon their refusal, proceeded to open fire. Senator Zeeshan has not yet responded to requests for a comment. Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Senator Allama Raja Nasir posted on social media platform X that he was “ deeply disturbed” to hear about the attack. While the incident report said that only one person had been injured in the attack, Nasir’s post mentioned two injured. He said, “The assault on the home of a senator who has been a vocal critic of the power elements underscores the perilous environment for political dissent in the country. “It is therefore imperative that transparent, thorough investigations be conducted to ensure justice and accountability.” Senator Nasir further stated that such incidents “erode confidence in the constitutional promise to protect freedom of speech and association, and they must be addressed urgently to safeguard the rights and safety of all citizens, regardless of their political stance”. Last month, an alleged quadcopter attack on the residence of PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan in Raghagan area of Khar tehsil had left one of his private guards injured.",

He said, “The assault on the home of a senator who has been a vocal critic of the power elements underscores the perilous environment for political dissent in the country. “It is therefore imperative that transparent, thorough investigations be conducted to ensure justice and accountability.” Senator Nasir further stated that such incidents “erode confidence in the constitutional promise to protect freedom of speech and association, and they must be addressed urgently to safeguard the rights and safety of all citizens, regardless of their political stance”. Last month, an alleged quadcopter attack on the residence of PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan in Raghagan area of Khar tehsil had left one of his private guards injured.",

      "summary_orig": "Faisal Hossain told his family he had found work in Dubai. In reality, the 22-year-old from Madaripur, some 100 kilometres to the south of Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, was fighting for the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — a banned militant group waging insurgency against the Pakistani state in order to establish their own interpretation of Sharia law. On September 26, 2025, Pakistani security forces killed Hossain during an operation in Karak district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. His brother, Arman, identified him from photos of bodies circulated in the media. Hossain is one of at least four Bangladeshis confirmed killed while fighting for the TTP, referred to as the Fitna al-Khawarij by the Pakistan state. Bangladesh’s Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit adds that another two dozen or so Bangladeshi nationals are currently in Pakistan, fighting for the TTP and other militant organisations — a trend that experts say first emerged in 2023 and has alarmed authorities in Dhaka. A second Bangladeshi, Zubair Ahmed, 22, is believed to have been killed in April 2025. “At the end of April, I received a call from an unknown number, informing me that my son is no more,” his mother, Aleya Akter, tells Eos. Dozens of young Bangladeshi men are said to be fighting for extremist Pakistani outfits such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban. Their recruitment marks a dangerous new export for Bangladesh and a perplexing shift in South Asian militancy… An undated image of Bangladeshi youth Faisal Hossain, which surfaced after news of his killing in a security operation against militants in Pakistan | Social Media THE FATE OF RATAN DHALI The fate of a third man, Ratan Dhali, 29, remains unclear. In early November, the CTTC informed his family he had been killed in the September 26 operation. But on December 1, a video surfaced on Bangladeshi social media, showing someone identified as Dhali and claiming to be alive. CTTC Superintendent of Police (SP) Rawshan Sadia Afroz tells Eos that officers have investigated the video and found it to be fake and will not be conducting a forensic analysis. A TTP spokesperson in Pakistan, Imran Haider, who initially told Eos that Dhali was dead has now retracted the statement, saying Dhali was only presumed dead because he had been missing. For Dhali’s family, the uncertainty is agonising. “A few days ago, the police informed me that my son had been killed in Pakistan,” his father Anwar Dhali tells Eos. “Now, God only knows whether my son is alive or not. Ratan Dhali last spoke to his family on April 11, 2024 — Eid day. He made a video call to his mother, exchanged Eid greetings, and told her he was in Delhi and would soon travel to Dubai. “That was our last conversation. I never spoke to my son again,” says Selina Begum, Ratan’s mother, as she broke down in tears. Ratan Dhali, a 29-year-old from Gopalganj district in southwestern Bangladesh, was reportedly killed in Pakistan this year | Social Media RECRUITMENT METHOD In March 2024, Hossain told his father that he wanted to go to Dubai. But his family did not agree, as they could not afford it. A few days later, Hossain told them that he had found a way to get there. “An elder brother will take me there and pay all the expenses. My salary will be 35,000 takas [$285]. After arriving in Dubai, I will have to repay him from my salary,” he told them. When Hossain was about to leave home for Dubai, his elder brother Arman asked him if he had obtained a visa. Faisal replied that his visa would be from India. “I was surprised when I heard that,” Arman tells Eos. “He [Hossain] would call us once or twice a month and say he was working in Dubai,” says Arman. “We last contacted him in June this year. Since then, despite repeated attempts, it has not been possible to reach him.” Also in March 2024, Dhali told his father he was going to Dubai. “He told me that his boss had a clinic in Dubai and he wanted Ratan to work there,” his father Anwar tells Eos. About 20 days later, was when Dhali called his mother and told her he was in India and would be going to Dubai, he adds. In reality, both men had travelled to India via the Benapole Land Port — the largest land port in Bangladesh, used for imports and exports to and from India — before staying in Kolkata and Delhi for several days. “Our investigation found that Ratan [Dhali] and Faisal [Hossain] entered India via the Benapole land port on March 27, 2024. From there, they illegally travelled to Pakistan through Afghanistan, where they joined the TTP,” says SP Afroz. Dhali and Hossain had been working at a clinic called Rof Rof Hijama Centre, located in Dhaka’s Khilgaon area. When Eos went to look for the clinic, it was no longer in the building. A resident said it had relocated a few months earlier. Zubair took a different route. He first went to Saudi Arabia in November 2024 to perform Umrah. After completing Umrah, he did not return home. The CTTC say Zubair entered Pakistan through legal channels from Saudi Arabia. “After performing Umrah, Zubair said he was not coming home for now, as he was busy spreading the message of Allah,” says Aleya Akter, his mother. Zubair Ahmed, 22, was killed in Pakistan in April this year | Social Media PREYING ON THE VULNERABLE There seems to be certain similarities in the three recruits: all three come from modest backgrounds. Dhali studied at a school in Dhaka until class five. His father drives an autorickshaw and his mother is a housewife. Hossain completed his matriculation at a school in Uttara, Dhaka. His father is a retired private-sector employee and his elder brother works as a deliveryman. Ahmed was pursuing an undergraduate degree in Islamic Studies and comes from a middle-class family. The families of the victims allege that their sons were misled and trapped. They are demanding justice and have urged the Bangladesh government to take immediate action. “I have only one demand. I want the people who led my son down this path to be punished,” says Ratan’s father. Faisal’s brother Arman echoes the demand. “I request the Bangladeshi government to investigate the root of this cycle and punish those responsible, so that no one else falls for this kind of deception and loses their child in the future,” he tells Eos. Analysts say militant recruiters often target young people from rural districts, who are seeking jobs abroad or are financially strapped. “People from lower-middle-class families are the most vulnerable, which is why they can be easily persuaded by promises of money,” says Mubashar Hasan, a political analyst specialising in South Asian geopolitics and an adjunct researcher at the Western Sydney University in Australia. Imran Haider, the TTP spokesperson in Pakistan who spoke to Eos via WhatsApp, contends that the young men knew what they were getting into. “No one was brought here by force or deception,” says Haider, who claims to be a former Bangladesh Air Force engineer. According to the CTTC, he left Bangladesh in April 2023. SCALE OF THE ISSUE According to SP Afroz, Bangladeshis are joining multiple militant organisations in Pakistan beyond the TTP. “So far, we have identified three of them: TTP, TLP [Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan] and IMP [Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan],” she says. Experts believe the majority join the TTP, which was founded in 2007 by Baitullah Mehsud. Its current leader is Noor Wali Mehsud, who has publicly pledged allegiance to the Afghan Taliban. While it remains difficult to estimate how many Bangladeshis are leaving for Pakistan, the trend has grown in recent years. “I am not obligated to tell you how many [Bangladeshis] are fighting for TTP,” says TTP’s Haider. Bangladeshi police say they have identified dozens who are currently in Pakistan. “We have been able to identify 25 to 30 people who are currently in Pakistan and fighting,” says SP Afroz. Most of this recruitment, experts and security officials add, tends to take place online and often involves misinterpretation of religious edicts. Dr Tawhidul Haque, a criminologist and associate professor at the University of Dhaka, says the involvement of Bangladeshi youth in militant organisations has been rising in recent years. “And they are now doing these things online, where they face less risk,” he adds. Hasan Al Mahmud, who has been reporting on militancy in Bangladesh for years, says this trend of people from Bangladesh going to Pakistan to join militant organisations started in 2023. “They are constantly trying to recruit newcomers by misinterpreting religion,” he tells Eos. Bangladesh police say that they have been cracking down on such activities and are keeping a close watch. “In recent years, we have identified at least a hundred people who were planning to go to Pakistan to engage in militancy,” says SP Afroz. “We stopped them.” Ratan Dhali’s father, Anwar Dhali, is an autorickshaw driver in Gopalganj district in southwestern Bangladesh | Maruf Hasan MOTIVATING FACTORS For experts in Bangladesh, their fellow citizens fighting against a Muslim-majority country like Pakistan represents an unusual development. “In history, people from Bangladesh have gone to fight in many countries for various reasons,” says Mubashar Hasan, the political analyst. “But going to Pakistan to fight against the Pakistani government is a new and surprising development,” he adds. Haider, the TTP spokesperson in Pakistan, says these young men are fighting to establish Islamic rule in Pakistan. “Although India and Pakistan were divided in 1947 based on the two-nation theory, Islamic rule was never truly established in Pakistan,” he says. “Our main goal is to establish Islamic rule in Pakistan.” Mamunul Haque, an Islamic scholar and the joint secretary-general of Hefazat-i-Islam Bangladesh — one of the country’s largest Islamic organisations — rejects this reasoning. He says his organisation strongly advises against leaving Bangladesh to wage an armed war against another Islamic state. “Islam does not support this either,” he tells Eos. But religious condemnation alone may not deter recruits who have already been radicalised — both online and offline. Dr Haque, the criminologist, says radicalised individuals lose their capacity for critical thinking. “They can’t think about things logically,” he says. “They simply follow whatever instructions they’re given.” MILITANCY IN BANGLADESH While Bangladesh has largely suppressed domestic militant activity in recent years, the emergence of citizens fighting abroad suggests extremist networks have adapted — recruiting online and sending fighters to foreign conflicts. On July 5, 2025, an officer from the Intelligence Branch of Bangladesh’s Anti-Terrorism Unit filed a case with Savar police station in Dhaka, naming six people and their unidentified associates, confirms Savar police station’s officer-in-charge, Mohammad Jewel Mia. “The case, filed under the Anti-Terrorism Act, accuses them of conspiring against another country by attempting to disrupt and destabilise its public security on behalf of the TTP, as well as sharing extremist content,” Mia tells Eos. Law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh also arrested two people on charges of being involved with the TTP, also in July this year. The case file states that some Bangladeshi youths, inspired by the ideology of the TTP, are attempting to establish an Islamic Sharia-based regime in Pakistan by travelling to Afghanistan. However, local acts of terrorism are few and far between. The last major terrorist attack on Bangladeshi soil took place on the night of July 1, 2016, when five young Bangladeshis carried out a brutal attack at the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka, killing 20 people — including 17 foreigners — by shooting and stabbing them. Two police officers were also killed while trying to stop the attackers. That night, the international extremist organisation Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility and released photos of the perpetrators. However, the government rejected the IS claim, attributing the attack to the Bangladeshi militant group Neo-Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh. In response to such attacks over the years, the Bangladeshi government has banned nine militant organisations in the country as terrorist groups. Under the prevailing laws, these groups are prohibited from carrying out any activities in Bangladesh. Yet some banned groups have tried to resurface, including Hizb-ut-Tahrir Bangladesh, which was proscribed in 2009. In March 2024, hundreds of members of the group held a public procession following Friday prayers in Dhaka, demanding the country’s secular democracy be replaced by an Islamic caliphate. Law enforcement responded by firing tear gas and sound grenades and arrested several participants. Meanwhile, even if the video claiming to show Ratan Dhali to be alive isn’t forensically analysed, his family remains trapped between hope and grief — unsure whether their son will return or if he has already become another casualty in a conflict most Bangladeshis barely understand. It’s an uncertainty that may define this new phase of militancy: families left in limbo, young men vanishing across borders and a threat that operates in digital shadows, far beyond the reach of domestic law enforcement.

In early November, the CTTC informed his family he had been killed in the September 26 operation. But on December 1, a video surfaced on Bangladeshi social media, showing someone identified as Dhali and claiming to be alive. CTTC Superintendent of Police (SP) Rawshan Sadia Afroz tells Eos that officers have investigated the video and found it to be fake and will not be conducting a forensic analysis. A TTP spokesperson in Pakistan, Imran Haider, who initially told Eos that Dhali was dead has now retracted the statement, saying Dhali was only presumed dead because he had been missing. For Dhali’s family, the uncertainty is agonising. “A few days ago, the police informed me that my son had been killed in Pakistan,” his father Anwar Dhali tells Eos. “Now, God only knows whether my son is alive or not. Ratan Dhali last spoke to his family on April 11, 2024 — Eid day. He made a video call to his mother, exchanged Eid greetings, and told her he was in Delhi and would soon travel to Dubai. “That was our last conversation. I never spoke to my son again,” says Selina Begum, Ratan’s mother, as she broke down in tears. Ratan Dhali, a 29-year-old from Gopalganj district in southwestern Bangladesh, was reportedly killed in Pakistan this year | Social Media RECRUITMENT METHOD In March 2024, Hossain told his father that he wanted to go to Dubai. But his family did not agree, as they could not afford it. A few days later, Hossain told them that he had found a way to get there. “An elder brother will take me there and pay all the expenses. My salary will be 35,000 takas [$285]. After arriving in Dubai, I will have to repay him from my salary,” he told them. When Hossain was about to leave home for Dubai, his elder brother Arman asked him if he had obtained a visa. Faisal replied that his visa would be from India. “I was surprised when I heard that,” Arman tells Eos. “He [Hossain] would call us once or twice a month and say he was working in Dubai,” says Arman. “We last contacted him in June this year. Since then, despite repeated attempts, it has not been possible to reach him.” Also in March 2024, Dhali told his father he was going to Dubai. “He told me that his boss had a clinic in Dubai and he wanted Ratan to work there,” his father Anwar tells Eos. About 20 days later, was when Dhali called his mother and told her he was in India and would be going to Dubai, he adds. In reality, both men had travelled to India via the Benapole Land Port — the largest land port in Bangladesh, used for imports and exports to and from India — before staying in Kolkata and Delhi for several days. “Our investigation found that Ratan [Dhali] and Faisal [Hossain] entered India via the Benapole land port on March 27, 2024. From there, they illegally travelled to Pakistan through Afghanistan, where they joined the TTP,” says SP Afroz. Dhali and Hossain had been working at a clinic called Rof Rof Hijama Centre, located in Dhaka’s Khilgaon area. When Eos went to look for the clinic, it was no longer in the building. A resident said it had relocated a few months earlier. Zubair took a different route. He first went to Saudi Arabia in November 2024 to perform Umrah. After completing Umrah, he did not return home. The CTTC say Zubair entered Pakistan through legal channels from Saudi Arabia. “After performing Umrah, Zubair said he was not coming home for now, as he was busy spreading the message of Allah,” says Aleya Akter, his mother. Zubair Ahmed, 22, was killed in Pakistan in April this year | Social Media PREYING ON THE VULNERABLE There seems to be certain similarities in the three recruits: all three come from modest backgrounds. Dhali studied at a school in Dhaka until class five. His father drives an autorickshaw and his mother is a housewife. Hossain completed his matriculation at a school in Uttara, Dhaka. His father is a retired private-sector employee and his elder brother works as a deliveryman. Ahmed was pursuing an undergraduate degree in Islamic Studies and comes from a middle-class family. The families of the victims allege that their sons were misled and trapped. They are demanding justice and have urged the Bangladesh government to take immediate action. “I have only one demand. I want the people who led my son down this path to be punished,” says Ratan’s father. Faisal’s brother Arman echoes the demand. “I request the Bangladeshi government to investigate the root of this cycle and punish those responsible, so that no one else falls for this kind of deception and loses their child in the future,” he tells Eos. Analysts say militant recruiters often target young people from rural districts, who are seeking jobs abroad or are financially strapped. “People from lower-middle-class families are the most vulnerable, which is why they can be easily persuaded by promises of money,” says Mubashar Hasan, a political analyst specialising in South Asian geopolitics and an adjunct researcher at the Western Sydney University in Australia. Imran Haider, the TTP spokesperson in Pakistan who spoke to Eos via WhatsApp, contends that the young men knew what they were getting into. “No one was brought here by force or deception,” says Haider, who claims to be a former Bangladesh Air Force engineer. According to the CTTC, he left Bangladesh in April 2023. SCALE OF THE ISSUE According to SP Afroz, Bangladeshis are joining multiple militant organisations in Pakistan beyond the TTP. “So far, we have identified three of them: TTP, TLP [Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan] and IMP [Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan],” she says. Experts believe the majority join the TTP, which was founded in 2007 by Baitullah Mehsud. Its current leader is Noor Wali Mehsud, who has publicly pledged allegiance to the Afghan Taliban. While it remains difficult to estimate how many Bangladeshis are leaving for Pakistan, the trend has grown in recent years. “I am not obligated to tell you how many [Bangladeshis] are fighting for TTP,” says TTP’s Haider. Bangladeshi police say they have identified dozens who are currently in Pakistan. “We have been able to identify 25 to 30 people who are currently in Pakistan and fighting,” says SP Afroz. Most of this recruitment, experts and security officials add, tends to take place online and often involves misinterpretation of religious edicts. Dr Tawhidul Haque, a criminologist and associate professor at the University of Dhaka, says the involvement of Bangladeshi youth in militant organisations has been rising in recent years. “And they are now doing these things online, where they face less risk,” he adds. Hasan Al Mahmud, who has been reporting on militancy in Bangladesh for years, says this trend of people from Bangladesh going to Pakistan to join militant organisations started in 2023. “They are constantly trying to recruit newcomers by misinterpreting religion,” he tells Eos. Bangladesh police say that they have been cracking down on such activities and are keeping a close watch. “In recent years, we have identified at least a hundred people who were planning to go to Pakistan to engage in militancy,” says SP Afroz. “We stopped them.” Ratan Dhali’s father, Anwar Dhali, is an autorickshaw driver in Gopalganj district in southwestern Bangladesh | Maruf Hasan MOTIVATING FACTORS For experts in Bangladesh, their fellow citizens fighting against a Muslim-majority country like Pakistan represents an unusual development. “In history, people from Bangladesh have gone to fight in many countries for various reasons,” says Mubashar Hasan, the political analyst. “But going to Pakistan to fight against the Pakistani government is a new and surprising development,” he adds. Haider, the TTP spokesperson in Pakistan, says these young men are fighting to establish Islamic rule in Pakistan. “Although India and Pakistan were divided in 1947 based on the two-nation theory, Islamic rule was never truly established in Pakistan,” he says. “Our main goal is to establish Islamic rule in Pakistan.” Mamunul Haque, an Islamic scholar and the joint secretary-general of Hefazat-i-Islam Bangladesh — one of the country’s largest Islamic organisations — rejects this reasoning. He says his organisation strongly advises against leaving Bangladesh to wage an armed war against another Islamic state. “Islam does not support this either,” he tells Eos. But religious condemnation alone may not deter recruits who have already been radicalised — both online and offline. Dr Haque, the criminologist, says radicalised individuals lose their capacity for critical thinking. “They can’t think about things logically,” he says. “They simply follow whatever instructions they’re given.” MILITANCY IN BANGLADESH While Bangladesh has largely suppressed domestic militant activity in recent years, the emergence of citizens fighting abroad suggests extremist networks have adapted — recruiting online and sending fighters to foreign conflicts. On July 5, 2025, an officer from the Intelligence Branch of Bangladesh’s Anti-Terrorism Unit filed a case with Savar police station in Dhaka, naming six people and their unidentified associates, confirms Savar police station’s officer-in-charge, Mohammad Jewel Mia. “The case, filed under the Anti-Terrorism Act, accuses them of conspiring against another country by attempting to disrupt and destabilise its public security on behalf of the TTP, as well as sharing extremist content,” Mia tells Eos. Law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh also arrested two people on charges of being involved with the TTP, also in July this year. The case file states that some Bangladeshi youths, inspired by the ideology of the TTP, are attempting to establish an Islamic Sharia-based regime in Pakistan by travelling to Afghanistan. However, local acts of terrorism are few and far between. The last major terrorist attack on Bangladeshi soil took place on the night of July 1, 2016, when five young Bangladeshis carried out a brutal attack at the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka, killing 20 people — including 17 foreigners — by shooting and stabbing them. Two police officers were also killed while trying to stop the attackers. That night, the international extremist organisation Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility and released photos of the perpetrators. However, the government rejected the IS claim, attributing the attack to the Bangladeshi militant group Neo-Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh. In response to such attacks over the years, the Bangladeshi government has banned nine militant organisations in the country as terrorist groups. Under the prevailing laws, these groups are prohibited from carrying out any activities in Bangladesh. Yet some banned groups have tried to resurface, including Hizb-ut-Tahrir Bangladesh, which was proscribed in 2009. In March 2024, hundreds of members of the group held a public procession following Friday prayers in Dhaka, demanding the country’s secular democracy be replaced by an Islamic caliphate. Law enforcement responded by firing tear gas and sound grenades and arrested several participants. Meanwhile, even if the video claiming to show Ratan Dhali to be alive isn’t forensically analysed, his family remains trapped between hope and grief — unsure whether their son will return or if he has already become another casualty in a conflict most Bangladeshis barely understand. It’s an uncertainty that may define this new phase of militancy: families left in limbo, young men vanishing across borders and a threat that operates in digital shadows, far beyond the reach of domestic law enforcement.

      "summary_orig": "Reporters Without Borders said on Tuesday that Israel was responsible for nearly half of all journalists killed this year worldwide, with 29 Palestinian reporters slain by its forces in Gaza. In its annual report , the Paris-based media freedom group said the total number of journalists killed reached 67 globally this year, slightly up from the 66 killed in 2024. Israeli forces accounted for 43 per cent of the total, making them “the worst enemy of journalists”, RSF said in its report, which documented deaths over 12 months from December 2024. The most deadly single attack was a so-called “double-tap” strike on a hospital in south Gaza on August 25, which killed five journalists, including two contributors to international news agencies Reuters and the Associated Press . In total, since the start of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in October 2023, nearly 220 journalists have died, making Israel the biggest killer of journalists worldwide for three years running, RSF data shows. Foreign reporters are still unable to travel to Gaza — unless they are in tightly controlled tours organised by the Israeli military — despite calls from media groups and press freedom organisations for access. Elsewhere in the RSF annual report, the group said that 2025 was the deadliest year in Mexico in at least three years, with nine journalists killed there, despite pledges from left-wing President Claudia Sheinbaum to help protect them. War-wracked Ukraine (three journalists killed) and Sudan (four journalists killed) are the other most dangerous countries for reporters in the world, according to RSF. The overall number of deaths last year is far down from the peak of 142 journalists killed in 2012, linked largely to the Syrian civil war, and is below the average since 2003 of around 80 killed per year. The RSF annual report also counts the number of journalists imprisoned worldwide for their work, with 121 in China, 48 in Russia and 47 in Myanmar. As of December 1, 2025, 503 journalists were detained in 47 countries across the world, the report said.",

      "summary_orig": "Thailand said it was taking action to expel Cambodian forces from its territory on Tuesday, as renewed fighting between the two Southeast Asian neighbours spread along the disputed border. Each side has blamed the other for the clashes, which have derailed a fragile ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump that ended five days of fighting in July. Cambodia’s Defence Ministry said two civilians had been killed overnight, taking its death toll to six. One Thai soldier has died in the fighting. In a statement on Tuesday morning, the Thai Navy said Cambodian forces had been detected inside Thai territory in the coastal province of Trat and military operations were launched to expel them, without providing further details. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said late on Monday that Thailand “must not use military force to attack civilian villages under the pretext of reclaiming its sovereignty”. Earlier, Cambodia said it had not retaliated even after its forces came under sustained attack. The Thai Navy said Cambodian forces were increasing their presence, deploying snipers and heavy weapons, improving fortified positions and digging trenches, adding it saw the actions “as a direct and serious threat to Thailand’s sovereignty”. Monday’s clashes were the fiercest since a five-day exchange of rockets and heavy artillery in July, when at least 48 people were killed and 300,000 displaced, before Trump intervened to broker a ceasefire. Thailand evacuated 438,000 civilians across five border provinces and authorities in Cambodia said hundreds of thousands of people had been moved to safety. Thailand’s army said 18 soldiers were wounded and Cambodia’s government reported nine civilians injured. Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817-km (508-mile) land border, with disputes over ancient temples stirring nationalist fervour and occasional armed flare-ups, including a deadly week-long artillery exchange in 2011. Tensions rose in May following the killing of a Cambodian soldier during a skirmish, which led to a major troop buildup at the border and escalated into diplomatic breakdowns and armed clashes.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The United Nations and its partners on Monday launched their 2026 global humanitarian appeal, with $64.9 million specifically earmarked to support 1.9m vulnerable people in Pakistan as part of the $33bn plan aimed at saving lives threatened by wars, climate disasters, epidemics, earthquakes and crop failures worldwide. The humanitarian appeals’ immediate priority is to save 87 million lives with $23bn in funding, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said. Ultimately, in 2026, the aim is to raise a total of $33bn to support 135m people through 23 country operations and six plans for refugees and migrants. The appeal, titled ‘2026 Response Plan’ earmarks $64.9m to provide assistance to 1.9m people in Pakist­­an. The aim of the appeal, called ‘Life by Life’, is to reach 135m in 50 countries in 2026, the UN agency said. UNOCHA noted that in 2025, 98m people received help despite funding cuts and attacks on aid workers. Occupied Palestinian Territory gets the largest individual plan — $4.1bn for three million people In 2026, the largest individual response plan is for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, where $4.1bn is needed to assist 3 million people who have experienced shocking levels of violence and destruction. In Sudan, the world’s largest displacement crisis, $2.9bn is needed for 20 million people. The largest regional plan is for Syria, with $2.8bn targeted for 8.6 million people. The highly prioritised appeal follows a year in which humanitarian lifelines were strained and, in some places, snapped due to severe funding cuts. Funding for the 2025 appeal — $12bn — was the lowest in a decade, resulting in 25 million fewer people being reached compared to 2024. Amidst this devastation, civilians endured blatant disregard for the laws of war, and more than 320 aid workers, the vast majority of them local staff, were killed. The consequences were immediate: hunger surged, health systems came under crushing strain, education collapsed, mine clearance stalled and families suffered blow after blow, with no shelter, no cash assistance and no protection services. “This appeal sets out where we need to focus our collective energy first: life by life,” said UN Humanitarian Chief Tom Fletcher. “The Global Humanitarian Over­view 2026 is grounded in reform, evidence and efficiency. We are shifting power to local organisations, putting more money directly into the hands of those who need it, and, behind all, renewing and reimagining hu­­manitarian action with idealism, humility and hope.” Published in Dawn, December 9th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Ayaz Sadiq feels dialogue the only way forward, says he is still ready to play his role • Barrister Gohar calls for defusing tensions, indicates all party lawmakers will resign if ‘minus-one formula’ is implemented ISLAMABAD: With the main opposition PTI threatening to boycott parliamentary proceedings if the government continued to push it against the wall, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Monday reiterated his offer to mediate between the government and the party. Responding to the points raised by PTI interim Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the NA speaker noted that dialogue was the only way forward. He asked the opposition to consult on his offer and said he would also make a request to the government. “What can be achieved by criticising the institutions. The army not only defends the borders but also fights terrorism in the country,” Mr Sadiq rema­rked. He added that while his previous efforts to resolve issu­es between the between government and the opposition had not succeeded, he was still ready to play his role. ‘En masse resignation’ Earlier speaking in the House, Barrister Gohar called for defusing tensions and warned that if would not be possible for them to sit in the House if the prevailing situation continued. He also made it clear that the “minus-one [PTI founder Imran Khan] formula” would not work at all. The PTI leader indicated that all the party’s members would resign if there were any attempt to implement the minus-one formula. He said the enemies of Pakistan and democracy wanted a fight between “tita­ns and gladiators”, and that the country’s enemies would benefit if a major political party and a state institution came face to face. “It will be very unfortunate if the ongoing tensions in the country is not defused. There should be tolerance and not anarchy in politics,” he added. The PTI leader said the whole nation had been concerned since last Friday — when Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general held a press conference , wherein he launched a scathing attack on the PTI founder. Without naming the DG ISPR, Barrister Gohar said certain press conferences were very “disappointing”. He regretted that the PTI founder had been labelled a security threat, saying that it was unexpected. “Press conferences are not addressed like this,” he remarked. He maintained that Imran Khan was a guarantee for the continuation of democracy and not a threat to national security. Barrister Gohar said they had been demanding the PTI founder’s release, but a ban on meetings with him had now been placed. “We never desire that infighting in the country starts after Pakistan’s victory against a hostile neighbour,” he said. He asked the speaker and parliament to play their roles in defusing the tensions. Financial position Earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told the House that the government’s efforts to broaden and deepen the tax base were yielding results and the tax-to-GDP ratio had entered double digits after a long time. “It was 8.5 per cent in 2023-24 and 10.3pc last year. We are hopeful that it will be 11pc this year,” he remarked. He added that the total tax collection last year was Rs 11.7 trillion — a 27pc year-on-year increase. The minister continued that income tax collection increased by 28pc, sales tax by 26pc, federal excise duty by 33pc, and customs duty by 16pc. He added that revenue collection figures till November this year showed a 10.3pc increase. The minister said sugar and cement were the first two sectors where production was being digitally monitored through artificial intelligence. He elaborated that from July to November this year, Rs7bn in additional revenues from the sugar industry and Rs10bn from the cement sector had been collected compared to the same period last year. Mr Aurangzeb said digital monitoring would be ex­­panded to other sectors, including tobacco and beverages. “Technology is a big equaliser. It brings transparency.

      "summary_en": "• Ayaz Sadiq feels dialogue the only way forward, says he is still ready to play his role • Barrister Gohar calls for defusing tensions, indicates all party lawmakers will resign if ‘minus-one formula’ is implemented ISLAMABAD: With the main opposition PTI threatening to boycott parliamentary proceedings if the government continued to push it against the wall, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Monday reiterated his offer to mediate between the government and the party. Responding to the points raised by PTI interim Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the NA speaker noted that dialogue was the only way forward. He asked the opposition to consult on his offer and said he would also make a request to the government. “What can be achieved by criticising the institutions. The army not only defends the borders but also fights terrorism in the country,” Mr Sadiq rema­rked. He added that while his previous efforts to resolve issu­es between the between government and the opposition had not succeeded, he was still ready to play his role. ‘En masse resignation’ Earlier speaking in the House, Barrister Gohar called for defusing tensions and warned that if would not be possible for them to sit in the House if the prevailing situation continued. He also made it clear that the “minus-one [PTI founder Imran Khan] formula” would not work at all. The PTI leader indicated that all the party’s members would resign if there were any attempt to implement the minus-one formula. He said the enemies of Pakistan and democracy wanted a fight between “tita­ns and gladiators”, and that the country’s enemies would benefit if a major political party and a state institution came face to face. “It will be very unfortunate if the ongoing tensions in the country is not defused. There should be tolerance and not anarchy in politics,” he added. The PTI leader said the whole nation had been concerned since last Friday — when Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general held a press conference , wherein he launched a scathing attack on the PTI founder. Without naming the DG ISPR, Barrister Gohar said certain press conferences were very “disappointing”. He regretted that the PTI founder had been labelled a security threat, saying that it was unexpected. “Press conferences are not addressed like this,” he remarked. He maintained that Imran Khan was a guarantee for the continuation of democracy and not a threat to national security. Barrister Gohar said they had been demanding the PTI founder’s release, but a ban on meetings with him had now been placed. “We never desire that infighting in the country starts after Pakistan’s victory against a hostile neighbour,” he said. He asked the speaker and parliament to play their roles in defusing the tensions. Financial position Earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told the House that the government’s efforts to broaden and deepen the tax base were yielding results and the tax-to-GDP ratio had entered double digits after a long time. “It was 8.5 per cent in 2023-24 and 10.3pc last year. We are hopeful that it will be 11pc this year,” he remarked. He added that the total tax collection last year was Rs 11.7 trillion — a 27pc year-on-year increase. The minister continued that income tax collection increased by 28pc, sales tax by 26pc, federal excise duty by 33pc, and customs duty by 16pc. He added that revenue collection figures till November this year showed a 10.3pc increase. The minister said sugar and cement were the first two sectors where production was being digitally monitored through artificial intelligence. He elaborated that from July to November this year, Rs7bn in additional revenues from the sugar industry and Rs10bn from the cement sector had been collected compared to the same period last year. Mr Aurangzeb said digital monitoring would be ex­­panded to other sectors, including tobacco and beverages. “Technology is a big equaliser. It brings transparency. Technology brings a world which is no place to hide,” he said. The NA on Monday passed ‘The National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority Bill, 2025’ and ‘The Capital Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2025’. ‘The National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) (Amendment) Bill, 2025’ was also introduced in the House.
