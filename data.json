DI Khan District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed that three terrorists were killed by police forces and added that a large contingent of security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area. Police confirmed that the training centre premises were cleared and all terrorists involved in the attack were killed. A search operation, led by DPO Sahibzada, was also conducted in the surrounding areas to ensure no other terrorists were present. A large contingent of security forces reached the incident site soon after the attack commenced and cordoned off the area. Earlier, there were reports of a loud explosion in the vicinity of the police facility. DI Khan Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) Yaqoob Khan earlier told Dawn.com that a “suicide bomber and two terrorists have been killed”. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. A senior army officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the district a day ago. A cop was martyred in the district after a police checkpoint came under attack from multiple sides by terrorists late on Wednesday. Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel. Last month, 13 terrorists were killed during an IBO in the district’s Daraban area. According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.",

      "summary": "At least three terrorists, including a suicide bomber, were killed in retaliatory fire by police forces after an attack on a police training centre in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan was repulsed on Friday night. DI Khan District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed that three terrorists were killed by police forces and added that a large contingent of security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area. Police confirmed that the training centre premises were cleared and all terrorists involved in the attack were killed. A search operation, led by DPO Sahibzada, was also conducted in the surrounding areas to ensure no other terrorists were present. A large contingent of security forces reached the incident site soon after the attack commenced and cordoned off the area. Earlier, there were reports of a loud explosion in the vicinity of the police facility. DI Khan Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) Yaqoob Khan earlier told Dawn.com that a “suicide bomber and two terrorists have been killed”. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.

      "summary_orig": "Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) supporters reached Lahore’s Shahdara bridge late on Friday night as the religious party attempted to march towards Islamabad and hold an anti-Israeli demonstration outside the US embassy. A spokesperson for the party told Dawn.com that they have stopped the march for the night. A Dawn.com correspondent in Lahore reported earlier on Friday evening that the protesters were trying to remove obstacles at the city’s Chauburji Chowk and march ahead. A statement by Edhi spokesperson Younis Bhatti said several policemen had been injured in clashes with TLP protesters. The statement added that Edhi volunteers moved the injured personnel to various hospitals in the city. Meanwhile, TLP spokesperson Usman Naushahi told Dawn.com that one of the protesters had died and 22 were injured. Ahead of the march, without naming the TLP, the US embassy in Islamabad posted on social media platform X that “the US consulates general in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar are monitoring planned protest activity across Pakistan on October 10”. “These protests may cause traffic delays/detours due to closed or blocked roads in the vicinity of the demonstrations. The duration of the protests is unknown. We advise US citizens to avoid large gatherings and remain aware of their surroundings,” the embassy said in the post. ‘More than a dozen police, Rangers personnel injured’ Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry slammed the TLP for violence during its protest in Lahore, stating that mob politics no longer had a place in Pakistan. “The Pakistani government and state are absolutely clear that protesting is a political, religious and fundamental right, but it has been enshrined in the Constitution with certain terms and conditions,” the state minister said at a press conference. “If people will exercise their right to protest, they must do so in line with our conditions.” Chaudhry highlighted that the TLP had brought mobs to protests and attacked security forces in the past, which had led to deaths and “damage to our image”. “Mob rule has no place in Pakistan,” Chaudhry emphasised. Pointing out that a peace pact had been reached between Hamas and Israel, with which the people of Gaza were happy, he asked what was the purpose of the protest. “I will give the media footage showing them using sticks, chemicals, glass balls and tennis balls with nails lodged in them,” he added. “They fire these at police and Rangers personnel like slingshots and have injured over a dozen of them. “This mob, numbering under 2,000, left their central office in Samanabad and headed towards Ravi Road via Bund Road. They successfully made it because the police did not use force,” the minister said. “There were some blockades, but force was not used.” The minister maintained that “police personnel deployed there were not equipped with anything other than the anti-riot gear”. “The gunmen guarding the DIG overseeing the operation or [security measures] were also unarmed,” he added. The minister added that when TLP leadership claimed injuries among their workers, CCTV footage showed the religious party’s supporters and workers shooting in the air and also destroying cameras deployed as part of the Safe City project. “Why did they do so if they were peaceful?” Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Parliamentary Secretary Asia Ishaq  also questioned that if the people of Palestine were happy with the recent peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, then why was the TLP coming to the capital for a protest. Internet services suspended in twin cities Before the march began, roads in Islamabad were blocked and mobile internet services suspended. In anticipation of the protest, the Islamabad administration had also started placing shipping containers at Faizabad Interchange — the historic site of several TLP sit-ins . It emerged earlier today that the Ministry of Interior had directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to suspend 3G and 4G services in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. A directive dated October 9 and addressed to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) chairman stated the ministry had “accorded approval to suspend 3G/4G services in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, starting from 12am tonight till further orders.” The missive, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , directed the PTA to take “further necessary action” in this regard in coordination with the Islamabad commissioner and police chief, and the Rawalpindi regional police officer. The ministry did not provide a reason for suspending services, but the development does come amid verious other measures being taken by the authorities ahead of the TLP protest. Traffic plan Islamabad traffic police also issued a diversion plan, referring to the “law and order” situation in the Faizabad area. The plan, posted on Islamabad police’s X account, said the entry of all heavy vehicles in the federal capital would not be allowed until further orders and detailed the diversion routes for smaller vehicles around the Faizabad area. A Dawn report, citing sources, earlier said around 500 containers would be used to seal the Red Zone in Islamabad, covering Attaturk Avenue, Third Avenue, Margalla Road, and Khayaban-i-Suharwardy as well as the capital’s entry and exit points. These containers were being placed at key locations, including Serena Chowk, Express Chowk, Nadra Chowk, Agha Khan Road near Marriott Hotel, Margalla Road near Trail 3 and Luqman Hakeem Road. Other blockades were being set up at Faisal Avenue’s Zero Point and Faisal Chowk, the report said. It added that entry points into the capital from Rawat T-Cross, Chungi No 26 and Faizabad will also be sealed with containers. The metro bus and electric bus services on 21 different routes were suspended on Thursday evening and these would remain suspended today as well. Some educational institutions also announced closures in view of the rally and the state’s preparations to counter it. There are also reports of roads being blocked in Jhelum and Jhelum. The police were also deployed at the Peshawar motorway toll plaza, with large containers placed on the roadway and the route towards Islamabad closed. Vehicles traveling on the roadway were asked to turn back. Security measures and arrests Separately, according to a Dawn report , the capital police had started detaining local TLP leaders, activists and workers, taking into custody at least 280 people on Thursday. The report said about 7,000 security personnel, including 5,500 policemen, 1,000 Frontier Constabulary and 500 Rangers, would be deployed across the capital to intercept the TLP gathering and maintain law and order. Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and vehicles equipped with anti-riot gear, including tear gas shells and rubber bullets, would also be deployed at various locations. To avoid any law and order situation in Rawalpindi, the city police and administration have imposed Section 144 till October 11 and sealed major entry and exit routes with more than 300 containers. Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period. As part of the security plan, more than 6,500 police personnel, including 1,150 traffic police, contingents of Punjab Constabulary, and the newly formed Riot Management Police (RMP), have been deployed in Rawalpindi. Personnel from other districts have also been called in to assist the local force. On Thursday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the government always allowed peaceful marchers and demonstration, however, the TLP had not sought permission for its protest in the capital. Section 144 imposed in Punjab Late on Thursday, violence had also broken out in Punjab, after police launched a crackdown on the headquarters of TLP in a bid to arrest its chief, Saad Rizvi. The clashes left several people injured, including around a dozen policemen. An October 8 order by the Punjab Home Department, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , says that Section 144 has been imposed in the province for 10 days. The order states that the Punjab government has received credible reports from law enforcement and intelligence agencies indicating a “serious and imminent threat to public peace, tranquility, and the safety of life and property across the province”. “Multiple credible threat alerts, regarding possible terrorist activities planned by hostile groups, including RAW, TTP, BLA, Daesh etc., aimed at targeting minorities or Muslim scholars to trigger sectarian unrest have been received. Assemblies, rallies, gathering, sit-ins, processions, demonstrations, jalsa, etc., could present a convenient target for such terrorist attacks and the possibility of an untoward incident cannot be ruled out. “[…] There is a strong apprehension that certain political, sectarian or anti-social elements may engage in activities, assemblies, gatherings or demonstrations that are likely to cause a breach of public peace, disturb the public order and create a security risk for the general public and critical infrastructure,” the order read. Apart from a ban on assembly of four or more persons, the order also places a restriction on carrying, brandishing and displaying arms in public spaces, a ban on “misuse of loudspeakers, public address systems and audio amplifying devices for provocative, sectarian or inflammatory content”, and a ban on publishing, disseminating of displaying provocative, hateful or sectarian material. A notification by the University of Punjab, also available with Dawn.com , said that the varsity would remain closed today, as per the instructions of the government. Meanwhile, a statement by the Punjab Public Service Commission’s media and production deputy director said exams for the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority Sub-Divisional Officer’s post, scheduled for Oct 11 and 12, had been postponed following the imposition of Section 144. The statement, however, did not specify a new date for the exams. Additional reporting by Nauman Liaquat and Hamid Asghar",

      "title_orig": "Kabul condemns violation of its ‘sovereign territory’",
      "summary_orig": "Amid rising speculations over an explosion reported in the Afghan capital a day earlier, the interim Taliban government on Friday accused Pakistan of “violating Kabul’s sovereign territory”. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the Afghan Defence Ministry said in a post on social media. For its part, Pakistan remained tight-lipped on the issue, with the the military spokesperson neither confirming nor denying the strikes when questioned about them at a press conference earlier in the day. The Foreign Office, meanwhile, did not respond to a request for comment till the publication of this report. On Thursday evening, residents in the border town of Marghi reported that a market selling second-hand weapons had been bombed. Around the same time, Afghan government spokesman Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabeehullah Mujahid confirmed on X that an explosion “was heard in the city of Kabul”. Many social media accounts speculated that TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud was targeted, but Mujahid refuted the reports in an interview with Anadolu Agency and claimed Mehsud was not present in Kabul or Afghanistan. The development comes amid Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s first visit to India. During the visit, New Delhi announced it was upgrading its mission in Kabul to a full embassy. The top Afghan diplomat addressed the Kabul incident while speaking at a press conference, saying: “There has been an attack near the border in remote areas. We consider this act of Pakistan wrong. Problems cannot be solved like this … We have kept the door to discussion open. They should solve their problem on their own. Earlier, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry did not directly respond when questioned whether Pakistan was responsible for the attacks. “To safeguard Pakistani lives and properties, what measures need to be taken will be taken,” he told reporters. Surge in terrorism Terrorism has surged in Pakistan since the withdrawal of US-led troops from Afghanistan in 2021 and the return of the Taliban government. The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistani Taliban (TTP), a separate but linked group to the Afghan Taliban, along with its affiliates, is behind most of the violence — largely directed at security forces. A lieutenant colonel and a major were among 11 security personnel martyred in an exchange of fire with the TTP in the Orakzai district earlier this week. The federal government and the army have repeatedly accused Kabul’s authorities of harbouring terrorist groups that launch attacks on Pakistani soil with impunity. Earlier this year, a UN report said the TTP “receive substantial logistical and operational support from the de facto authorities”, referring to the Taliban government in Kabul. A day earlier, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told the National Assembly that several efforts to convince the Afghan Taliban to stop backing the TTP had failed. “We will not tolerate this any longer,” Asif said. “United, we must respond to those facilitating them — whether the hideouts are on our soil or Afghan soil.” He warned that any response could cause collateral damage. “Everyone will have to bear the consequences, including those providing the hideouts. Enough is enough,” he added. “The Pakistani government and army’s patience has run out.“ Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also said the nation was united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country and the government would take all measures to crush violence perpetrated from across the border. Pak-Afghan tensions The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. With ties between the two neighbouring countries already strained, PM Shehbaz had issued a stern message to Kabul last month, saying Afghanistan must decide whether it stands with Pakistan or the TTP. The prime minister said terrorists entered Pakistan from Afghanistan and, together with the outlawed TTP, carried out attacks that martyred soldiers, brothers, sisters and ordinary citizens. He added that Pakistan was willing to maintain relations with Afghanistan, but if Kabul chose to side with and support the terrorists, then Pakistan had nothing to do with the interim Afghan government and the terrorists would be eliminated at any cost. Differences between Pakistan and Afghanistan are primarily centred on security and border disputes. Pakistan has made terrorism its central concern in ties with Kabul, citing a sharp rise in attacks by the banned TTP and other militant groups operating from Afghanistan. Further exacerbating tensions has been the issue of repatriation of Afghan refugees by the federal government, a move that has been criticised by the Taliban authorities. During a meeting in January held in Peshawar, political leaders had urged Field Marshal Asim Munir that the military engage with Afghanistan to address Pakistan’s internal security problems. The army chief, however, said the Afghan interim rulers had failed to heed repeated warnings in the past. “They don’t listen to us,” sources quoted the field marshal as telling politicians who had called for formal or informal dialogue with the interim Afghan government. Lack of action by Afghan authorities against terror outfits has also led to reprisal by Pakistan in recent months. At least three people were killed and seven wounded in two separate incidents in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and Khost provinces in August. Afghan authorities claimed the fatalities were caused by strikes carried out by Pakistan. There was no official word from Islamabad, and Afghan authorities did not provide any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the incidents. Pakistan has targeted terrorist camps in Afghan territory in the past: most recently in December last year, when Pakistani jets bombed positions in Pak­tika province, targeting TTP members. At the time, the Foreign Office had avoided di­r­ectly commenting on the claim, but admitted that Pa­k­­i­stani forces conducted “operations in border areas to protect the people of Pakistan from terr­­­orist groups”. A number of cross-border infiltration bids have also been foiled.",

Enough is enough,” he added. “The Pakistani government and army’s patience has run out.“ Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also said the nation was united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country and the government would take all measures to crush violence perpetrated from across the border. Pak-Afghan tensions The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. With ties between the two neighbouring countries already strained, PM Shehbaz had issued a stern message to Kabul last month, saying Afghanistan must decide whether it stands with Pakistan or the TTP. The prime minister said terrorists entered Pakistan from Afghanistan and, together with the outlawed TTP, carried out attacks that martyred soldiers, brothers, sisters and ordinary citizens. He added that Pakistan was willing to maintain relations with Afghanistan, but if Kabul chose to side with and support the terrorists, then Pakistan had nothing to do with the interim Afghan government and the terrorists would be eliminated at any cost. Differences between Pakistan and Afghanistan are primarily centred on security and border disputes. Pakistan has made terrorism its central concern in ties with Kabul, citing a sharp rise in attacks by the banned TTP and other militant groups operating from Afghanistan. Further exacerbating tensions has been the issue of repatriation of Afghan refugees by the federal government, a move that has been criticised by the Taliban authorities. During a meeting in January held in Peshawar, political leaders had urged Field Marshal Asim Munir that the military engage with Afghanistan to address Pakistan’s internal security problems. The army chief, however, said the Afghan interim rulers had failed to heed repeated warnings in the past. “They don’t listen to us,” sources quoted the field marshal as telling politicians who had called for formal or informal dialogue with the interim Afghan government. Lack of action by Afghan authorities against terror outfits has also led to reprisal by Pakistan in recent months. At least three people were killed and seven wounded in two separate incidents in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and Khost provinces in August. Afghan authorities claimed the fatalities were caused by strikes carried out by Pakistan. There was no official word from Islamabad, and Afghan authorities did not provide any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the incidents. Pakistan has targeted terrorist camps in Afghan territory in the past: most recently in December last year, when Pakistani jets bombed positions in Pak­tika province, targeting TTP members. At the time, the Foreign Office had avoided di­r­ectly commenting on the claim, but admitted that Pa­k­­i­stani forces conducted “operations in border areas to protect the people of Pakistan from terr­­­orist groups”. A number of cross-border infiltration bids have also been foiled.",

      "summary": "Amid rising speculations over an explosion reported in the Afghan capital a day earlier, the interim Taliban government on Friday accused Pakistan of “violating Kabul’s sovereign territory”. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the Afghan Defence Ministry said in a post on social media. For its part, Pakistan remained tight-lipped on the issue, with the the military spokesperson neither confirming nor denying the strikes when questioned about them at a press conference earlier in the day. The Foreign Office, meanwhile, did not respond to a request for comment till the publication of this report. On Thursday evening, residents in the border town of Marghi reported that a market selling second-hand weapons had been bombed. Around the same time, Afghan government spokesman Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabeehullah Mujahid confirmed on X that an explosion “was heard in the city of Kabul”. Many social media accounts speculated that TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud was targeted, but Mujahid refuted the reports in an interview with Anadolu Agency and claimed Mehsud was not present in Kabul or Afghanistan. The development comes amid Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s first visit to India. During the visit, New Delhi announced it was upgrading its mission in Kabul to a full embassy. The top Afghan diplomat addressed the Kabul incident while speaking at a press conference, saying: “There has been an attack near the border in remote areas. We consider this act of Pakistan wrong. Problems cannot be solved like this … We have kept the door to discussion open. They should solve their problem on their own. Earlier, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry did not directly respond when questioned whether Pakistan was responsible for the attacks. “To safeguard Pakistani lives and properties, what measures need to be taken will be taken,” he told reporters. Surge in terrorism Terrorism has surged in Pakistan since the withdrawal of US-led troops from Afghanistan in 2021 and the return of the Taliban government. The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistani Taliban (TTP), a separate but linked group to the Afghan Taliban, along with its affiliates, is behind most of the violence — largely directed at security forces. A lieutenant colonel and a major were among 11 security personnel martyred in an exchange of fire with the TTP in the Orakzai district earlier this week. The federal government and the army have repeatedly accused Kabul’s authorities of harbouring terrorist groups that launch attacks on Pakistani soil with impunity. Earlier this year, a UN report said the TTP “receive substantial logistical and operational support from the de facto authorities”, referring to the Taliban government in Kabul. A day earlier, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told the National Assembly that several efforts to convince the Afghan Taliban to stop backing the TTP had failed. “We will not tolerate this any longer,” Asif said. “United, we must respond to those facilitating them — whether the hideouts are on our soil or Afghan soil.” He warned that any response could cause collateral damage. “Everyone will have to bear the consequences, including those providing the hideouts.

      "title_orig": "Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado wins Nobel Peace Prize, dedicates award to Trump",
      "summary_orig": "Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado received the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. The committee chose to focus on Venezuela at this time, in a year dominated by US President Donald Trump’s repeated public statements that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Machado was on this year’s TIME Magazine “100 most influential People” list, where current US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said she was the “personification of resilience, tenacity, and patriotism”. “She is receiving the prize for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” said Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo. “As the leader of the democratic forces in the Venezuela, she is one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times,” he said. He said that Machado had been a “key unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided; an opposition that found common ground in the demand for free election and representative government”. “This is precisely what lies at the heart of democracy: our shared willingness to defend the principles of popular rule even though we disagree. At a time when democracy is under threat, it is more important than ever to defend this common ground,” he said. He stated that Venezuela had evolved from “a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal and authoritarian state” that was suffering from a humanitarian and economic crisis. “Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty even as the few at top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against its own population. Nearly eight million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution, and imprisonment,” he said. He further said that Venezuela’s authoritarian regime made carrying out political work in the country “extremely dangerous”, adding that Machado stood up for free and fair elections more than 20 years ago. Frydnes said that the Venezuela opposition leader had spoken out for judicial independence, human rights, and popular representation. “She has spent years working for the representation of the Venezuelan people,” he said. He further said that Machado was the opposition’s presidential candidate for the 2024 elections, but her candidacy was blocked by the regime. “She then backed the representative of another party Edmundo González Urrutia in the elections. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised across the political divides. They were trained as election observers to ensure a transparent and fair election. “Despite the risk of harassment, arrest, and torture, citizens across the country held watch over the polling stations. They made sure the final tallies were documented before the regime could destroy ballots and lie about the outcome,” he said, adding that the efforts of the collective opposition were innovative, brave, peaceful and democratic. Frydnes went on to say that democracy was a pre-condition for lasting peace. “However, we live in a world where democracy is in retreat. Where more and more authoritarian regimes are challenging norms and resorting to violence.” He said the repression of the Venezuelan population by its regime was not unique. “We see the same trends globally. Rule of law abused by those in control, free media silenced, critics imprisoned and societies pushed towards authoritarian rule and militarisation. “In 2024, more elections were held than ever before. But fewer and fewer are free and fair.” Noting that she has been forced to live in hiding in the past year, he said, “Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.” Frydnes said that Machado “embodies the hope for a different future — one where the fundamental rights of citizens are protected and their voices are heard”. US President Trump had made no secret of his desire to win this year’s prize. Since returning to the White House for his second term in January, the US leader has repeatedly insisted that he “deserves” the Nobel for his role in resolving numerous conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated. But Nobel Prize experts in Oslo had insisted in the run-up to Friday’s announcement that he had no chance, noting that his “America First” policies run counter to the ideals of the Peace Prize as laid out in Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will creating the award. Machado dedicated the award in part to Trump. “Oh my God … I have no words,” Machado told the secretary of the award body, Kristian Berg Harpviken, in a phone call which the Nobel Committee posted on social media. “I thank you so much, but I hope you understand this is a movement, this is an achievement of a whole society. I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve it,” she added.

The prize comes with a gold medal, a diploma and a prize sum of $1.2 million. The award will be presented at a formal ceremony in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of the prizes’ creator, Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel.

Machado is the first Venezuelan to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the sixth from Latin America. Her three adult children are living abroad for safety reasons. The United Nations human rights office welcomed the award to Machado as a recognition of “the clear aspirations of the people of Venezuela for free and fair elections”.

      "summary_en": "Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado received the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. The committee chose to focus on Venezuela at this time, in a year dominated by US President Donald Trump’s repeated public statements that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Machado was on this year’s TIME Magazine “100 most influential People” list, where current US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said she was the “personification of resilience, tenacity, and patriotism”. “She is receiving the prize for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” said Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo. “As the leader of the democratic forces in the Venezuela, she is one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times,” he said. He said that Machado had been a “key unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided; an opposition that found common ground in the demand for free election and representative government”. “This is precisely what lies at the heart of democracy: our shared willingness to defend the principles of popular rule even though we disagree. At a time when democracy is under threat, it is more important than ever to defend this common ground,” he said. He stated that Venezuela had evolved from “a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal and authoritarian state” that was suffering from a humanitarian and economic crisis. “Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty even as the few at top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against its own population. Nearly eight million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution, and imprisonment,” he said. He further said that Venezuela’s authoritarian regime made carrying out political work in the country “extremely dangerous”, adding that Machado stood up for free and fair elections more than 20 years ago. Frydnes said that the Venezuela opposition leader had spoken out for judicial independence, human rights, and popular representation. “She has spent years working for the representation of the Venezuelan people,” he said. He further said that Machado was the opposition’s presidential candidate for the 2024 elections, but her candidacy was blocked by the regime. “She then backed the representative of another party Edmundo González Urrutia in the elections. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised across the political divides. They were trained as election observers to ensure a transparent and fair election. “Despite the risk of harassment, arrest, and torture, citizens across the country held watch over the polling stations. They made sure the final tallies were documented before the regime could destroy ballots and lie about the outcome,” he said, adding that the efforts of the collective opposition were innovative, brave, peaceful and democratic. Frydnes went on to say that democracy was a pre-condition for lasting peace. “However, we live in a world where democracy is in retreat. Where more and more authoritarian regimes are challenging norms and resorting to violence.” He said the repression of the Venezuelan population by its regime was not unique. “We see the same trends globally. Rule of law abused by those in control, free media silenced, critics imprisoned and societies pushed towards authoritarian rule and militarisation. “In 2024, more elections were held than ever before. But fewer and fewer are free and fair.” Noting that she has been forced to live in hiding in the past year, he said, “Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.” Frydnes said that Machado “embodies the hope for a different future — one where the fundamental rights of citizens are protected and their voices are heard”. US President Trump had made no secret of his desire to win this year’s prize. Since returning to the White House for his second term in January, the US leader has repeatedly insisted that he “deserves” the Nobel for his role in resolving numerous conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated. But Nobel Prize experts in Oslo had insisted in the run-up to Friday’s announcement that he had no chance, noting that his “America First” policies run counter to the ideals of the Peace Prize as laid out in Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will creating the award. Machado dedicated the award in part to Trump. “Oh my God … I have no words,” Machado told the secretary of the award body, Kristian Berg Harpviken, in a phone call which the Nobel Committee posted on social media. “I thank you so much, but I hope you understand this is a movement, this is an achievement of a whole society. I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve it,” she added.

      "summary_orig": "The recent floods across Punjab have upended lives once again, displacing nearly 2.8 million people and affecting more than 4.2m, according to a Rapid Needs Assessment report from the United Nations. Amid the devastation, survivors are struggling not only with loss and uncertainty but with deep psychological distress that shows no sign of easing. A mother’s silent struggle Nazeera Bano, 39, a mother of four from Bait Nabi Shah village in Muzaffargarh’s Tehsil Alipur, has been having sleepless nights since this year’s floodwaters swallowed her home and forced her family to seek shelter in a government-donated tent. Now living with relatives in a nearby village, she said, the flashbacks of the ordeal still play out vividly in her mind, leaving her anxious and on edge. “My daughter is getting married next year, so we had all the dowry kept in the house. When the water entered, we barely had time to save anything. We brought the jewellery with us and some essential items, but not everything could be carried. I am now extremely worried. We are poor. How will we arrange for this again?” she said. Farmer Syed Jafar Raza inspects a damaged cotton plant, following monsoon rains and flooding, in Kabirwala on September 18, 2025. — Reuters “I get flashbacks of what my house looked like before and what it looks like now. I get nightmares of drowning along with my family. We have been told that we’ll head back home soon, but I am not sure how to forget about it.” Displacement, she continued, has been far from easy. For years, her biggest concern had been getting her daughter married. Every penny went into saving for her dowry, much of which was lost to the floods. Her husband now fears they might have to sell the daughter’s jewellery just to get by. The thought, Bano added, has left both her and her 19-year-old daughter deeply anxious. Even though her daughter’s in-laws endured the same ordeal, she worries they may not understand the family’s financial loss. “They are still expecting so much. How can I sleep at night in such circumstances?” she lamented. Bano’s ordeal shows the quiet anguish of countless families uprooted by the floods. While their homes and livelihoods may one day be rebuilt, the emotional toll is harder to recover from. Yet in most relief efforts, mental health remains an afterthought. When some survivors were asked about their jazbaat — their feelings — many did not even understand what they were being asked. Zainab Bibi, a flood victim, carries sacks of handouts on her head, that she received from a distribution point, following monsoon rains and rising water levels of the Chenab River, in Alipur in Muzaffargarh District, Punjab on September 12, 2025. — Reuters The weight of trauma This year’s World Mental Health Day theme, “mental health in humanitarian emergencies,” strikes a chord in Pakistan, where floods have left millions vulnerable. The World Health Organisation estimates that one in five people in such crises develops a mental health condition, yet psychological support remains scarce. Dr Fauziah Rabbani, Professor of Public Health and Implementation Scientist at the Brain & Mind Institute, Aga Khan University, and Amna Siddiqui, Consultant at the Brain & Mind Institute, told Dawn.com that floods contribute significantly to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) risk because exposure is often both severe and prolonged. PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event, often causing flashbacks, nightmares, and severe anxiety. “A recent analysis found PTSD prevalence in flood victims to be about 30 per cent as survivors witness injury or death, lose their homes and belongings, and experience repeated aftershocks of fear during ongoing rains or displacement, which can overwhelm coping mechanisms,” they said. They explained that many survivors experience repeated losses, such as homes, livelihoods, and livestock, which mirror known risk factors linked to elevated PTSD rates. Displaced individuals often display symptoms including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts or flashbacks. Physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, and rapid heart rate are also common. Citing the Pareshan study, conducted by the Brain & Mind Institute following the 2022 floods in Sindh’s Badin district, they said: “Approximately 23 per cent of adults had mild to moderate anxiety and 24 per cent had mild to moderate depression, indicating a large burden of psychological symptoms as assessed through standardised psychometric tools.” Maha Iftikhar, a Clinical Assessment Specialist at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (Lums), observed visible trauma in shelters. “Even when people appear to be coping, there are physical manifestations of stress in the form of appetite loss, difficulty sleeping, and constant worry,” she told Dawn.com . Children often show fear through clinginess or outbursts, while adults display fatigue or irritability. The pain of losing more than homes Journalist Akhtar Soomro, who travelled throughout Punjab to report on the floods, described the profound impact of the disaster on families, saying that while people were sad about losing their crops and machinery, they were most affected by losing their animals. “Families have a bond with their cattle: they name them, treat them like family members, and love them very much. Because of this, people were even more saddened by losing their animals,” Soomro told Dawn.com. Flood victims sit as they receive food handouts, following monsoon rains and rising water levels of the Chenab River, in Alipur in Muzaffargarh District, Punjab on September 12, 2025. — Reuters In Kasur and along the Sutlej River, some families refused to evacuate, staying in homes surrounded by water to protect their livestock. Even during Rescue 11 operations, villagers resisted, saying, “We do not want to go. We will stay here. No matter what the water level is, we will go to the roofs.” Soomro also noted the hidden toll on men. “Male members of a family often don’t cry openly, and it is very hard for them. Seeing their house empty and belongings scattered after a disaster is extremely painful. Even prosperous families are mentally affected despite having resources,” he observed. The physical echoes of trauma The stress of displacement manifests in the body as much as the mind. Dr Monica Vaswani, Psychiatrist and Assistant Professor at Karachi’s Asghar Psychiatric Hospital, explained, “People are not just emotionally shaken; their bodies also carry the trauma. We see patients with somatic complaints directly linked to the stress of displacement and loss.” Bushra Jabeen, Clinical Psychologist at Ittefaq Hospital Lahore, added that prolonged exposure to disaster conditions erodes coping mechanisms, especially for women and children.  “Even when people appear to manage externally, internally the stress is accumulating and affecting their health,” she said. Both professionals stressed the importance of recognising trauma holistically, acknowledging that the psychological impact of disasters extends beyond the mind and can manifest physically, requiring integrated support for both mental and physical health. The endless strain of displacement For Saeed, who hails from Baharewali in Mauza Azmatpur, the floods stole everything. “The government cannot compensate for the loss we have incurred. First of all, we did not get any help,” he told Dawn.com. He paid to save his family and animals, only to return to a village in ruins. “All our property has been lost,” he said. Each day brings new worries, including how to rebuild, where to find food, and how to keep his children safe. “I keep thinking about this. There is nothing else on my mind.” Residents work at a damaged property, following monsoon rains and flooding, in Kabirwala on September 17, 2025. — Reuters Dr Ehsen Naveed Irfan, a psychiatrist at Irfan Neuro-Psychiatry and General Hospital Mansehra, stressed that prolonged displacement deepens mental health struggles. “People need to be rehabilitated to proper residential facilities close to their original homes. Without this, their mental health struggles intensify, and returning to normal life becomes extremely difficult,” he said. His team, he said, trained local doctors and used psychological first aid, screening communities for PTSD and offering therapies like Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR). Building bridges to recovery Psychosocial support is vital for healing in the face of disaster. According to Bushra, “Psychologists and mental health professionals can help disaster survivors process their trauma experiences, strengthening social support, providing problem-solving and resilience training. Priority should be given to fulfilling their basic needs, while specialised therapies may be beneficial after initial support.” At the same time, she noted, local mental health systems are not well-prepared to handle emergencies, leaving many communities without timely support. Citing evidence, Dr Rabbani added that early interventions, particularly by trained frontline workers, can significantly reduce PTSD and depression. In Sindh, Lady Health Workers trained in psychosocial support and equipped with digital counselling tools helped communities cope, leading to measurable reductions in anxiety and depression. “Community-based approaches, peer support, and culturally sensitive interventions are key to sustaining recovery,” she emphasised. A fragile path forward Nazeera talks about her sleepless nights and constant headaches, but she clings to hope. “My only hope is that we go home safely and get our daughter married. As for my other family members, we will endure it. After all, who can fight nature?” Her words carry the quiet strength of families across Punjab, piecing together lives torn apart by floods. On World Mental Health Day, their story is a raw reminder: mending broken spirits is as crucial as rebuilding homes, a slow but stubborn journey toward hope, one day at a time.

When the water entered, we barely had time to save anything. We brought the jewellery with us and some essential items, but not everything could be carried. I am now extremely worried. We are poor. How will we arrange for this again?” she said. Farmer Syed Jafar Raza inspects a damaged cotton plant, following monsoon rains and flooding, in Kabirwala on September 18, 2025. — Reuters “I get flashbacks of what my house looked like before and what it looks like now. I get nightmares of drowning along with my family. We have been told that we’ll head back home soon, but I am not sure how to forget about it.” Displacement, she continued, has been far from easy. For years, her biggest concern had been getting her daughter married. Every penny went into saving for her dowry, much of which was lost to the floods. Her husband now fears they might have to sell the daughter’s jewellery just to get by. The thought, Bano added, has left both her and her 19-year-old daughter deeply anxious. Even though her daughter’s in-laws endured the same ordeal, she worries they may not understand the family’s financial loss. “They are still expecting so much. How can I sleep at night in such circumstances?” she lamented. Bano’s ordeal shows the quiet anguish of countless families uprooted by the floods. While their homes and livelihoods may one day be rebuilt, the emotional toll is harder to recover from. Yet in most relief efforts, mental health remains an afterthought. When some survivors were asked about their jazbaat — their feelings — many did not even understand what they were being asked. Zainab Bibi, a flood victim, carries sacks of handouts on her head, that she received from a distribution point, following monsoon rains and rising water levels of the Chenab River, in Alipur in Muzaffargarh District, Punjab on September 12, 2025. — Reuters The weight of trauma This year’s World Mental Health Day theme, “mental health in humanitarian emergencies,” strikes a chord in Pakistan, where floods have left millions vulnerable. The World Health Organisation estimates that one in five people in such crises develops a mental health condition, yet psychological support remains scarce. Dr Fauziah Rabbani, Professor of Public Health and Implementation Scientist at the Brain & Mind Institute, Aga Khan University, and Amna Siddiqui, Consultant at the Brain & Mind Institute, told Dawn.com that floods contribute significantly to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) risk because exposure is often both severe and prolonged. PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event, often causing flashbacks, nightmares, and severe anxiety. “A recent analysis found PTSD prevalence in flood victims to be about 30 per cent as survivors witness injury or death, lose their homes and belongings, and experience repeated aftershocks of fear during ongoing rains or displacement, which can overwhelm coping mechanisms,” they said. They explained that many survivors experience repeated losses, such as homes, livelihoods, and livestock, which mirror known risk factors linked to elevated PTSD rates. Displaced individuals often display symptoms including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts or flashbacks. Physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, and rapid heart rate are also common. Citing the Pareshan study, conducted by the Brain & Mind Institute following the 2022 floods in Sindh’s Badin district, they said: “Approximately 23 per cent of adults had mild to moderate anxiety and 24 per cent had mild to moderate depression, indicating a large burden of psychological symptoms as assessed through standardised psychometric tools.” Maha Iftikhar, a Clinical Assessment Specialist at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (Lums), observed visible trauma in shelters. “Even when people appear to be coping, there are physical manifestations of stress in the form of appetite loss, difficulty sleeping, and constant worry,” she told Dawn.com . Children often show fear through clinginess or outbursts, while adults display fatigue or irritability. The pain of losing more than homes Journalist Akhtar Soomro, who travelled throughout Punjab to report on the floods, described the profound impact of the disaster on families, saying that while people were sad about losing their crops and machinery, they were most affected by losing their animals. “Families have a bond with their cattle: they name them, treat them like family members, and love them very much. Because of this, people were even more saddened by losing their animals,” Soomro told Dawn.com. Flood victims sit as they receive food handouts, following monsoon rains and rising water levels of the Chenab River, in Alipur in Muzaffargarh District, Punjab on September 12, 2025. — Reuters In Kasur and along the Sutlej River, some families refused to evacuate, staying in homes surrounded by water to protect their livestock. Even during Rescue 11 operations, villagers resisted, saying, “We do not want to go. We will stay here. No matter what the water level is, we will go to the roofs.” Soomro also noted the hidden toll on men. “Male members of a family often don’t cry openly, and it is very hard for them. Seeing their house empty and belongings scattered after a disaster is extremely painful. Even prosperous families are mentally affected despite having resources,” he observed. The physical echoes of trauma The stress of displacement manifests in the body as much as the mind. Dr Monica Vaswani, Psychiatrist and Assistant Professor at Karachi’s Asghar Psychiatric Hospital, explained, “People are not just emotionally shaken; their bodies also carry the trauma. We see patients with somatic complaints directly linked to the stress of displacement and loss.” Bushra Jabeen, Clinical Psychologist at Ittefaq Hospital Lahore, added that prolonged exposure to disaster conditions erodes coping mechanisms, especially for women and children.  “Even when people appear to manage externally, internally the stress is accumulating and affecting their health,” she said. Both professionals stressed the importance of recognising trauma holistically, acknowledging that the psychological impact of disasters extends beyond the mind and can manifest physically, requiring integrated support for both mental and physical health. The endless strain of displacement For Saeed, who hails from Baharewali in Mauza Azmatpur, the floods stole everything. “The government cannot compensate for the loss we have incurred. First of all, we did not get any help,” he told Dawn.com. He paid to save his family and animals, only to return to a village in ruins. “All our property has been lost,” he said. Each day brings new worries, including how to rebuild, where to find food, and how to keep his children safe. “I keep thinking about this. There is nothing else on my mind.” Residents work at a damaged property, following monsoon rains and flooding, in Kabirwala on September 17, 2025. — Reuters Dr Ehsen Naveed Irfan, a psychiatrist at Irfan Neuro-Psychiatry and General Hospital Mansehra, stressed that prolonged displacement deepens mental health struggles. “People need to be rehabilitated to proper residential facilities close to their original homes. Without this, their mental health struggles intensify, and returning to normal life becomes extremely difficult,” he said. His team, he said, trained local doctors and used psychological first aid, screening communities for PTSD and offering therapies like Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR). Building bridges to recovery Psychosocial support is vital for healing in the face of disaster. According to Bushra, “Psychologists and mental health professionals can help disaster survivors process their trauma experiences, strengthening social support, providing problem-solving and resilience training. Priority should be given to fulfilling their basic needs, while specialised therapies may be beneficial after initial support.” At the same time, she noted, local mental health systems are not well-prepared to handle emergencies, leaving many communities without timely support. Citing evidence, Dr Rabbani added that early interventions, particularly by trained frontline workers, can significantly reduce PTSD and depression. In Sindh, Lady Health Workers trained in psychosocial support and equipped with digital counselling tools helped communities cope, leading to measurable reductions in anxiety and depression. “Community-based approaches, peer support, and culturally sensitive interventions are key to sustaining recovery,” she emphasised. A fragile path forward Nazeera talks about her sleepless nights and constant headaches, but she clings to hope. “My only hope is that we go home safely and get our daughter married. As for my other family members, we will endure it. After all, who can fight nature?” Her words carry the quiet strength of families across Punjab, piecing together lives torn apart by floods. On World Mental Health Day, their story is a raw reminder: mending broken spirits is as crucial as rebuilding homes, a slow but stubborn journey toward hope, one day at a time.

      "summary_orig": "Thirty terrorists involved in the Orakzai incident earlier this week — during which 11 security personnel, including two officers, were martyred — were killed in a “retribution operation”, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday. The incident in Orakzai took place on Tuesday night when security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district on the reported presence of  “Indian proxy Fitna Al Khawarij ”. In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij , mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. In the Tuesday operation, 19 “India-sponsored” terrorists were killed, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, adding that 11 security personnel, including two officers, had also embraced martyrdom during the exchange of fire. In a statement issued today, the ISPR said, “Security forces have been conducting a series of retribution operations against the kharijis involved in [the] heinous incident that occurred in Orakzai District on October 7, resulting in the shahadat of brave sons of soil, including Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq and Major Tayyab Rahat.” It added that during an operation in the Jamal Maya area of Orakzai, conducted on the basis of credible intelligence, “all 30 India-sponsored khwarij involved in the terrorist incident have been sent to hell” after an intense exchange of fire. “These successful operations have avenged the heinous act and have brought the main perpetrators to justice,” the statement read. It said sanitisaton operations were under way to “hunt and eliminate any other India-sponsored khariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined and remain steadfast to eradicate and wipe out the menace of India-sponsored terrorism from the country”. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that security personnel were engaged in “safeguarding the motherland against the enemy by risking their lives”. According to state-run Radio Pakistan , he also reiterated the government’s resolve to stamp out the menace of terrorism from the country. President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement on the PPP’s X account, lauded the security forces’ “courageous” operation against “India-sponsored terrorists”. It quoted the president as saying that the nation would forever remember the sacrifices of Lieutenant Colonel Tariq and Major Rahat and that security forces had made the nation proud by dismantling a network of terrorists. “Continuous successes against terrorism reflect our resolve, [and] the brave sons of the soil have written history by sacrificing their lives for the protection of the motherland,” the president added. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also lauded the efforts of security forces, saying that the nation stood with them in the fight against terrorism. A statement posted on the interior ministry’s X account quoted Naqvi as saying, “I pay tribute to the security forces for thwarting the designs of the Fitna Al Khawarij terrorists. The security forces achieved great success by bringing 30 terrorists to a decisive end. “We will not let the terrorists of Fitna Al Khawarij hide anywhere in Pakistan,” he said. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Just a day after the Orakzai incident, a major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district. Last month, 19 soldiers were martyred in KP in multiple incidents in a span of a few days. Following that, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said that the “Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khawarij or stand with Pakistan”. Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan. It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. But Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations. Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. After Tuesday’s IBO in Orakzai, a statement from the ISPR said the participants at the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference held at General Headquarters on Wednesday had expressed the resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of “Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan . A day ago, PM Shehbaz said during a meeting of the federal cabinet that the nation was united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country, and the government would take all measures to crush violence perpetrated from across the border. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a similar warning in the National Assembly same day about going after terrorist facilitators “wherever they are”. Saying “enough is enough”, he added that the facilitators of terrorism would have to pay, whether they were present on Pakistani or Afghan soil.",

      "title_orig": "KP govt must protect its people instead of begging Afghanistan for security: DG ISPR",
      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Friday that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government should work on protecting the people of the province instead of “begging Afghanistan” for security. The DG ISPR made these remarks while addressing a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He said governance gaps in KP were being paid for by the blood of security personnel. “Appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators is never and not a policy,” he asserted, adding that the state and its institutions would not be bothered by “any political distortions”. “The state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of any single person who is singularly the most responsible person for bringing terrorism back to KP.” He said that he hoped the government would focus on governance and the people it was duty-bound to protect. “We also hope that instead of begging Afghanistan for security, you will protect this province and its people.” The DG ISPR began the press conference by paying homage on behalf of the armed forces of Pakistan to the “brave sons of soil” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said the purpose of the press conference was to give an overview of the security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the past two decades, Pakistan, particularly KP, has been facing the issue of terrorism, he said. In 2024, he said, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP, 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians were killed. Moreover, he continued, 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025 until September 15. In these operations, 970 terrorists were killed while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred. When the frequency of terrorism incidents increased in 2021, “the response also went up”, the DG ISPR said. “And more number of kharijis were killed in subsequent years.” The DG ISPR said following the 2014 attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, security forces had started uprooting terrorism as part of a comprehensive strategy. “We reached close to [realising] the dream of a peaceful Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. [But], unfortunately, as part of a plan, terrorists and their facilitators were then provided space here. “Governance and public welfare were deliberately weakened and attempts were made to build a misleading narrative. The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are paying its price with their blood and sacrifices even today.” Factors behind rise of militancy He then outlined the factors that led to this situation. First reason, he said, was not fully implementing the National Action Plan, followed by politicising the issue of terrorism, India using Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the provision of modern weapons to terrorists in Afghanistan and the existence of a “terrorism-crime nexus” that had “complete local and political backing”. Going back to the 2014 APS attack, he said all political parties, and the provincial and federal governments devised the NAP. “All political parties agreed that the implementation of the NAP was necessary for eliminating terrorism.” But, he added, the then-government removed some provisions of the plan in 2021 despite progress in those areas and came up with the “revised” NAP. All political parties, provincial governments and the federal government then agreed to fully implement all 14 points of the revised plan, he said. Pointing to a graphic of the plan on the screen, he said the first point concerned kinetic operations. “Is this being worked on or not? I have presented the data for KP to you. Just in KP, are law enforcement agencies not conducting more than 40 intelligence-based operations?” He asserted that the empirical evidence demonstrated that work was being done on the first point of the NAP. He then went on to question the work being done on the remaining 13 points. “Today, are we all standing under one narrative? Do you not hear voices calling for talks with these terrorists? Are we following this NAP? “Does the solution to all problems lie in dialogue? You tell me. If the solution for every problem is in dialogue, then when India fired missiles on Pakistan on May 6 and 7 … why didn’t the people of this country say let’s hold talks?” If the solution lay in just holding dialogue, there would be no wars, he emphasised. Coming to the fifth point, the military spokesperson said it had been decided to “break the terror-crime nexus” in order to eradicate terrorism. Moreover, he said, it had also been decided to “strengthen the judiciary” with regard to counter-terrorism cases. Then, pulling up another graphic, the DG ISPR detailed the cases in anti-terrorism courts in KP. He said that no one was convicted, while 34 cases were pending. “This is the judicial system that was to be strengthened. The political government of the time decided it, we did not.” The DG ISPR further stated that the decision had been made to strengthen KP police. Noting that the provincial police was currently 3,200-personnel strong, he asked: “ The terrorism (situation) is before you all. Is this [number] enough?“ The army spokesperson also noted that the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan was being “politicised”. “Misleading things were said when these decisions were taken.” He said that after the US left Afghanistan in 2021, “they left behind weapons and ammunition that are now being used by terrorists. Those weapons were found in the custody of terrorists killed in operations in KP.” The DG ISPR replied to a question about how things will change concerning the NAP by saying, “We know how things will change … they will change once we work on this NAP with clarity and in unison. There will be change when those who play politics are asked why they are playing with people’s lives and property and why they are supporting the statements of terrorists.” Last night’s Kabul explosion During the press conference, the DG ISPR was also asked about media reports alleging a strike was carried out in Kabul last night to eliminate the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) leader Noor Wali Mehsud. In his response, he said the army had taken note of the reports circulating on social media and the statement issued by the Taliban spokesperson. “Afghanistan is a neighbourly, Islamic country. We have historical connections, cultural connections. Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for four decades. We only say one thing to the Afghan government: do not allow your soil to be used for terrorism against Pakistan,” he added. He pointed out that trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan was also continuing, and many Afghans came to Pakistan for medical reasons. “So we only have an extremely fair demand: don’t let your soil be used by non-state actors and terrorist groups.” “Is it wrong to ask? It is absolutely fair, it is correct, it is rational, it is our right. And for this, we also engage them at multiple levels,” he said, highlighting several bilateral and multilateral engagements. “Yes, we do engage them and we clearly communicate [to them] … that these are the [terrorist] leaders, their facilitators and their centres [in Afghanistan]. Yes, we engage [with Afghanistan], but at the same time, we are doing and will continue to do whatever is necessary to protect the lives of Pakistan’s people and its territorial integrity,” the DG ISPR continued. When pressed by another reporter for more clarity on alleged strikes in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said, “I have made it clear that Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this. And I have also said that all the necessary steps for protecting the people’s lives and property are being taken and will continue to be taken.” Saudi defence deal and international engagement to curb Afghan terrorism Questioned about the Saudi defence deal and whether the kingdom could be engaged in the talks with Afghanistan to resolve the issue of cross-border militancy, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan continued to engage the country and its other allies even before the pact. “We engage the Afghans directly at multiple levels and also through allied countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, China, US, Turkiye and many more. They all understand that the space being given to non-state actors in Afghanistan is not just against Pakistan.” He said ‘‘every alphabet’’ of non-state actors was found in Afghanistan, pointing to various groups such as the TTP, IS-K, BLA and more. DG Chaudhry said these terrorists had no affiliation or religious or cultural identity and were available to the highest bidder. ’’If you allow these elements space in your country, then every kind of terrorist organisation will be found. That is why we are engaging them because all of them are concerned because this threat from non-state actors is not only a danger to Pakistan or to the region but it is becoming a threat to the whole world.“ He said the Afghan authorities had to decide whether they would allow Afghanistan to become a sanctuary for terrorists or not, adding that history showed that nurturing such groups often led to them turning on their benefactors. DG Chaudhry said such groups were a threat to Afghanistan and its people as well. He said Pakistan’s job was to engage the Afghan authorities and take necessary action to defend and protect the lives of its people. On a question about an international coalition to strike terrorist havens in Afghanistan, he said while such consultations and engagement continued, “we know that your security cannot be granted by external players, while we keep on engaging them, the responsibility to protect your life and property and people is of Pakistan’s state and institutions and military and that is where our first and foremost focus is’’. The DG ISPR also remarked on whether the presence of non-state actors was a product of the transition of the Afghan Taliban from a non-state actor to a state entity, or due to the interference of foreign actors such as India. “Perhaps it is the clout and influence of these non-state actors in Afghanistan that has grown beyond control,” he said. “Perhaps it is the factions within Afghan government who cannot agree on how to resolve this problem. But that is for them to decide.” Past engagement with TTP and change in KP leadership Questioned about past engagement with the TTP and the change in the KP leadership that saw Ali Amin Gandapur stepping down as chief minister, the DG ISPR said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists). Where is this voice coming from? Who is saying this? Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations. ‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations. It is for everyone to see that today, or five years back or six or seven or eight or in any timeframe, who is that person and political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’ DG Chaudhry said the person saying so was responsible for the state in the past but now he was not and yet he still persisted with his stance. “It is absolutely clear that this stance and confusing the people through it that the solution to this problem is not in counterterrorism or operations but in talking to the people who slaughtered your children … is for everyone to see.’’ He said the army, police and children of Pakistan were paying the price for the above ‘‘perverted and criminal thinking’’. DG Chaundry said talks were indeed engaged in but questioned what was the result of it all, pointing to the Afghan Taliban’s promises in the Doha peace talks and their failure to abide by them. Questioned about the change in KP leadership and how it might be signalling a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR said the establishment was itself a part of the state. “Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’ He questioned whether the military could afford distraction by political shenanigans and said the answer was no. Faiz Hameed court martial proceedings Questioned about the court martial proceedings against former spymaster retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, DG Chaudhry said: ‘‘That legal process is ongoing and will come to its logical and just conclusion.’’ To another question about an alleged delay in the court martial proceedings, DG Chaudhry said the matter concerned a former intelligence chief and hence the “gravity” of the matter was high. ’’The state and the institution have to be absolutely and deliberately correct in that. All the requirements of procedure, process and justice have to be met because you would not like to try such an important and critical case in hurry and haste,“ he added. “The Pakistan Army’s system of internal accountability does not work off allegations but facts and evidence. There is a process to it and anybody who is charged is given complete right to defend themselves and that time will be given and is being given, so we are not worried about any delay because we have to fulfill all the requirements of justice and process.’’ He said another reason for the court martial proceedings was that ‘‘when you turn a relation into a political and personal relation, then you will have to answer for that. But who did it? The one who was [heading] the state at the time and doing politics and that is why, we always say not to involve us in your politics.’’ The DG ISPR said all political parties and politicians were respectable for the army but it was unacceptable if anyone considered their politics to be above the state. “If a single person thinks their being is greater than Pakistan, then that is unacceptable.’’ Giving the example of the current state of Indian armed forces and the creeping influence of Hindutva , the military spokesperson said the military was the ‘‘ultimate instrument of violence’’ of the state and politicising it would lead to ‘‘horrible results’’. Issue of US weapons left behind in Afghanistan In response to a question about US weapons in the hands of terrorists, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan was engaged with Washington on the matter. “This equipment is not only being used in Pakistan by Fitna al-Khawarij or Fitna al-Hindustan but the equipment left with non-state actors can be used anywhere,” he explained. “We do share data and engage with them (the US) and they understand how the equipment is used by non-state actors.” Collateral damage during operations In response to a question about collateral damage during operations and criticism by affected locals, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that operations were intelligence-based and “very precise”. “We cannot believe statements about collateral damage because we are the army of Pakistan and KP,” he replied. “If terrorists have taken a family hostage and are firing at innocent people and we respond, does that make it collateral damage or facilitation?” The DG ISPR noted that facilitators, whether they were doing it out of desperation or for financial gain, had three choices: “Turn terrorists over to the law. If that is not possible, then join the state and work to eradicate the threat,” the military spokesperson said. “If a terrorist violates the sanctity of someone’s home by entering it, and you do not force him out, that makes you a facilitator. Where is the collateral damage? there’s no collateral damage. There’s a terrorist and a facilitator.”",

      "title_en": "KP govt must protect its people instead of begging Afghanistan for security: DG ISPR",
      "summary_en": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Friday that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government should work on protecting the people of the province instead of “begging Afghanistan” for security. The DG ISPR made these remarks while addressing a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He said governance gaps in KP were being paid for by the blood of security personnel. “Appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators is never and not a policy,” he asserted, adding that the state and its institutions would not be bothered by “any political distortions”. “The state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of any single person who is singularly the most responsible person for bringing terrorism back to KP.” He said that he hoped the government would focus on governance and the people it was duty-bound to protect. “We also hope that instead of begging Afghanistan for security, you will protect this province and its people.” The DG ISPR began the press conference by paying homage on behalf of the armed forces of Pakistan to the “brave sons of soil” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said the purpose of the press conference was to give an overview of the security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the past two decades, Pakistan, particularly KP, has been facing the issue of terrorism, he said. In 2024, he said, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP, 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians were killed. Moreover, he continued, 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025 until September 15. In these operations, 970 terrorists were killed while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred. When the frequency of terrorism incidents increased in 2021, “the response also went up”, the DG ISPR said. “And more number of kharijis were killed in subsequent years.” The DG ISPR said following the 2014 attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, security forces had started uprooting terrorism as part of a comprehensive strategy. “We reached close to [realising] the dream of a peaceful Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. [But], unfortunately, as part of a plan, terrorists and their facilitators were then provided space here. “Governance and public welfare were deliberately weakened and attempts were made to build a misleading narrative. The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are paying its price with their blood and sacrifices even today.” Factors behind rise of militancy He then outlined the factors that led to this situation. First reason, he said, was not fully implementing the National Action Plan, followed by politicising the issue of terrorism, India using Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the provision of modern weapons to terrorists in Afghanistan and the existence of a “terrorism-crime nexus” that had “complete local and political backing”. Going back to the 2014 APS attack, he said all political parties, and the provincial and federal governments devised the NAP. “All political parties agreed that the implementation of the NAP was necessary for eliminating terrorism.” But, he added, the then-government removed some provisions of the plan in 2021 despite progress in those areas and came up with the “revised” NAP. All political parties, provincial governments and the federal government then agreed to fully implement all 14 points of the revised plan, he said. Pointing to a graphic of the plan on the screen, he said the first point concerned kinetic operations. “Is this being worked on or not? I have presented the data for KP to you. Just in KP, are law enforcement agencies not conducting more than 40 intelligence-based operations?” He asserted that the empirical evidence demonstrated that work was being done on the first point of the NAP. He then went on to question the work being done on the remaining 13 points. “Today, are we all standing under one narrative? Do you not hear voices calling for talks with these terrorists? Are we following this NAP? “Does the solution to all problems lie in dialogue? You tell me. If the solution for every problem is in dialogue, then when India fired missiles on Pakistan on May 6 and 7 … why didn’t the people of this country say let’s hold talks?” If the solution lay in just holding dialogue, there would be no wars, he emphasised. Coming to the fifth point, the military spokesperson said it had been decided to “break the terror-crime nexus” in order to eradicate terrorism. Moreover, he said, it had also been decided to “strengthen the judiciary” with regard to counter-terrorism cases. Then, pulling up another graphic, the DG ISPR detailed the cases in anti-terrorism courts in KP. He said that no one was convicted, while 34 cases were pending. “This is the judicial system that was to be strengthened. The political government of the time decided it, we did not.” The DG ISPR further stated that the decision had been made to strengthen KP police. Noting that the provincial police was currently 3,200-personnel strong, he asked: “ The terrorism (situation) is before you all. Is this [number] enough?“ The army spokesperson also noted that the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan was being “politicised”. “Misleading things were said when these decisions were taken.” He said that after the US left Afghanistan in 2021, “they left behind weapons and ammunition that are now being used by terrorists. Those weapons were found in the custody of terrorists killed in operations in KP.” The DG ISPR replied to a question about how things will change concerning the NAP by saying, “We know how things will change … they will change once we work on this NAP with clarity and in unison. There will be change when those who play politics are asked why they are playing with people’s lives and property and why they are supporting the statements of terrorists.” Last night’s Kabul explosion During the press conference, the DG ISPR was also asked about media reports alleging a strike was carried out in Kabul last night to eliminate the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) leader Noor Wali Mehsud. In his response, he said the army had taken note of the reports circulating on social media and the statement issued by the Taliban spokesperson. “Afghanistan is a neighbourly, Islamic country. We have historical connections, cultural connections. Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for four decades. We only say one thing to the Afghan government: do not allow your soil to be used for terrorism against Pakistan,” he added. He pointed out that trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan was also continuing, and many Afghans came to Pakistan for medical reasons. “So we only have an extremely fair demand: don’t let your soil be used by non-state actors and terrorist groups.” “Is it wrong to ask? It is absolutely fair, it is correct, it is rational, it is our right. And for this, we also engage them at multiple levels,” he said, highlighting several bilateral and multilateral engagements. “Yes, we do engage them and we clearly communicate [to them] … that these are the [terrorist] leaders, their facilitators and their centres [in Afghanistan]. Yes, we engage [with Afghanistan], but at the same time, we are doing and will continue to do whatever is necessary to protect the lives of Pakistan’s people and its territorial integrity,” the DG ISPR continued. When pressed by another reporter for more clarity on alleged strikes in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said, “I have made it clear that Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this. And I have also said that all the necessary steps for protecting the people’s lives and property are being taken and will continue to be taken.” Saudi defence deal and international engagement to curb Afghan terrorism Questioned about the Saudi defence deal and whether the kingdom could be engaged in the talks with Afghanistan to resolve the issue of cross-border militancy, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan continued to engage the country and its other allies even before the pact. “We engage the Afghans directly at multiple levels and also through allied countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, China, US, Turkiye and many more. They all understand that the space being given to non-state actors in Afghanistan is not just against Pakistan.” He said ‘‘every alphabet’’ of non-state actors was found in Afghanistan, pointing to various groups such as the TTP, IS-K, BLA and more. DG Chaudhry said these terrorists had no affiliation or religious or cultural identity and were available to the highest bidder. ’’If you allow these elements space in your country, then every kind of terrorist organisation will be found. That is why we are engaging them because all of them are concerned because this threat from non-state actors is not only a danger to Pakistan or to the region but it is becoming a threat to the whole world.“ He said the Afghan authorities had to decide whether they would allow Afghanistan to become a sanctuary for terrorists or not, adding that history showed that nurturing such groups often led to them turning on their benefactors. DG Chaudhry said such groups were a threat to Afghanistan and its people as well. He said Pakistan’s job was to engage the Afghan authorities and take necessary action to defend and protect the lives of its people. On a question about an international coalition to strike terrorist havens in Afghanistan, he said while such consultations and engagement continued, “we know that your security cannot be granted by external players, while we keep on engaging them, the responsibility to protect your life and property and people is of Pakistan’s state and institutions and military and that is where our first and foremost focus is’’. The DG ISPR also remarked on whether the presence of non-state actors was a product of the transition of the Afghan Taliban from a non-state actor to a state entity, or due to the interference of foreign actors such as India. “Perhaps it is the clout and influence of these non-state actors in Afghanistan that has grown beyond control,” he said. “Perhaps it is the factions within Afghan government who cannot agree on how to resolve this problem. But that is for them to decide.” Past engagement with TTP and change in KP leadership Questioned about past engagement with the TTP and the change in the KP leadership that saw Ali Amin Gandapur stepping down as chief minister, the DG ISPR said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists). Where is this voice coming from? Who is saying this? Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations. ‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations. It is for everyone to see that today, or five years back or six or seven or eight or in any timeframe, who is that person and political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’ DG Chaudhry said the person saying so was responsible for the state in the past but now he was not and yet he still persisted with his stance. “It is absolutely clear that this stance and confusing the people through it that the solution to this problem is not in counterterrorism or operations but in talking to the people who slaughtered your children … is for everyone to see.’’ He said the army, police and children of Pakistan were paying the price for the above ‘‘perverted and criminal thinking’’. DG Chaundry said talks were indeed engaged in but questioned what was the result of it all, pointing to the Afghan Taliban’s promises in the Doha peace talks and their failure to abide by them. Questioned about the change in KP leadership and how it might be signalling a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR said the establishment was itself a part of the state. “Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’ He questioned whether the military could afford distraction by political shenanigans and said the answer was no. Faiz Hameed court martial proceedings Questioned about the court martial proceedings against former spymaster retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, DG Chaudhry said: ‘‘That legal process is ongoing and will come to its logical and just conclusion.’’ To another question about an alleged delay in the court martial proceedings, DG Chaudhry said the matter concerned a former intelligence chief and hence the “gravity” of the matter was high. ’’The state and the institution have to be absolutely and deliberately correct in that. All the requirements of procedure, process and justice have to be met because you would not like to try such an important and critical case in hurry and haste,“ he added. “The Pakistan Army’s system of internal accountability does not work off allegations but facts and evidence. There is a process to it and anybody who is charged is given complete right to defend themselves and that time will be given and is being given, so we are not worried about any delay because we have to fulfill all the requirements of justice and process.’’ He said another reason for the court martial proceedings was that ‘‘when you turn a relation into a political and personal relation, then you will have to answer for that. But who did it? The one who was [heading] the state at the time and doing politics and that is why, we always say not to involve us in your politics.’’ The DG ISPR said all political parties and politicians were respectable for the army but it was unacceptable if anyone considered their politics to be above the state. “If a single person thinks their being is greater than Pakistan, then that is unacceptable.’’ Giving the example of the current state of Indian armed forces and the creeping influence of Hindutva , the military spokesperson said the military was the ‘‘ultimate instrument of violence’’ of the state and politicising it would lead to ‘‘horrible results’’.

      "summary_orig": "Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for promoting democratic rights in her country and her struggle to achieve a transition to democracy, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said. The following are some facts about the democracy campaigner: Upper-class background Maria Corina Machado, 58, was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on October 7, 1967. She is an industrial engineer by training, and her father was a prominent businessman in Venezuela’s steel industry. Her upper-class roots have made her a target of criticism from Venezuela’s governing socialist party. In hiding Machado won a resounding victory in the opposition’s primary election in 2023, and her rallies attracted large crowds, but a ban from holding public office prevented her from running for president against Nicolas Maduro in an election in 2024, and she went into hiding. The country’s electoral authority and top court say Maduro, whose time in office has been marked by a deep economic and social crisis, won the election, though they have never published detailed tallies. Machado emerged from hiding to make a brief appearance during a protest before Maduro’s inauguration in January. She was briefly arrested and then freed. Advocate of liberal economic reforms Machado advocates for liberal economic reforms, including the privatisation of state-owned enterprises such as PDVSA, Venezuela’s oil company. She also supports the creation of welfare programs aimed at aiding the country’s poorest citizens. Political activism Her political activism has come at a cost, leaving her isolated as nearly all of her senior advisers have been detained or forced to leave the country. Machado herself has accused Maduro’s administration of operating as a “criminal mafia.” Collective struggle Though sometimes criticised for being egotistical, even by her own mother, Machado rarely speaks about herself in public. Instead, she frames her campaign as a collective struggle for redemption and unity, aiming to inspire hope among Venezuelans weary of economic hardship and social decay.",

      "summary_orig": "India will reopen its embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul that was shut four years ago, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Friday. India had closed its embassy in Kabul after the Taliban seized power following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces in 2021, but opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support, and humanitarian aid. About a dozen countries including China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Turkiye have embassies operating in Kabul, although Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration. New Delhi’s announcement came as Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi began talks with Jaishankar on what is the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since 2021. “India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,” Jaishankar told Muttaqi in his opening remarks. “Closer cooperation between us contributes to your national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” he said, adding that India’s “technical mission” in Kabul was being upgraded to an embassy. According to Hindustan Times , Jaishankar also said that closer cooperation between the two countries would contribute to “regional stability and resilience“. “As a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in your development and progress,” Jaishankar said, according to the report. Meanwhile, Muttaqi was quoted as saying that India was the first country to respond to “the recent earthquake in Afghanistan”. “Afghanistan looks at India as a close friend. Afghanistan wants relations based on mutual respect, trade and people-to-people relations,” the Afghan minister was quoted as saying. New Delhi does not officially recognise the Taliban government but has taken tentative steps to thaw ties with meetings and talks between senior officials in their respective foreign ministries. The visit comes after Muttaqi attended a regional meeting in Moscow where Afgha­nistan’s neighbours including Pakistan, Iran, China and several Central Asian countries issued a joint statement opposing the deployment of foreign military infrastructure in the region. The statement was regarded as a signal of opposition to US President Donald Trump’s stated objective to retake control of the Bagram military base near Kabul.",

According to the press release, the CTD had received confidential information that terrorists belonging to the banned organisation Fitna-al-Khawarij were planning a “major terrorist operation” on Company Road within the limits of Domail police station. Fitnah-al Khawarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Per the statement, the CTD’s Special (SWAT) team surrounded the area immediately along with the district police. “Upon seeing the operation team, the terrorists tried to escape and started indiscriminate firing on the officials,” it said. “CTD and police retaliated vigorously to protect themselves and arrest the terrorists.” The exchange of fire between the CTD team and the terrorists reportedly continued for about 25 minutes. After the firing stopped, a search and clearance operation was conducted in the area and two terrorists were found dead, both of whom were identified as being from Bannu, it added. “Some of the terrorists’ accomplices took advantage of the darkness to successfully escape.” One of the terrorists killed was identified as the mastermind behind an attack on the Bannu CTD team on April 30, 2025, in which four personnel were killed and one injured. He had also been involved in attacks on two police posts in the district, in which a constable was martyred, the statement saod. The other was involved in several attacks and targeted killings on CTD and district police in 2023, including attacking and injuring a constable in November of that year, according to the CTD. “Two Kalashnikovs, six magazines, 23 rounds, two hand grenades, two mobile phones and two cards of the banned TTP were recovered from the possession of the slain terrorists,” the press release said, adding that additional police and CTD personnel had launched a search operation in the area to arrest the escaped terrorists. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. A major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district yesterday, according to the media wing of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The incident occurred a day after the ISPR reported that 11 security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, had been killed in an exchange of fire between the forces and TTP terrorists in KP’s Orakzai district.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: After Starlink , a European giant and a Chinese company, Amazon’s satellite broadband initiative — Project Kuiper — has expressed interest in rolling out its services in Pakistan. In a meeting with Minister for IT and Telecom Shaza Fatima Khawaja, a delegation from Amazon outlined plans to launch Project Kuiper in Pakistan by the end of 2026. The delegation, led by Mostafa Mousa — Project Kuiper’s lead for Licensing and Regulatory Affairs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa — also included Jeff Kietzemen and Hisham Alshaer. The IT minister welcomed the delegation, stressing that this development signals growing confidence among global tech giants in Pakistan’s expanding digital economy. She noted that the entry of Project Kuiper would create new opportunities for affordable, high-speed internet, particularly in remote and underserved communities where traditional connectivity options remain limited. Project Kuiper is Amazon’s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network, which plans to deploy 3,236 satellites to deliver broadband speeds of up to 400 Mbps using low-cost user terminals. Minister insists move signals tech giants’ growing confidence in Pakistan’s digital sector The delegation shared its intent to establish ground infrastructure in Pakistan, including gateways and points of presence (PoPs), to ensure stable connectivity and smooth integration with local networks. Welcoming Amazon’s plans, Ms Fatima said the partnership aligns perfectly with the government’s vision of “Digital Nation Pakistan”. “This initiative is not just about faster internet — it’s about opportunity,” she noted. “With Project Kuiper, we are taking a concrete step towards digital inclusion so every citizen, no matter where they live, can connect, learn and grow.” The Ministry of IT and Telecom emphasised that collaborations like these will create new opportunities for Pakistan’s IT sector, boost innovation and e-commerce and strengthen Pakistan’s position in the global digital ecosystem. Pakistan’s satellite broadband policy is guided by the Pakistan Satellite Services Regulatory Policy (PASRP), which defines procedures for foreign operators seeking landing rights and spectrum access. Several international companies have already shown interest . SpaceX’s Starlink has completed preliminary technical submissions, while OneWeb, a subsidiary of the French group Eutelsat, has opened talks for gateway testing and commercial collaboration. The application of the Chinese satellite internet provider, SSST, is currently in the initial process. Amazon’s Project Kuiper has now become the fourth major global LEO satellite operator to formally engage with Pakistan. The PASRP’s regulatory framework requires satellite operators to secure multiple clearances, including landing rights, gateway licensing, spectrum allocation and security vetting, through bodies such as Suparco, the Frequency Allocation Board, Pakistan Telecomm­unication Authority, and the Ministry of Interior.

His resignation letter, which was shared with the media the previous night, has apparently gotten lost in red tape, with Governor House denying having ever received it. Officials at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat told Dawn that Mr Gandapur’s resignation had been delivered to the Governor House on Wednesday night. A copy of the letter seen by Dawn showed that it was received by the governor’s staff at 10:57pm. However, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who was in Islamabad on Thursday, and other officials at the Governor’s Secre­tariat remained tight-lipped about the issue. An official on Mr Kundi’s staff told Dawn that they had yet to receive the resignation letter. “As far as I know, the resignation has not yet reached the Governor’s Office,” the official said, adding that the governor would sign it whenever he received it. He further said that Governor Kundi was due to return to the provincial capital on Friday (today). Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Mr Kundi said he had not yet received the chief minister’s resignation and would sign it as soon as it was received. He described reports regarding the receipt of the resignation letter at the Governor House as “fake news.” Meanwhile, in his first media interaction after ‘stepping down’, Mr Gandapur asserted that the federal government could not topple the PTI government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Commenting on the delay in the acceptance of his resignation, he termed it a “drama” and advised the government not to waste time, warning that such a delay would harm the province. When asked if he had been re-offered the chief ministership, he denied receiving any such offer, saying that even if such an offer were made, he would not accept it. ‘PTI enables terrorists’ Meanwhile, at a press conference in Isla­m­abad, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused the PTI of “enabling terrorists”. In his view, the problem that led to Mr Gandapur’s ouster was that he did not do as he was told i.e., “enable and support terrorists and prevent actions against them”. He alleged that CM-in-waiting Sohail Afridi was nominated to “support, promote, and enable” terrorism in the province. “These [people] are enabled by a person sitting in jail,” the information minister said, calling Imran Khan the “chief sponsor of terrorism”.

      "summary_orig": "POLITICAL uncertainty in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has been deepening with each passing day, as both major coalition partners in the Chaudhry Anwarul Haq-led government have urged their leaders to allow them to withdraw from the coalition, ahead of the upcoming elections. Following recent shifts in political affiliations in the 53-member AJK Legislative Assembly, the PPP has raised its strength to 17 and the PML-N to nine, while the PTI forward bloc stands at 20. The PTI, which holds the office of the leader of the opposition, is left with only five lawmakers — one of whom has tendered his resignation, although it hasn’t been accepted yet — while two seats are held by members of other parties. The PPP’s parliamentary party and some key ticket holders, who met in Islamabad on Wednesday with its regional president Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin in the chair, unanimously resolved that the party should quit the government “sooner rather than later” to protect its political goodwill among the masses. Amid suspicions that PM Haq ‘supported’ JKJAAC protest, PML-N, PPP lawmakers seek to pull out of ruling coalition Later, the 17-member parliamentary party held an exclusive meeting that was also attended by a non-legislator, Sardar Tanveer Ilyas. The meeting came in the backdrop of the PML-N’s offer to PPP to form its own government following the possible exit of Mr Haq. “Yes, we have offered them that we will support them in the event of a new election of the leader of the house. But we will not be part of the government and prefer to sit on the opposition benches,” a PML-N leader confided to Dawn. The PPP meeting deliberated on options to pave the way for the prime minister’s exit, either through a no-confidence motion or his voluntary resignation. According to one participant, Mr Ilyas assured the meeting that he would arrange the required tally of 27 to send Mr Haq packing. The issue will be further discussed by the PPP parliamentary party on Friday afternoon at Zardari House in Karachi, where the party’s central leadership is expected to take a final decision. Mr Ilyas has also been invited to attend. A day earlier, the PML-N’s political committee had met in Islamabad, alongside cabinet members Rana Sanaullah and Ahsan Iqbal, where a similar view was expressed — that remaining part of the coalition was politically damaging for the party ahead of the polls. Sources told Dawn that when PM Shehbaz Sharif was briefed about the recent agreement signed in Muzaffarabad between the federal government’s negotiation committee and representatives of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), he was told that PM Haq appeared to have tacitly backed the movement. “It seemed the AJK premier himself was behind the committee’s hard stance; otherwise, it could not have succeeded in getting each and every demand of the protesters implemented,” a well-placed source quoted a member of the negotiating team as telling the premier. This was why the head of the negotiation committee, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, had hinted to media persons that Mr Haq may be re­­p­laced. However, shortly afterwards, Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry sought to play down the claim, saying it was AJK’s internal matter. Meanwhile, Mr Haq is said to be under intense pressure over the removal of eight cabinet members elected from 12 constituencies of Pakistan-based refugees, in accordance with the agreement with the JKJAAC. These ministers belong to all three coalition partners. According to sources, the AJK PM had asked them to step down voluntarily, which was met stiff refusal. Two of them, belonging to the PML-N, even lashed out at the premier through social media posts, accusing him of backing the JKJAAC movement and urging him to resign himself. The AJK prime minister has yet to respond to these allegations. Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2025",

The standoff came following a call by the religious outfit to march on the federal capital, where it planned to stage a protest outside the US embassy in solidarity with Palestinians. In a bid to prevent the group from following through on its plans, authorities cracked do­wn, cordoning off the Mult­an Road headquarters of the TLP with shipping containers and sealing the city’s entry/exit points. Meanwhile, in Islamabad, the administration also placed containers at entry points to keep protesters at bay. More than 100 TLP supporters were also rounded up in the capital. After clashes with Lahore police a night ago, the TLP had called on its supporters to converge on the provincial capital for a ‘final call’ on Friday (today). This worried police, who feared the protest might turn violent and took extraordinary security measures across the province to maintain law and order. As a result, citizens, particularly those living in the densely populated areas from Chauburji to Yateem Khanna Chowk, faced inconvenience. Despite the added security measures, the situation remained tense, especially on Multan Road. The artery remained closed to all kinds of traffic as charged TLP supporters took positions in improvised shelters erected on the road, ready to pounce on police. On Thursday afternoon, the TLP supporters and the police faced off again, resulting in a skirmish. The religious outfit, however, ransacked some businesses and damaged vehicles. There were contradictory reports about casualties, as TLP claimed at least two of its workers were killed. However, police sources acknowledged only one death, saying the body had been handed over to the TLP for burial. The outfit also claimed that 50 of its workers sustained injuries, but police sources put the number at only seven. Over a dozen policemen were also injured in the violence since Wednesday night. A senior police officer told Dawn on anonymity that the Nawan Kot police station was lodging FIR under anti-terrorism and other offences against hundreds of TLP activists and supporters. He said TLP chief Saad Rizvi would also be nominated besides many central leaders of the party. ‘Unrest and anarchy’ Separately, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Thursday accused the TLP of attempting to spread unrest and anarchy in the country under the pretext of a so-called ‘Gaza March’. Speaking to reporters outside Parliament House, Mr Chaudhry said the government had always facilitated peaceful protests under legal procedures and standard operating protocols, but the TLP neither sought permission nor assured compliance with any law. “Was the TLP planning a protest or plotting violence? I will show you the difference,” he remarked. The minister said that several individuals arrested in Punjab and Islamabad were found carrying batons, chemicals, glass marbles, tear gas shells and guns, and face masks, which, he said, indicated violent intent rather than peaceful demonstration. “Does this look like a peaceful protest or an attempt to incite violence?” the state minister questioned, adding that those detained were confirmed to be the TLP office-bearers. He called the TLP a “mercenary-like group” that operates under the garb of religion and said the organisation was deliberately trying to divert national attention from security issues. “It was shameful that you were spreading blatant lies and giving false statements on social media regarding the deaths of your workers. Does our faith allow such things?” the minister added. Kalbe Ali in Islamabad contributed to this report Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2025",
