Since mid-November, heavy rainfall in central Vietnam has triggered widespread floods and landslides, leaving at least 90 people dead so far. The Seoul government plans to swiftly provide assistance to affected areas and residents in need, in consultation with the Vietnamese authorities, the Korean Embassy in Vietnam said, expressing hope that the aid will contribute to a swift recovery and the restoration of daily life. Last year, Korea provided $2 million in support for recovery from Typhoon Yagi, which claimed 323 lives in Vietnam. In October, it also provided $1 million in humanitarian aid for victims of typhoons in northern Vietnam.",

      "summary_orig": "Jailed PTI founder Imran Khan’s son, Kasim Khan, fears that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. The remarks come as the PTI and Imran’s sisters have protested and staged sit-ins outside Adiala jail, where he is imprisoned, after being barred from meeting him for over three weeks. As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked and rumours swirl about possible prison transfers, Kasim told Reuters the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the ex-prime minister, despite a judicial order for weekly meetings. “Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,” he said in written remarks, adding that there had been no independently confirmed communication for a couple of months. “Today we have no verifiable information at all about his condition,” he added. “Our greatest fear is that something irreversible is being hidden from us.” The family has repeatedly sought access for Imran’s personal physician, who has not been allowed to examine him for more than a year, he added. The interior ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the matter. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a jail official told Reuters that Imran was in good health, adding that he was not aware of any plan for a move to a higher-security facility. Imran, 72, has been in jail since August 2023, convicted in a string of cases he says were politically driven following his ouster in a 2022 no-confidence vote. His first conviction was in the Toshakhana case and centred on accusations that he unlawfully sold gifts received in office. Later verdicts added lengthy jail terms, including 10 years in the cipher case and 14 years in the Al Qadir Trust corruption case . The PTI has alleged that the prosecution’s aim in cases against Imran was to exclude him from public life and elections, which were held in 2024. Family anxiety deepened by lack of information Imran’s family says the lack of communication has fuelled fears over what it calls a deliberate effort to push Imran out of public sight. “This isolation is intentional,” Kasim said, referring to the authorities he believes are keeping his father cut off. “They are scared of him. He is Pakistan’s most popular leader, and they know they cannot defeat him democratically.” Kasim and his older brother Suleiman Isa Khan, who live in London with their mother, Jemima Goldsmith, have kept a distance from Pakistan’s politics. The brothers have spoken publicly only sparingly, mainly about their father’s imprisonment . Kasim added that the last time they saw their father was in November 2022, when they visited Pakistan after he survived an assassination attempt . “That image has stayed with me ever since. Seeing our father in that state is something you don’t forget,” Kasim said. “We were told he would recover with time. Now, after weeks of total silence and no proof of life, that memory carries a different weight.” The family was pursuing internal and external avenues, such as appeals to international human rights organisations, and wanted court-ordered access restored immediately, he said. “This is not just a political dispute,” Kasim said. “It is a human rights emergency. Pressure must come from every direction. We draw strength from him, but we need to know he is safe.” Meanwhile, Jemima responded to an interview between Zeteo’s Mehdi Hasan and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, wherein the latter says Imran’s sons can meet their father. “They’re not even allowed to speak to him on the phone. No one is,” she said. HRCP ‘concerned’ over limitations on Imran’s prison meetings The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed concern over the conditions in which the PTI founder is being incarcerated and the repeated denial of meetings with his family or lawyers. “Allegations indicating that he has been unable to meet close relatives, associates or legal counsel warrant urgent clarification, as regular and unhindered access to immediate family and counsel is a fundamental safeguard against isolation and misuse of detention powers,” the body wrote on X. HRCP called on the federal government and Punjab Home Department to ensure that all practices “comply with constitutional due-process protections and international standards for humane treatment”.",

      "summary_orig": "One cop was martyred while five others were injured on Monday in a suicide blast targeting a police mobile in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district. Lakki Marwat District Police Officer’s spokesman Asif Hassan told Dawn that a Tajori police mobile was targeted in a suicide attack. He identified the deceased as Head Constable Alauddin. He further said that the bomber’s accomplice had escaped, adding that a search operation was underway. The injured were identified as Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Haq Nawaz, Constable Yar Muhammad, Elite Force Constable Kamal Ahmad, Elite Force Constable Naeemullah and Duty Foot Constable Nasrullah. Later, a press release issued by Lakki Marwat police shared further details of the incident. It quoted District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan as saying that police had received information about the movement of a “suspicious” motorcyclist by “credible sources”. According to the DPO, the sources said the motorcyclist was travelling from Bittani subdivision toward the Bakhmal Ahmadzai area. The motorcyclists’ “potential target was a public gathering”, the DPO was further quoted as saying. The press release said police of the relevant jurisdiction were then alerted about the development. It added that Tajori police has set up checkpoints at Katta Khel, where they flagged down two suspicious motorcyclists. The motorcyclists, however, tried and were chased by police, the press release detailed. “During the chase, one of the motorcyclists opened fire on police and upon retaliatory action, he blew himself up,” the press release said. Later, it added, DPO Khan reached the site, and a search operation was under way there. “The site has been cordoned off and investigators are collecting evidence.” The press release said DPO Khan paid tribute to the martyred policeman. It quoted the official as saying: “Lakki Marwat police showed exemplary bravery by timely foiling an attack and saving the lives of dozens of innocent citizens.” KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the incident, saying that the sacrifices of police personnel “will not go in vain”. “The provincial government stands with the police,” Afridi said, adding that maintaining law and order was the government’s top priority. “Such cowardly attacks cannot dampen our morale,” he said. Separately, Kashif Nawaz, the spokesperson for the Bannu regional police officer, told Dawn that a police constable was martyred in firing by unidentified attackers at Sarangi Adda. Constable Muhammad Tariq was attacked while going to work from his house, the spokesperson said. Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, the TTP had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Last week, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu.",

      "title_orig": "Information ministry, NCCIA to take action against fake news on ‘massive scale’: Naqvi",
      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Monday that the information ministry, along with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), would be taking action “on a massive scale” against fake news. The minister said this during a press conference in Lahore, where he said he believed that “since the past few days, past few weeks, 90 per cent news on social media is fake”. Saying so, Naqvi also clarified that he believed in the freedom of expression and liberty to criticise. He also highlighted that in case false news was reported by a platform in the mainstream media, a complaint could be registered with the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority. Similarly, he continued, a reporter associated with a news outlet would be answerable to their director news or the bureau chief in such a scenario. “But, on social media one can post any photo, make news as per their wish and post it,” he said, adding that he had spoken to the information minister today morning, and “we will not allow this”. Naqvi added, “If you have evidence, you can report any story. But it cannot be allowed that you say whatever you want on social media, make any allegation against anyone, [declare] any living person dead and [declare] a dead person alive. This cannot happen.” The information ministry, along with the NCCIA, would carry out a “crackdown on this on a massive scale”, he said. “We will not allow you to spread fake news across the country and create panic […] in the garb of journalism.” The interior minister then went on describe “who is a journalist for us”. “Journalists are responsible, those who are part of the national media. They work as part of a system. Every institution has a system of check-and-balance and an editorial board,” he said, adding that individuals working as part of these systems “are journalists for us”. On the other hand, those who spread fake news were “not journalists for us. We are very clear on this”, Naqvi further stated. He went on to say: “Whether you produce vlogs or a podcast, […] run news responsibly.” The minister once again emphasised that journalists and freedom of expression held significance for the government, but the spreading of fake news could not be permitted. Later, when a journalist asked him whether a regulatory body would be established in connection with the new measure announced by Naqvi today, the minister replied: “I think one is already being established.” He also asserted that this measure was “not against journalists”, but only those spreading fake news. In this connection, he gave the hypothetical example of “someone saying that an ABC person has died”. He added that after making such a statement, one would have to take responsibility. Answering another question, he said the action taken by the information ministry and NCCIA “will not be an operation or a crackdown, but simply an action against anyone spreading fake news without any evidence”. Asked about “a political party running a campaign from India” — apparently, a reference to PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters giving interviews to Indian outlets recently — Naqvi said: “I want people to get exposed. Others should know who can go to what extent. The country’s integrity is a boundary that you don’t cross and join the enemy. Let it happen.” In this context, Naqvi was also asked about criticism directed toward Chief of Army Staff Fied Marshal Asim Munir. He replied, “The state is clear […] we will not spare them. The other day someone was saying in London that there was a dispute within the institutions, someone else says something about our journalists. This will have to stop.” Without naming anyone, he added: “Those sitting out there, let me tell you, you are also coming back soon. And if you think you will get protection here, that is not possible. We will soon bring you back, and you will be answerable.” Afghan migrants At the outset of the press conference, Naqvi said the authorities were facing difficulties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with regards to sending Afghan refugees back to Afghanistan. This was not the case in the three other provinces, he added. Afghan migrants, he claimed, were being “protected in KP”. He further alleged that the federal government had de-notified camps of Afghan refugees, but several of them remained operational in KP. Highlighting the involvement of Afghans in terror activities, he mentioned that terrorists who attacked Federal Constabulary headquarters a few days ago — ostensbily a reference to an attack in Peshawar on November 24 — were also Afghans. Naqvi added that station house officers (SHO) in police were now being assigned the task to identify and locate “illegal Afghans” in their respective areas so that they could be sent back to Afghanistan. Instructions had also been issued to inspector generals for the collection of data via SHOs. “Our message to the KP government is also that it is important at this time to prioritise your country over politics,” he said, adding that the KP government would have to ensure the implementation of the federal government’s decision “as we cannot afford any more bomb blasts”. He added, “My message to illegal Afghans is to leave yourself respectfully. Because if you get caught now, we will not just send you back.” Without further elaborating on this statement, Naqvi also warned that if any Afghan returned to Pakistan after being sent to Afghanistan, they would be arrested. Asked whether the Centre was mulling going to the court against KP government over the alleged non-cooperation on the matter of Afghan, Naqvi said multiple options were being worked on. “When it comes to national security, it cannot happen that a province makes it own policy. We will not allow this.” Offloading of passengers On the matter of officials denying boarding to passengers travelling abroad, Naqvi maintained that just 50-70 people were being offloaded daily across the country. “I have asked the FIA (Federal Investigation Agency) to share this data so that people how realise how an agent mafia is running a campaign on social media. Because obviously, they are the ones who will actually face consequences in this matter,” he said. The minister said that there could be some negligence on part of the FIA, but travellers having all necessary documents were not being barred from travelling abroad. He went on to say that action against travellers with insufficient documents was necessary as “we are trying to improve the ranking of our passport”. Speculation about notification Naqvi was also asked about a “notification” and the speculation about it on social media. It seemed to be a reference to the delay in the issuance of the notification for the Chief of Defence Forces’ (CDF) appointment. Observers described the delay in CDF’s notification as “baffling”, noting that it has signalled to the opposition that something may be amiss in civil–military relations. In his response, Naqvi, seemingly referring to the speculation on social media, said: “Let them do it”. He then went on to explain that “a new institution is being established after an amendment in the Constitution. They want things to happen at the press of a button, but things don’t work that way. A system has to be established, and it takes days, hours. It’s not that you press a button and it will become a part of the Constitution”.",

Similarly, he continued, a reporter associated with a news outlet would be answerable to their director news or the bureau chief in such a scenario. “But, on social media one can post any photo, make news as per their wish and post it,” he said, adding that he had spoken to the information minister today morning, and “we will not allow this”. Naqvi added, “If you have evidence, you can report any story. But it cannot be allowed that you say whatever you want on social media, make any allegation against anyone, [declare] any living person dead and [declare] a dead person alive. This cannot happen.” The information ministry, along with the NCCIA, would carry out a “crackdown on this on a massive scale”, he said. “We will not allow you to spread fake news across the country and create panic […] in the garb of journalism.” The interior minister then went on describe “who is a journalist for us”. “Journalists are responsible, those who are part of the national media. They work as part of a system. Every institution has a system of check-and-balance and an editorial board,” he said, adding that individuals working as part of these systems “are journalists for us”. On the other hand, those who spread fake news were “not journalists for us. We are very clear on this”, Naqvi further stated. He went on to say: “Whether you produce vlogs or a podcast, […] run news responsibly.” The minister once again emphasised that journalists and freedom of expression held significance for the government, but the spreading of fake news could not be permitted. Later, when a journalist asked him whether a regulatory body would be established in connection with the new measure announced by Naqvi today, the minister replied: “I think one is already being established.” He also asserted that this measure was “not against journalists”, but only those spreading fake news. In this connection, he gave the hypothetical example of “someone saying that an ABC person has died”. He added that after making such a statement, one would have to take responsibility. Answering another question, he said the action taken by the information ministry and NCCIA “will not be an operation or a crackdown, but simply an action against anyone spreading fake news without any evidence”. Asked about “a political party running a campaign from India” — apparently, a reference to PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters giving interviews to Indian outlets recently — Naqvi said: “I want people to get exposed. Others should know who can go to what extent. The country’s integrity is a boundary that you don’t cross and join the enemy. Let it happen.” In this context, Naqvi was also asked about criticism directed toward Chief of Army Staff Fied Marshal Asim Munir. He replied, “The state is clear […] we will not spare them. The other day someone was saying in London that there was a dispute within the institutions, someone else says something about our journalists. This will have to stop.” Without naming anyone, he added: “Those sitting out there, let me tell you, you are also coming back soon. And if you think you will get protection here, that is not possible. We will soon bring you back, and you will be answerable.” Afghan migrants At the outset of the press conference, Naqvi said the authorities were facing difficulties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with regards to sending Afghan refugees back to Afghanistan. This was not the case in the three other provinces, he added. Afghan migrants, he claimed, were being “protected in KP”. He further alleged that the federal government had de-notified camps of Afghan refugees, but several of them remained operational in KP. Highlighting the involvement of Afghans in terror activities, he mentioned that terrorists who attacked Federal Constabulary headquarters a few days ago — ostensbily a reference to an attack in Peshawar on November 24 — were also Afghans. Naqvi added that station house officers (SHO) in police were now being assigned the task to identify and locate “illegal Afghans” in their respective areas so that they could be sent back to Afghanistan. Instructions had also been issued to inspector generals for the collection of data via SHOs. “Our message to the KP government is also that it is important at this time to prioritise your country over politics,” he said, adding that the KP government would have to ensure the implementation of the federal government’s decision “as we cannot afford any more bomb blasts”. He added, “My message to illegal Afghans is to leave yourself respectfully. Because if you get caught now, we will not just send you back.” Without further elaborating on this statement, Naqvi also warned that if any Afghan returned to Pakistan after being sent to Afghanistan, they would be arrested. Asked whether the Centre was mulling going to the court against KP government over the alleged non-cooperation on the matter of Afghan, Naqvi said multiple options were being worked on. “When it comes to national security, it cannot happen that a province makes it own policy. We will not allow this.” Offloading of passengers On the matter of officials denying boarding to passengers travelling abroad, Naqvi maintained that just 50-70 people were being offloaded daily across the country. “I have asked the FIA (Federal Investigation Agency) to share this data so that people how realise how an agent mafia is running a campaign on social media. Because obviously, they are the ones who will actually face consequences in this matter,” he said. The minister said that there could be some negligence on part of the FIA, but travellers having all necessary documents were not being barred from travelling abroad. He went on to say that action against travellers with insufficient documents was necessary as “we are trying to improve the ranking of our passport”. Speculation about notification Naqvi was also asked about a “notification” and the speculation about it on social media. It seemed to be a reference to the delay in the issuance of the notification for the Chief of Defence Forces’ (CDF) appointment. Observers described the delay in CDF’s notification as “baffling”, noting that it has signalled to the opposition that something may be amiss in civil–military relations. In his response, Naqvi, seemingly referring to the speculation on social media, said: “Let them do it”. He then went on to explain that “a new institution is being established after an amendment in the Constitution. They want things to happen at the press of a button, but things don’t work that way. A system has to be established, and it takes days, hours. It’s not that you press a button and it will become a part of the Constitution”.",

      "summary": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Monday that the information ministry, along with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), would be taking action “on a massive scale” against fake news. The minister said this during a press conference in Lahore, where he said he believed that “since the past few days, past few weeks, 90 per cent news on social media is fake”. Saying so, Naqvi also clarified that he believed in the freedom of expression and liberty to criticise. He also highlighted that in case false news was reported by a platform in the mainstream media, a complaint could be registered with the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority.

      "summary_orig": "The body of a three-year-old boy who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night was recovered on Monday, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported. The development was confirmed by both Rescue 1122 and Edhi, with the latter adding that the body was being taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. Images shared on social media last night had showed a large number of citizens gathered in the area as rescue work was underway. Other videos also showed the child’s distraught mother calling on someone to save her child. Earlier, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the service’s central command received information about the incident at 10pm on Sunday night. He said the boy was with his parents, who were shopping at a private departmental store near Nipa. He said the boy fell into the manhole after the family left the store. He said that Rescue 1122 did not usually initiate search operations at night due to a lack of visibility. But, since a “highly charged” crowd had gathered and the parents were grief-stricken, officials initiated the search operation, he said. However, rescue workers have been unable to trace the boy. The spokesperson said that the search and rescue operation continued into the night for a considerable time. He said that the rescue operation had been halted for now, but officials had excavated five areas with the help of heavy machinery to search for the missing boy. He said that the Rescue 1122 team had asked the authorities concerned to provide the blueprint for the underground drainage system. According to Khan, the team was waiting for information on the entry and exit flow of the underground water so that rescue work could be conducted at the exact location. Karachi mayor cautions against politicising incident Speaking to the media in Karachi, Mayor Murtaza Wahab said he would initiate an inquiry into the incident but cautioned against politicising it. “Unfortunately, when this kind of thing happens, we immediately go toward blame and rhetoric,” he said. “If there is a human tragedy, then is it necessary to bring politics into it?” He said that he would conduct an inquiry as to how long the manhole had been left open in the middle of the city, near a large department store which was visited by thousands daily. “How it was open or was it left open at that time … this will be checked,” he said. “If there was carelessness on the part of the government, I assure you we will take action,” he said. Wahab also said he would ask the union council chairman concerned about whether it had been communicated that the manhole was left open as he questioned the funds provided to the councils. “This is very unfortunate,” he said, talking about the incident. “I will refrain from political rhetoric, but I will say once, and for all that we will have to decide whether we will focus on assigning blame or actually try to find solutions to people’s problems.” ‘How many more will die?’ Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman slammed the Sindh government for “playing with the lives and health of Karachi’s citizens” in the name of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) projects. Speaking to the media in Karachi, he said the construction of the projects had resulted in the destruction of roads. “BRT projects in Karachi should be stopped due to their numerous flaws, which are causing traffic issues and endangering lives,” he said, as he went on to speak about the incident at Nipa. “ Today, a boy fell into a gutter and died [ sic ],” he said, questioning that “how many more will die?”. He held the Karachi Water and Sewage Corporation responsible for the incident and condemned the incident. The JI chief’s accusation apparently stemmed from the digging at University Road between Nipa Chowrangi and The Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology for the Karachi Water and Sewerage System Improvement Project. The city’s roads were also dug for BRT projects, which Rehman said the authorities should abandon, citing concerns over the safety and well-being of citizens. Referring to frequent road accidents and incidents such as people falling into manholes, he questioned, “Who will take responsibility for the 3.5 crore population of Karachi?” He said Karachi was generating 90 per cent tax revenue in the country but still faced problems. “The Sindh government has collected 3,306 billion rupees in  taxes, infrastructure funds, and development charges, but has failed to utilise these funds for the development of Karachi. Instead, they engaged  in corruption,” he alleged. He appealed to the people of Karachi to join the JI in its efforts to hold the government accountable and fight against land grabbers and corruption. Past incidents Deaths from falling into open gutters and manholes frequently occur in Pakistan, particularly in major cities like Karachi, where poorly managed drainage systems, missing or broken covers, and inadequate lighting in congested neighbourhoods often put pedestrians in danger . The gutters are filled with toxic sewage and lack oxygen, making it easy to suffocate or drown within minutes. In September, three sanitation workers died by falling into a manhole while cleaning it in Karachi’s Usmanabad neighbourhood. In May, a six-year-old boy fell into an open manhole in Karachi and drowned, causing a a protest by residents and politicians which prompted the police to register a case. In April, the body of a young girl was recovered from a drain in Liaqatabad after being reported missing.",

Speaking to the media in Karachi, he said the construction of the projects had resulted in the destruction of roads. “BRT projects in Karachi should be stopped due to their numerous flaws, which are causing traffic issues and endangering lives,” he said, as he went on to speak about the incident at Nipa. “ Today, a boy fell into a gutter and died [ sic ],” he said, questioning that “how many more will die?”. He held the Karachi Water and Sewage Corporation responsible for the incident and condemned the incident. The JI chief’s accusation apparently stemmed from the digging at University Road between Nipa Chowrangi and The Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology for the Karachi Water and Sewerage System Improvement Project. The city’s roads were also dug for BRT projects, which Rehman said the authorities should abandon, citing concerns over the safety and well-being of citizens. Referring to frequent road accidents and incidents such as people falling into manholes, he questioned, “Who will take responsibility for the 3.5 crore population of Karachi?” He said Karachi was generating 90 per cent tax revenue in the country but still faced problems. “The Sindh government has collected 3,306 billion rupees in  taxes, infrastructure funds, and development charges, but has failed to utilise these funds for the development of Karachi. Instead, they engaged  in corruption,” he alleged. He appealed to the people of Karachi to join the JI in its efforts to hold the government accountable and fight against land grabbers and corruption. Past incidents Deaths from falling into open gutters and manholes frequently occur in Pakistan, particularly in major cities like Karachi, where poorly managed drainage systems, missing or broken covers, and inadequate lighting in congested neighbourhoods often put pedestrians in danger . The gutters are filled with toxic sewage and lack oxygen, making it easy to suffocate or drown within minutes. In September, three sanitation workers died by falling into a manhole while cleaning it in Karachi’s Usmanabad neighbourhood. In May, a six-year-old boy fell into an open manhole in Karachi and drowned, causing a a protest by residents and politicians which prompted the police to register a case. In April, the body of a young girl was recovered from a drain in Liaqatabad after being reported missing.",

      "summary": "The body of a three-year-old boy who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night was recovered on Monday, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported. The development was confirmed by both Rescue 1122 and Edhi, with the latter adding that the body was being taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. Images shared on social media last night had showed a large number of citizens gathered in the area as rescue work was underway. Other videos also showed the child’s distraught mother calling on someone to save her child. Earlier, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the service’s central command received information about the incident at 10pm on Sunday night. He said the boy was with his parents, who were shopping at a private departmental store near Nipa. He said the boy fell into the manhole after the family left the store. He said that Rescue 1122 did not usually initiate search operations at night due to a lack of visibility. But, since a “highly charged” crowd had gathered and the parents were grief-stricken, officials initiated the search operation, he said. However, rescue workers have been unable to trace the boy. The spokesperson said that the search and rescue operation continued into the night for a considerable time. He said that the rescue operation had been halted for now, but officials had excavated five areas with the help of heavy machinery to search for the missing boy. He said that the Rescue 1122 team had asked the authorities concerned to provide the blueprint for the underground drainage system. According to Khan, the team was waiting for information on the entry and exit flow of the underground water so that rescue work could be conducted at the exact location.

      "summary_orig": "A Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court issued directives on Monday for unfreezing the bank accounts of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust (SKTM) and Namal University in Mianwali. Judge Amjad Hussain Shah issued the instructions in a case pertaining to November 26 protests last year, in which incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, has been facing legal proceedings. SKTM, a charitable organisation established under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 of Pakistan, and Namal University were both set up by Imran. The bank accounts of the two institutions were said to have been inadvertently frozen following the issuance of an arrest warrant against Aleema in the case. During today’s proceedings, Shah heard arguments on Aleema’s application for unfreezing her bank accounts. Representatives of the SKTM also attended the hearing and presented arguments in favour of restoring the bank accounts. For his part, prosecutor Zaheer Shah clarified that the prosecution had never sought, either verbally or in writing, the freezing of SKTM’s or Namal University’s bank accounts. He also pointed out that there was no court order specifically directing relevant authorities to freeze the bank accounts of the two institutions. The prosecutor contended that the confusion over the matter originated from an order sent to the State Bank of Pakistan in which Aleema’s identity card number was referenced. “The state bank conducted a data search based on her CNIC, and during this process, these accounts also came up,” he said, adding that they were subsequently frozen. He further clarified that the prosecution had no objection to the unfreezing of SKTM’s or Namal University’s bank accounts, but also stressed that Aleema’s personal and business accounts, which were frozen under the same order, should remain blocked. Following the completion of the arguments, the judge ordered the unfreezing of the bank accounts of the two institutions and upheld the court’s earlier decision regarding Aleema’s personal bank accounts. Criticism over account closure Earlier, a wave of criticism had erupted over the closure of the bank accounts of SKMT, as many feared that it could affect the supply of medicines and treatment for cancer patients. SKTM operates the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centres in Lahore and Peshawar, with construction underway for a third location in Karachi. The facilities were established with the aim of providing quality cancer care to every patient, regardless of their ability to pay. Thousands of deser­ving patients have been receiving free treatment every day at these hospitals. On the closure of bank accounts, SKMT had assured the public that efforts were under way to have the frozen accounts restored and that the hospital would ensure uninterrupted medicine supply to the 75 per cent patients who were receiving free treatment. Meanwhile, some users on social media linked the matter to Judge Shah’s directives in the case against Aleema and claimed that despite being informed abo­ut patient-related difficulties and Aleema’s appearance in the court, he had not susp­e­­nded his order. Similar claims were made about Namal University’s bank accounts as Aleema was a board member. Nov 26 protest case The case pertains to allegations brought under various sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) in connection with protests and unrest linked to last year’s November 26 protest. The protest saw more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”. Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the ATA. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations. Aleema, along with 10 others, was booked in the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station.",

      "summary_orig": "Pak-EPA enforcement team inspects a vehicle for smoke emission under the ongoing vehicular emission testing drive in Islamabad on Sunday. — White Star ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Environment Protection Agency on Sunday warned owners of smoke-emitting vehicles of stringent action across the federal capital. It said any vehicle found releasing excessive emissions will face strict punitive measures. In a statement, Pak-EPA Director General Nazia Zaib Ali said the agency had intensified its enforcement operations as part of ongoing efforts to curb vehicular pollution, which she described as a major contributor to deteriorating air quality and recurring smog episodes in Islamabad. She said enforcement teams were carrying out regular inspections on major roads, intersections and high-traffic corridors to identify vehicles emitting excessive smoke. Violators would face on-the-spot fines, confiscation of vehicles, or both, depending on the severity of the offence, she added. Ms Nazia reminded the public that driving a vehicle emitting smoke beyond permissible limits, particularly the thick black smoke from poorly maintained engines, constituted an environmental crime under federal environmental laws. “Let me be very clear, smoke-emitting vehicles will not be allowed to operate in Islamabad under any circumstances,” she warned. “This is not just a regulatory matter. It is a public health emergency. Vehicular smoke is poisoning the air our children breathe. We will take every lawful measure, including heavy fines and confiscation, to stop this environmental crime.” She said the agency’s heightened vigilance stemmed from growing alarm over the increasing number of vehicles, particularly diesel buses, trucks, wagons, Qingqi rickshaws and motorcycles that continue to ply roads without proper maintenance, releasing hazardous emissions that harm both the environment and human health. Pak-EPA said vehicular emissions remained a major source of outdoor air pollution and heat-trapping carbon emissions in urban centres. The smoke released from vehicles contained harmful pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and un-burnt hydrocarbons, all of which degraded air quality and contribute to smog formation. Particulate matter, especially PM2.5, penetrated deep into the lungs and could enter the bloodstream. Long-term exposure increased the risk of chronic respiratory diseases, heart conditions, stroke and premature death. The World Health Organisation has repeatedly stated that air pollution is among the top global environmental health risks, causing millions of premature deaths each year. The statement said Islamabad’s winter months typically brought stagnant air and temperature inversions that trapped pollutants close to the ground, intensifying smog episodes. Vehicular smoke, when combined with dust and industrial pollutants, formed thick layers of toxic air that reduced visibility and trigger respiratory illnesses. Local health experts said smoke from polluting vehicles was a key cause of respiratory distress, chronic cough, asthma attacks, allergies and eye irritation. Children, the elderly and individuals with cardiac or pulmonary diseases face heightened risks. Prolonged exposure could impair lung development in children, while medical specialists warned of increased risks of heart attacks and worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Public health data also linked vehicular pollution with higher rates of bronchitis, pneumonia and certain cancers. Ms Nazia stressed that addressing air pollution could not be left solely to enforcement teams. It called on citizens to act responsibly by cooperating during inspections, maintaining smoke-free vehicles, reporting polluting vehicles and encouraging adherence to environmental laws. “Cleaner air is a shared national responsibility. If citizens cooperate with us, we can significantly reduce pollution levels and protect the health of millions,” she added. Published in Dawn, December 1st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "FACING a two-front situation on the borders has long been Pakistan’s nightmare scenario. That is why its security and foreign policy has, over the decades, been predicated on avoiding having to deal simultaneously with external threats on two borders. This policy was shaped by the exigencies of the country’s formative years when it was confronted with a hostile India and contested borders on both its western and eastern flanks bequeathed by colonialism. An early conflict with India and continuing tensions over Kashmir was accompanied by irredentist claims of successive Afghan governments, who questioned the border with Pakistan, demarcated as the Durand Line by the British. The tyranny of geography imposed heavy burdens on Pakistan. But the lesson learnt from the country’s early years was the strategic imperative of keeping one front defused as active military engagement on both borders was regarded as unsustainable. This was not something Pakistan could always control, but its security strategy aimed at averting a double squeeze from two hot borders. This is exemplified by Pakistan’s efforts to prevent any flare-up of tensions with India in the 1980s during its long involvement in the US-led military campaign against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. It is also illustrated by the post-9/11 decade when Pakistan became a front-line state in the US ‘war on terror’ and cooperated in the US/ Nato effort to defeat the Taliban and terrorist groups based in Afghanistan. India’s military mobilisation along the border after a terror attack on the Indian parliament in 2002 compelled Pakistan to deal with two hot fronts for some time. But US mediation helped to end the Pakistan-India military stand-off. What followed was perhaps the longest period of uninterrupted diplomatic engagement between the two countries in a ‘composite dialogue’. In fact, one of president Pervez Musharraf’s ‘asks’ of the Americans then was for Washington to ‘watch’ Pakistan’s ‘back’ while Pakistani forces were engaged on the Afghan border. The US administration obliged. Today however, Pakistan faces a three-front security challenge. On the eastern front an implacable foe continues to issue threats and insist its ‘Operation Sindoor’ — the name of its military action against Pakistan in May — is not over. On the western frontier, Pakistan and Afghanistan remain engaged in hostilities . Pakistan also alleges active collusion between Kabul and New Delhi in terrorist attacks on the country. The third front is at home, reflected in the surge in militant attacks that is undermining domestic peace and stability. This is unprecedented as never before has the country had to deal simultaneously with three fronts. The only bright spot is improved ties between Pakistan and Iran that has helped to address border management problems. This is an encouraging development considering the two neighbours engaged in tit-for-tat missile strikes in January 2024 over activities of militant Baloch groups on both sides of the border. Relations with Afghanistan have hit a record low because of the Taliban’s unwillingness to act against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), that continues cross-border terror attacks from its Afghan sanctuaries and poses a grave threat to Pakistan’s security. With several rounds of talks yielding little, an increasingly frustrated Islamabad was forced to adopt a coercive policy towards Kabul, especially as Pakistani casualties mounted in terror attacks. Pakistan faces two hot borders and an internal security challenge. In October, deadly clashes erupted on the border. Pakistan launched air strikes against militant targets in Afghanistan including Kabul while Afghan forces attacked multiple border posts in response. Pakistan retaliated with fierce cross-border strikes. A ceasefire was reached through mediation by Qatar and Turkiye. But subsequent talks ended in deadlock as the Taliban declined to give a written commitment to stop TTP attacks. The border remains closed and trade suspended . Islamabad seems to have concluded that with diplomatic efforts exhausted the only option is kinetic as sustained military pressure might have a deterrent effect on the Taliban’s permissive attitude and support for TTP. This is designed to inflict pain on Kabul. But it also entails costs for Pakistan not only in terms of lost trade (annual Pakistani exports are just over $1 billion), but also in overstretching its resources. Pakistani officials acknowledge this but argue they are left with little choice. Nevertheless, prolonged tensions will mean Pakistan’s attention and military resources will have to increasingly be directed or diverted to its western border from the east, despite the latter front being unstable. In the face of continuing Indian belligerence and intimidatory military exercises near its border Pakistan cannot afford to lower its guard. With the Indian leadership apparently wanting to avenge its setback in the May conflict with Pakistan, Islamabad cannot leave anything to chance. True, India took no knee-jerk action after the recent Delhi bomb blast . But recently when its defence minister provocatively suggested that borders can change and Sindh could one day ‘return to India’, Islamabad condemned this as “a threat to regional stability”. Given New Delhi’s hostility and absent any communication between the two countries, a high degree of unpredictability and risk of miscalculation characterises the situation. Pakistan thus has to keep a watchful eye on the western front and remain in a state of military preparedness. The existential threat after all can come from India, not Afghanistan. While Pakistan may be unable to do much in the near term to defuse either of the two external fronts (ideally the Afghan front should be over time) the home front is what it can and should control. Two provinces are afflicted by insurgency while terrorists are also striking across the country. Despite notable counterterrorism gains, the internal security situation remains troubling with rising fatalities from terrorism likely to make 2025 the deadliest year in a decade. Pakistan needs a more effective counterterrorism strategy. Strengthened border controls must involve zero tolerance for corruption and criminality that allow militant movement. The government should also evolve a differentiated approach to deal with militant violence in Balochistan and KP. In Balochistan, the underlying sources of long-standing public disaffection need to be addressed. Law enforcement should be accompanied by political and economic measures to win hearts and minds. Effective counter-insurgency operations in KP require rising above partisan politics for better coordination with the opposition-controlled province to secure community support. Defeating militant violence ‘within’ is a strategic compulsion as a continuing three-front situation is obviously untenable. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.

      "summary_en": "FACING a two-front situation on the borders has long been Pakistan’s nightmare scenario. That is why its security and foreign policy has, over the decades, been predicated on avoiding having to deal simultaneously with external threats on two borders. This policy was shaped by the exigencies of the country’s formative years when it was confronted with a hostile India and contested borders on both its western and eastern flanks bequeathed by colonialism. An early conflict with India and continuing tensions over Kashmir was accompanied by irredentist claims of successive Afghan governments, who questioned the border with Pakistan, demarcated as the Durand Line by the British. The tyranny of geography imposed heavy burdens on Pakistan. But the lesson learnt from the country’s early years was the strategic imperative of keeping one front defused as active military engagement on both borders was regarded as unsustainable. This was not something Pakistan could always control, but its security strategy aimed at averting a double squeeze from two hot borders. This is exemplified by Pakistan’s efforts to prevent any flare-up of tensions with India in the 1980s during its long involvement in the US-led military campaign against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. It is also illustrated by the post-9/11 decade when Pakistan became a front-line state in the US ‘war on terror’ and cooperated in the US/ Nato effort to defeat the Taliban and terrorist groups based in Afghanistan. India’s military mobilisation along the border after a terror attack on the Indian parliament in 2002 compelled Pakistan to deal with two hot fronts for some time. But US mediation helped to end the Pakistan-India military stand-off. What followed was perhaps the longest period of uninterrupted diplomatic engagement between the two countries in a ‘composite dialogue’. In fact, one of president Pervez Musharraf’s ‘asks’ of the Americans then was for Washington to ‘watch’ Pakistan’s ‘back’ while Pakistani forces were engaged on the Afghan border. The US administration obliged. Today however, Pakistan faces a three-front security challenge. On the eastern front an implacable foe continues to issue threats and insist its ‘Operation Sindoor’ — the name of its military action against Pakistan in May — is not over. On the western frontier, Pakistan and Afghanistan remain engaged in hostilities . Pakistan also alleges active collusion between Kabul and New Delhi in terrorist attacks on the country. The third front is at home, reflected in the surge in militant attacks that is undermining domestic peace and stability. This is unprecedented as never before has the country had to deal simultaneously with three fronts. The only bright spot is improved ties between Pakistan and Iran that has helped to address border management problems. This is an encouraging development considering the two neighbours engaged in tit-for-tat missile strikes in January 2024 over activities of militant Baloch groups on both sides of the border. Relations with Afghanistan have hit a record low because of the Taliban’s unwillingness to act against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), that continues cross-border terror attacks from its Afghan sanctuaries and poses a grave threat to Pakistan’s security. With several rounds of talks yielding little, an increasingly frustrated Islamabad was forced to adopt a coercive policy towards Kabul, especially as Pakistani casualties mounted in terror attacks. Pakistan faces two hot borders and an internal security challenge. In October, deadly clashes erupted on the border. Pakistan launched air strikes against militant targets in Afghanistan including Kabul while Afghan forces attacked multiple border posts in response. Pakistan retaliated with fierce cross-border strikes. A ceasefire was reached through mediation by Qatar and Turkiye. But subsequent talks ended in deadlock as the Taliban declined to give a written commitment to stop TTP attacks. The border remains closed and trade suspended . Islamabad seems to have concluded that with diplomatic efforts exhausted the only option is kinetic as sustained military pressure might have a deterrent effect on the Taliban’s permissive attitude and support for TTP. This is designed to inflict pain on Kabul. But it also entails costs for Pakistan not only in terms of lost trade (annual Pakistani exports are just over $1 billion), but also in overstretching its resources. Pakistani officials acknowledge this but argue they are left with little choice. Nevertheless, prolonged tensions will mean Pakistan’s attention and military resources will have to increasingly be directed or diverted to its western border from the east, despite the latter front being unstable. In the face of continuing Indian belligerence and intimidatory military exercises near its border Pakistan cannot afford to lower its guard. With the Indian leadership apparently wanting to avenge its setback in the May conflict with Pakistan, Islamabad cannot leave anything to chance. True, India took no knee-jerk action after the recent Delhi bomb blast . But recently when its defence minister provocatively suggested that borders can change and Sindh could one day ‘return to India’, Islamabad condemned this as “a threat to regional stability”. Given New Delhi’s hostility and absent any communication between the two countries, a high degree of unpredictability and risk of miscalculation characterises the situation. Pakistan thus has to keep a watchful eye on the western front and remain in a state of military preparedness. The existential threat after all can come from India, not Afghanistan. While Pakistan may be unable to do much in the near term to defuse either of the two external fronts (ideally the Afghan front should be over time) the home front is what it can and should control. Two provinces are afflicted by insurgency while terrorists are also striking across the country. Despite notable counterterrorism gains, the internal security situation remains troubling with rising fatalities from terrorism likely to make 2025 the deadliest year in a decade. Pakistan needs a more effective counterterrorism strategy. Strengthened border controls must involve zero tolerance for corruption and criminality that allow militant movement. The government should also evolve a differentiated approach to deal with militant violence in Balochistan and KP. In Balochistan, the underlying sources of long-standing public disaffection need to be addressed. Law enforcement should be accompanied by political and economic measures to win hearts and minds. Effective counter-insurgency operations in KP require rising above partisan politics for better coordination with the opposition-controlled province to secure community support. Defeating militant violence ‘within’ is a strategic compulsion as a continuing three-front situation is obviously untenable. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.

He maintained that efforts were being made to corner the PTI, but his party would continue to hold peaceful protests. “Persistent efforts have been made to isolate the PTI, and peaceful protesters were even shot at,” the chief minister said. ‘Imran in isolation’ He continued that PTI founder Imran Khan was being kept in isolation and solitary confinement, and that all his visitors, including the chief minister himself and Mr Khan’s sisters, were being denied meetings with the incarcerated former prime minister. Mr Afirdi said that after some unfortunate news was reported by international media, he went to Adiala jail to inquire about Mr Khan’s health, but even after spe­nding an entire night outside the facility, he was refused a meeting. He added that they then went to the Islamabad High Court (IHC), but the judges also declined to meet them. Weekly protests The chief minister said the PTI had decided all its parliamentarians would hold peaceful protests outside the IHC every Tuesday, and accompany Mr Khan’s sisters to Adiala jail. He added that the KP government would follow the directions issued by the PTI leadership. “All the parliamentarians, including National and provincial assembly members as well as senators, will protest outside the IHC over delayed case hearings. They will all proceed to Adiala, accompanying Khan sahib’s sisters,” Mr Afridi told reporters. He said he decided to hold a sit-in outside Adiala jail because his party was being mistreated. The KP CM stated that while some chief ministers were offered official jets by the Pakistan Air Force and facilitated during travel, he was placed on the Passport Control List. Responding to questions, the chief minister said no part of KP was under the control of militants. However, without naming anyone, he added that the entire country was being controlled by a single individual. He said the Centre should consider the provincial government’s suggestions for maintaining lasting peace in KP, adding that decisions taken behind closed doors had harmed the province. “If the federal government implements what the provincial government has been suggesting, it will be our responsibility to carry out those decisions and maintain law and order,” he said. He added that the KP government wanted all stakeholders to be taken on board for any decision regarding peace in the province. NFC share Mr Afridi said the provincial government would participate in the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting scheduled for Dec 4 and would fight for the province’s rights. He added that the tribal areas were merged administratively with KP in 2018 but had yet to be merged financially. He maintained that the NFC share for the merged districts had not been paid to KP since 2018, describing it as a “constitutional violation”. The chief minister also announced that from Monday (today), awareness sessions would be held for students in universities so they could understand how the federal government had treated the KP government. Responding to another question, the chief minister said that while he personally did not own any property in Tirah, his family did. He added that the recent documentary against him was an attempt to divert public attention, but people did not believe those who produced it. “People know everything. They know who is lying, and we want them to do their job… only then will the country move forward,” the chief minister said. ‘Good governance’ Separately, Special Assistant to the KP CM Shafiullah Jan issued a statement expressing similar concerns about the PTI founder’s health. He criticised the PML-N leadership, saying the party had “forgotten its own past”, recalling how its workers met their “convicted leader” in London and sought guidance from him during his stay abroad. “Today, they are fearful of Imran Khan’s statements and even his photographs,” he said, adding that the PTI founder remained the most popular political leader in the country and that attempts were being made to “block his voice”. Mr Jan said that the KP chief minister had declared emergencies in the education and health sectors and had decided that the provincial cabinet would meet every Friday. “Good governance is among the top priorities of Chief Minister Sohail Afridi,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "AFGHAN refugees return to Afghanistan after deportation.—Dawn/file ISLAMABAD: Afghan refugees, awaiting resettlement in the US, have urged the Trump administration to resume the programme, saying that they were living in Pakistan under extreme hardship and constant fear of deportation. The statement from the Afghan P1/P2 case holders came days after the US administration abruptly halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghan nationals indefinitely after the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House. “We, the Afghan allies and partners of the United States with completed P1/P2 cases, express our deep concern and urgent plea for assistance. Our cases were fully processed, and we were awaiting our flight dates when, on January 20, 2025, the programme was suspended without explanation,” the statement shared with the media said. “For more than three years, we have been living in Pakistan under extreme hardship and constant fear,” it said, while also condemning the Washington attack. “This was the act of a single individual, and it must never be used to collectively punish thousands of loyal Afghan allies who served the United States honourably and at great personal risk. Individual crime is not a reflection of an entire group, and we respectfully ask that this principle of justice be upheld,” the statement added. As Pakistan and Afghanistan’s relationship deteriorates due to the terrorist outfits operating from the Afghan soil, Islamabad has stepped up the deportation of Afghan refugees, including those who have valid documents. The statement also reflected this concern, saying the authorities continued to arrest and deport Afghan nationals, including “documented US allies”. “Even official letters from the US Embassy carry no protection, and many with valid documents are still detained and deported. If we are forced back to Afghanistan, we will be immediately identified and killed by the Taliban for our service to the United States,” the statement said, adding that thousands of cases that had already been processed were now in a state of uncertainty. “We urgently request that the United States uphold its commitments, protect its allies, and resume the evacuation process before more innocent lives are lost,” it added. “We are not criminals. We are the allies who stood with America. Now, we ask America to stand with us,” said the statement issued on behalf of the P1/P2 case holders in Pakistan. In a recent statement posted on its website, the UN refugee agency had also urged Pakistan to ensure that Afghans with specific protection needs are exempted from the provisions of the ‘Illegal Foreigner Repatriation Plan’ and allowed to remain safely in the country. The UNHCR confirmed that more than one million Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan in 2025. “In the right circumstances, this would be something to celebrate,” said Philippa Candler, UNHCR representative in Pakistan. “But under the current conditions, it raises more concerns than solutions.” Published in Dawn, December 1st, 2025",
