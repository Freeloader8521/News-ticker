      "summary_orig": "At first glance, Korea’s Incheon International Airport appears every bit the image of global glamour. Trains to the airport, which serves more than 70 million passengers a year, are filled with travelers — and with flight attendants commuting to work in full uniform. Even in freezing weather, they can be seen wearing thin jackets and low shoes that leave their ankles exposed. The sight has become a familiar part of the airport’s daily rhythm. Behind the scenes, however, lies a less visible reality. Many of these flight attendants are not choosing to commute in uniform, but are forced to — because their employers do not provide facilities like changing rooms. According to an aviation industry worker, the reason flight attendants report to work in thin uniforms that are not warm enough for the cold weather is simple: Airlines do not provide adequate changing rooms or lockers.

      "title_orig": "The world according to Trump",
      "summary_orig": "AMERICAN President Donald Trump now seeks to create a new international organisation to rival the United Nations. His idea of the ‘ Board of Peace ’ goes beyond its original UN mandate of overseeing the rehabilitation of Gaza, which has been devastated by two years of Israel’s genocidal war. Reportedly, so far nearly 60 countries have been invited to join the ‘board’ chaired by the American president. It is supposed to operate as a “more nimble and effective international peacebuilding body”. It will cost $1 billion for nations to buy a permanent seat on the so-called board. Many heads of government and state representing potential member countries have been invited to join. The full list of the invitees is still not known. Interestingly, there is no mention of Gaza in the Board of Peace charter. Last year, a UN Security Council resolution had authorised the formation of the board to oversee the post-war administrative transition of the enclave. Trump has separately named an 11-member executive board for Gaza as part of the 20-point peace plan for the enclave. But the charter reportedly sent out by the Trump administration to potential members projects the Board of Peace as an international conflict resolution body along the lines of the UN. One wonders under what mandate this international body is being set up. It is the brainchild of the American president who seems to consider himself as the sole arbiter of the global order. According to international media, the charter gives wide-ranging powers to Trump as the board’s chair, allowing him to appoint and remove member states — a decision that could only be overturned by a two-thirds majority of members. It also provides him with the “exclusive authority to create, modify, or dissolve subsidiary entities as necessary or appropriate to fulfil the Board of Peace’s mission”. The so-called Board of Peace is meant to be used to advance US hegemony. Trump has been a fierce critic of the UN and under his presidency America has pulled out of several of its agencies. His Board of Peace is also meant to undermine the global body. He aspires to create a new world order dictated by American military might. Interestingly, the charter says the objective of the board is “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”. It is ironic that this talk of lawful governance comes from an administration that recently kidnapped the president of a sovereign state (Venezuela) and his wife in a military operation that trampled over all international laws. Trump has dismissed international law, saying only his “own morality” can curb the aggressive policies he is pursuing across the world. Trump has also threatened to use military force against other South American countries and has bombed Iran last year. It aided Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza that has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians and destroyed the entire enclave. The same administration, whose imperialistic designs have been fully exposed, claims to uphold the idea of a rules-based world order. Describing the need for setting up a new international organisation, the charter maintains: “Durable peace requires pragmatic judgement, common sense solutions, and the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”. It doesn’t, of course, talk about the fact that America’s own disdain for the rule of law has been the main reason for the failure of the UN and other international institutions. This board cannot provide global peace and stability. It is meant to be used to advance America’s hegemony. Curiously, the idea of this American-led multinational organisation has been floated as the Trump administration prepares to take over Greenland, which has brought Washington into conflict with its European Nato allies. He has imposed an initial 10 per cent tariff on European countries opposing his plan to seize the Danish-controlled autonomous island. In a recent message to Norway’s prime minister, Trump reportedly said that one reason why he is pushing to acquire Greenland is that he didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize. “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace…” was Trump’s message. Trump’s anger over not getting the Nobel Peace Prize seems to be driving him to take the world down. He no longer distinguishes between rivals and allies. Nothing could be more dangerous for world peace than such a megalomaniac at the helm of the world’s biggest power. His plan to create and chair an international organisation as a rival to the UN will be the final nail in the coffin of an already collapsing global order. Strangely, neither the Board of Peace nor the Gaza Executive Board under it has Palestinian representation. Instead, the executive board is stuffed with American officials whose pro-Zionist bias is well known. Besides Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and America’s Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff are also included in the executive board. There are also officials from Qatar and Egypt and an Israeli businessman, according to media reports. One of the most controversial founding members of the Gaza board is Tony Blair , the former British prime minister, who is accused of war crimes for his decision to join the American war in Iraq. As a part of the peace plan, an International Stabilisation Force will be raised to lead security operations, support comprehensive demilitarisation and enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid. Pakistan and some other Muslim countries have been approached to join the force that will be led by an American military officer. Given its dubious mandate, there is a real danger that the ISF will find itself fighting the Palestinian resistance group. Pakistan needs to think through any decision to join the ISF.

      "summary_en": "AMERICAN President Donald Trump now seeks to create a new international organisation to rival the United Nations. His idea of the ‘ Board of Peace ’ goes beyond its original UN mandate of overseeing the rehabilitation of Gaza, which has been devastated by two years of Israel’s genocidal war. Reportedly, so far nearly 60 countries have been invited to join the ‘board’ chaired by the American president. It is supposed to operate as a “more nimble and effective international peacebuilding body”. It will cost $1 billion for nations to buy a permanent seat on the so-called board. Many heads of government and state representing potential member countries have been invited to join. The full list of the invitees is still not known. Interestingly, there is no mention of Gaza in the Board of Peace charter. Last year, a UN Security Council resolution had authorised the formation of the board to oversee the post-war administrative transition of the enclave. Trump has separately named an 11-member executive board for Gaza as part of the 20-point peace plan for the enclave. But the charter reportedly sent out by the Trump administration to potential members projects the Board of Peace as an international conflict resolution body along the lines of the UN. One wonders under what mandate this international body is being set up. It is the brainchild of the American president who seems to consider himself as the sole arbiter of the global order. According to international media, the charter gives wide-ranging powers to Trump as the board’s chair, allowing him to appoint and remove member states — a decision that could only be overturned by a two-thirds majority of members. It also provides him with the “exclusive authority to create, modify, or dissolve subsidiary entities as necessary or appropriate to fulfil the Board of Peace’s mission”. The so-called Board of Peace is meant to be used to advance US hegemony. Trump has been a fierce critic of the UN and under his presidency America has pulled out of several of its agencies. His Board of Peace is also meant to undermine the global body. He aspires to create a new world order dictated by American military might. Interestingly, the charter says the objective of the board is “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”. It is ironic that this talk of lawful governance comes from an administration that recently kidnapped the president of a sovereign state (Venezuela) and his wife in a military operation that trampled over all international laws. Trump has dismissed international law, saying only his “own morality” can curb the aggressive policies he is pursuing across the world. Trump has also threatened to use military force against other South American countries and has bombed Iran last year. It aided Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza that has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians and destroyed the entire enclave. The same administration, whose imperialistic designs have been fully exposed, claims to uphold the idea of a rules-based world order. Describing the need for setting up a new international organisation, the charter maintains: “Durable peace requires pragmatic judgement, common sense solutions, and the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”.

      "summary_orig": "• PTI claims several held, injured after police scuttle rally in Pindi • Aleema seeks brother’s release; Uzma confident Feb 8 protest will ‘shut down’ entire country ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Tuesday moved the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission to meet incarcerated leader Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in Adiala jail, as well as an order by the court to end their unlawful solitary confinement. On the other hand, the Punjab police used force to disperse a PTI protest in Rawalpindi after the former ruling party wrapped up its sit-in outside the prison and decided to stage a rally in the garrison city. The PTI, in a statement posted on X after midnight, said the police crackdown resulted in several arrests and injuries. A group of about 17 senators, including Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, approached the high court under Article 199 of the Constitution, making the Punjab Home Department and the Adiala jail superintendent respondents. The petition challenged the alleged unlawful and unconstitutional use of solitary confinement and other inhumane practices against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi in jail. According to the petition, the continued solitary confinement amounts to torture and violates fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Barrister Zafar said the senators approa­ched the court in discharge of their constitutional duty of parliamentary oversight and to safeguard human dignity and the rule of law. The petition maintained Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi had been kept in prolonged isolation for the last two months without any judicial order or statutory justification under the Pakistan Penal Code or the Prisons Act. It alleged denial of basic prisoner entitlements, including access to books, news­­papers, TV, family visits, and confidential meetings with counsel, as well as the arbitrary refusal to allow lawmakers to meet them. The senators contended that these measures were punitive, politically motivated, and part of a broader pattern of coercive treatment of political detainees, undermining constitutional democracy and parliamentary oversight. Separately, PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also arrived at the IHC to seek the fixing of cases related to Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi. According to sources, the PTI leadership requested a meeting with the IHC chief justice, but the meeting could not take place. Speaking to the media, Barrister Gohar said he had gone to the chief justice’s chamber to request early fixation of the cases but was unable to meet him. He added that another attempt would be made later. Barrister Gohar said the PTI had approa­ched the IHC about 15 times but could not secure a hearing date, stressing that a woman’s appeal should be heard expeditiously. Crackdown on PTI rally The PTI supporters and family members of Imran Khan staged a sit-in outside the prison for a few hours after they were barred from meeting the former prime minister in the morning. In the late evening, they decided to stage a rally in the garrison city, prompting the police to disperse the crowd. A video posted by the PTI on X showed several cars leaving the jail area, with party workers and supporters moving on foot. “Even today, Chairman Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were not granted a meeting with the family. Khan sahib’s sisters and party workers have set off for a protest rally in Islamabad,” the post’s caption read. However, the rally was scuttled by the police, with videos of the crackdown posted on X by the PTI. These videos could not be independently verified. The PTI claimed that its workers were also injured in the action, and several, including minors, were allegedly rounded up. It also alleged that the police roughed up the sisters of Mr Khan and other party leaders. Visit to Adiala In the morning on their way to the prison, the PTI leaders were stopped at ‘DHA Naka’ instead of ‘Factory Chowk’, but were allo­wed to move a little further after some time. Imran’s sister Uzma Khanam said that it has been decided that wherever the police stop them, they will hold ‘Quran Khwani’ there. She said that on February 8, the entire country “will be jammed” to protest the alleged rigging in the 2024 elections. She urged the party supporters to fly kites with the name of Imran Khan on Basant so that “his name and picture would be on land and in the skies”. Replying to a question, Aleema Khan said they wanted the release of Imran Khan instead of just meetings. PTI leader Shafiul­lah Jan said that in the past, the authorities used to stop PTI workers three kilometres from the jail, but on Tuesday, they were stopped eight kilometres from the jail.

      "summary_orig": "KABUL: China has demanded that the Taliban government in Afghanistan take effective measures to protect Chinese nationals after seven people were killed in a blast in Kabul on Monday. Six Afghans and one Chinese national were killed, and several others were injured in the blast at a Chinese restaurant in a heavily-guarded part of the city centre. Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s foreign minister, told a press briefing on Tuesday that China has requested the Afghanistan government to spare no effort in treating the injured. On Monday, videos shared on social media showed smoke billowing from a large hole torn in the facade of the restaurant building, while debris littered the street outside. Demand comes after militant group Islamic State claimed the Kabul blast “We have received 20 people at our hospital,” Dejan Panic, the Afghanistan director of humanitarian group EMERGENCY, said in a statement, adding that seven were dead on arrival. “Among the wounded are four women and a child.” The Taliban took control of war-torn Afghanistan in 2021 and said it would restore security, but bomb attacks have continued, many of them claimed by the local arm of the Islamic State group. Militant group Islamic State claimed the Monday’s blast that tore through a Chinese-run restaurant in the commercial Shahr-e-Naw area, police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said. The Afghan branch of Islamic State militant group said in a statement it was carried out by a suicide bomber. The restaurant serving the Chinese Muslim community was jointly run by a Chinese Muslim man, Abdul Majid, his wife, and an Afghan partner, Abdul Jabbar Mahmood, Zadran said. “The nature of the explosion is unkn­own so far and is being investigated,” he said. The Amaq news agency said the domestic arm of Islamic State had put Chinese citizens on its list of targets, citing “growing crimes by the Chinese government against Uyghurs”. Rights groups accuse Beijing of widespread abuses of Uyghurs, a mainly Mus­­lim ethnic minority group numbering about 10 million. Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• UNRWA slams ‘unprecedented attack’; Israeli foreign ministry claims ‘ownership’ • Palestinian football club in occupied West Bank faces imminent demolition JERUSALEM: Israeli bulldozers began demolitions at the headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in east Jerusalem on Tuesday, in what the organisation called an “unprecedented attack” and a “serious violation of international law”. UNRWA spokesman Jonathan Fowler said that Israeli forces “stormed into” the compound shortly after 7am and ejected security guards from the site, before bulldozers entered and began demolishing buildings. “This is an unprecedented attack against UNRWA and its premises. And it also constitutes a serious violation of international law and the privileges and immunities of the United Nations,” Fowler said. “What happens today to UNRWA can happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission around the world,” he warned. The demolition of the UNWRA headquarters comes at a time when a Palestinian children’s football club in the occupied West Bank faces imminent demolition after being threatened by Israel, despite an international campaign to save it, according to a BBC report. Roland Friedrich, the agency’s director in the occupied West Bank called the move political, saying “it seems the intent is to seize the land for settlement construction as has openly been stated by Israeli officials for many years in the media and elsewhere”. AFP photos showed heavy machinery demolishing structures at the UNWRA compound, where now an Israeli flag fluttered overhead. An AFP photographer reported that far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir had made a brief visit to the site. “For years, these supporters of terrorism were here, and today they are being removed from here along with everything they built in this place. This is what will happen to every supporter of terrorism,” the Israeli minister said. A series of investigations, including one led by France’s former foreign minister Cath­e­rine Colonna, found some ‘neutrality-related issues’ at UNRWA but stressed Israel had not provided conclusive evidence for its headline allegation. ‘Ownership’ In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry defended the de­­molitions and said Israel “owns the Jerusalem compound”. The compound in Israeli-occupied territory has been empty of UNRWA staff since January 2025, when Israel “ banned ” its operations in the Gaza Strip. “UNRWA-Hamas had alrea­­dy ceased its operations at this site and no longer had any UN personnel or UN activity there,” the foreign ministry asserted. “The compound does not enjoy any immunity and the seizure of this compound by Israeli authorities was carried out in accordance with both Israeli and international law,” it insisted. UNRWA’s Friedrich said the UN rejected the Israeli claim, explaining that the compound “remains United Nations property and is protected by the privileges and immunities of the UN, regardless of whether it is currently in use”. Though the UNRWA ban applies in east Jerusalem due to its occupation by Israel, the agency still operates in Gaza. Attempt to erase identity UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini denounced the demolitions on X, saying it was yet another attempt by “Israeli authorities to erase the Palestine Refugee identity”. Meanwhile, a Palestinian children’s football club in the occupied West Bank faces im­­minent demolition despite an international campaign to save it, according to a BBC report. Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players, particularly those living in the nearby Aida refugee camp, while Israel declared it illegal. On Nov 3, 2025 the children found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field. It was followed soon by a demolition order. Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Shares leaked texts & AI mock-ups • EU sees opportunity to build ‘new independent Europe’ • Bessent urges leaders to calm down DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was ‘no going back’ on his goal to control Greenland, refusing to rule out taking the Arctic island by force and rounding on allies as European leaders struggled to respond. Trump’s ambition — spelled out in social media posts and mock-up AI images — to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow Nato member Denmark has threatened to blow apart the alliance that has underpinned Western security for decades. It has also threatened to reignite a trade war with Europe that rattled markets and companies for months last year, though Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against what he called “hysteria’ over Greenland. “As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back On that, everyone agrees!” Trump said after speaking to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. To drive home the message, Trump posted an AI image of himself in Greenland, holding a US flag. Another showed him speaking to leaders next to a map showing Canada and Greenland as part of the United States. Separately, he leaked messages including from French President Emmanuel Macron, who questioned what Trump was ‘doing on Greenland’. Trump, who has vowed to impose tariffs on countries that stood in his way, had earlier threatened to hammer French wines and champagnes with a 200pc tariff. ‘New independent Europe’ The European Union has threatened to hit back with trade measures. One option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($109 billion) of US imports that could automatically kick in on Feb 6 after a six-month suspension. Another option is the “Anti-Coercion Instrument” (ACI), which has never yet been used. It could limit access to public tenders, investments or banking activity, or restrict trade in services, the sector in which the US has a surplus with the bloc, including the lucrative digital services provided by US tech giants. Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told parliament in Copenhagen on Tuesday the worst may still lie ahead. “We can negotiate about everything political, including security, investments and the economy, but we cannot negotiate our most fundamental values: sovereignty, our country’s identity, our borders, our democracy,” she said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, which Trump is also due to attend this week, sought to rally leaders around building a “new independent Europe”. “The seismic change we are going through today is an opportunity, in fact a necessity to build a new form of European independence,” she said. “We will only be able to capitalise on this opportunity if we recognise that this change is permanent,” she added. Bessent pushes back against ‘hysteria’ Bessent, also speaking at the Davos gathering of the world’s political and business elite, said a solution would be found that ensures national security for the United States and Europe. “It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax,” he said. “I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all.” Asked about the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the US and Europe, Bessent replied: “Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case?… Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.” Danish sovereignty over Greenland questioned Protesters marched in Zurich, Switzerland, late on Monday, carrying a giant banner saying: “TRUMP NOT WELCOME. NO WEF! NO OLIGARCHY! NO IMPERIALIST WARS!”, Swiss newspaper NZZ reported. The foreign minister of Russia, which has been watching with glee as Trump’s drive to acquire Greenland widens splits with Europe, said that “Greenland is not a natural part of Denmark” and also denied that Moscow had any designs on the island. “It was neither a natural part of Norway nor a natural part of Denmark,” Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. “It is a colonial conquest. The fact that the inhabitants are now accustomed to it and feel comfortable is another matter.” Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2026",

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, which Trump is also due to attend this week, sought to rally leaders around building a “new independent Europe”. “The seismic change we are going through today is an opportunity, in fact a necessity to build a new form of European independence,” she said. “We will only be able to capitalise on this opportunity if we recognise that this change is permanent,” she added. Bessent pushes back against ‘hysteria’ Bessent, also speaking at the Davos gathering of the world’s political and business elite, said a solution would be found that ensures national security for the United States and Europe. “It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax,” he said. “I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all.” Asked about the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the US and Europe, Bessent replied: “Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case?… Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.” Danish sovereignty over Greenland questioned Protesters marched in Zurich, Switzerland, late on Monday, carrying a giant banner saying: “TRUMP NOT WELCOME. NO WEF! NO OLIGARCHY! NO IMPERIALIST WARS!”, Swiss newspaper NZZ reported. The foreign minister of Russia, which has been watching with glee as Trump’s drive to acquire Greenland widens splits with Europe, said that “Greenland is not a natural part of Denmark” and also denied that Moscow had any designs on the island. “It was neither a natural part of Norway nor a natural part of Denmark,” Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. “It is a colonial conquest. The fact that the inhabitants are now accustomed to it and feel comfortable is another matter.” Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Private sector entities of Pakistan and China have signed 78 memoranda of understanding worth $4.5 billion at the conclusion of Pak-China Agriculture Investment Conference, marking agriculture’s elevation as a priority sector under the second phase of CPEC. Briefing the media on Tuesday, Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain said the conference would contribute to increased bilateral agricultural trade, expanded investment in priority sub-sectors, modernisation of production and processing systems, and the establishment of commercial partnerships between private sector entities of the two countries. Cooperation across 10 priority sub-sectors of agriculture includes collaboration in seed production technology; export of heat-treated beef; construction of grain storages and warehouses; strengthening ties for cheese production and export; improvement of local milk processing machinery; export of heat-treated offal; collaboration in buffalo UHT milk and camel milk powder; poultry machinery and technology; chemicals and bio-pesticides; feed mill equipment; renewable technologies in irrigation; value addition in mango pulp and tea; efficient fodder production; fish and shrimp feed technology; fruit processing; development of sweet and seedless Chinese citrus orchards in Pakistan; value addition of rice; soya milk packaging; and exchange of best citrus varieties with mango (chaunsa) variety. Of the 78 agreements signed, 37 were business-to-business investment agreements, 24 joint ventures and 14 partnership agreements. The 10 priority sectors identified were agri-chemicals and inputs; agri-machinery; food processing and value addition; meat and poultry industry; dairy products; fruits and vegetables; animal feed; fisheries and aquaculture; cold chain systems; and food-grade packaging and equipment. Agriculture formally included as priority area under CPEC 2.0 To ensure implementation of the MoUs, dedicated units were being established in the ministry as well as at the Pakistan Embassy in Beijing to oversee follow-up, the minister said. He added that enhanced cooperation in agriculture would help boost Pakistan’s exports. Currently, Pakistan exports agricultural products worth $8bn, and the government aims to double this figure over the next three years. Mr Hussain explained that the conference was conceived as a targeted, investment-focused platform rather than a general consultative forum. Its design emphasised direct private sector engagement, investment matchmaking and facilitation support, aligned with national priorities for agricultural modernisation and export-led growth. He said 116 Chinese companies and 165 Pakistani companies were invited to participate, enabling business-to-business matchmaking between shortlisted firms from both sides. Pakistan also showcased investable projects, value chains and policy reforms. He added that Pakistan had already signed a protocol for milk products with China. Documents revealed that the food security ministry plans to sign more than 25 sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and export protocols with key partners, including China, in 2026. Pakistan plans to introduce a new seed policy and a national agricultural biotechnology policy to create pathways for GMO seeds. Proposals are under consideration to allow the export of pesticides and fertilisers under specific conditions, particularly targeting regional and African markets. The participants of the conference were informed that Pakistan’s annual fruit production exceeds 10 million tonnes, while vegetable production stands at over 9m tonnes. With a rising population, domestic demand is growing at more than 5pc annually. Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Tuesday the issue of missing persons had long been used as a propaganda tool against the state, adding that his government had now put in place a comprehensive legal framework to address the matter on a permanent basis. Presiding over the 22nd meeting of the provincial cabinet at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat, Mr Bugti said that despite similar or higher numbers of such cases in other provinces, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the issue in Balochistan had been politically exploited for years without any serious effort to find a lasting solution. The chief minister stressed that from Feb 1 onw­ards, no enforced disappearance would take place under the authority of the state or the government. He maintained that the new legislation would help dispel allegations of enforced disappearances and counter negative propaganda directed at Pakistan. The chief minister said that security forces in Balochistan often operate in grey zones and conduct intelligence-based operations where suspects are detained for investigation. However, he added, the new legal framework would ensure transparency and accountability. Balochistan cabinet okays detention rules, witness protection bill Mr Bugti clarified that if individuals were abducted by terrorist groups or went into hiding on their own, the responsibility could not be attributed to the state. He noted that courts and relevant commissions already existed to examine claims of enforced disappearance, but allegations were often amplified without verification to fuel anti-state narratives. To address this, the cabinet approved the rules for the Balochistan Prevention of Detention and De-radicalisation Act, 2025. Under the law, designated centres have been established where suspects will be investigated under the supervision of authorised police officers, along with counselling aimed at countering extremism and anti-state indoctrination. Families of those under investigation will be informed within 24 hours, allowed visitation and provided medical facilities. No individual will be shifted outside these centres. During the meeting, the provincial cabinet also approved the Balochistan Witness Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2025. Mr Bugti said that in the past, the absence of an effective witness protection mechanism had led to extremely low conviction rates in terrorism and serious criminal cases. Under the new reforms, witnesses will testify through faceless courts, with their identities kept fully confidential, a measure expected to significantly improve convictions. The cabinet expressed satisfaction over merit-based recruitments conducted through online testing in the Finance Department and decided to gradually digitalise recruitment processes across all provincial departments. Among other decisions, the cabinet approved the abolition of the Religious Affairs Department, with staff to be adjusted in other departments, the creation of two new divisions (Pishin and Koh-i-Suleman), administrative realignment of Ziarat with Loralai, and the establishment of Municipal Committee Karbala in Pishin district. The cabinet also approved policies related to the evaluation of law officers, amendments to grant-in-aid rules for minority affairs, measures to curb child labour, the declaration of higher technical education as an essential service and verification of academic credentials of contract teachers. The chief minister directed the Chief Minister’s Inspection Team to initiate verification of degrees, warning that FIRs would be registered against holders of fake credentials, starting from Nasirabad and Dera Bugti. Education-related decisions included adopting the national curriculum as part of the provincial syllabus from the academic year 2026-27, launching the Chief Minister Academic Excellence Programme and hiring ad-hoc teachers for mathematics, science and English at middle, high and higher secondary levels. In the social sector, the cabinet approved the Balochistan Protection and Promotion of Reproductive Health Rights Bill, 2026, aimed at improving maternal and child health, expanding access to family planning services and safeguarding basic reproductive health rights.

      "summary_orig": "Hours after he was notified as the opposition leader in the Senate on Tuesday, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas met lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chattha, expressing solidarity with them and ruing that “dissent has been made a crime” in the country. The meeting took place at the office of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president, following which a statement on Abbas’s X account detailed his media talk after his interaction with the lawyers. The post quoted him as saying that Pakistan was currently going through a “severe crisis”. “Unfortunately, the country seems to be heading in a direction where fundamental rights of people, constitutional guarantees and human dignity are being continuously violated. The real tragedy is that those who have the power and authority are the ones ruthlessly crushing the state’s soft power. “Today, civil society, lawyers, human rights organisations and every other voice that raises awareness and questions is being pressurised in the country. Dissent has been made a crime and anyone who dares to speak up has to face imprisonment, cases and violence. The Constitution of Pakistan gives the people the right to choose their rulers, but here public decisions are trampled and elections are stolen,” Abbas was quoted as saying. He said the people of Pakistan had several grievances and reiterated that the country was mired in political, economic and social crisis. “When people are deprived of justice, they approach the court. But unfortunately, they often face disappointment there as well,” he added. Abbas further stated that the “wounds of people of Balochistan are still fresh”. “But instead of dialogue, rapprochement and political wisdom, force and operations were chosen as the first options for the resolution of issues there. Even though surgery should always be the last resort,” he continued. “The question remains that after decades of ongoing operations, which issue has been resolved,” he said, adding that when injustice becomes common, countries start disintegrating. He said the rulers need to “have mercy on Pakistan and should not further harm its international standing because they will not be able to contain the destruction that they are unleashing today”. Abbas said millions of people in the country could not even afford two meals a day. And “if someone raises their voice against this, should they be responded to with bullets, batons and cases? Those who are not getting their rights and justice, where should they go?” The Senate opposition leader said Mazari and Chattha were the voices of the oppressed. “They have the spirit of freedom, and the rulers are truly wise, they should promote awareness and liberty among the youth rather than trying to silence every free voice with bullets and imprisonment”. “These young people raise their voices against cruelty and that is why they are being targeted,” he added. He said that a first information report was being registered against Mazari “after six months”, in which she was accused of beating policemen. Abbas alleged that the intent behind this was to put Mazari behind bars at any cost. “This conduct is not just blatant oppression but is also extremely damaging for the judiciary’s dignity. When people are disappointed by courts, they are compelled to strive to get justice for themselves on their own. This is a dangerous situation for any state,” he added. “You cannot suppress truth by putting someone in jail. These voices grow stronger and more wide-reaching if they are held captive for days or even months,” he said. “I sincerely advise the rulers to refrain from such oppressive actions, because Pakistan no longer has the capacity to bear any more,” he said. In his remarks to the media, he criticised what he described as a broader crisis of justice in the country, stating that people approach courts in the hope of relief but were instead subjected to repression. Terming the proceedings against Imaan and Hadi a grave injustice, he warned that such actions would furtther erode public confidence in the judiciary. He added that accountability must not turn into revenge and emphasised that the constitution guarantees citizens the right to life, liberty, and freedom of expression. Separately, a case registered against Imaan and Hadi in July 2025 resurfaced on Tuesday pertaining to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Council. The two subsequently filed pre-arrest bail applications which could not be heard on an urgent basis as the couple struggled to avoid arrest. IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani later took the two to his office and assured them of complete safety, stating that no arrest would take place from within the bar premises. He further informed them that their pleas would be scheduled later in accordance with the court’s roster. The couple took refuge in the IHCBA president’s office, while a large number of police officials, including a female station house officer remained outside the premises. IHC reinstates bail, right to defence for Imaan, Hadi in social media posts case Separately, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday reinstated the bail of Imaan and Hadi in the controversial social media posts case, after it was cancelled by a sessions court on January 15. In the case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. On January 17, Mazari and Chattha challenged their arrest orders in the IHC, arguing that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production. During today’s hearing, the IHC judge reinstated the bail from earlier, suspending the arrest warrant issued by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka. He further directed them to complete the cross-examination in three days and reinstated their right to defence. At this, the couple’s legal counsel, Kamran Murtaza, requested the court to grant one week. “I will look into it. You should proceed with the trial,” the judge remarked.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: PML-N Senator Afnanullah Khan on Tuesday alleged that there had to be some involvement of officials in the theft of Pakistanis’ data, saying that it was available on the dark web. The senator made the remarks during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior, where he said: “All of Pakistani nationals’ data is on the dark web. And it is the latest data. “And it is such good data that we might not have such well-processed data. For example, they have consolidated data from the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and banks into a dataset,” he said. “And you can get anyone’s data for Rs500, and if you want that of the entire country, you will get it for Rs70-80 billion. Data worth Rs70-80bn is [available] on the dark web,” the senator said. He pointed out that when the data of any individual was stolen, it could be used for any purpose, including obtaining passports and identity cards for others. “Why is Pakistanis’ data stolen time and again?” he asked. Addressing Immigration and Passports Director General Mustafa Jamal Kazi, he added: “Let me tell you one thing; without the [involvement of] people inside the organisation, data theft at such a large scale is not possible. It is impossible. The data of 240 million people cannot be stolen just like that.” Later, speaking to Dawn , the PML-N senator asserted that this data could not have been leaked without the involvement of officials in the Nadra and Immigration and Passports Directorate General. In the meeting, Committee Chairperson and PTI Senator Faisal Saleem Rahman had asked Kazi whether any investigation had been carried out in this regard. Kazi responded that a probe had been conducted and officials had also been removed. Senator Rahman also stressed the need for ensuring the protection of law enforcement bodies’ data. “Who will be responsible if their data is leaked?” he said. Proposal to ban social media platforms Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry also attended the meeting, where he raised the issue of the use of social media by terrorists. “Previously, terrorists used guns. Now, they are using social media,” he said, adding that social media companies would not even share the Internet Protocol addresses of users operating accounts being used for terrorism. Speaking on the matter, Senator Rahman suggested that the government should enter into a contract with social media platforms. He further advised that platforms that did not cooperate with the government should be banned. PPP Senator Palwasha Khan endorsed these views, saying: “A ban should definitely be imposed.” Senator Rahman further pointed out that China had its own social media platforms and said, “There is no need to employ the services of those [companies] that are not cooperating.” Chaudhry responded to the suggestion, saying: “This is a big decision, you can take it. If we take it, it will be called an attack on the freedom of expression.”",

      "summary_orig": "A diplomatic row has erupted between New Delhi and Warsaw after Indian Foreign Minister Dr Subrahmanyam Jaishankar took aim at Polish Deputy Prime Minister Radoslaw Sikorski’s recent visit to Pakistan, Indian media reported. According to The Hindu , the visit by the Polish minister was the first since Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Warsaw in August 2024, from where he travelled to Ukraine as well. The report added that Jaishankar, in televised remarks, said he wanted to discuss Sikorski’s “recent travels to the region”, calling it a direct reference to the Polish minister’s visit to Pakistan in October last year. During Sikorski’s two-day visit to Islamabad, Pakistan and Poland had agreed to deepen their political and economic ties during talks in Islamabad, with both countries pledging to transform their relationship into what they called a “comprehensive and mutually beneficial partnership”. The Hindu reported that during the meeting between Jaishankar and Sikorski, the former said, “Poland should display zero tolerance for terrorism and not help fuel the terrorist infrastructure in our neighbourhood.” According to the report, this was a “direct reference to the Polish FM’s visit to Pakistan in October 2025, where he had met Pakistan’s top leadership”. The report further quoted Jaishankar as saying that Sikorski, a former journalist who covered Afghanistan in the 1980s, was “no stranger to the region” and would be “certainly familiar with the longstanding challenge of cross-border terrorism”. The Indian minister also took exception to the Polish minister’s previous comments about Delhi’s import of Russian oil; the report noted that Sikorski had stated in Paris earlier this month that he was “satisfied” by India’s reduction of Russian oil imports “because this is financing the war machine of Putin”. “I have repeatedly underlined that the selective targeting of India is both unfair and unjustified. I do so again today,” Jaishankar told Sikorski, according to The Hindu. Speaking to reporters after the meeting at Hyderabad House, Sikorski said that while the two sides agreed on concerns over terrorism, India’s participation in “Zapad 2025” military exercises in Russia and Belarus was seen as “threatening”, the report said. India had taken part in Russia’s Zapad (West) joint drills with Belarus in September 2025, part of which took place close to Nato borders. “We all have regional concerns and we all have neighbours, and with neighbours you have opportunities and challenges,” Sikorski was quoted as saying, adding that India and Poland were of “one mind” as far as terrorism was concerned. “We also have concerns. India took part in the Zapad exercises in Russia that we find threatening,” Sikorski was quoted as saying.",

      "title_orig": "PTI-nominated MWM chief Raja Nasir Abbas appointed Senate opposition leader after months-long delay",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was appointed as the opposition leader in the Senate on Tuesday. Abbas — vice chairman of Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — had been chosen by PTI founder Imran Khan as the opposition’s choice for the seat, which had been vacant since August 2025. “In pursuance of sub-rule (3) of Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, the chairman Senate has been pleased to declare Senator Raja Nasir Abbas as leader of the opposition in the Senate, with immediate effect,” said a notification issued by the Senate Secretariat. Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani also announced Abbas’s appointment as the opposition leader during Tuesday’s session in the House. As the proceedings began, he said: “I want to give a ruling. Before proceeding further, I consider it necessary to place on record the legal and procedural background relating to the declaration of the leader of the opposition in the Senate. “Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012 mandates that the chairman Senate should declare as leader of the opposition the member who commands the support of the majority of the members in opposition. “Following the disqualification of former senator Syed Shibli Faraz by the Election Commission of Pakistan vide notification dated August 5, 2025 and the consequential notification of the Senate Secretariat dated August 8, 2025, the office of the leader of the opposition stood vacated. “The said notifications were challenged before the honourable Peshawar High Court, which issued restraining orders prohibiting further action in the matter. In view of the pendency of judicial proceedings, the matter remained under consideration of the Senate Secretariat for legal examination and procedural guidance, in accordance with the established parliamentary practice and constitutional discipline so as to ensure that no step was taken which might conflict with or render infructuous the proceedings before the honourable court.” Gilani explained that the “earlier deferment [of the appointment] was therefore procedural, occasioned by institutional prudence, due deference to judicial authority and rule of law”. He further stated: “There being no legal bar, I now proceed in accordance with Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012 and hereby declare Senator Raja Nasir Abbas as the leader of the opposition in the Senate …” At this point, Gilani was interrupted by the thumping of desks and slogans in favour of incarcerated ex-premier Imran. Meanwhile, Gilani continued: “… Having secured the support of 22 members out of 32 members on the opposition benches. The secretary is directed to issue a formal notification accordingly right now.” He then requested parliamentary leaders in the House to “assist the opposition leader on his seat”, following which Abbas rose and changed his seat amid applause, shaking hands with several senators on his way. Later, before giving the floor to Senator Abbas, Gilani congratulated him for becoming the opposition leader. Abbas’s maiden address as opposition leader In his maiden address in the House as the opposition leader, Abbas credited Imran for “making me a senator”. He asserted that he was “his (Imran) loyal companion, will never compromise on principles” and never violate his oath taken as a senator. Abbas also expressed his commitment to making all-possible efforts and playing his role to ensure the security, betterment and national interest of the country. He thanked treasury members for showing him respect and welcoming him. “It was a good gesture,” he said, adding that “we will try that this Senate play a role in addressing the difficulties of the people” and that legislation benefits the people. The opposition leader then went on to elaborate on the significance of the Constitution, highlighting that it was a social contract with the people and represented people’s views and expectations. “Laws are made in light of the Constitution, and under those laws, institutions and pillars of the state are established .” He added that under the Constitution, it had been established that the three pillars of the state — ostensibly a reference to the legislature, judiciary and executive — would not interfere in each other’s affairs. “The Constitution is sacred,” he remarked, adding that when laws are not respected, society “becomes a jungle”. Abbas continued: “Presently, Pakistan is facing various difficulties. One among them is lawlessness.” The senator said it was the government’s and the rulers’ job to ensure law and justice, adding that people also had a role to play in this regard. But, he continued, people no longer “trust our system as there is no law and justice. Look at what has become of the judiciary. People are losing confidence in Parliament and they no longer trust the executive as well. The people of Pakistan do not trust this system”. Abbas stressed that whenever a government loses the trust of the people, it loses its “soft and national power” as well. “And national power or soft power is not acquired through bullets, tanks or jets. […] That is why it is impossible to keep people united when there is no rule of law, justice and supremacy of the Constitution.” He went on to say that the consequences of injustice were visible in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Is it not injustice to displace people just to find a few terrorists? Had you taken the people’s help, the terrorists might not have been able to enter that region. How can you eradicate terrorism and restore peace without the support of the local people? How will there be peace if people do not get justice?” This part of Abbas’s speech seemed to be a reference to the displacement of residents from KP’s Tirah for a military operation against terrorists. The opposition leader also emphasised that it was the House’s responsibility to stand up for ensuring justice. He also stressed the need for ending the political crisis in the country, adding that economic difficulties and law and order problems also could not be resolved until the political crisis was brought to an end. The senator said the political crisis originated from what happened on February 8, 2024 — the day when general elections, which the opposition alleges were rigged, were held in the country. He also alleged that TTAP members were subjected to violence when they recently visited Punjab. “What law is this? Did we have weapons? We were peaceful,” he said, adding, “Why is this happening? Why is there lawlessness? Will we be able to run the system by suppressing, pressuring and harassing people? […] Let people speak. […] If people protest within the limits of the law and Constitution, it makes the country more powerful.” He then said that the only solution to the ongoing political crisis was to release Imran from jail, claiming that progress on cases against Imran had been stalled. “The country cannot progress if you keep a popular leader in jail,” he asserted, claiming that he had the support of 90 per cent people in the country. He further called for the Senate to speak up for the release of “political prisoners”. “We want these innocent people to be released from jail so that political instability in Pakistan ends.” Moreover, he said under the Constitution, only those had the right to rule the country who were voted into power by the people, not those who were rejected by the people. “Today, Imran Khan is a popular leader. The presence of a popular is necessary today for nation-building,” he said, adding that he could sacrifice his life for the country but would also impede any efforts to harm the country. The senator then mentioned that ruling the country was only politicians’ job, recalling that some from the establishment had said that they had nothing to do with politics. “Can we swear about this on the Holy Quran?” he questioned, adding that “we all will salute” the army if it operated within its domain. Addressing treasury members, particularly PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah, he said let’s steer the country towards a better political situation. “May no one have to face the injustice that Imran Khan is facing. The case against you was unjust, and you know who is behind those cases. When will we stop them? […] Politicians have built this country with the support of the people. Under the Constitution and law, only politicians have the right to run this country,” he said. He stressed the importance of collective wisdom in Parliament and called for progress on cases against Imran. Moreover, he said Pakistan should take a stand against US President Donald Trump over his threats to Iran. “We should call a session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation […] we should call a session of neighbouring and other countries and decide that no one will be allowed to attack any country in this region.” Speaking after Abbas, Sanaullah addressed the House and began his speech by congratulating the new opposition leader. He said Abbas had expressed “balanced and positive views” and even chose suitable words to express his disagreement on various issues. The PML-N leader said he expected that this practice would continue in the future as well. Responding to Abbas’s remarks regarding February 8, 2024 elections, he recalled that allegations of electoral rigging at also surfaced in relation to 2018 elections, following which the PTI had come to power. Sanaullah said neither could the opposition walk back on its allegations regarding the 2024 elections nor could it agree to the then-opposition’s stance on the 2018 elections. “Then why don’t we agree that electoral [exercises] in Pakistan could not be fully trusted? … And if we agree on this, then we should sit together, ponder over these matters and make the [electoral] system better. […] We can talk about electoral rules. We can talk about the election commission,” he suggested. Moreover, Sanaullah said he agreed with Abbas that politicians should be involved in politics, “that politicians should sit together and politicians should resolve political issues in a political manner”. In this connection, he also mentioned the Charter of Democracy signed by former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto in 2006. But then, he continued while referring to Imran, “who began harping that he will not spare anyone?” Sanaullah further questioned: “Does the establishment carry out long marches against politicians? Does the establishment stage months-long sit-ins against politicians?” Concluding his speech, he stressed the need for dialogue between the opposition and government, saying that solutions to problems would only come through talks and Parliament. Months-long delay The opposition leader’s slot in the Senate had been lying vacant since August 2025, following the disqualification of the then-opposition leader, PTI’s Shibli Faraz. At the same time, PTI’s Omar Ayub, who was the opposition leader in the National Assembly (NA) back then, was also disqualified. The two were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) after their convictions in cases rela­ted to the May 9, 2023, riots. The PTI had then nominated in October last year Abbas as its candidate for the opposition leader’s position in the Senate and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai to fill the NA slot. On Monday, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar said Gilani had informed him that Abbas would be notified as the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament by Tuesday (today). Zafar had submitted a letter to the Senate chairperson, seeking the appointment of Abbas. In a post on X, Zafar had said that he also had a meeting with the Senate chairman regarding the appointment of the opposition leader. Additional reporting by Iftikhar Khan",

One among them is lawlessness.” The senator said it was the government’s and the rulers’ job to ensure law and justice, adding that people also had a role to play in this regard. But, he continued, people no longer “trust our system as there is no law and justice. Look at what has become of the judiciary. People are losing confidence in Parliament and they no longer trust the executive as well. The people of Pakistan do not trust this system”. Abbas stressed that whenever a government loses the trust of the people, it loses its “soft and national power” as well. “And national power or soft power is not acquired through bullets, tanks or jets. […] That is why it is impossible to keep people united when there is no rule of law, justice and supremacy of the Constitution.” He went on to say that the consequences of injustice were visible in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Is it not injustice to displace people just to find a few terrorists? Had you taken the people’s help, the terrorists might not have been able to enter that region. How can you eradicate terrorism and restore peace without the support of the local people? How will there be peace if people do not get justice?” This part of Abbas’s speech seemed to be a reference to the displacement of residents from KP’s Tirah for a military operation against terrorists. The opposition leader also emphasised that it was the House’s responsibility to stand up for ensuring justice. He also stressed the need for ending the political crisis in the country, adding that economic difficulties and law and order problems also could not be resolved until the political crisis was brought to an end. The senator said the political crisis originated from what happened on February 8, 2024 — the day when general elections, which the opposition alleges were rigged, were held in the country. He also alleged that TTAP members were subjected to violence when they recently visited Punjab. “What law is this? Did we have weapons? We were peaceful,” he said, adding, “Why is this happening? Why is there lawlessness? Will we be able to run the system by suppressing, pressuring and harassing people? […] Let people speak. […] If people protest within the limits of the law and Constitution, it makes the country more powerful.” He then said that the only solution to the ongoing political crisis was to release Imran from jail, claiming that progress on cases against Imran had been stalled. “The country cannot progress if you keep a popular leader in jail,” he asserted, claiming that he had the support of 90 per cent people in the country. He further called for the Senate to speak up for the release of “political prisoners”. “We want these innocent people to be released from jail so that political instability in Pakistan ends.” Moreover, he said under the Constitution, only those had the right to rule the country who were voted into power by the people, not those who were rejected by the people. “Today, Imran Khan is a popular leader. The presence of a popular is necessary today for nation-building,” he said, adding that he could sacrifice his life for the country but would also impede any efforts to harm the country. The senator then mentioned that ruling the country was only politicians’ job, recalling that some from the establishment had said that they had nothing to do with politics. “Can we swear about this on the Holy Quran?” he questioned, adding that “we all will salute” the army if it operated within its domain. Addressing treasury members, particularly PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah, he said let’s steer the country towards a better political situation. “May no one have to face the injustice that Imran Khan is facing. The case against you was unjust, and you know who is behind those cases. When will we stop them? […] Politicians have built this country with the support of the people. Under the Constitution and law, only politicians have the right to run this country,” he said. He stressed the importance of collective wisdom in Parliament and called for progress on cases against Imran. Moreover, he said Pakistan should take a stand against US President Donald Trump over his threats to Iran. “We should call a session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation […] we should call a session of neighbouring and other countries and decide that no one will be allowed to attack any country in this region.” Speaking after Abbas, Sanaullah addressed the House and began his speech by congratulating the new opposition leader. He said Abbas had expressed “balanced and positive views” and even chose suitable words to express his disagreement on various issues. The PML-N leader said he expected that this practice would continue in the future as well. Responding to Abbas’s remarks regarding February 8, 2024 elections, he recalled that allegations of electoral rigging at also surfaced in relation to 2018 elections, following which the PTI had come to power. Sanaullah said neither could the opposition walk back on its allegations regarding the 2024 elections nor could it agree to the then-opposition’s stance on the 2018 elections. “Then why don’t we agree that electoral [exercises] in Pakistan could not be fully trusted? … And if we agree on this, then we should sit together, ponder over these matters and make the [electoral] system better. […] We can talk about electoral rules. We can talk about the election commission,” he suggested. Moreover, Sanaullah said he agreed with Abbas that politicians should be involved in politics, “that politicians should sit together and politicians should resolve political issues in a political manner”. In this connection, he also mentioned the Charter of Democracy signed by former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto in 2006. But then, he continued while referring to Imran, “who began harping that he will not spare anyone?” Sanaullah further questioned: “Does the establishment carry out long marches against politicians? Does the establishment stage months-long sit-ins against politicians?” Concluding his speech, he stressed the need for dialogue between the opposition and government, saying that solutions to problems would only come through talks and Parliament. Months-long delay The opposition leader’s slot in the Senate had been lying vacant since August 2025, following the disqualification of the then-opposition leader, PTI’s Shibli Faraz. At the same time, PTI’s Omar Ayub, who was the opposition leader in the National Assembly (NA) back then, was also disqualified. The two were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) after their convictions in cases rela­ted to the May 9, 2023, riots. The PTI had then nominated in October last year Abbas as its candidate for the opposition leader’s position in the Senate and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai to fill the NA slot. On Monday, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar said Gilani had informed him that Abbas would be notified as the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament by Tuesday (today). Zafar had submitted a letter to the Senate chairperson, seeking the appointment of Abbas. In a post on X, Zafar had said that he also had a meeting with the Senate chairman regarding the appointment of the opposition leader. Additional reporting by Iftikhar Khan",
