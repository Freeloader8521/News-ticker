      "summary_orig": "The federal government on Thursday approved a ban on the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan under the anti-terrorism act (ATA) following violent protests earlier this month. The decision was taken in a meeting of the federal cabinet that deliberated on a recommendation by the Punjab government to ban the party. A press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting said the ban was “unaimously” approved by the federal cabinet. It added that the interior ministry presented the summary to the federal cabinet on the Punjab government’s request and a briefing was provided on the “violent and terrorist activities of TLP in the country”. “The meeting was informed that this organisation, established since 2016, has incited violence across the country. Due to the organisation, incidents of violence have occurred in different parts of the country,” it added. It pointed out that the TLP was banned in 2021 as well, which was lifted after 6 months on the condition that unrest and violent activities would not be carried out by the party in the future, adding that a reason for the current ban on the organisation was also the reneging on the guarantees given in 2021. “In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP. The federal cabinet, after a briefing given to the meeting and the recommendation of the Punjab government, unanimously concluded that the TLP is involved in terrorism and violent acts,” the press release concluded. Speaking on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the purpose of a ban was not to eliminate any party, but to purge it of any anti-state and terrorist elements. He said no one had any issue with the TLP’s religious views. But, whenever the party staged protests in the past, it “led to violence and loss of life, such as the 2017 Faizabad demonstrations”. Sanaullah added that a ban was placed on the party in 2021 under the ATA, which was later revoked, subject to an undertaking by the party that it would not partake in any violent activities in the future. Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said while speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ that the TLP had acted in a manner of an extremist group and violated its prior commitments. He said the government had no other option in light of reports submitted by the Punjab government than to ban the party. Chaudhry said the interior ministry had summoned reports from all provinces about the party’s conduct in the past decade regarding its involvement in violence, targeting of minorities, incitement of sectaraianism and other such matters. “Those who adopt the path of violence have no right to be given political rights.” How does banning a party work? The National Counter-Terrorism Authority (Nacta) maintains lists of proscribed persons and groups, under which those designated as ‘terrorists’ or associated with terrorism face severe consequences such as travel bans and sanctions. The Fourth Schedule of the ATA, a watch list for individuals affiliated with terrorist groups or activities, is also used as a means of monitoring and restricting terrorism. Historically, the list has included militant groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Hizbut Tahrir; banned sectarian outfits such as Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, extremist organisations such as Jaish-i-Mohammad; and outlawed separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). However, authorities have widened their net in the last couple of years to include an increasing number of individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Although it is common practice for Pakistan’s ruling powers to attempt to ban political and other outfits based on conflicts of interest, the government has limited powers to seal the fate of its political rivals. The provincial government can request a ban to be imposed on a party, as in the case of the TLP. In turn, the federal government has the power to refer this request to the Supreme Court, by declaring that the party “has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan”, according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution. However, according to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court (SC), as per the Constitution. “The federal government shall, within fifteen days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,” the article says. According to a previous analysis by Dawn of relevant constitutional and legal provisions, the government can either invoke Article 17 (2) to ban a political party or Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek its dissolution. The latter act similarly states that the government can make a declaration in this regard, but the matter will be referred to the SC for adjudication. As a result, most attempts to ban a political party have fizzled out. Bokhari provides details of damage by TLP protesters during recent protests Earlier in the day, Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari said that a decision on the “fate of an extremist party” — an apparent reference to the TLP — was expected to come shortly from the federal government. “The Punjab government had prepared its case on this and forwarded it,” she added. She made this statement during a press conference in Lahore, days after the Punjab government forwarded a summary to the Centre to ban the religio-political party and amid reports of a federal cabinet meeting scheduled for later today. At the press conference, the provincial minister detailed recent measures taken by the Punjab government pertaining to law and order and security following a TLP protest earlier this month. These also include steps taken regarding weapons possession and licences , on which Bokhari said the provincial government had “suspended the licences of 28 weapons’ dealers and the shops of some other fake dealers who lacked licences have been sealed”. “There is a zero-tolerance policy on buying and selling of weapons, and as I said earlier, no licence for weapons will now be issued in Punjab,” she added. The minister further stated that currently, over one million people in the province had weapons’ licences. “A province where such a large number [of people] have licences for weapons, you can figure out how big a challenge it is to maintain peace.” Moreover, 47,918 security companies in the province had weapons’ licences and the number of licences issued to various institution exceeded 42,000, she added. Bokhari then went on to share some details of weapons and ammunition, which she said had been found in custody of “people belonging to the TLP”. With pictures displayed on a screen in the background, she said TLP protesters had snatched weapons, ammunition and other articles from police during their protests in previous years. “This is their modus operandi. They surround police, snatch vehicles, weapons and tear gas guns from them and use them later. “In the 2021[protest], they robbed 3,498 tear gas shells, 23 tear gas guns, 326 anti-riot kits, two 12-bore pistols and 11 submachine guns,” she said. Pointing to one of the pictures on the screen, she added that they matched the bullets that were shot at police during the TLP’s recent protest. According to Bokhari, TLP activist damaged eight police vehicles and snatched a submachine gun, two 12-bore pistols, 945 bullets during their recent protest. Moreover, the minister said the protesters had snatched 197 helmets, 22 kits, 130 “safety sheets”, one tear gas guns and 984 tear gas shells, of all which wear part of anti-riot gear. They even damaged Safe City cameras, Bokhari added. She further said that a special prosecution cell was working on cases pertaining to the TLP, in which 559 suspects had been sent on physical remand. Among them, 161 were sent to jail and 190 were on judicial remand, she added. Moving on actions taken regarding social media posts, she said a total of “75 links” had been blocked for sharing hateful and inciting material and 107 people had been apprehended. Bokhari further said citizens could give tip-offs to police about “the extremist party” and “illegal citizens, be it Afghans or anyone else”, by calling 15 police helpline. Their calls would be transferred to a special cell and the informants’ name would be kept secret, she assured. She stressed that “ dala culture”, too, would not be tolerated. “Giving a call for strike and forcing shops, business and transport to shut down is totally unacceptable. Cases will be registered under terrorism laws [against those involved],” she further warned. Bokhari also emphasised that there was a province-wide ban on posters, pamphlets, branding or any other kind of publicity of “extremist mobs”. About Afghan refugees, she said combing operations had been initiated to identify those lacking the necessary documents, who would then be shifted to centres established at the district level. They would then be sent back to their country in a respectful manner. This would also apply to others residing in Punjab “illegally”, she said, adding that “information was being collected about illegal citizens doing business in Punjab so that they could also be repatriated”. In this connection, the minister warned that renting or leasing out properties to “illegal citizens” or letting them stay at one’s residence was a crime and action would taken over it. “The Punjab government has taken a decision on this and it is being implemented.” She also said the Punjab government had requested the Centre to regularise weapons’ factories. TLP protest The Punjab government’s decision to seek a ban on the TLP was made during a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Oct 16, five days after the religio-political party had begun a protest march in Lahore. The party — which has a history of violent protests — had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. Ahead of its planned march, roads had been blocked in mutiple areas of Punjab and mobile internet services suspended in the federal capital and Rawalpindi. The TLP protesters had camped at Muridke on the night of Oct 11, the very first day of their march, and later stayed there until an operation by law enforcement personnel on Oct 13 that resulted in their dispersal. Dawn reported that the marchers were unable to move forward due to large trenches dug by the district administration along the main GT Road. Meanwhile, throughout the duration of the protest, reports of clashes between TLP activists and law enforcement personnel kept emerging. On Oct 12, law enforcement agencies, including Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) and large contingents of police from five districts, were dispatched to Muridke and were reported to have surrounded the TLP protest camp, in what appeared to be preparations for a large-scale operation. Subsequently, law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Oct 13 to dismantle the party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests. The Punjab government has been taking stringent measures since, while several TLP activists have been arrested with cases against them registered under terrorism laws. However, there has been no official confirmation about the whereabouts of TLP chief Saad Rizvi. But, according to an Oct 20 report from Dawn , authorities in Punjab have claimed to have traced his and his brother Anas’s whereabouts, saying that they had fled to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). A senior official told Dawn that law enforcers had shared this information with AJK authorities and sought their help to nab the TLP leaders. The development follows speculation — fuelled by TLP circles — that their party chief was in custody. In the meeting chaired by Maryam on Oct 16, it was also decided to place the TLP leadership in the Fourth Schedule of the ATA. The Fourth Schedule is a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism under the 1997 ATA. Several others decisions were also made during the session, following which Bokhari shared during an Oct 21 press conference that individuals providing “financial or political support” to TLP would face terrorism charges. “Some 3,800 TLP financiers have been identified. Their funding sources have been blocked and legal action will be initiated against them under anti-terrorism laws,” she had said. She had further claimed that 1.92 kilogrammes of gold was recovered from TLP head Saad Rizvi’s house, along with 898 grammes of silver, 68 rare watches and other valuables. Besides, Saad Rizvi purchased properties under benami (anonymous) ownership and turned certain areas into no-go zones, the minister alleged. She further stated that the management of TLP-linked mosques and madressahs had been placed under the Auqaf Department. “This is not an action against any sect or group but against extremist ideology. A total of 130 TLP mosques have been taken into government control and 223 seminaries have been geo-tagged.” Bokhari had also said 95 bank accounts linked to Saad Rizvi had been frozen. She had also shared that the Punjab government had forwarded the summary to ban the party to the Centre. Previously, the federal government had banned the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government under the ATA. The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march towards Islamabad.",

Bokhari also emphasised that there was a province-wide ban on posters, pamphlets, branding or any other kind of publicity of “extremist mobs”. About Afghan refugees, she said combing operations had been initiated to identify those lacking the necessary documents, who would then be shifted to centres established at the district level. They would then be sent back to their country in a respectful manner. This would also apply to others residing in Punjab “illegally”, she said, adding that “information was being collected about illegal citizens doing business in Punjab so that they could also be repatriated”. In this connection, the minister warned that renting or leasing out properties to “illegal citizens” or letting them stay at one’s residence was a crime and action would taken over it. “The Punjab government has taken a decision on this and it is being implemented.” She also said the Punjab government had requested the Centre to regularise weapons’ factories. TLP protest The Punjab government’s decision to seek a ban on the TLP was made during a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Oct 16, five days after the religio-political party had begun a protest march in Lahore. The party — which has a history of violent protests — had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. Ahead of its planned march, roads had been blocked in mutiple areas of Punjab and mobile internet services suspended in the federal capital and Rawalpindi. The TLP protesters had camped at Muridke on the night of Oct 11, the very first day of their march, and later stayed there until an operation by law enforcement personnel on Oct 13 that resulted in their dispersal. Dawn reported that the marchers were unable to move forward due to large trenches dug by the district administration along the main GT Road. Meanwhile, throughout the duration of the protest, reports of clashes between TLP activists and law enforcement personnel kept emerging. On Oct 12, law enforcement agencies, including Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) and large contingents of police from five districts, were dispatched to Muridke and were reported to have surrounded the TLP protest camp, in what appeared to be preparations for a large-scale operation. Subsequently, law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Oct 13 to dismantle the party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests. The Punjab government has been taking stringent measures since, while several TLP activists have been arrested with cases against them registered under terrorism laws. However, there has been no official confirmation about the whereabouts of TLP chief Saad Rizvi. But, according to an Oct 20 report from Dawn , authorities in Punjab have claimed to have traced his and his brother Anas’s whereabouts, saying that they had fled to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). A senior official told Dawn that law enforcers had shared this information with AJK authorities and sought their help to nab the TLP leaders. The development follows speculation — fuelled by TLP circles — that their party chief was in custody. In the meeting chaired by Maryam on Oct 16, it was also decided to place the TLP leadership in the Fourth Schedule of the ATA. The Fourth Schedule is a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism under the 1997 ATA. Several others decisions were also made during the session, following which Bokhari shared during an Oct 21 press conference that individuals providing “financial or political support” to TLP would face terrorism charges. “Some 3,800 TLP financiers have been identified. Their funding sources have been blocked and legal action will be initiated against them under anti-terrorism laws,” she had said. She had further claimed that 1.92 kilogrammes of gold was recovered from TLP head Saad Rizvi’s house, along with 898 grammes of silver, 68 rare watches and other valuables. Besides, Saad Rizvi purchased properties under benami (anonymous) ownership and turned certain areas into no-go zones, the minister alleged. She further stated that the management of TLP-linked mosques and madressahs had been placed under the Auqaf Department. “This is not an action against any sect or group but against extremist ideology. A total of 130 TLP mosques have been taken into government control and 223 seminaries have been geo-tagged.” Bokhari had also said 95 bank accounts linked to Saad Rizvi had been frozen. She had also shared that the Punjab government had forwarded the summary to ban the party to the Centre. Previously, the federal government had banned the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government under the ATA. The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march towards Islamabad.",

      "title_orig": "Trump says would pull US support if Israel annexes West Bank",
      "summary_orig": "President Donald Trump said Israel would lose its crucial backing from the United States if it annexes the occupied West Bank, in a Time magazine interview published on Thursday. Trump’s comments , which Time said were made by telephone on October 15, were published as both Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned against any annexation. “It won’t happen. It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. And you can’t do that now. We’ve had great Arab support,” Trump said when asked what the consequences would be for Israel if it did so. “Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.” Trump also told Time that he believed Saudi Arabia would join the Abraham Accords, which normalise relations between Israel and Arab states, by the end of the year. “Yes, I do. I do,” he said when asked if he thought Riyadh would join in that timeframe. “See they had a problem. They had a Gaza problem and they had an Iran problem. Now they don’t have those two problems,” he said, referring to Israel’s military onslaught in Gaza and Iran’s nuclear programme, which US airstrikes targeted earlier this year. Trump then said that he would be “making a decision” on whether Israel should release high-profile Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti as part of peace moves. Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — was among the Palestinian prisoners Hamas wanted to see released as part of the Gaza deal, according to Egyptian state-linked media. Trump has dispatched a stream of top officials to Israel in recent days to shore up the fragile Gaza ceasefire he brokered earlier this month. But as Vance wrapped up his three-day visit and Rubio arrived, Israeli lawmakers advanced two bills paving the way for West Bank annexation. A bill applying Israeli law to the West Bank, a move tantamount to annexation of a territory that Palestinians seek for part of a future independent state, won preliminary approval from Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday. Vance said it was a “very stupid political stunt and I personally take some insult to it”. As Rubio left Washington he warned Israel against annexing the West Bank, saying steps taken by parliament and settler violence threatened the Gaza truce. Vance said that Trump would oppose Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank and it would not happen. Vance spoke after Rubio warned that steps toward annexing the territory, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war, could endanger Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict, which has yielded a shaky ceasefire so far. “The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of President Trump is that the West Bank will not be annexed. This will always be our policy,” Vance said at the end of a two-day visit to Israel. Far-right opposition sponsored vote The vote was sponsored by a far-right opposition lawmaker who until recently was in the ruling right-wing coalition, and backed by ultranationalists National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. The reading passed by a vote of 25-24 out of 120 lawmakers. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office later said that the vote was a “deliberate political provocation” that aimed to sow division during Vance’s visit. Netanyahu’s Likud party did not vote for the bill, it said, adding that without its support, attempts to legislate the annexation of the West Bank were “unlikely to go anywhere”. The US has long been Israel’s most powerful and staunch major power ally and the Trump administration is particularly close to Israel with considerable sway over its leadership. Netanyahu has repeatedly ruled out Palestinian statehood. His cabinet has considered the idea of annexation as a response to major Western allies recently recognising a Palestinian state to put pressure on Israel to stop its devastating military onslaught in Gaza, but appeared to shelve it after Trump objected last month. Senior White House officials and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner have been visiting Israel seeking to keep alive the 13-day-old truce between Israel and Hamas after two years of fighting that has upended the Middle East. Rubio is due to arrive in Israel on Thursday. The US State Department said Rubio was visiting Israel to support the implementation of Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan, which envisages eventual reconstruction and stable governance in the enclave along with possible steps towards Palestinian statehood. Vance told reporters at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport that he “feels pretty good” about the Gaza ceasefire after holding talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, other senior officials and the military. Israel and Hamas have reiterated their commitment to the US-mediated ceasefire while trading accusations of repeated violations since it took effect on October 10. The deal has so far seen the release of captives held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel, a handover of bodies of some deceased people and a partial pullout of Israeli troops. West Bank settlements There are hundreds of thousands of people living in Jewish settlements across the West Bank. The United Nations and much of the international community consider the settlements illegal under international law. Israel’s government cites biblical and historical connections to the West Bank, territory that it regards as disputed, and opposes any steps towards Palestinian statehood. The settlements are a highly volatile issue that has for decades loomed as a major obstacle to Middle East peace, as they fragment territory Palestinians want for a viable state. Wednesday’s vote was the first of four needed to pass the law and coincided with Vance’s visit to Israel — a month after Trump said he would not allow Israel to annex the territory. Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkiye and 13 other Muslim-majority nations condemned the vote, as did the key multilateral organisations that represent Arab states and Muslim nations. Trump hopes his Gaza plan will deliver stability across the Middle East and widen normalisation deals known as the Abraham Accords between Israel and Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates to include regional power Saudi Arabia. The kingdom has repeatedly said it would not strike a deal with Israel without the formation of a Palestinian state. Speaking at a conference in Jerusalem, Smotrich had said that, “if Saudi Arabia tells us normalisation in exchange for a Palestinian state, friends, no thank you. “Keep riding camels on the sand in the Saudi desert; we’ll keep truly developing — with an economy, a society, a state and all the great and wonderful things we know how to do.“ He later expressed regret for what he called his “unfortunate” remarks about Saudi Arabia. “My statement regarding Saudi Arabia was unfortunate, and I regret any offence it may have caused,” Smotrich said in a video statement he posted on X. But he said that he also expected Saudis not to offend Israel. “I’m also not willing to accept hypocrisy. Just as I don’t intend to offend the Saudis, I expect from them not to offend me, or rather, offend us,” he said. “And anyone who denies the living and very deep connection we have to the regions of our homeland in Judea and Samaria, offends us,” he added, using the Israeli Biblical term for the occupied West Bank. Smotrich, who lives in a West Bank settlement, is an outspoken supporter of annexing the Palestinian territory. His earlier comments had prompted sharp responses in Israel. Opposition leader Yair Lapid had swiftly denounced the comments. “To our friends in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, Smotrich does not represent the state of Israel,” Lapid posted on X in Arabic, later calling for him to apologise. Former defence minister Benny Gantz, another opposition figure, said that Smotrich’s comments “indicate ignorance, and a lack of internalisation of his responsibility as a senior minister in the government and cabinet”. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco normalised relations with Israel in 2020 under the US-brokered Abraham Accords. But Saudi Arabia’s own normalisation talks with Israel were frozen after Hamas’s October 2023 attack sparked the Gaza war.",

But Saudi Arabia’s own normalisation talks with Israel were frozen after Hamas’s October 2023 attack sparked the Gaza war.",

      "title_orig": "26th Amendment case: Justice Shahid Hassan says ignoring Article 191A akin to granting final relief",
      "summary_orig": "Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan on Thursday remarked that ignoring Article 191A through which the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB) was formed under the 26th Amendment would amount to granting the petitioners “final relief”. Justice Hassan’s observation came as an eight-member CB heard over three dozen petitions against the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year. The PTI claimed seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate , with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment . The hearing Advocate Uzair Bhandari, counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), began his arguments today. The hearing was adjourned till November 10, with Justice Aminuddin Khan saying that a later date would be fixed for the hearing if the bench was not available that day. Justice Aminuddin is heading the bench hearing the case. It also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan and Hassan. At the outset of the hearing, retired Justice Shahid Jamil Khan, a former judge of the Lahore High Court who resigned four years before his superannuation, came to the rostrum. Justice Mandokhail asked Jamil whether he had a separate petition against the 26th Amendment, to which the latter replied that his client has requested for the “implementation of the Practice and Procedure Committee’s decision”. The former judge informed the court that he had a visit abroad scheduled for November 2, with Justice Aminuddin telling him that the CB will listen to his arguments towards the end of the proceedings. Justice Mandokhail remarked, “You may present your arguments after returning […] We will also be fresh.” Subsequently, Advocate Bhandari came to the rostrum and said he will present his arguments on the “current value” of the 26th Amendment. However, Justice Mandokhail directed him to inform the court which bench could hear the case before presenting his main arguments. Bhandari noted the bench’s “concern” that Article 191A , through which the CB was introduced in the apex court, was in place. “The bench considers that Article 191A bars it from referring the matter to a full court.” Here, Justice Hassan told the SIC lawyer to detail what constitutes a full court. Justice Mandokhail quipped that the CB wanted to know whether a full court would be “formed on wishes or as per the law”. Bhandari responded that it will be according to the law. He added that “full courts are never formed; they always exist”, echoing the stances taken by lawyers Munir A. Malik and Dr Adnan Khan . Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Bhandari whether a full court was a “precedent” and had not been defined in the Constitution, the counsel contended that a full court’s definition was stated in Article 176 (constitution of SC). Noting that the question now was who would form the full court, Bhandari argued that the current CB could issue orders for it, which would be “binding on all persons”. Justice Mazhar then again raised a question mulled repeatedly in recent hearings: “How can Article 191A, due to which this bench was constituted, be ignored?” Bhandari replied, “Even when the authority is taken away from one court, it still has the authority to send [the case] to the competent court.” Justice Mazhar reiterated that the foundations of the CB were provided under Article 191A, adding that the lawyer was arguing to “ignore” that provision. Justice Hassan also remarked, “You are making us ignore Article 191A, but also want this bench to pass an order.” At this, Bhandari stressed, “I have not requested to suspend the 26th Constitutional Amendment in my petition. If the Amendment is suspended, then you all would not be even able to hear any case.” Justice Mazhar once again observed that he and other judges were part of the current CB under Article 191A, asking rhetorically how the provision could be disregarded. Addressing Bhandari, Justice Hassan noted, “If Article 191A is ignored, then that would amount to granting you final relief.” The SIC council contended that the court had to decide “whether Article 191A is valid or not”. Justice Mazhar responded that the provision — introduced under the same Amendment that is under challenge — is “valid, which is why it is a part of the Constitution”. Justice Afghan then observed, “The question is what forum can declare Article 191A right or wrong.” Bhandari answered the judge, saying that the SC had the jurisdiction to hear the case. “This would amount to suspending the 26th Amendment,” Justice Aminuddin remarked. Bhandari said he would first “remove the obstacle of Article 191A in front of him”. “Only the lordships in the bench are consistently raising this question. The ladyships have not asked any question,” he said. “The ladies have understood the matter,” Justice Hilali quipped. Justice Mandokhail added, “The women judges are sharper than me.” At this point, Justice Ayesha observed that Article 191A was not taking away someone else’s powers, but was vesting them in the SC. “No jurisdiction has been taken away anywhere,” she asserted. Bhandari then recalled that once a former United States judge was asked why a full court hears all cases, to which the judge responded that the jurisdiction lay with the US top court, not with the benches. Justice Mandokhail then remarked, “The Supreme Court has given the powers to the benches.” In response, the lawyer contended that every judge belonged to the SC and had “judicial powers”. The hearing was then adjourned till November 10, with Bhandari set to continue his arguments. Commenting on the proceedings, Barrister Asad Rahim Khan pointed out on X that Article 191A “says not a word” on a full court. “And even if it did, the entire point of this case is to determine whether the amendment, which includes [Article] 191A, was legal and constitutional. “Why already presume its permanency — that it must remain unquestioned?” he asked. “By that logic, the SC should never have convened a full court to hear challenges to the 18th, 19th, 21st Amendments either. Art. 175(3) had been amended by the 21st to exclude the SC altogether. But it did anyway, because the core issue — their validity — remained unresolved.” Requests for full court Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan , Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s ( BHCBA ) counsel Munir A. Malik , Afrasiab Khattak’s counsel Khwaja Ahmed Hosain, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Other lawyers have also presented arguments for a 24-member full court based on judges present in the SC currently, including six who were appointed after the Amendment. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners. The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request . The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself. The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",

Justice Mandokhail added, “The women judges are sharper than me.” At this point, Justice Ayesha observed that Article 191A was not taking away someone else’s powers, but was vesting them in the SC. “No jurisdiction has been taken away anywhere,” she asserted. Bhandari then recalled that once a former United States judge was asked why a full court hears all cases, to which the judge responded that the jurisdiction lay with the US top court, not with the benches. Justice Mandokhail then remarked, “The Supreme Court has given the powers to the benches.” In response, the lawyer contended that every judge belonged to the SC and had “judicial powers”. The hearing was then adjourned till November 10, with Bhandari set to continue his arguments. Commenting on the proceedings, Barrister Asad Rahim Khan pointed out on X that Article 191A “says not a word” on a full court. “And even if it did, the entire point of this case is to determine whether the amendment, which includes [Article] 191A, was legal and constitutional. “Why already presume its permanency — that it must remain unquestioned?” he asked. “By that logic, the SC should never have convened a full court to hear challenges to the 18th, 19th, 21st Amendments either. Art. 175(3) had been amended by the 21st to exclude the SC altogether. But it did anyway, because the core issue — their validity — remained unresolved.” Requests for full court Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan , Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s ( BHCBA ) counsel Munir A. Malik , Afrasiab Khattak’s counsel Khwaja Ahmed Hosain, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Other lawyers have also presented arguments for a 24-member full court based on judges present in the SC currently, including six who were appointed after the Amendment. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners. The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request . The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself. The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",
      "title": "26th Amendment case: Justice Shahid Hassan says ignoring Article 191A akin to granting final relief",
      "summary": "Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan on Thursday remarked that ignoring Article 191A through which the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB) was formed under the 26th Amendment would amount to granting the petitioners “final relief”. Justice Hassan’s observation came as an eight-member CB heard over three dozen petitions against the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year. The PTI claimed seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate , with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment . The hearing Advocate Uzair Bhandari, counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), began his arguments today. The hearing was adjourned till November 10, with Justice Aminuddin Khan saying that a later date would be fixed for the hearing if the bench was not available that day. Justice Aminuddin is heading the bench hearing the case. It also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan and Hassan. At the outset of the hearing, retired Justice Shahid Jamil Khan, a former judge of the Lahore High Court who resigned four years before his superannuation, came to the rostrum. Justice Mandokhail asked Jamil whether he had a separate petition against the 26th Amendment, to which the latter replied that his client has requested for the “implementation of the Practice and Procedure Committee’s decision”. The former judge informed the court that he had a visit abroad scheduled for November 2, with Justice Aminuddin telling him that the CB will listen to his arguments towards the end of the proceedings. Justice Mandokhail remarked, “You may present your arguments after returning […] We will also be fresh.” Subsequently, Advocate Bhandari came to the rostrum and said he will present his arguments on the “current value” of the 26th Amendment. However, Justice Mandokhail directed him to inform the court which bench could hear the case before presenting his main arguments. Bhandari noted the bench’s “concern” that Article 191A , through which the CB was introduced in the apex court, was in place. “The bench considers that Article 191A bars it from referring the matter to a full court.” Here, Justice Hassan told the SIC lawyer to detail what constitutes a full court. Justice Mandokhail quipped that the CB wanted to know whether a full court would be “formed on wishes or as per the law”. Bhandari responded that it will be according to the law. He added that “full courts are never formed; they always exist”, echoing the stances taken by lawyers Munir A. Malik and Dr Adnan Khan . Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Bhandari whether a full court was a “precedent” and had not been defined in the Constitution, the counsel contended that a full court’s definition was stated in Article 176 (constitution of SC). Noting that the question now was who would form the full court, Bhandari argued that the current CB could issue orders for it, which would be “binding on all persons”. Justice Mazhar then again raised a question mulled repeatedly in recent hearings: “How can Article 191A, due to which this bench was constituted, be ignored?” Bhandari replied, “Even when the authority is taken away from one court, it still has the authority to send [the case] to the competent court.” Justice Mazhar reiterated that the foundations of the CB were provided under Article 191A, adding that the lawyer was arguing to “ignore” that provision. Justice Hassan also remarked, “You are making us ignore Article 191A, but also want this bench to pass an order.” At this, Bhandari stressed, “I have not requested to suspend the 26th Constitutional Amendment in my petition. If the Amendment is suspended, then you all would not be even able to hear any case.” Justice Mazhar once again observed that he and other judges were part of the current CB under Article 191A, asking rhetorically how the provision could be disregarded. Addressing Bhandari, Justice Hassan noted, “If Article 191A is ignored, then that would amount to granting you final relief.” The SIC council contended that the court had to decide “whether Article 191A is valid or not”. Justice Mazhar responded that the provision — introduced under the same Amendment that is under challenge — is “valid, which is why it is a part of the Constitution”. Justice Afghan then observed, “The question is what forum can declare Article 191A right or wrong.” Bhandari answered the judge, saying that the SC had the jurisdiction to hear the case. “This would amount to suspending the 26th Amendment,” Justice Aminuddin remarked. Bhandari said he would first “remove the obstacle of Article 191A in front of him”. “Only the lordships in the bench are consistently raising this question. The ladyships have not asked any question,” he said. “The ladies have understood the matter,” Justice Hilali quipped. Justice Mandokhail added, “The women judges are sharper than me.” At this point, Justice Ayesha observed that Article 191A was not taking away someone else’s powers, but was vesting them in the SC. “No jurisdiction has been taken away anywhere,” she asserted.

      "title_orig": "Adiala jail superintendent directed to implement earlier IHC order allowing Imran twice-a-week meetings",
      "summary_orig": "The Islamabad High Court on Thursday directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement a March 24 order that reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for former prime minister Imran Khan. The directive came as a larger bench , led by Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and including Justices Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Muhammad Azam Khan, collectively took up all 11 petitions filed by PTI leaders regarding Imran’s jail visitation. The ex-premier’s family and party have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “ sabotaging ” meetings with him. Today, the IHC directed Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum, who was present during the hearing, to allow Imran’s jail meetings, as per the earlier order, while abiding by standard operating procedures (SOPs). It directed the jail official to facilitate the meetings as per the lists provided by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who also attended the proceedings. Raja and Anjum traded barbs during the hearing as the PTI leader claimed that “not even once” was the earlier IHC order implemented despite them giving a list of names, while the jail official asserted that “regular meetings” were held, but no list was received. Petitions taken up by the bench included those filed by newly elected Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi , who attended the IHC hearing. Shortly after it concluded, Afridi departed for Adiala jail but later claimed he was denied a meeting with Imran. The PTI later posted a video on its X account of Afridi speaking to the media outside the Adiala jail. Afridi said on the occasion that he would be seeking policy guidelines from Imran during their meeting. “Nothing else is going to take place inside. I have to implement my leader’s policies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He might give me some good advice inside […] There is nothing wrong with us wanting to meet our leader,” he added. A subsequent post reshared by the PTI’s account showed Afridi, along with several others, sitting on the ground. The post stated that they were not being allowed to meet Imran despite court directives. “A symbolic sit-in is under way,” it said. According to a statement later issued by the KP CM Secretariat, “Despite the court’s explicit permission, the chief minister was not allowed to meet his party leader (Imran).” Speaking to media persons outside the Adiala jail, CM Afridi said that the refusal to implement a clear court order reflected not his weakness, but the “helplessness of the judiciary” itself. “If court orders are not being respected, it raises serious questions about the state of justice in the country,” he was quoted as saying. The chief minister stressed that his visit was “purely Constitutional and aimed at seeking guidance from his party leader on key policy matters related to governance” in KP, the statement added. “For the past two years, I have not met my leader. Yesterday’s meeting was important for taking policy direction and moving forward in line with the vision of Imran Khan,” Afridi said. The PTI leader asserted that he had followed every legal and administrative channel — including communications with the Punjab Home Department, the federal government, and the chief justice — before approaching the Islamabad High Court. “Whatever instructions come from Imran Khan, I will implement them in letter and spirit,” CM Afridi asserted. “No cabinet will be formed without the guidance of Imran Khan,” he affirmed. Court did not say to tape our mouths: Salman Raja Punjab Advocate General (AG) Amjad Pervaiz and Islamabad AG Ayaz Shaukat appeared before the court today and presented their arguments on their separate appeals challenging the striking down of the bar on prisoners’ political talks. At one point during the hearing, PTI’s Raja attempted to present his contentions but was stopped by Justice Dogar. The IHC chief justice told the lawyer to let the Punjab government counsel complete his arguments first. Raja said he wanted to assist the court, at which Justice Dogar said the former’s assistance was not needed. Here, Pervaiz referred to the 1992 Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao case , adding that it was held that a notice under Order 27A of the Code of Civil Procedure . Justice Tahir then asked Raja if he wanted to say something, at which the PTI lawyer said he wanted to assist the court. After Pervaiz completed his arguments, a representative from the attorney general’s office informed the court that he was supporting Pervaiz’s stance. In his arguments, Islamabad AG Shaukat said he had raised objections, but they were “dismissed”. At this point, Raja claimed that the March IHC order had not been implemented  “on even one day”. “We give a list of names [for the meeting] repeatedly as per the court order, but those people are not allowed inside [the jail],” he said. He went on to allege, “An outsider is added to the names given in the list.” Anjum, the jail superintendent, then asserted that the PTI leaders “regularly” have meetings with Imran. He further said that the jail administration received no list from Raja. “The court restricted them from speaking to the media after meeting [Imran, but] they speak to the media after coming outside [the jail],” Anjum said. In response, Raja quipped, “The court said not to speak to the media at the [jail] gate; it did not say to tape our mouths. “We are kept a mile away from the Adiala jail, where we speak [to the media],” he added. Subsequently, the court ordered the Adiala jail superintendent to implement the March 24 order that allows Imran to have two meetings per week with visitors, while placing restrictions on the latter’s media interactions. The bench observed that while the PTI leaders were not barred from holding a media talk, they should not speak at the jail’s gate, but rather in a “chamber” or somewhere else later. Raja assured the court that they would not speak at the prison’s gate. IHC suspends order nullifying ban on political talks in jail meetings Among the petitions taken up today were intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the October 2024 order by IHC’s Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan that nullified a ban on political discussions during prisoners’ meetings with visitors. Justice Ishaq had issued the ruling on a plea filed by former PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat. The subsequent ICAs were filed by the Islamabad chief commissioner and the Punjab government, and were taken up by a division bench in November 2024, according to APP . The IHC then suspended the single-bench order that had ended the ban on political discussions. As the Punjab AG began his arguments, his Islamabad counterpart informed the court that he had earlier objected that the Punjab and Islamabad AGs had not been issued notices in the case. Justice Tahir wondered whether it was mandatory to issue a notice to the AG as well, along with the attorney general. Pervaiz cited past Supreme Court orders in response, contending that following the said procedure was necessary. Responding to a question by Justice Tahir, the Punjab AG replied that the jail rules had been in place since 1984, with no amendments made since then. On Justice Dogar’s directives, the Punjab AG read out his writ petition. Justice Tahir asked the counsel whether notices were issued to the attorney general, to which the Islamabad AG replied that neither the attorney general nor the advocate general was notified. Pervaiz stated that even the Punjab government had not been made a party in the petition, but was made later on through a notice to its AG. “The Punjab government was not made a respondent in a proper manner.” At this point, Justice Tahir then sought reasons for the single-member bench declaring the rules regarding political conversations illegal. Pervaiz responded that the decision was made based on various grounds, including contradictions with Article 19 (freedom of expression) of the Constitution. According to Rule 265 (letters and interviews) of the Pakistan Prison Rules 1978 , the “discussion of political matters shall not be allowed” during a prisoner’s meeting, and letters also “shall not contain any reference” to politics. During his incarceration so far, Imran has written multiple letters to the chief justices of Pakistan, as well as three “ open letters ” addressed to the army chief. The ex-premier had also purportedly authored an essay published by The Economist in January 2024, just a month before the general elections. When the Punjab AG cited past rulings to argue that issuing notices to the relevant attorney general was necessary for striking down a law, Justice Dogar observed that the laws Pervaiz was referring to were for under-trial suspects. “The suspended rules were not even the federal rules,” Pervaiz said, adding that the laws fell within the Punjab government’s jurisdiction after the 18th Amendment. Aleema signs warrants, but not arrested At one point during the hearing, Rawalpindi police also made an appearance to have Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum sign a non-bailable arrest warrant issued for her in a case pertaining to the PTI’s November 26 protest . After City Police Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Azhar Shah received Aleema’s signature on her arrest warrant, the police departed without arresting her. Yesterday, a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court issued show-cause notices to two police of­­ficers for submitting a “fabricated” report claiming that Aleema had gone into hiding.",

The PTI later posted a video on its X account of Afridi speaking to the media outside the Adiala jail. Afridi said on the occasion that he would be seeking policy guidelines from Imran during their meeting. “Nothing else is going to take place inside. I have to implement my leader’s policies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He might give me some good advice inside […] There is nothing wrong with us wanting to meet our leader,” he added. A subsequent post reshared by the PTI’s account showed Afridi, along with several others, sitting on the ground. The post stated that they were not being allowed to meet Imran despite court directives. “A symbolic sit-in is under way,” it said. According to a statement later issued by the KP CM Secretariat, “Despite the court’s explicit permission, the chief minister was not allowed to meet his party leader (Imran).” Speaking to media persons outside the Adiala jail, CM Afridi said that the refusal to implement a clear court order reflected not his weakness, but the “helplessness of the judiciary” itself. “If court orders are not being respected, it raises serious questions about the state of justice in the country,” he was quoted as saying. The chief minister stressed that his visit was “purely Constitutional and aimed at seeking guidance from his party leader on key policy matters related to governance” in KP, the statement added. “For the past two years, I have not met my leader. Yesterday’s meeting was important for taking policy direction and moving forward in line with the vision of Imran Khan,” Afridi said. The PTI leader asserted that he had followed every legal and administrative channel — including communications with the Punjab Home Department, the federal government, and the chief justice — before approaching the Islamabad High Court. “Whatever instructions come from Imran Khan, I will implement them in letter and spirit,” CM Afridi asserted. “No cabinet will be formed without the guidance of Imran Khan,” he affirmed. Court did not say to tape our mouths: Salman Raja Punjab Advocate General (AG) Amjad Pervaiz and Islamabad AG Ayaz Shaukat appeared before the court today and presented their arguments on their separate appeals challenging the striking down of the bar on prisoners’ political talks. At one point during the hearing, PTI’s Raja attempted to present his contentions but was stopped by Justice Dogar. The IHC chief justice told the lawyer to let the Punjab government counsel complete his arguments first. Raja said he wanted to assist the court, at which Justice Dogar said the former’s assistance was not needed. Here, Pervaiz referred to the 1992 Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao case , adding that it was held that a notice under Order 27A of the Code of Civil Procedure . Justice Tahir then asked Raja if he wanted to say something, at which the PTI lawyer said he wanted to assist the court. After Pervaiz completed his arguments, a representative from the attorney general’s office informed the court that he was supporting Pervaiz’s stance. In his arguments, Islamabad AG Shaukat said he had raised objections, but they were “dismissed”. At this point, Raja claimed that the March IHC order had not been implemented  “on even one day”. “We give a list of names [for the meeting] repeatedly as per the court order, but those people are not allowed inside [the jail],” he said. He went on to allege, “An outsider is added to the names given in the list.” Anjum, the jail superintendent, then asserted that the PTI leaders “regularly” have meetings with Imran. He further said that the jail administration received no list from Raja. “The court restricted them from speaking to the media after meeting [Imran, but] they speak to the media after coming outside [the jail],” Anjum said. In response, Raja quipped, “The court said not to speak to the media at the [jail] gate; it did not say to tape our mouths. “We are kept a mile away from the Adiala jail, where we speak [to the media],” he added. Subsequently, the court ordered the Adiala jail superintendent to implement the March 24 order that allows Imran to have two meetings per week with visitors, while placing restrictions on the latter’s media interactions. The bench observed that while the PTI leaders were not barred from holding a media talk, they should not speak at the jail’s gate, but rather in a “chamber” or somewhere else later. Raja assured the court that they would not speak at the prison’s gate. IHC suspends order nullifying ban on political talks in jail meetings Among the petitions taken up today were intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the October 2024 order by IHC’s Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan that nullified a ban on political discussions during prisoners’ meetings with visitors. Justice Ishaq had issued the ruling on a plea filed by former PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat. The subsequent ICAs were filed by the Islamabad chief commissioner and the Punjab government, and were taken up by a division bench in November 2024, according to APP . The IHC then suspended the single-bench order that had ended the ban on political discussions. As the Punjab AG began his arguments, his Islamabad counterpart informed the court that he had earlier objected that the Punjab and Islamabad AGs had not been issued notices in the case. Justice Tahir wondered whether it was mandatory to issue a notice to the AG as well, along with the attorney general. Pervaiz cited past Supreme Court orders in response, contending that following the said procedure was necessary. Responding to a question by Justice Tahir, the Punjab AG replied that the jail rules had been in place since 1984, with no amendments made since then. On Justice Dogar’s directives, the Punjab AG read out his writ petition. Justice Tahir asked the counsel whether notices were issued to the attorney general, to which the Islamabad AG replied that neither the attorney general nor the advocate general was notified. Pervaiz stated that even the Punjab government had not been made a party in the petition, but was made later on through a notice to its AG. “The Punjab government was not made a respondent in a proper manner.” At this point, Justice Tahir then sought reasons for the single-member bench declaring the rules regarding political conversations illegal. Pervaiz responded that the decision was made based on various grounds, including contradictions with Article 19 (freedom of expression) of the Constitution. According to Rule 265 (letters and interviews) of the Pakistan Prison Rules 1978 , the “discussion of political matters shall not be allowed” during a prisoner’s meeting, and letters also “shall not contain any reference” to politics. During his incarceration so far, Imran has written multiple letters to the chief justices of Pakistan, as well as three “ open letters ” addressed to the army chief. The ex-premier had also purportedly authored an essay published by The Economist in January 2024, just a month before the general elections. When the Punjab AG cited past rulings to argue that issuing notices to the relevant attorney general was necessary for striking down a law, Justice Dogar observed that the laws Pervaiz was referring to were for under-trial suspects. “The suspended rules were not even the federal rules,” Pervaiz said, adding that the laws fell within the Punjab government’s jurisdiction after the 18th Amendment. Aleema signs warrants, but not arrested At one point during the hearing, Rawalpindi police also made an appearance to have Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum sign a non-bailable arrest warrant issued for her in a case pertaining to the PTI’s November 26 protest . After City Police Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Azhar Shah received Aleema’s signature on her arrest warrant, the police departed without arresting her. Yesterday, a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court issued show-cause notices to two police of­­ficers for submitting a “fabricated” report claiming that Aleema had gone into hiding.",
      "title": "Adiala jail superintendent directed to implement earlier IHC order allowing Imran twice-a-week meetings",
      "summary": "The Islamabad High Court on Thursday directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement a March 24 order that reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for former prime minister Imran Khan. The directive came as a larger bench , led by Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and including Justices Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Muhammad Azam Khan, collectively took up all 11 petitions filed by PTI leaders regarding Imran’s jail visitation. The ex-premier’s family and party have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “ sabotaging ” meetings with him. Today, the IHC directed Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum, who was present during the hearing, to allow Imran’s jail meetings, as per the earlier order, while abiding by standard operating procedures (SOPs). It directed the jail official to facilitate the meetings as per the lists provided by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who also attended the proceedings. Raja and Anjum traded barbs during the hearing as the PTI leader claimed that “not even once” was the earlier IHC order implemented despite them giving a list of names, while the jail official asserted that “regular meetings” were held, but no list was received. Petitions taken up by the bench included those filed by newly elected Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi , who attended the IHC hearing.

Border crossings between the two countries have remained closed since October 11, following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600-km frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.

      "summary_orig": "The Sindh Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Thursday claimed to have arrested two suspects — linked to the outlawed Zainebiyoun Brigade — in connection with the killing of an Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) worker, as well as another sectarian killing in Karachi. The militant group Zainebiyoun Brigade was added to the list of proscribed organisations in June of last year. It has also been designated by the US State Department as a terrorist organisation since 2019. ASWJ, also an outlawed group, has seen a spate of attacks in recent times in Karachi. On October 20, an ASWJ worker was shot dead in the city’s Nangan Chowrangi area. Earlier this month, another worker was killed in a suspected targeted attack on main University Road. Speaking at a press conference today, Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) CTD Azfar Mahesar said that the “counter-terror force of police and a federal intelligence agency jointly carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO) and arrested two suspects linked with the Zainebiyoun Brigade.” The suspects “were involved in recent terrorism cases linked with sectarianism in Karachi,” the DIG CTD claimed. “The suspects confessed they had carried out the targeted killing of Qari Anas on Main University Road in Gulistan-i-Jauhar near Samama Shopping Centre recently,” the CTD official said. The suspects also revealed that they had killed Qari Abdul Rehman in Sherpao Colony in May 2025 on “sectarian grounds,” added the counter-terror force official. One of the suspects’ names was also included in the Red Book, CTD Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Irfan Ali Bahadur told Dawn.com , adding that he was a resident of Karachi and had been associated with the “Mehdi Force” of Sipah Mohammad Pakistan. “He had come to Karachi recently after fleeing to a neighbouring country,” SSP Bahadur said. He was also involved in an armed attack on the caravan of the central leader of the banned ASWJ, Maulana Aurangzeb Farooqi, in Gulshan-i-Iqbal in 2012, the CTD official said. “The other suspect hailed from Gilgit and had come to Karachi only eight months ago for the targeted killings”, SSP Bahadur said. SSP Bahadur also clarified that the suspects were not involved in the recent ASWJ attack near Nangan Chowrangi. The two members of the outlawed Zainebiyoun Brigade were planning attacks to further the group’s interests in Karachi, as per DIG Mahesar. CTD personnel recovered two 9mm pistols and two hand grenades from the arrested suspects, police said. According to DIG Mahesar, the suspects also disclosed that they had “foreign links” while the outfit’s main leader lives in a “neighbouring country” from where they received financial assistance, as well as a list of targets. However, he did not disclose the name of the neighbouring country. “The suspects revealed that their fellow accomplices were also involved in killings linked with sectarianism in the provincial capital,” DIG Mahesar said, adding that “concerted efforts are underway to arrest them.” “The suspects and their facilitators involved in recent targeted killings in Karachi have been identified,” declared the CTD DIG, adding that teams have been formed for their arrest, and expected a “breakthrough” soon.",

      "title_orig": "KP asks Punjab to withdraw ‘restrictive measures’ on inter-provincial movement of wheat",
      "summary_orig": "The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government has requested that the Punjab government withdraw “restrictive measures” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and wheat products, citing a “sharp escalation” in the prices of the essential commodity in the province. The development comes a day after the KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the Punjab’s “move” to restrict the transportation of wheat and flour to KP while chairing a meeting. The KP CM termed the move “a blatant violation of the Constitution and an attack on the rights of KP citizens,” and directed food authorities to write a letter to relevant bodies in Punjab. In the aftermath of floods, the Punjab government began tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage. In a letter addressed to secretary price control & commodities management department, Punjab, the KP food department said, “It is earnestly requested to take urgent and decisive action to ensure immediate withdrawal of all restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat”. The letter added that the current situation was “inconsistent” with Article 151(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees that “freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country”. “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, being a wheat-deficient province, heavily relies on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its daily wheat requirement of approximately 14,500 metric tonnes,” the letter read. “The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices.” The food department stressed that the province was affected by the restrictions “disproportionately, with the steepest surge in wheat and flour prices compared to other provinces”. It welcomed the “recent permission for transportation of 2,000 metric tonnes of flour to KP through a permit system,” but noted that it was the measure was “insufficient.” The letter continued: “Despite repeated communications from the Chief Secretary, Secretary Food and Director Food, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, to counterparts, the restrictive measures continue to remain in force. “As a result, the province is now witnessing acute shortages and unprecedented price escalation in [the] wheat market.” It added that the Flour Mills Association of KP has also “repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist.” The KP food department recalled that the matter also came under discussion during Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif’s meeting about the Wheat Policy 2025-26. During the meeting — held last week — the premier had directed that there should be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to ensure its availability across the country. The food department detailed that the price of 100 kgs of wheat before the movement restrictions, on August 13, in Peshawar, was Rs6,175. However, after the restrictions, it rose to Rs7,725 on August 28, and it stands at  Rs10,675 as of October 22. Meanwhile, in Karachi, the price was reported to be Rs9,975, in Lahore, Rs9,375. In Rawalpindi, it was Rs9,600, and Rs10,000 in Quetta as of October 22. CM KP, in his remarks at the meeting yesterday, had said that “hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of basic necessities was unacceptable”. Officials from the food department informed the meeting that KP’s annual wheat and flour consumption was approximately 5.3 million metric tonnes, of which only 1.5m metric tons were produced locally. The remaining requirement, according to the statement, was met through supplies from Punjab and other provinces. Punjab’s restrictions on the interprovincial movement of wheat have drawn sharp criticism from politicians and flour millers who argue it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement. While Punjab officials de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. Critics, however, argued that these mea­sures are against the spirit of a deregulated market.",

      "summary_orig": "Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar hailed the visit of his Polish counterpart to Pakistan on Thursday as “significant”, saying that during the delegation-level talks, the two sides had agreed to expand bilateral cooperation. “During the delegation-level talks, Minister Sikorski and I took stock of the Pakistan-Poland bilateral ties, which continue to develop on a very positive trajectory. We have over a billion-dollar bilateral trade and both sides agreed that there remains immense untapped potential to further expand trade and economic cooperation. “We agreed to expand bilateral cooperation in trade, energy, infrastructure, defence, counter-terrorism, science and technology and education,” Dar said during a joint press conference with Poland’s Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, who landed in Islamabad today on a two-day official visit. Dar also announced that the foreign ministries of the two countries had signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) that envisioned regular bilateral consultations, which he said aimed at further enhancing cooperation between the two sides. Moreover, he said an MoU had also been signed on cooperation between the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad and the Polish Institute of International Affairs. At the outset of the press conference, Dar welcomed his Polish counterpart, mentioning that this was his second visit to Pakistan, the last being in 2011. Moreover, he said, Sikorski was “no stranger in this part of the world”, having served as a war correspondent in the region during 1980s. Dar underlined that Pakistan attached great importance to its ties with Poland. “Poland’s struggle for freedom and independence is exemplary,” he said, further stating that Pakistan and Poland shared a “unique historical connection”. “During World War II, thousands of Polish refugees found shelter in present-day Pakistan i.e. in Karachi and Quetta.” He also recalled and lauded the role of Polish pilots and engineers in laying the foundation of the Pakistan Air Force. Dar continued that with this shared historical context, Pakistan viewed Poland as an important partner, bilaterally, as well as in the European Union. “We rejoice the economic progress Poland has made to now become a trillion-dollar economy,” he said, further congratulating the European country on the “successful and smooth presidential election and for its it able stewardship of the European Union ”. FM Dar further said that during the talks today, the two sides had exchanged views on major regional and global issues, including the security situation in South Asia, Afghanistan, Europe and the Middle East. “I apprised the foreign minister of our concerns regarding unprovoked Indian aggression and Pakistan’s principled position on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, advocating for the resolution according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people and in line with UN Security Council resolutions. “We also discussed the recent excess of the Taliban regime. Presence of Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan elements on Afghan soil and their continued attacks against Pakistan remain our top concerns.” Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan are terms designated by the state for the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and terrorist organisations in Balochistan, respectively. Dar said he had emphasised the need for “strengthening multilateralism and consistent adherence to the fundamental principles of the UN Charter to address the existing and emerging international challenges in an effective and credible manner”. Concluding his speech, he said Sikorski’s visit to Pakistan was a “significant milestone” in relations between the two countries, saying, “Today, we reaffirm our resolve to transform these relations into a comprehensive and mutually beneficial partnership.” After Dar, the Polish foreign minister began his speech by thanking Dar for “reminding us of the shared historical legacy” between the two countries. He confirmed that the two sides had agreed to renew the MoU between their foreign ministries to “facilitate better coordination”. He also welcomed the signing of an MoU between think tanks in the two countries. Moving on to talks between the two sides, he said, “We have covered a broad range of issues, from bilateral economic ties […] to regional issues and global governance. “During the talks with Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, I presented a […] offer of more intense bilateral collaborations in the fields of trade, public finances, fintech and water management. We also discussed further collaboration in the mining and the energy sector, building on the success of such engagements as the Polish Oil and Gas Company exploring natural in Pakistan. This, I believe, has huge potential for the future.” Sikorski further said that the Pakistani diaspora in Poland had been growing over the past few years. “It is still quite small, around 2,000 people, but I am glad to say a quarter of them are students. We are happy that Polish universities are popular among young, talented people from Pakistan, and we hope that their experience and impressions that they gather in Poland serve as a basis for actual people-to-people diplomacy. “So Poland remains open to legal migration, and for real studies for real students. But I want to emphasise that there is zero tolerance for illegal migration to Polish territory, which is simultaneously the EU territory.” He said for several years, Poland’s neighbours, Russia and Belarus “have been trying to help people smugglers breach our border, exploiting people, exploiting tragic situations and using them as a tool of hybrid warfare and putting them under unnecessary risk. And Poland had to respond. Polish border are now some of the best protected borders of the EU”. He also said Poland and Pakistan shared a “common perspective on sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. This principle holds particular significance in our region in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Recent Russian violations of the Polish airspace — and you know a thing or two about that around here — is an outrageous and unprecedented miliatry provocation. It is new stage of Russian attempts to destabilise the situation in our part of Europe,” he said. The foreign minister added that “Poland remains steadfast in its support of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine, and welcomes all efforts towards achieving such a peace. It should be based on the UN Charter and international law”. On Gaza, he said “we root for peace” there. “Poland has recognised Palestine for decades, and we believe there should be a two-state solution for the two ancient peoples of the Middle East to live in dignity and peace with each other”. Concluding his speech, FM Sikorski underlined that Poland was also interested in a “stable and prosperous South Asia”. “We welcome all the efforts of Pakistan, both regional and globally, that help to achieve this aim.” Polish FM lands in Islamabad Earlier today, the Foreign Office said in a post social media platform X that “Deputy prime minister/foreign minister of Poland, His Excellency Radosław Sikorski, [had] arrived in Islamabad today for a two-day official visit”. The FO added that Sikorski was received by the additional secretary for Europe, the Polish ambassador and other senior officials. Later, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received Sikorski at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “The two leaders held a tête-à-tête meeting and exchanged views on matters of mutual interest,” the FO said. A day earlier, the FO had stated that the Polish minister would be paying an official visit to Islamabad at Dar’s invitation. “This will be minister Sikorski’s second official visit to Pakistan; his previous visit took place in 2011,” the statement said. During the visit, Dar and Sikorski will hold a one-on-one meeting as well as delegation-level talks. “The two sides are expected to discuss the full spectrum of bilateral relations,” the FO said, adding that the talks would be followed by a joint press stakeout. The FO said that Sikorski’s visit marked a “significant milestone in Pakistan-Poland relations” and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to enhancing cooperation with Warsaw “for the mutual benefit of both countries”. In July, Pakistan and Poland had agreed to enhance collaboration via high-level visits, parliamentary interactions and dialogue, during the 9th round of Bilateral Political Consultations between the two countries held in Warsaw. At these consultations, regional and global issues of mutual interest were also discussed, including developments in South Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. It was mutually agreed that the next round of consultations would be held in Islamabad in 2026.",

      "summary_orig": "Nearly 700 foreigners, including Pakistanis, have fled Myanmar and crossed into Thailand, the Thai army said on Thursday, following a military operation against the Chinese-backed KK Park, a notorious cybercrime compound. Thailand has detained 677 people, including 618 men and 59 women, after they crossed the border into Tak province, it said in a statement. Myanmar’s military has taken control of KK Park and is inspecting the area, driving a large number of people into Thailand, the statement said. The people are now undergoing legal procedures and screening, and Thai authorities have also made additional detention facilities available in case existing spaces become insufficient, the army said. “All actions are in line with legal and humanitarian principles,” it said, adding that it was working closely with local security agencies to maintain order along the Thai-Myanmar border. The group consists primarily of individuals from India and China, with smaller numbers from Vietnam, Pakistan, Indonesia and several other countries, the army said. Myanmar’s KK Park is a notorious enclave known to international law enforcement and diplomats for its involvement in cyberscams. KK Park’s sprawling compound and others nearby are run primarily by Chinese criminal gangs and guarded by local militia groups aligned to Myanmar’s military. Border areas between Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia have become hubs for online fraud since the Covid-19 pandemic, and the United Nations says billions of dollars have been earned from the trafficking of hundreds of thousands of people forced to work in scam compounds. The sprawling compounds, where internet fraudsters target people with romance and business cons, have thrived along Myanmar’s loosely governed border during its civil war, sparked by a 2021 coup. A highly publicised crackdown starting in February saw around 7,000 workers repatriated and Thailand enact a cross-border internet blockade. But an AFP investigation this month revealed construction has continued apace at several compounds, while Starlink internet service receivers have been installed en masse, seeming to connect the hubs to the Elon Musk-owned satellite network. Sawanit Suriyakul Na Ayutthaya, deputy governor of Tak province on the Myanmar border, told AFP that “677 people fled from the scam centre“ across the Moei river into Thailand as of Thursday morning. Another crowd of more than 100 people gathered on the Myanmar side of the main local border crossing to Thailand early Thursday, an AFP journalist saw, many carrying large suitcases and backpacks. A driver in the area, speaking anonymously for security reasons, estimated 700 people had made illegal overnight crossings. While some scam workers are clearly trafficked into often fortified compounds, experts say others go voluntarily with hopes of earning more in the multibillion-dollar illicit industry than they can at home. Sawanit said immigration police and the military had provided assistance “under humanitarian procedures”. Those who crossed “will undergo screening” to determine whether they have been victims of human trafficking or if they may be prosecuted for crossing the border illegally, he said. The Tak Provincial Administration office, which oversees the area, said in a statement that the group entering from Myanmar comprised “foreign nationals” — both men and women — and authorities expected more to cross into Thailand. Indonesian state news agency Antara reported around 20 Indonesians had “successfully crossed into Thai territory via the Moei River” as of Wednesday evening, according to the Indonesian embassy in Yangon, which cited Thai authorities. Conned out of billions Experts say Myanmar’s military has long turned a blind eye to scam centres which profit its militia allies, crucial collaborators in their fight against rebels. The junta has also faced pressure to shut down scam operations from its military backer China, irked at the number of its citizens both participating in and being targeted by the scams. But military crackdowns on scam hubs are likely token efforts organised in cahoots with allied militias in an attempt to appease China without badly denting profits, analysts say. “Because of the news it became a need for our organisation to resolve it carefully,” said Saw Tin Win, a senior figure in the most powerful local militia. “There is pressure from the military, so we warned people not to continue bad things,” he added, a Myanmar media outlet reported on Wednesday evening. The transnational scam industry has ballooned in Southeast Asia in recent years, with thousands of scammers estimated to be involved. Victims in the wider region were conned out of up to $37bn in 2023, according to a UN report, which said global losses were likely “much larger”. Thailand’s Anti-Money Laundering Office seized assets worth 70 million baht ($2.1m) from Cambodian senator and tycoon Ly Yong Phat as part of an investigation into scam centres and his businesses, a senior police official told local media on Wednesday. The US government sanctioned Ly Yong Phat last year for alleged abuses related to human trafficking in scam centres. Thailand’s deputy finance minister Vorapak Tanyawong resigned on Wednesday following allegations linking him to Cambodian cyberscam operations.

      "summary_en": "Nearly 700 foreigners, including Pakistanis, have fled Myanmar and crossed into Thailand, the Thai army said on Thursday, following a military operation against the Chinese-backed KK Park, a notorious cybercrime compound. Thailand has detained 677 people, including 618 men and 59 women, after they crossed the border into Tak province, it said in a statement. Myanmar’s military has taken control of KK Park and is inspecting the area, driving a large number of people into Thailand, the statement said. The people are now undergoing legal procedures and screening, and Thai authorities have also made additional detention facilities available in case existing spaces become insufficient, the army said. “All actions are in line with legal and humanitarian principles,” it said, adding that it was working closely with local security agencies to maintain order along the Thai-Myanmar border. The group consists primarily of individuals from India and China, with smaller numbers from Vietnam, Pakistan, Indonesia and several other countries, the army said. Myanmar’s KK Park is a notorious enclave known to international law enforcement and diplomats for its involvement in cyberscams. KK Park’s sprawling compound and others nearby are run primarily by Chinese criminal gangs and guarded by local militia groups aligned to Myanmar’s military. Border areas between Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia have become hubs for online fraud since the Covid-19 pandemic, and the United Nations says billions of dollars have been earned from the trafficking of hundreds of thousands of people forced to work in scam compounds. The sprawling compounds, where internet fraudsters target people with romance and business cons, have thrived along Myanmar’s loosely governed border during its civil war, sparked by a 2021 coup. A highly publicised crackdown starting in February saw around 7,000 workers repatriated and Thailand enact a cross-border internet blockade. But an AFP investigation this month revealed construction has continued apace at several compounds, while Starlink internet service receivers have been installed en masse, seeming to connect the hubs to the Elon Musk-owned satellite network. Sawanit Suriyakul Na Ayutthaya, deputy governor of Tak province on the Myanmar border, told AFP that “677 people fled from the scam centre“ across the Moei river into Thailand as of Thursday morning. Another crowd of more than 100 people gathered on the Myanmar side of the main local border crossing to Thailand early Thursday, an AFP journalist saw, many carrying large suitcases and backpacks. A driver in the area, speaking anonymously for security reasons, estimated 700 people had made illegal overnight crossings. While some scam workers are clearly trafficked into often fortified compounds, experts say others go voluntarily with hopes of earning more in the multibillion-dollar illicit industry than they can at home.

      "summary_orig": "The climate crisis in Pakistan over the years has exacerbated to the extent that it has become the new norm, with floods impacting cities, livelihoods and homes of millions of people in the country. In 2025 alone, Pakistan experienced devastating floods, with an estimated 4.2 million people affected in Punjab, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). As the floodwaters rose, however, a parallel crisis emerged online. In response to the floods,  many Pakistanis turned to digital technologies for weather updates, relief efforts and communicating with communities affected by the floods. At the same time, in response to this reliance on updates from digital platforms, there’s also been a rapid surge in climate change disinformation, intended to sensationalise an already tragic environment and garner more views for spreading confusion. More alarmingly, the surge of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on platforms has largely gone unchecked. This has allowed manufactured information to be widely believed, promoting dangerous narratives online. Millions of Pakistanis affected by floods are turning to social media for help. Instead, they’re finding AI-generated lies: fake geopolitical attacks, sexualised “rescue” videos and fabricated tragedies designed to maximise engagement THE RISE OF MISINFORMATION A recent study by the Lahore-based Digital Rights Foundation (DRF) of which I was a co-author, Combatting Flood Misinformation in Pakistan: Generative AI and Platform Accountability in the Age of Climate Crisis , investigated some of these trends and the kind of misinformation being fuelled on platforms, leading to further polarisation and dangerous narratives being promoted. The report points out how AI is being weaponised in the climate crisis, with viral TikTok visuals portraying India’s release of dam water into overflowing rivers downstream into Pakistani Punjab as a deliberate act of hostility. This AI-generated footage on various social media platforms has been dramatising this narrative, depicting Indian workers maliciously releasing water as a calculated tactic of war. This framing of a natural catastrophe within a singular geopolitical narrative, fuels existing India-Pakistan tensions. More critically, it serves to divert attention from domestic shortcomings in governance, flood management and relief efforts. Such narratives are often pushed by bad-faith actors, seeking to profit from engagement or to advance divisive political agendas, exploiting the climate crisis for their own ends. Today, when 40 per cent of Pakistan’s population remains illiterate and generative AI is becoming more advanced and sophisticated, it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify information online as being disinformation or authentic news, with many falling into the trap of climate disinformation online. The combination of low digital literacy, the inherent realism of AI-generated content and a high-stakes crisis creates a perfect storm for misinformation to thrive. WOMEN AS CLICKBAIT Beyond geopolitical narratives, AI-generated content has also enabled a more insidious form of exploitation: technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including the rise of AI-generated “woman-in-crisis” content. The trend has been seen across multiple platforms, where AI-generated depictions of women are used both to elicit sympathy and to exploit a natural disaster as a vehicle for sexualising women’s bodies. TikTok and Instagram are rife with such videos, showing rural women navigating flooded landscapes, often carrying babies. These clips attract thousands of views, yet only a small fraction carry TikTok’s “AI content” label. Following this theme, users have been seen posting hyper-sexualised depictions of women in flood settings, shifting the focus from the floods to women’s bodies. This sets a dangerous precedent in a context where women already face heightened risks of gender-based violence during disasters in relief camps. Pakistani TikTok and Instagram accounts have also been producing “AI village fetish” content, including videos portraying unconscious women being touched inappropriately under the guise of “rescue”, and bad actors have exploited the floods as another opportunity for engagement. The DRF report uncovered several AI-generated videos depicting women drenched in floodwaters with men groping them under the pretext of saving them. This sexualisation also appears in village-vlog-style videos, where an AI-generated woman ostensibly documents the destruction of her flooded village. Yet the focus of these clips remains on her physical appearance and body rather than the devastation itself. While less explicit, these videos still perpetuate objectification to maximise engagement. Alarmingly, comments on such content show that many older Pakistani users interpret these videos as genuine depictions of women affected by floods, which shows the urgent need for clear and prominent AI labelling. Without such safeguards, misinformation not only distorts reality but also normalises the exploitation of women’s bodies during humanitarian crises. EXPLOITING TRAGEDIES Similarly, AI has also been used to exploit real tragedies, such as an Instagram reel recreating the tragedy that unfolded in Swat in June this year. At least 17 people were caught for hours in the middle of the river after the water suddenly surged, before being swept away and drowning. The entirely AI-generated clip fabricates visuals and overlays screaming voices of the victims. This type of synthetic content is deeply insensitive and dangerous. It has the ability to distort the memory of a real disaster, trivialise the suffering of survivors and spread misinformation among audiences already grappling with fear and grief. This fictionalisation of human tragedy for clicks and engagement not only undermines trust but also risks retraumatising affected communities. PLATFORM ACCOUNTABILITY At this time, while social media platforms are flooded with climate-related misinformation, TikTok remains the only platform to provide cautionary warnings and links to flood-related information for Pakistani users. Although its flood safety guide marked a positive step, the initiative has been limited in scope. TikTok, like many other social media platforms, has failed to adequately address the scale of misinformation, particularly from generative AI content. These platforms do not cater to regional languages or reflect Pakistan’s diverse media landscape. As a result, outreach has always been restricted to a relatively small segment of users who can read and comprehend English and Urdu. In moments of crisis, social media platforms carry a responsibility to uphold global standards. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) provide a clear benchmark to companies to respect users’ rights and mitigate harm, which includes curbing disaster-related misinformation, as part of their duty to protect human rights in digital spaces. Misinformation during emergencies is not a trivial issue. It can compromise humanitarian aid and disaster response by changing perceptions, damaging credibility, and disrupting coordination. As climate catastrophes become a recurring norm, striking Pakistan almost every year, platforms have a responsibility to support users during crises, rather than adding to these challenges in an already impending disaster.

      "title_orig": "From hospital bed to cricket legend: How Sadiq Mohammad’s heroics saved Pakistan a Test match",
      "summary_orig": "A maiden career century at Melbourne in 1972-73 got Sadiq Mohammad, Pakistan’s dashing left-handed opening batsman, noticed in Tasmania, where Latrobe Cricket Club brought him over to both coach and play for them. He was the youngest of five brothers — Wazir, Raees, Hanif, Mushtaq and Sadiq — four of whom played Test cricket for Pakistan. Playing cricket in Tasmania offered Sadiq a fat pay-check, and while the standard of cricket was still wanting (they were not yet part of the Sheffield Shield, Australia’s first-class circuit), this was a real chance for him to cement his status as a professional cricketer, at a time when playing for Pakistan still meant poor pay. In 1974-75, the West Indies were coming to tour Pakistan, in one of Clive Lloyd’s first captaincy assignments, and recent debuts for two West Indies cricketers — Andy Roberts and Viv Richards. They were also on the back of a competitive 5-match series in India, which they had won 3-2. A bureaucratic struggle Sadiq and Majid Khan had already established themselves as Pakistan’s premier opening partnership, and the Board of Cricket Control in Pakistan (BCCP, the precursor to the PCB) asked the former to come over for the two match Test series. However, Sadiq was told in Tasmania that he would not get paid for the matches he would miss while on national duty. Sadiq told Abdul Hafeez Kardar, president of the Board at the time, that for him to come back, the BCCP would have to pay both his Pakistan match fee, and the fees he would be missing from Tasmania. Latrobe would not have let Sadiq go so easily. Having won their maiden trophy in the 1973-74 season (also their first final) mainly due to their marquee player, the Pakistan call-up came right during the Australian cricket season. In that season, Sadiq had scored 542 runs at an average of 42, and claimed 67 wickets. In just the final game, he scored 162 and took 43-5 in the first innings, and 20-4 in the second. As recorded in Summer’s Warriors, a compilation of cricket in North-Western Tasmania, for the 1974-75 season, “Latrobe’s chances took a big blow when Sadiq was called up by Pakistan selectors to meet the West Indians”. “ Kardar ney zyada lift nahin karayi (he was not keen on it) and asked me to forgo the match fee and come back to play for our country,“ Sadiq told Dawn.com in a recent interview. “I reiterated that now I am a professional, and if the board was willing to pay for me to come back, only then I would,” he added. Pakistan then went ahead with Agha Zahid, who ended up failing in the Lahore Test, his first and final match. “The Board was now ready to pay all fees as well as a return-ticket.” However, to the media, the Board gave a different story. In a Reuters wire titled, “Changed Plans”, published in The Canberra Times , it was reported that “Pakistani opener Sadiq Mohammad has changed his mind and returned from Australia to play for Pakistan in the Second Test against the West Indies, cricket officials said in Rawalpindi today.” Sadiq then flew overnight from Hobart to Sydney, then from Singapore to Karachi, and reached a day before the Test fixture began on March 1. Tragedy strikes In the first innings, Sadiq was out for 27, yet Pakistan declared at 406-8, with Wasim Raja getting his maiden Test century. A pitch invasion followed, causing the match to be suspended for almost two and a half hours. The West Indies, in response, made 493, and this is where Sadiq’s call-up from Australia was about to be worth every single penny. However, tragedy nearly struck. “I was fielding at short-leg and told Intikhab Alam (captain) to move me. It was apparent that the West Indies were going to declare in a few overs,” Sadiq recalled to Dawn.com . Intikhab, however, stuck with his field. “He then bowled a full toss, and Vanburn Holder pulled it right at the top of my neck, behind my left ear,” said Sadiq. Things become slightly murky as to where Sadiq was standing and who hit him. Sadiq recalls that Holder struck him, which is reiterated in his brother Mushtaq Mohammad’s autobiography, Inside Out. The Guardian and ESPNcricinfo write that Bernard Julien, on the way to his second Test century, struck Sadiq. Yet the scene was horrific. Mushtaq writes: “He was lying still but would have little nervous fits and I really thought he was going to go … The television cameras focused on me with my hands on my head looking horrified; I thought he was going to die.” His brother, Hanif Mohammad, in his autobiography, Playing for Pakistan, writes: “I was giving expert comments on the match but my heart was no longer in the task, as I was really worried about him.” Sadiq was rushed off the field and taken to Jinnah Hospital, around 20 minutes away, where Dr Omer Jooma, a renowned neurosurgeon, was in the operation theatre but came out to examine Sadiq. “On looking where the ball had struck, he said that had it been just slightly higher, I would have had my fateha read,” recalls Sadiq. Dr Jooma gave him an injection, and some painkillers for the next day. Sadiq was taken back to the ground, but then saw that Pakistan had slipped to 90-4. The West Indies had a lead of 87 runs, so effectively, the hosts were batting at 3 with 4 down. The heroics The next morning, Wasim Bari was run out on the first ball of the day. “So, in I walked at 90-5, taking Brufen to help with the pain. I had already made up my mind the previous evening that I would go out to bat, especially since no bone was broken. My mother also told me to go out and save the Test for Pakistan.” “That morning I was reading namaz and prayed that ‘Allah miyan please do a miracle that we save this Test’”. After Asif Iqbal was out on 77, the tail was exposed. Sadiq then batted the first 6 deliveries of each over — for the 1974-75 season, Tests in Pakistan had eight-ball overs — and then looked for a single to give the tail-ender the strike for one or two balls. Sarfaraz Nawaz, Asif Masood, and Liaquat Ali, all three fast bowlers who barely batted, were now facing a relentless attack from Roberts and Holder. Sadiq kept spitting out blood while batting, “At times, I felt loose-headed and would then take a minute or so to get myself in order.” In the modern game, Sadiq would definitely not have been allowed to continue, but at the time this Test took place, helmets were not part of the game. Their first inclusion in Tests was still three years away. Meanwhile, Sadiq was not the only Pakistani fielding casualty. Wasim Raja had injured his ankle tendons while bowling and was off the field. When Liaquat Ali got out and Wasim was the only batter left. Sadiq was batting on 96. Wasim then walked in wearing a plaster on his ankles. Sadiq had by now batted for over 5 hours. A Test century however, was not in the script. Confusion denied Sadiq his ton. “Zaheer Abbas came on as a runner for Wasim. I thought there were two balls left in the over, and hit the ball towards midwicket. Zaheer came running back for the third but I sent him back when he was two-thirds of the way down,” reminisced Sadiq. “To my surprise, the over was called, and I was on the striker’s end. I then crossed over and Wasim was bowled by [Lance] Gibbs in the next over. I was left stranded on 98.” The Test however, was saved. There was less than an hour for the day to end, and when the West Indies came out, they had 25 minutes left to chase 170 runs. Zaheer Abbas bowled one over in which he conceded a no-ball, the solitary run of the innings. “I took a flight back to Australia that night, as part of my promise to return to Tasmania as soon as possible.” News of Sadiq’s feat spread, with The Times of India writing: “Gallant Sadiq Saves Pakistan” and The Guardian proclaiming: “Sadiq Beats Pain to Force Draw”. Back in Australia, Sadiq narrowly missed out on claiming a second title for Latrobe despite an all-round performance in the final against Wynyard, where he scored 29 and took crucial wickets. The youngest Mohammed brother had been defiant on two counts. Not only had he denied the West Indies a sure win, but his negotiations with the board and Kardar in particular, would be the precursor to the pay disputes between Pakistani cricketers and the board for years to come.",

      "summary_en": "A maiden career century at Melbourne in 1972-73 got Sadiq Mohammad, Pakistan’s dashing left-handed opening batsman, noticed in Tasmania, where Latrobe Cricket Club brought him over to both coach and play for them. He was the youngest of five brothers — Wazir, Raees, Hanif, Mushtaq and Sadiq — four of whom played Test cricket for Pakistan. Playing cricket in Tasmania offered Sadiq a fat pay-check, and while the standard of cricket was still wanting (they were not yet part of the Sheffield Shield, Australia’s first-class circuit), this was a real chance for him to cement his status as a professional cricketer, at a time when playing for Pakistan still meant poor pay. In 1974-75, the West Indies were coming to tour Pakistan, in one of Clive Lloyd’s first captaincy assignments, and recent debuts for two West Indies cricketers — Andy Roberts and Viv Richards. They were also on the back of a competitive 5-match series in India, which they had won 3-2. A bureaucratic struggle Sadiq and Majid Khan had already established themselves as Pakistan’s premier opening partnership, and the Board of Cricket Control in Pakistan (BCCP, the precursor to the PCB) asked the former to come over for the two match Test series. However, Sadiq was told in Tasmania that he would not get paid for the matches he would miss while on national duty. Sadiq told Abdul Hafeez Kardar, president of the Board at the time, that for him to come back, the BCCP would have to pay both his Pakistan match fee, and the fees he would be missing from Tasmania. Latrobe would not have let Sadiq go so easily. Having won their maiden trophy in the 1973-74 season (also their first final) mainly due to their marquee player, the Pakistan call-up came right during the Australian cricket season. In that season, Sadiq had scored 542 runs at an average of 42, and claimed 67 wickets. In just the final game, he scored 162 and took 43-5 in the first innings, and 20-4 in the second. As recorded in Summer’s Warriors, a compilation of cricket in North-Western Tasmania, for the 1974-75 season, “Latrobe’s chances took a big blow when Sadiq was called up by Pakistan selectors to meet the West Indians”. “ Kardar ney zyada lift nahin karayi (he was not keen on it) and asked me to forgo the match fee and come back to play for our country,“ Sadiq told Dawn.com in a recent interview. “I reiterated that now I am a professional, and if the board was willing to pay for me to come back, only then I would,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump slapped sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies on Wednesday, complaining that his talks with Vladimir Putin to end the Ukraine war “don’t go anywhere”. The European Union also unveiled a fresh wave of sanctions to pressure Russia to end its relentless, three-and-a-half-year invasion of its neighbor, which is allied with both Washington and Brussels. Trump has held off pulling the trigger on sanctions against Russia for months, but his patience snapped after plans for a fresh summit with Putin in Budapest collapsed . “Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere,” Trump said in response to a question from an AFP journalist in the Oval Office. But Trump added that he hoped the “tremendous sanctions” against Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil would be short-lived. “We hope that the war will be settled,” he said alongside Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday evening that the US still wants to meet with the Russians, despite the sanctions. “We’re always going to be interested in engaging if there’s an opportunity to achieve peace,” Rubio told reporters. Separately, the EU agreed to impose new measures aimed at crimping Moscow’s oil and gas revenues over the war, a spokesperson for the bloc’s current Danish presidency said. That package — the 19th from the EU since the Kremlin’s 2022 invasion — sought to keep the pressure on Russia in light of Trump’s faltering peace push and an escalation of Russia’s offensive. Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States welcomed the sanctions. “This decision fully aligns with Ukraine’s consistent position that peace can only be achieved through strength and by exerting maximum pressure on the aggressor using all available international instruments,” Ambassador Olga Stefanishyna said in a statement. The sanctions came hours after Russia’s latest overnight barrage on Ukraine killed seven people — including two children — and ripped into a kindergarten. Not ‘honest and forthright’ The US sanctions represent a major stepping up of its actions against Russia and reflect Trump’s growing frustration at being unable to persuade Putin to end the conflict despite what he calls his personal chemistry with the Kremlin chief. The sanctions involve a freezing of all Rosneft and Lukoil assets in the United States, while barring all US companies from doing any business with the two Russian oil titans. “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. Bessent later told the Fox Business programme Kudlow that it was “one of the largest sanctions that we have done against the Russian Federation. “President Putin has not come to the table in an honest and forthright manner, as we’d hoped,” Bessent said, adding that Trump was “disappointed at where we are in these talks”. Trump this week halted plans to hold talks with Putin in Budapest, saying he did not want a “wasted” meeting. The Kremlin on Wednesday appeared to leave the door open for a summit, saying ahead of the sanctions announcement that preparations were still ongoing. “No one wants to waste time, neither President Trump nor President Putin,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. EU oil and gas sanctions As part of the new EU measures, the 27-nation bloc brought forward a ban on the import of liquefied natural gas from Russia by a year to the start of 2027.\nIt also blacklisted over 100 more tankers from Moscow’s so-called “shadow fleet” of ageing oil vessels and imposed controls on the travel of Russian diplomats suspected of espionage. The package is scheduled to be formally adopted on Thursday, just before Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky joins EU leaders at a summit in Brussels. Zelensky signed a letter of intent with Sweden earlier on Wednesday to acquire 150 Gripen fighter jets. During the latest Russian strikes, AFP journalists in Kyiv heard the buzzing of Russian drones and explosions throughout the night, and saw a pillar of smoke rising above the capital. “My hands are still shaking,” Kyiv resident Mariana Gorchenko told AFP . “I jumped up, glad that my little one wasn’t in the room where the windows were blown out.” The strikes also damaged a kindergarten in Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv.",

Officials said security forces launched an intelligence-based operation in the mountainous area of Dalbandin in Chagai after reports of militants hiding there. Troops cordoned off the location and came under heavy fire. A fierce gun battle ensued and lasted about an hour, leaving six suspects dead. “The Fitna al-Hindustan terrorists were hiding in the area and were detected through aerial reconnaissance,” officials said, adding that arms and ammunition were recovered from the hideout. They said the operation had reduced threats to security forces and civilians in the vicinity. In a separate action, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted an operation in Sibi after a tip-off about the presence of members of a banned outfit. CTD personnel surrounded a compound where the suspects were holed up. The militants opened fire and a firefight lasting more than an hour ensued, leaving five suspects dead, CTD sources said. Arms, ammunition, maps and documents allegedly detailing attack plans were recovered from the site. Officials said the slain men were linked to past attacks on security forces, police and Levies personnel. All five bodies were shifted to a hospital. Two cops martyred Meanwhile in Noshki, two police constables were gunned down by unidentified attackers on Wednesday. Police said Abdul Razzaq and Obaid Ullah were travelling to police lines when assailants on motorbikes opened fire near the Gharibabad western bypass. “Both constables sustained multiple bullet wounds and [were martyred] on the spot,” said Noshki SHO Zahoor Baloch. Police moved the bodies to the district hospital and started an investigation. No group had claimed responsibility by late Wednesday. In another incident in Kachhi district’s Sanni Shoran area, a security man lost his life when a landmine planted beside a road exploded as a patrol vehicle passed. Police said the blast also badly damaged the vehicle. Published in Dawn, October 23rd, 2025",

      "summary": "• Two policemen martyred in Noshki • Security man loses life in landmine blast QUETTA: At least 11 militants were killed in separate operations in Chagai and Sibi districts over the past 24 hours, whereas two police constables were martyred in Noshki, and a security official lost his life to a landmine in Kachhi, officials said on Wednesday. Officials said security forces launched an intelligence-based operation in the mountainous area of Dalbandin in Chagai after reports of militants hiding there. Troops cordoned off the location and came under heavy fire. A fierce gun battle ensued and lasted about an hour, leaving six suspects dead. “The Fitna al-Hindustan terrorists were hiding in the area and were detected through aerial reconnaissance,” officials said, adding that arms and ammunition were recovered from the hideout. They said the operation had reduced threats to security forces and civilians in the vicinity. In a separate action, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted an operation in Sibi after a tip-off about the presence of members of a banned outfit. CTD personnel surrounded a compound where the suspects were holed up. The militants opened fire and a firefight lasting more than an hour ensued, leaving five suspects dead, CTD sources said. Arms, ammunition, maps and documents allegedly detailing attack plans were recovered from the site. Officials said the slain men were linked to past attacks on security forces, police and Levies personnel. All five bodies were shifted to a hospital. Two cops martyred Meanwhile in Noshki, two police constables were gunned down by unidentified attackers on Wednesday. Police said Abdul Razzaq and Obaid Ullah were travelling to police lines when assailants on motorbikes opened fire near the Gharibabad western bypass. “Both constables sustained multiple bullet wounds and [were martyred] on the spot,” said Noshki SHO Zahoor Baloch. Police moved the bodies to the district hospital and started an investigation. No group had claimed responsibility by late Wednesday. In another incident in Kachhi district’s Sanni Shoran area, a security man lost his life when a landmine planted beside a road exploded as a patrol vehicle passed. Police said the blast also badly damaged the vehicle. Published in Dawn, October 23rd, 2025",
