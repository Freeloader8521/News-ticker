      "title_orig": "Water becomes latest luxury symbol for India’s elite",
      "summary_orig": "At an Indian gourmet food store, Avanti Mehta is organising a blind tasting of drinks sourced from France, Italy and India. No, this isn’t wine, it’s water. Participants use tiny shot glasses to check the minerality, carbonation and salinity in samples of Evian from the French Alps, Perrier from southern France, San Pellegrino from Italy and India’s Aava from the foothills of the Aravalli mountains. “They will all taste different … you should be choosing a water that can give you some sort of nutritional value,” said Mehta, who is 32 and calls herself India’s youngest water sommelier, a term usually associated with premium wine. Her family owns the Aava mineral water brand. Premium water is a $400 million business in the world’s most populous nation and is growing bigger as its wealthy see it as a new status symbol that fits in with a spreading wellness craze. Avanti Mehta, 32, India’s youngest water sommelier, talks about different brands of packaged water at “Sip and Sense”, a water tasting event in Hyderabad, India, January 9. — Reuters Premium Indian mineral water costs around $1 for a one-litre bottle, while imported brands are upwards of $3, or 15 times the price of the country’s lowest-priced basic bottled water. Clean water is a privilege in the country of 1.4 billion people, where researchers say 70 per cent of the groundwater is contaminated. Tap water remains unfit to drink, and 16 people died in Indore city after consuming contaminated tap water in December. Many in India see bottled water as a necessity and standard 20 US-cent bottles are available widely at convenience stores, restaurants and hotels. The market is worth nearly $5bn annually and is set to grow 24pc a year — among the fastest in the world. Bottled water demand in the United States or China is driven by convenience, making it a $30bn-plus market in each country, which will grow just 4-5pc each year, market researcher Euromonitor says. In India, the premium water segment is leading the surge in demand, accounting for 8pc of the bottled water market last year compared to just 1pc in 2021, Euromonitor said. Workers arrange PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) bottles filled with natural water on a conveyor at Tata’s Himalayan natural mineral water bottling plant in Dhaula Kuan, Himachal Pradesh, India on October 16, 2025. — Reuters/File “Distrust of municipal water in some areas has escalated the demand for bottled water. Now, people understand how mineral water has more health benefits. It’s expensive, but the category will boom,” said Amulya Pandit, a senior consultant at Euromonitor specialising in the drinks market. Among its consumers is New Delhi-based real estate developer BS. Batra, who says his family uses only premium water at home to get more minerals and safeguard health. “You feel different, more energetic during the day,” said Batra, 49, an avid badminton player. “I consume mineral water even with whisky at home, and kids use it for their smoothies.” Water lures Bollywood star, wealthy The popular 20-cent plastic bottled water is mainly made by Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Indian market leader Bisleri. In addition, Indians who can afford it install purifiers in their homes, which clean the water but also remove most minerals. Imported and local premium waters are luring wealthy consumers and businesses alike. Bollywood star Bhumi Pednekar and her sister have launched Backbay — selling 750 millilitre (ml) cartons of mineral water for $2.2; Indian conglomerate Tata is expanding its premium water portfolio, and retailers and businesses are reporting higher sales. A worker walks as natural water is filled into glass bottles at a water filling machine at Tata’s Himalayan natural mineral water bottling plant in Dhaula Kuan, Himachal Pradesh, India on October 16, 2025. — Reuters Tata Consumer Products, also Starbucks’ partner in India, sells 20-cent bottled water, but premium water is its priority as it sees affluent, health-focused consumers willing to spend on the drink without worrying about the price, Chief Executive Officer Sunil D’Souza said in an interview. “I don’t have to push water uphill…I see a long, long, long runway for the business,” he said. Tata’s premium “Himalayan” mineral water factory — which a Reuters photographer visited — is located in the foothills of the Himalayan range in Himachal Pradesh state. Workers there largely keep a hands-free watch on machines filling plastic and glass bottles with water sourced from a natural underground aquifer. A drone view shows Tata’s Himalayan natural mineral water bottling plant in Dhaula Kuan, Himachal Pradesh, India on October 16, 2025. — Reuters/File Looking for springs Most Indians prefer still water, and the sparkling variant remains niche. Tata said it plans to launch a sparkling Himalayan water and is also scouting for natural springs to expand its other offerings. At three Foodstories Indian gourmet stores, sales of premium waters tripled in 2025. Customer demand prompted the chain to import “light and creamy” Saratoga Spring Water from New York, which costs 799 rupees ($9) for a 355ml bottle, and stocks sold out within days, said co-founder Avni Biyani. Indian mineral water brand Aava’s sales touched a record 805m rupees ($9m) last year, growing 40pc a year since 2021. Tata said its basic and premium water portfolio will grow 30pc a year, after growing tenfold to $65 million in six years. A worker inspects glass bottles filled with water against a bottle inspection light at Tata’s Himalayan natural mineral water bottling plant in Dhaula Kuan, Himachal Pradesh, India on October 16, 2025. — Reuters Imported waters, which attract an over 30pc tax, are pricier than Indian brands.

      "summary_orig": "Iranian army chief Amir Hatami on Saturday warned the United States and Israel against an attack, saying his country’s forces were on high alert following Washington’s heavy military deployments in the Gulf. He also insisted the Islamic republic’s nuclear expertise could not be eliminated, after Trump said he expected Tehran to seek a deal to avoid US strikes. “If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region, and the security of the Zionist regime (Israel),” Hatami said, according to the official IRNA news agency. He noted that Iran’s armed forces were “at full defensive and military readiness”. Washington sent a naval strike group to the Middle East led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, with Trump threatening to intervene militarily after a deadly crackdown by Iranian authorities on two weeks of anti-government protests. The deployment has raised fears of a possible direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies — notably Israel — in the event of an attack. On Friday, Trump said he predicted that Iran would seek to negotiate a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face American military action. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that Tehran was ready for nuclear talks, but its missiles and defence “will never be negotiated”. ‘Cannot be eliminated’ The US carried out strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites in June when it briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against its regional foe. Israeli attacks also hit military sites across the country and killed senior officers and top nuclear scientists. But Hatami on Saturday insisted that Iran’s nuclear technology “cannot be eliminated, even if scientists and sons of this nation are martyred”. On Friday, US Central Command (Centcom) said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would conduct “a two-day live-fire naval exercise” in the Strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies. In a statement , Centcom warned the IRGC against “any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces”. The United States designated the IRGC a terrorist organisation in 2019, a move the European Union followed on Thursday. The EU decision drew angry reactions from Tehran, which vowed to reciprocate. Deadly crackdown Nationwide protests against the rising cost of living erupted in Iran on December 28, before turning into a broader anti-government movement that peaked on January 8 and 9. Iranian authorities have said the protests began peacefully before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, blaming the United States and Israel for fomenting the unrest. The official death toll from the authorities stands at 3,117. The protests have since subsided . On Saturday, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian urged his government to heed public grievances after the demonstrations. “We must work with the people and for the people and serve the people as much as possible,” Pezeshkian said in a speech broadcast on state TV. “If we act justly, the people will see it and will accept it, and under such conditions, no power can cripple a government, a society, or a nation that acts justly, fairly, and on the basis of rights.” On Saturday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei visited the shrine of Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, in southern Tehran. In a video carried by his official website, Khamenei offered prayers at the shrine on the occasion of 10-day celebrations marking the 47th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

      "summary_orig": "The executive director of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, revealed early on Saturday that the eye procedure of incarcerated former premier Imran Khan was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention. The video statement by the hospital’s head comes after the PTI approached the Supreme Court on Friday, seeking its assistance in arranging a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians, with the help of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP). Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had earlier confirmed that Imran underwent a “20-minute” medical procedure for an eye ailment on the night of January 24 at Pims in Islamabad. “It (the procedure) was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes. During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions and follow-up advice and documents,” said Sikander. The doctor said the former premier, aged 74, complained of “reduced vision in his right eye”, adding that a “qualified ophthalmologist” from the hospital conducted a “complete eye assessment at Adiala jail”. Sikander elaborated that the doctor dispatched to the prison conducted “strict lab examination, [ocular] endoscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, essential laboratory tests and OCT of the retina”. He added that based on the initial assessment, the diagnosis of right central vein occlusion was made and a hospital-based treatment was recommended. “Accordingly, Mr Niazi was brought to Pims on the night of last Saturday, Sunday for the advised procedure.” The head of the hospital said Imran, after arrival at Pims, was “explained in full” about the procedure. “Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure. The procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocol and monitoring,” said Dr Sikander. Imran’s eye condition and ‘secret transfer’ to Pims On January 28, the PTI had raised concerns about Imran’s health, saying it had learned through credible reports that he had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye, which could cause permanent eyesight damage if not treated promptly. The party had alleged that the jail administration was insisting that the treatment be provided inside the prison, contrary to a medical expert’s advice to take him to a hospital. The next day, a report , quoting a senior doctor at Pims, said Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on the night of January 24 for a medical procedure, which was “completed when the time reached in the A.M.”. The doctor said there was “extraordinary movement” on Saturday night, and the operation theatres and the anaesthesia room were cordoned off ahead of Imran’s arrival at Pims. On Thursday, the information minister confirmed that the PTI founder underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment at Pims on the night of January 24. He said it was a “20-minute” procedure and that the ex-premier was “absolutely healthy”. Subsequently, the PTI condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians. The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also termed Imran’s transfer to the hospital without the knowledge of his family and personal physicians a “criminal negligence”. Imran’s sister, Noreen Niazi, who had earlier raised doubts about his brother’s ailment, reiterated concerns that his family and lawyers were not being kept informed and demanded that his medical reports be made public. Then on Friday, the PTI staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court, following which it said the ex-premier’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States on Friday approved multibillion-dollar weapons sales to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, at a point of high tensions with Iran. The State Department said it green-lighted a $3.8-billion sale of 30 Apache attack helicopters to Israel, which has agreed to a fragile ceasefire in Gaza. “The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability,” the State Department said in a statement. “This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” it said. Also in the package was a $1.8 billion sale of joint light tactical vehicles. The United States sends billions of dollars worth of military supplies per year to Israel, largely in aid rather than sales. Israel and Hamas reached a US-backed ceasefire in October that largely paused two years of war. Tensions are high elsewhere in the region as the United States deploys a major military contingent in waters near Iran. The State Department also approved a $9-billion sale to Saudi Arabia for 730 Patriot missiles, which are used to defend against incoming attacks. Israel last year carried out a major bombing campaign against nuclear and other military sites in Iran. Iran has faced growing pressure after major protests against the clerical state, which has responded by killing thousands of protesters. Saudi Arabia has voiced caution about an attack on Iran as Gulf monarchies fear instability that could jeopardise their reputation as business havens. The Trump administration has said that the Gaza ceasefire is now in its second phase, with a focus on disarming Hamas. Earlier in November, US President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia was being designated as a “ major, non-Nato ally ”. The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. The White House also announced the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the Kingdom, however, the jets will be less advanced than those operated by Israel, in line with a US law that guarantees Israel’s military edge in the region.",

      "summary_orig": "• Erdogan offers to help ease Tehran-Washington tensions • Trump softens threats, suggests openness to dialogue • UK PM Starmer, allies working to block Iran’s nuclear ambitions ISTANBUL: Turkiye intensified a diplomatic push to mediate between Tehran and Washington on Friday as US President Donald Trump appeared to cool his threats of a strike, though Iran warned that its missile capabilities would “never” be on the negotiating table. Turkish President Re­cep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan led regional efforts to de-escalate tensions that have soared since the US moved military assets to the Middle East following a deadly crackdown on protests in Iran. While the Pentagon said the military remained ready, Trump lowered the temperature late on Thursday, stating he hoped to avoid conflict and that talks were possible. Speaking during a visit to Turkiye, Iranian For­eign Minister Abbas Araghchi welcomed the potential for dialogue but drew a hard line regarding national defence. “I want to state firmly that Iran’s defensive and missile capabilities will never be subject to negotiation,” Araghchi said, adding that his country had no current plans to meet US officials. Araghchi emphasised that Tehran was “ready to begin negotiations if they take place on an equal footing, based on mutual interests and mutual respect.” Erdogan spoke by ph­one with Iranian President Masoud Pezes­hkian on Friday, telling his counterpart that Turkiye was “ready to assume a facilitating role between Iran and the United States to de-escalate the tensions”. Standing alongside Araghchi at a press conference in Istanbul, Fidan said restarting talks over Iran’s nuclear program was “vital for reducing regional tensions”. He urged Washington to “act with common sense” and resist pressure from Israel, which he said was pushing for a US attack. Fidan also noted he had held discussions with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and would keep lines open to prevent Iran’s isolation. Despite the diplomatic overtures, significant hurdles remain. The Axios reported on Monday that US officials said any deal must include a cap on Tehran’s long-range missile stockpile, the removal of enriched uranium, and a ban on independent enrichment. Meanwhile, international pressure on Tehran continues to mount. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the BBC on Friday that preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons was “hugely important.” While stopping short of explicitly supporting a US strike, Starmer condemned the “grotesque” repression of demonstrators. The European Union also urged against military action but condemned the crackdown by designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a “terrorist organisation”. Tehran quickly criticised the move. Iran’s judiciary chief called the designation “hostile”, warning that Europe “will suffer the consequences of their foolish act”. Araghchi echoed the sentiment in Istanbul, labelling the designation a mistake and describing Europe as a “continent in decline”. While diplomatic channels remain active, military readiness continues. Israel’s Ynet news website reported Friday that a US Navy destroyer had docked at the Israeli port of Eilat. Araghchi told reporters that while Iran has “never sought war,” it remains prepared for any scenario. “Iran has no problem with negotiations, but negotiations cannot take place under the shadow of threats,” Araghchi said. “They must certainly set aside their threats and change their approach toward a fair and equitable negotiation, as Mr Trump himself said in his post.” Pezeshkian, in a call with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, reinforced that success depended on the “abandonment of belligerent and threatening actions,” warning that any aggression against Iran would “receive an immediate and firm response”. Tensions initially spiked following protests that erupted in late December over economic grievances. The demonstrations faced a severe crackdown that peaked on Jan 8 and Jan 9. Iran has accused the United States and Israel of fuelling a “terrorist operation” that transformed peaceful rallies into “riots”. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) confirmed 6,479 people were killed in the demonstrations, including 6,092 protesters and 118 children. Internet restrictions imposed in early January continue to hinder information access. While rights groups estimate the toll is in the tens of thousands, Iranian authorities have acknowledged more than 3,000 deaths, claiming the majority were security forces or bystanders killed by rioters.

      "summary_en": "• Erdogan offers to help ease Tehran-Washington tensions • Trump softens threats, suggests openness to dialogue • UK PM Starmer, allies working to block Iran’s nuclear ambitions ISTANBUL: Turkiye intensified a diplomatic push to mediate between Tehran and Washington on Friday as US President Donald Trump appeared to cool his threats of a strike, though Iran warned that its missile capabilities would “never” be on the negotiating table. Turkish President Re­cep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan led regional efforts to de-escalate tensions that have soared since the US moved military assets to the Middle East following a deadly crackdown on protests in Iran. While the Pentagon said the military remained ready, Trump lowered the temperature late on Thursday, stating he hoped to avoid conflict and that talks were possible. Speaking during a visit to Turkiye, Iranian For­eign Minister Abbas Araghchi welcomed the potential for dialogue but drew a hard line regarding national defence. “I want to state firmly that Iran’s defensive and missile capabilities will never be subject to negotiation,” Araghchi said, adding that his country had no current plans to meet US officials. Araghchi emphasised that Tehran was “ready to begin negotiations if they take place on an equal footing, based on mutual interests and mutual respect.” Erdogan spoke by ph­one with Iranian President Masoud Pezes­hkian on Friday, telling his counterpart that Turkiye was “ready to assume a facilitating role between Iran and the United States to de-escalate the tensions”. Standing alongside Araghchi at a press conference in Istanbul, Fidan said restarting talks over Iran’s nuclear program was “vital for reducing regional tensions”. He urged Washington to “act with common sense” and resist pressure from Israel, which he said was pushing for a US attack. Fidan also noted he had held discussions with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and would keep lines open to prevent Iran’s isolation. Despite the diplomatic overtures, significant hurdles remain. The Axios reported on Monday that US officials said any deal must include a cap on Tehran’s long-range missile stockpile, the removal of enriched uranium, and a ban on independent enrichment. Meanwhile, international pressure on Tehran continues to mount. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the BBC on Friday that preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons was “hugely important.” While stopping short of explicitly supporting a US strike, Starmer condemned the “grotesque” repression of demonstrators. The European Union also urged against military action but condemned the crackdown by designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a “terrorist organisation”. Tehran quickly criticised the move. Iran’s judiciary chief called the designation “hostile”, warning that Europe “will suffer the consequences of their foolish act”.
