      "summary_orig": "After staying out of favour in the Twenty20 International format for Pakistan’s last five assignments, former skipper Babar Azam was picked for the upcoming three-match series against South Africa only after fellow batter Fakhar Zaman decided to skip it, white-ball head coach Mike Hesson said on Sunday. Since Hesson took over the role in June, Babar hasn’t featured for Pakistan in T20Is with the national side playing series against Bangladesh, the West Indies and a tri-nation series followed by the Asia Cup during that period. Hesson had cited the right-hander’s low strike-rate as the reason for his absence. But Babar’s selection for the series, which starts in Rawalpindi on Tuesday raised suggested a change of mind for the coach before the New Zealander clarified it. “I certainly endorse his selection,” Hesson said of Babar while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of Pakistan’s training session at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. “We’ve sent him (Fakhar) back to first-class cricket after a conversation with him. “He wanted to focus on improving his technique for one-day cricket, so we gave him a bit of a break from T20s. That’s created an opportunity for another top-order player.” Hesson confirmed that Babar will take the number three spot instead of the batter’s preferred opening position, where he flourished for Pakistan for a substantial period before eventually falling in form and then out of favour. The coach, however, has expectations from Babar to make a strong comeback and suggested he saw him in Pakistan’s plans for the T20 World Cup, which is set to be held in February-March next year in India and Sri Lanka. “It’s a great chance to have Babar back,” said the coach. “He’s likely to bat at number three, a role I’m confident he’ll perform well in. “It also gives our squad some flexibility ahead of the [T20] World Cup.” ‘Haris needs to work’ Babar’s unexpected return also coincided with the axing of wicket-keeper-batter Mohammad Haris from the Pakistan squad even after he received ample backing from the team management across Hesson’s tenure so far. The 24-year-old proved his mettle with a century against Bangladesh back in June but gradually lost form amid frequent change of batting positions. Hesson believed Haris needed to go back to the drawing board to fix his issues. “Haris has had a number of opportunities recently, and he’d be the first to admit he hasn’t made the most of them,” he said. “But he’s still young and developing, so I wouldn’t say his career is over. “He needs to work on his decision-making with the bat. Even in domestic T20s, he averages around 17, similar to international cricket, so that’s an area for improvement.” Haris has been replaced by Usman Khan — who last year gave up on a career in the United Arab Emirates to play for Pakistan before being eventually dropped. He emerged out of nowhere and Hesson said he sees the right-hander, who keeps wickets as well, as a good player of spin. “We see our wicket-keeper batting more through the middle rather than at the top, especially with spin being such a big factor in Sri Lanka during the World Cup. That’s why Usman has been given this opportunity.”",

Hesson believed Haris needed to go back to the drawing board to fix his issues. “Haris has had a number of opportunities recently, and he’d be the first to admit he hasn’t made the most of them,” he said. “But he’s still young and developing, so I wouldn’t say his career is over. “He needs to work on his decision-making with the bat. Even in domestic T20s, he averages around 17, similar to international cricket, so that’s an area for improvement.” Haris has been replaced by Usman Khan — who last year gave up on a career in the United Arab Emirates to play for Pakistan before being eventually dropped. He emerged out of nowhere and Hesson said he sees the right-hander, who keeps wickets as well, as a good player of spin. “We see our wicket-keeper batting more through the middle rather than at the top, especially with spin being such a big factor in Sri Lanka during the World Cup. That’s why Usman has been given this opportunity.”",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces foiled two major terrorist infiltration attempts from Afghanistan on 24-25 October 2025, killing 25 militants, including four suicide bombers, and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives in separate operations in North Waziristan and Kurram districts, the military’s media wing said on Sunday. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), on 24-25 October 2025, security forces detected movements of two large groups of khwarij attempting to infiltrate Pakistan from Afghanistan near Ghaki in Kurram District and Spinwam in North Waziristan District. “Own troops effectively engaged these groups of khwarij [and] as a result of precise and skilful engagements, fifteen khwarij , including four suicide bombers belonging to [the] Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in Spinwam, North Waziristan District,” the statement said. It added that another ten infiltrating khwarij were killed in Ghaki, Kurram District, and a large cache of weapons, ammunition, and explosives was recovered from the slain militants. Fitna al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The statement added that despite successfully thwarting the infiltration attempt, five soldiers sacrificed their lives during the intense firefights. The fallen included Havildar Manzoor Hussain (35, District Ghizar), Sepoy Nauman Ilyas Kiyani (23, District Poonch), Sepoy Muhammad Adil (24, District Kasur), Sepoy Shah Jehan (25, District Vehari), and Sepoy Ali Asghar (25, District Pak Pattan), who embraced martyrdom while fighting gallantly. “It is significant to point out that these infiltration attempts by Fitna al Khwarij are being carried out at a time when delegations of Pakistan and Afghanistan are engaged in talks in Türkiye; casting doubts on the intentions of the Interim Afghan Government with regards to addressing the issue of terrorism emanating from its soil,” the statement said. It added that Pakistan had consistently been asking the Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border and is expected to fulfil its obligations of the Doha Agreement and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij against Pakistan. “The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” it said. Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country, it said. President Asif Zardari lauded the security forces for rendering the infiltration attempts by the terrorists unsuccessful, according to a statement on the PPP’s X account. He also paid tributes to the martyred “who laid down their live while defending the country”, adding that the “nefarious designs of Fitna-al-Khawarij and their Indian patrons would never be successful”. According to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan , Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the five personnel who embraced martyrdom while “bravely fighting” the terrorists. He prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the martyrs and expressed condolences with their families, the Radio Pakistan report said, adding that PM Shehbaz further stated that the entire nation “salutes the security forces for their courage and sacrifices”. He reaffirmed the government’s resolve to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned TTP’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Last week, security forces neutralised 34 “India-ba­cked” terrorists during multiple operations across KP.",

      "summary_orig": "Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar on Sunday ordered a judicial inquiry into the custodial death of a teenager in Karachi due to alleged torture. The teenager, 18-year-old Muhammad Irfan, was arrested by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of police along with three of his friends on October 22. SIU Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Amjad Ahmed Shaikh told Dawn that they were taken to the SIU/ CIA Centre in Saddar at around 5:30pm the same day, and 15 minutes later, the health condition of Irfan deteriorated. He was taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival, he said. The police claimed that the boy died of a heart attack, while his relatives allege that he was tortured to death. Preliminary findings from his post-mortem examination — conducted in the presence of a judicial magistrate at JPMC —  suggested the presence of multiple injuries on the teenager’s body, according to doctors and the police. In a statement issued today, the spokesperson for the home ministry said, “The home minister has directed the additional chief secretary (home) to initiate the process of judicial inquiry into the case.” It has been directed that “a thorough forensic investigation of the incident be carried out, and whosoever is involved should be taken to task”. “The case should be taken to a logical conclusion with the help of modern techniques,” the statement said. “I feel sorry that the child has died in the custody of the police,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. Protest On Saturday, relatives of the deceased and others staged a sit-in at an Edhi morgue at Sohrab Goth while carrying the coffin of the victim, whose body was kept at the morgue, and blocked the main road. The hours-long protest ended on Saturday night after assurances by “higher police authorities” that justice would be provided to them, said senior journalist Shahid Jatoi, who was one of the protesters. He said Irfan’s coffin was taken to his native village, Bait Ahmed, in Ahmedpur East, Bahawalpur district, on Saturday night, where “thousands of people” attended his funeral prayer. He said that “Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) and Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) SIU spoke to the relatives and promised that after receipt of the final report of the doctors, section 302 (intentional murder) would be incorporated in the first information report (FIR) of the case”. FIR An FIR of the incident was registered at the Saddar Police Station on the complaint of SIU and Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Station House Officer (SHO) Mumtaz Ahmed under Sections 34 (common intention) and 319 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against seven nominated SIU/CIA officers. The FIR said that four people were detained by the SIU police party from Lilly Bridge near Cantonment Station in the limits of Frere Police Station on October 22. The FIR added that they were detained on information provided by a special informant, a case was registered against the four on the same day, and they were handed over to an assistant sub-inspector (ASI). SHO Ahmed said he came to know through the investigating officer (IO) of the case that two other assistant sub-inspectors had continued interrogating Irfan when his health deteriorated suddenly and he became unconscious. The SHO added that the IO took Irfan to the hospital without informing him. SHO Ahmed said the SIU personnel had committed “negligence” during Irfan’s arrest and custody. He said it transpired that the registration of the case against the deceased was also “dubious” and the entire matter raised suspicion. On Saturday, Karachi police arrested two cops who were named in the FIR. Earlier, on Friday, seven policemen were suspended after the incident came to light.",

      "title_orig": "Azma Bokhari dismisses ‘propaganda’ about restriction on inter-provincial movement of wheat",
      "summary_orig": "Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari maintained on Sunday that there was no ban on the inter-provincial movement of wheat, terming the “ongoing propaganda in this regard baseless and contrary to facts”. Her statement, carried by state-run APP , comes after the Punjab government faced criticism by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh governments for allegedly choking wheat flow to the two provinces. In a letter dated October 23, the KP government asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province. Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed. Rejecting these “claims”, Bokhari clarified that the inter-provincial transportation of flour was “continuing transparently through official permits, ensuring a clear and traceable record of all consignments being transported out of the province”, the statement carried by APP said. Criticising the KP government, she said that “if the province’s flour demand has exceeded its production capacity, the provincial government should release its own stored wheat or procure it” from the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (Passco). “Punjab cannot compromise the right of its people to affordable flour for the sake of another [party’s] political theatrics,” she said. The minister claimed that over 200 flour mills in KP were currently non-operational and said the province’s chief executive should “focus on reviving these mills instead of staging protests outside Adiala Jail” — an apparent jibe at KP CM Sohail Afridi, who had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was not allowed to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan. In May this year, the federal food minister had informed the National Assembly that the Passco was being abolished . The policy has since been reversed under a national wheat policy , but procurement modalities remain contested. It was also said under the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat. Reiterating in her statement that there was “no ban” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat or flour, she said under Article 18 of the Constitution and relevant laws, permits and digital monitoring had been made mandatory to prevent hoarding and profiteering. The minister further said that the welfare of the people of Punjab remained her government’s top priority and  “the availability and affordability of flour for every citizen have been fully ensured”. “This pro-people style of governance is what some elements find hard to digest,” she claimed. Bokhari added that the Punjab government was “utilising taxpayer’s money to provide subsidised wheat to ensure public relief and avert any potential crisis during the dry months”. “Punjab currently possesses 0.885 million metric tons of wheat reserves, valued at around Rs100 billion. This reflects the farsighted and organised policies of [Punjab] Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.” Bokhari further stated that flour mills were being supplied wheat at Rs 3,000 per maund (40 kilogrammes) to “maintain steady availability and price stability in the market”. Wheat restrictions In the aftermath of floods, the Punjab government began tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage. The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from politicians and flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement. While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. Critics, however, argued that these mea­sures are against the spirit of a deregulated market. In the KP govt’s Oct 23 letter, the province’s food department had said that the inter-provincial wheat restrictions were “inconsistent” with Article 151(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees “freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country”. “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, being a wheat-deficient province, heavily relies on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its daily wheat requirement of approximately 14,500 metric tonnes,” the letter read. “The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,“ it added.",

In a letter dated October 23, the KP government asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province. Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed. Rejecting these “claims”, Bokhari clarified that the inter-provincial transportation of flour was “continuing transparently through official permits, ensuring a clear and traceable record of all consignments being transported out of the province”, the statement carried by APP said. Criticising the KP government, she said that “if the province’s flour demand has exceeded its production capacity, the provincial government should release its own stored wheat or procure it” from the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (Passco). “Punjab cannot compromise the right of its people to affordable flour for the sake of another [party’s] political theatrics,” she said. The minister claimed that over 200 flour mills in KP were currently non-operational and said the province’s chief executive should “focus on reviving these mills instead of staging protests outside Adiala Jail” — an apparent jibe at KP CM Sohail Afridi, who had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was not allowed to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan. In May this year, the federal food minister had informed the National Assembly that the Passco was being abolished . The policy has since been reversed under a national wheat policy , but procurement modalities remain contested. It was also said under the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat. Reiterating in her statement that there was “no ban” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat or flour, she said under Article 18 of the Constitution and relevant laws, permits and digital monitoring had been made mandatory to prevent hoarding and profiteering. The minister further said that the welfare of the people of Punjab remained her government’s top priority and  “the availability and affordability of flour for every citizen have been fully ensured”. “This pro-people style of governance is what some elements find hard to digest,” she claimed. Bokhari added that the Punjab government was “utilising taxpayer’s money to provide subsidised wheat to ensure public relief and avert any potential crisis during the dry months”. “Punjab currently possesses 0.885 million metric tons of wheat reserves, valued at around Rs100 billion. This reflects the farsighted and organised policies of [Punjab] Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.” Bokhari further stated that flour mills were being supplied wheat at Rs 3,000 per maund (40 kilogrammes) to “maintain steady availability and price stability in the market”. Wheat restrictions In the aftermath of floods, the Punjab government began tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage. The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from politicians and flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement. While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. Critics, however, argued that these mea­sures are against the spirit of a deregulated market. In the KP govt’s Oct 23 letter, the province’s food department had said that the inter-provincial wheat restrictions were “inconsistent” with Article 151(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees “freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country”. “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, being a wheat-deficient province, heavily relies on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its daily wheat requirement of approximately 14,500 metric tonnes,” the letter read. “The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,“ it added.",

      "summary_orig": "There is no precedent for it. But, there is never really a precedent for any development in Pakistan cricket. The happenings of Pakistan cricket outsmart one’s wildest fantasies and the current controversy that the country’s cricketing landscape sees itself embroiled in is one such. Since it has emerged that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) served a legal notice to Ali Tareen for the breach of the franchise agreement last month, the conflict between the two has played out publicly. While Tareen, the owner of Multan Sultans, has doubled down his criticism on the social media, the board has dropped subtle hints on the path it plans to venture. Sunday brought more developments as Tareen accused the PSL management for leaking the legal notice to “their favoured media”. “For the record, we received the legal notice on 12th Sept,” the post said. “Our legal team sent them a detailed reply. Since then, we had chosen to stay silent and not make the issue public. Because nothing could be more damaging to the league than this. “But then, the PSL management decided to leak parts of the notice to their favoured media last week. Perhaps they mistook our restraint for weakness. And one torn notice later, we are where we are. Lets (sic) see where it all ends up.” An hour later, the PCB, in an update about the meeting between Mohsin Naqvi, its chairperson, and Ernst&Young, the independent audit firm hired for the valuation of the six franchises and the PSL’s brand value, reiterated that it would extend the franchise renewal offer to only those franchisees who have been in compliance with the franchise agreement. Sources tell Dawn that Tareen has sought intervention of politicians and fellow franchisees to mediate with the PCB. Tareen has been directing his criticism towards PCB in the lead-up to this year’s PSL. He, primarily, reiterated complaints of the ordinary fans by highlighting the substandard fan experience in stadia around the country and criticised the board for the lack of innovation in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), which he claimed resulted in the decline of the league. He blamed the board for being content with “mediocrity” and questioned the credentials and ability of the PCB staffers. With the PCB’s contracts with the six PSL franchisees, title and other sponsors, and broadcast right holders lapsing this year, Tareen’s frequent criticism of the league worried the PCB about its implications. The PCB suspected that Tareen desired to sabotage the league to adversely affect the valuation process and bring down the market value of his franchise — which the board has stated in its legal notice to Tareen. The board officials also lamented that rather than contributing in the PSL governing council meetings during which Multan Sultans owner and representatives remained silent, Tareen resorted to attack the decisions on the social media – again, something that the PCB wrote in its notice. Tareen took over as the sole owner of Multan Sultans late 2023 after the passing of his uncle, Alamgir Tareen. He and his uncle had bid USD6.3million — almost the double of the reserve price set by the PCB — for the team in 2019 after the PCB had terminated the franchise agreement with Schon Properties Broker LLC for their failure to meet the financial obligations. (PCB has pegged dollar at PKR170 for the annual franchise fee). The PCB contemplated sending a legal notice to Tareen during this year’s tournament — which it also mentioned in the notice — but refrained from doing so, fearing it may harm the league’s image. Tareen responded to the legal notice on 2 October, but the chances of a reconciliation seem bleak after he ripped the PCB’s legal notice on camera. His act has publicly challenged PCB’s stature as the game’s governing body in the country and pushed its chief into a corner. There are many within and outside the country who are anticipating the response. Naqvi is embroiled in a conflict with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the Asia Cup silverware matter. The matter will rear its head once again next month when cricket chiefs gather for an International Cricket Council (ICC) conclave. The BCCI will be keen to observe how Naqvi responds to the pressure publicly exerted by one of the PSL franchise owners back home and the outcome of this saga will provide a template on how far they can stretch Naqvi. Similarly, it will also lay marker for other franchisees and stakeholders of the game within Pakistan. It is unprecedented for an owner of a PSL team to launch searing diatribes against the PCB. And, the outcome of this stand-off will go on to lengthen the list of unprecedented developments in Pakistan cricket.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has held separate meetings with British High Commissioner Jane Marriott and US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker, focusing on bilateral relations, regional developments, and areas of mutual interest, his office said on Sunday. The meetings underlined Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen ties with both the United Kingdom and the United States. Relations with the UK have been revitalised through the resumption of flight operations after a five-year gap and initiatives like the newly inaugurated Centre of Excellence in Islamabad, a joint project enhancing Pakistan’s capacity to tackle transnational crime and streamline mutual legal assistance and extradition processes. At the same time, engagement with the US reflects growing collaboration on security and counterterrorism . According to a post on the Interior Ministry’s X account, during the discussions, both sides emphasised enhancing cooperation in counter-narcotics, human trafficking, and security. “Naqvi expressed gratitude to the British government and High Commissioner Marriott for resuming flight operations to the UK after a five-year hiatus,” the post said. The Pakistan International Airlines operated its inaugural flight from Islamabad to Manchester on Saturday. The national flag carrier launched its flights to the United Kingdom after receiving the Third Country Operator (TCO) approval for flight operations. In the second phase, the flight operation will be extended to Birmingham and London. Both envoys also lauded the Pakistan Navy’s recent anti-narcotics operation . On October 23, Pakistan Navy ship Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea. According to the Com­bined Maritime Force (CMF) — a naval partnership that includes the US Navy — the Pakistani naval vessel intercepted two different ‘dhow’ sailing boats within 48 hours last week. Marriott briefed the minister on the upcoming visit of the Director General of the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) next month. “During the visit, memorandums of understanding will be signed in the fields of immigration and counter-narcotics,” the post said. Minister Naqvi highlighted projects like the Centre of Excellence, supported by the British High Commission, as crucial for enhancing the capacity of Pakistani institutions. “The initiative will further strengthen cooperation between Pakistan and the UK on mutual legal assistance and extradition matters,” the statement quoted him as saying. The British High Commissioner reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to its ties with Pakistan, while Naqvi reiterated Pakistan’s determination to work with the international community to eliminate terrorism. Meanwhile, Chargé d’Affaires Baker described Pakistan’s efforts against terrorism and extremism as commendable and pledged continued cooperation in security and counterterrorism. In August, Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Gregory LoGerfo and Baker participated in the US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue, advancing their shared resolve to combat the global threat. According to a statement from the Foreign Office, the dialogue was co-chaired by Special Secretary (UN) Ambassador Nabeel Munir and LoGerfo, adding that the two delegations underscored the critical importance of developing effective approaches to terrorist threats, including those posed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).",

      "summary_orig": "The Punjab government has revised school timings starting Monday in response to worsening smog across the province, with daily sessions now beginning at 8:45am. Lahore has ranked as the world’s most polluted city for the past three days, with air quality plummeting to hazardous levels as smog blanketed the city and the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) hitting 412, prompting health warnings and a province-wide crackdown on pollution sources. The Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a high alert across the eastern districts of the province, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Khanpur. According to Director General PDMA Irfan Ali Kathia, the intensity of smog is expected to increase from November to mid-December, citing forecasts from the Meteorological Department. The announcement was made by Punjab Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat on his X account, in light of the current smog situation. “Winter school timing — 8:45am to 1:30pm”, the minister announced. Separately, commenting on the smog situation, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said during a media briefing that the province now had a comprehensive digital and AI-based forecasting system in place. She said it had been developed using data from previous years, adding that it was accessible to the public through the air quality portal and was released a day in advance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Reflecting on opinions regarding the smog situation, she said, “First of all, all those who have suddenly become environmental experts these days and issue reports or make statements as they please, I want to clarify that smog is a seasonal phenomenon.” She said the seasons last for only three months, when the easterly corridor from east to west causes temperature inversions and cold air forms a lid over the atmosphere. “Within that lid, particulate pollutants become trapped because the air above is cold. That lid, together with atmospheric pressure, creates a haze that we call smog,” she explained. Marriyum emphasised that the people of Lahore and Punjab must realise that “it cannot be that yesterday the AQI was 160 and today, because of local pollutants, it has suddenly jumped to 380.” She explained that it is common for pollution levels to rise early in the morning due to colder temperatures, but as the day warms and upper-air conditions shift, the air becomes denser and “particulate matter starts to disperse.” The minister said that smog guns were being used only as an artificial and temporary measure. “Previously, smog was managed during the season by shutting schools, restaurants and imposing lockdown-style restrictions. But for the first time, we are not only managing smog in the season without resorting to closures; we are also improving Lahore’s Air Quality Index,” she added. Marriyum said the government’s work extended beyond the smog season. “We are not only active during these three months,” she said, “but carrying out smog mitigation efforts throughout the year.”",

Tensions between Islamabad and Kabul flared up earlier this month over accusations of terrorism, as border clashes killed 23 Pakistani troops as well as 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists after an attack by Kabul, which it claimed was retaliation for Islamabad conducting air strikes in its territory. A first round of talks in Doha last weekend led to a ceasefire agreement, with both governments seeking to firm up the agreement in more talks yesterday. Trump, who was previously involved in brokering a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in May of this year as well as a peace deal between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas, arrived today in Malaysia to attend a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Kuala Lumpur, while also co-signing a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia. Addressing the border dispute on the sidelines of an Asean summit today, Trump referred to it as “one of eight wars that my administration has ended in just eight months”. “We’re averaging one a month. There’s only one left,” he said. “Although I heard that Pakistan and Afghanistan have started up, but I’ll get that solved very quickly.” View this post on Instagram He added, “I know them both … the Pakistan field marshal and the prime minister are great people, and I know we’re gonna get that done quickly. That one started up a few days ago.” Referring to his own role in halting wars around the world, the US president said, “I just feel it’s something I can do. I do it nicely. “I don’t need to do it, I guess,” he added. “But if I can take time and save millions of lives, that’s really a great thing. I can’t think of anything better to do.” Trump had previously thanked both Shehbaz and “my favourite” Munir for their efforts in securing the ceasefire deal in Gaza, while Shehbaz praised Trump’s “exemplary [and] visionary leadership” and reconfirmed Pakistan’s plan to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize 2026. When the fighting broke out between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the US president was quick to express interest in assisting with establishing peace, although he was at the time occupied with overseeing a hostage exchange between Hamas and Israel. “I said, ‘I’ll have to wait till I get back. I am doing another one,’” he told reporters at the time. “Because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace, and it is an honour to do it.”",

      "summary_orig": "New Zealand overcame a blitz from centurion Harry Brook to beat England by four wickets on Sunday in the opening game of their three-match one-day international series, with Daryl Mitchell and Michael Bracewell scoring half-centuries. The hosts wobbled chasing 224, losing four quick wickets, including former captain Kane Williamson for a first-ball duck in his first match for the side since March, but Mitchell took them home with an unbeaten 78 after being dropped on 33. Bracewell also earned a reprieve early on and ran himself out for 51 to open the door for England after the initial burst from Brydon Carse (3-45), but New Zealand got back on track thanks to Mitch Santner’s 27 and prevailed in 36.4 overs. “There was still a lot in the wicket,” skipper Santner said. “We lost a couple more than we would have liked in the chase but the intent was great … Daryl and Michael’s partnership was massive for us.” England recovered from a disastrous start as captain Brook bludgeoned 135 from 101 balls and Jamie Overton made 46 to help their side finish on 223 all out in 35.2 overs for a fighting chance in the contest. Asked to bat first at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui, England were rocked early by New Zealand’s seamers as Zak Foulkes (4-41) and Matt Henry (2-53) reduced the tourists to 56-6 within 12 devastating overs in helpful conditions. ‘Great start’ “Yeah it was tough work in the end, but I think the way we started off, with wickets in the powerplay, it’s always a great start,” Santner said. “We know Matt can do that and then Zak was outstanding, the way he swung it. It looks like a nightmare facing him. Obviously long spells, but we knew wickets were massive because even when they’re four or five down they’ve got (batsmen). “Getting Brook earlier would have been nice but he was outstanding today.” Brook went into attack mode despite the carnage around him and brought up his fifty in 36 balls with a top-edged six off Nathan Smith, before Overton took his team’s total to three figures with another big hit off Jacob Duffy (3-55). Overton shrugged off being hit on the helmet by Smith and closed in on his own half-century, but departed four runs short after a fine catch on the second attempt by Mitchell that ended the 87-run seventh-wicket partnership. Consecutive sixes Duffy removed Carse with the very next ball to leave England teetering again on 143-8, but Brook took control following Adil Rashid’s fall shortly afterwards, reaching his ton with three consecutive sixes and taking his side past 200 runs. A belligerent Brook continued to deal in big shots, swelling his tally of sixes to 11, but was snared trying to sweep Santner out of the park as New Zealand stopped the bleeding to stay on top in the series opener. “I felt I was in good touch,” man of the match Brook said. “Obviously we didn’t get off to a great start and I tried to take it up on myself to have a counter-punch. Thankfully it came off today. “I’ve done it a few times actually, it’s a do-or-die moment. I managed to get us a decent score to defend. We started nicely with the ball, but we just struggled to take wickets throughout the middle.” The second game takes place in Hamilton on Wednesday, with New Zealand seeking another victory after losing the preceding rain-hit Twenty20 series between the teams 1-0.",

      "summary_orig": "With no majority in parliament and surrounded by allies outraged by his acceptance of a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to have set his sights on Israel’s next elections. A political phoenix, Netanyahu is the country’s longest-serving prime minister, has been its dominant political figure for decades and heads one of the most right-wing coalitions in Israel’s history.

Under pressure from US President Donald Trump, Netanyahu agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas that came into effect on October 10 after more than two years of Israeli assault on Gaza. His far-right allies vehemently denounced the agreement, arguing that the military should retain control of the entire Gaza Strip and crush the Palestinian movement for good. And while they are not abandoning the ship of government, they are raising the price to keep them on board. June 2026 election? “The coalition has been weakened by the ceasefire agreement,” said independent analyst Michael Horowitz. “For Netanyahu, the issue is no longer so much about preserving his coalition until the end as it is about positioning himself to win the next elections — even if they are brought forward,” he told AFP. In a televised interview on October 18, Netanyahu said that he would run for office in the next elections and that he expected to win. Those polls are required to take place by late October 2026, but Netanyahu, who has just turned 76, may call early elections or be forced into a fresh vote if another of his allied parties abandons the ruling coalition. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has already threatened to stop voting with the coalition if his bill calling for “the death penalty for terrorists” is not put to a parliamentary vote by November 9. Netanyahu must grapple with ideological differences from his far-right partners, who favour resuming the war on Gaza with a view to taking over the territory, from which Israel unilaterally withdrew in 2005. He must also contend with pressure from his allies in the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Shas party, which has 11 lawmakers and has distanced itself from the government. Without formally leaving the coalition, Shas ministers resigned from the cabinet in July over the issue of military service exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jews.\nThe coalition’s other ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, quit both the government and the coalition. Several Israeli journalists, including the high-profile Amit Segal, who is known to be close to Netanyahu, have suggested the premier would opt for June 2026 for early elections. For now, Netanyahu must overcome several obstacles to remain in power, most notably the issue of conscription for ultra-Orthodox Jews. Shas says it will pull its support unless military service exemption is enshrined in law, while the far-right and many in Netanyahu’s Likud party want to force ultra-Orthodox conscription.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has fixed for hearing a petition seeking the closure of former prime minister Imran Khan’s X (formerly Twitter) account. Meanwhile, a district court in the capital extended the interim bail of the PTI founder’s wife, Bushra Bibi, in a protest case. According to the cause list issued by the IHC registrar’s office, the petition will be taken up on November 4 by Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir. The court has already issued notices to the PTI founder, the National Cyber Crime Agency, the superintendent of prisons and other relevant officials seeking written responses. The petition filed by a citizen, Ghulam Murtaza, through Barrister Zafarullah contended that the PTI founder was allegedly broadcasting illegal and provocative messages from his X account while in prison. The petitioner maintained that such an online activity could incite public unrest and undermine law and order. It requested the court to order the removal of all unlawful or disruptive posts and to restrain any future dissemination of similar material. Meanwhile, the district and sessions court extended the interim bail granted to Bushra Bibi in a case linked to a protest held on November 26. The hearing, scheduled before Judge Chaudhry Amir Zia, was postponed due to his unavailability. The case, registered at the Ramna police station under multiple sections including the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act, accuses the PTI leadership of organising an unlawful assembly and inciting unrest. The court adjourned the hearing until November 15 and summoned the parties to present their arguments. Imaan Mazari tweet case Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka on Saturday dismissed the objections raised by the defence to the supplementary challan submitted by the prosecution in the controversial tweet case against Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatta. The court also rejected the prosecution’s miscellaneous application seeking voice matching of the accused and fixed October 29 for framing of charges. During the hearing at the district and sessions court, the assistant counsel for defence lawyer Qaiser Imam informed the court that the lead counsel was engaged in other cases and would appear shortly. The judge adjourned proceedings for a short break and resumed the hearing at 9:30am. Upon resumption, Advocate Qaiser Imam appeared on behalf of Imaan Mazari, while Advocate Kifayat Wazir represented co-accused Hadi Ali Chatta. Prosecutor Muhammad Usman Rana appeared on behalf of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which had registered the case. Advocate Qaiser Imam presented detailed arguments opposing the supplementary challan, contending that a final challan had already been submitted earlier in the case, leaving no legal ground for an additional submission. He argued that the supplementary challan was “legally inadmissible” since the investigation was considered complete once the final report was filed. The court had reserved its decision on both the defence’s objections and the prosecution’s voice-matching application earlier in the day. Later, Judge Majoka announced the verdict, dismissing both requests and scheduling October 29 as the date for the formal indictment of the accused. The case pertains to a controversial tweet allegedly posted by Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatta, which led the NCCIA to initiate proceedings under cybercrime and related laws.

The case, registered at the Ramna police station under multiple sections including the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act, accuses the PTI leadership of organising an unlawful assembly and inciting unrest. The court adjourned the hearing until November 15 and summoned the parties to present their arguments. Imaan Mazari tweet case Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka on Saturday dismissed the objections raised by the defence to the supplementary challan submitted by the prosecution in the controversial tweet case against Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatta. The court also rejected the prosecution’s miscellaneous application seeking voice matching of the accused and fixed October 29 for framing of charges. During the hearing at the district and sessions court, the assistant counsel for defence lawyer Qaiser Imam informed the court that the lead counsel was engaged in other cases and would appear shortly. The judge adjourned proceedings for a short break and resumed the hearing at 9:30am. Upon resumption, Advocate Qaiser Imam appeared on behalf of Imaan Mazari, while Advocate Kifayat Wazir represented co-accused Hadi Ali Chatta. Prosecutor Muhammad Usman Rana appeared on behalf of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which had registered the case. Advocate Qaiser Imam presented detailed arguments opposing the supplementary challan, contending that a final challan had already been submitted earlier in the case, leaving no legal ground for an additional submission. He argued that the supplementary challan was “legally inadmissible” since the investigation was considered complete once the final report was filed. The court had reserved its decision on both the defence’s objections and the prosecution’s voice-matching application earlier in the day. Later, Judge Majoka announced the verdict, dismissing both requests and scheduling October 29 as the date for the formal indictment of the accused. The case pertains to a controversial tweet allegedly posted by Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatta, which led the NCCIA to initiate proceedings under cybercrime and related laws.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) laun­ched a strong verbal attack on the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)-led Sindh government on Saturday, accusing it of failing to curb street crimes in the metropolis, improve law and order, tackle corruption and address inflation and police excesses across the province. Addressing a press conference at the party’s city office, Insaf House, Karachi, Sindh chapter president Haleem Adil Sheikh said that state institutions in the province had “ceased to function effectively”. “Sindh is the land of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai and hospitality, but today, oppression and lawlessness prevail,” he lame­nted, holding the PPP government responsible for the province’s deteriorating situation. Citing a recent case of “pol­ice brutality,” he referred to the case of a young labourer, Irfan Baloch, who had come from Uch Sharif, Punjab, to Karachi for work, and was allegedly abduc­ted and tortured to death by the CIA police. Haleem Adil says over 50 citizens killed by robbers this year “No FIR has been registered yet,” he said, warning that if jus­t­ice was denied, it would pro­ve that “the police institution itself is complicit in this brutality.” Accompanied by PTI Sindh leaders Jamal Siddiqui, Farukh Khan and others, the PTI provincial chief also highlighted the alarming rise in street crimes in the metropolis. “In September alone, 199 cars, 3,698 motorcycles, and 1,542 mobile phones were snatched, while 51 citizens were killed resisting robberies this year,” he said. Mr Sheikh questioned why the authorities had failed to take action against the patrons of 72 dacoits who recently surrendered in Shikarpur’s Katcha area, noting that “no hostages had been recovered”. “The Katcha areas have tur­ned into no-go zones. Law and order in Sindh has collapsed, and police excesses are rampant,” he said. Referring to the Auditor General of Pakistan’s 2024-25 report , the PTI provincial chief said that “financial irregularities worth Rs836 billion” had been unearthed in Sindh government departments. “Seventeen years of PPP rule have pushed Sindh to the brink of destruction. Corruption has infested every institution,” he said. He said the citizens were being “crushed under rising inflation” and that “corruption” had become routine. “Flour, sugar, vegetables, pulses, ghee, electricity, and gas have all become unaffordable. People must break their silence, as remaining quiet now means abetting crime,” he warned. Mr Sheikh also deplored the dismal state of education and healthcare in Sindh, saying that “more than six million children are out of school,” hospitals lack basic facilities, and dengue cases are surging. He criticised the provincial government for “denying” citizens access to the Sehat Card and “exploiting” farmers who were not getting fair prices for their crops. He further alleged large-scale corruption in the Sindh Solar Energy Programme, which is a Rs28 billion World Bank-funded project. “Fake import documents were used, and the actual price of solar fans was $23.4 per unit, but the Sindh government contracted them for $151 per unit. On top of that, Rs127 million in fake tax claims were filed,” he claimed. Published in Dawn, October 26th, 2025",

In the Jhallar area of North Waziristan, security forces killed three militants and averted a “potential catastrophic attack” by destroying a vehicle being prepared for a suicide attack, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. Acting on intelligence about the presence of “ Khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al-Khawarij ”, troops “effectively engaged” the militants’ location and destroyed the vehicle besides killing three militants. SHO wounded in follow-up action after attack on SP The state uses the term Fitna al-Khawarij to refer to militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “A sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored Kharji found in the area as a relentless counterterrorism campaign … by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the ISPR said. Separately, security officials said a targeted operation in War Mamund tehsil of Bajaur left five militants dead and several injured. The operation, conducted on intelligence reports about the presence of militants in the Badan area, continued over two days, according to residents who confirmed sustained movement by security forces. Local sources claimed the militants were using a mosque built for refugees as a hideout. The ISPR did not immediately issue a statement on the Bajaur operation. Leaders of the Bajaur Aman Jirga staged a demonstration in the Umary area on Saturday evening, demanding that authorities avoid harm to civilians during operations. In Hangu, four militants were killed in an exchange of fire in the rugged mountains on Friday evening. The operation was launched after an improvised explosive device (IED) attack that martyred SP (Operations) Asad Zubair and two guards. The SHO of the Doaba police station was injured in the ensuing action. The area has witnessed repeated attacks attributed to the banned TTP in recent months. Published in Dawn, October 26th, 2025",

Data revealed that Lower Mall was the worst-affected neighbourhood, with an AQI of 680, followed by Iqbal Town (577), Syed Maratib Ali Road (543), Shadman (507), the Punjab University area (506), and Shalimar (495). Environmental experts have urged residents to avoid unnecessary outdoor activity, particularly in the morning and evening, and to wear masks when outside. PM2.5 concentrations in Lahore’s air are multiple times above global safety thresholds, raising risks of respiratory and cardiovascular illness among other serious health issues, especially for children and the elderly. The Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a high alert across eastern districts of the province, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Khanpur. “The intensity of smog is expected to increase from November to mid-December,” warned DG PDMA Irfan Ali Kathia, citing forecasts from the Meteorological Department. The PDMA has directed all commissioners and deputy commissioners to ensure the implementation of government measures to combat smog. The authorities have announced a strict, multi-pronged strategy to tackle the pollution at its source. A comprehensive ban has been imposed on the burning of crop residues, solid waste, tires, plastic and rubber. Mr Kathia stated that a case would be registered for any violation, including the burning of crop stubble and garbage. Simultaneously, the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) has intensified its anti-smog operations, using advanced drone cameras to monitor industrial zones, agricultural land, and urban areas. In the last 24 hours, this tech-driven initiative identified over 460 smog-related violations. More than 200 e-challans were issued to smoke-emitting vehicles, with real-time data shared with departments for immediate action. While enforcement is critical, the government is also pushing for long-term, sustainable solutions. At a seminar in the Kabirwala town of Khanewal district, the Department of Environmental Protection and Climate Change educated farmers on using modern machinery to manage crop residue, particularly rice stubble, without burning. Officials and experts highlighted that this waste can be repurposed in biomass plants to generate steam and energy, turning an environmental problem into an economic opportunity. “Smog is a serious environmental and public health issue, requiring collective and coordinated efforts to address it,” said Project Coordinator Dr Younus Zahid. As the government leverages technology for enforcement and promotes alternative farming practices, the public has been urged to play its part. Citizens have been asked to report smog-inducing activities on the emergency helpline 15, with authorities emphasising that only a collective effort can clear the hazardous air and protect public health. Earlier, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said that nine departments were conducting large-scale operations against smog. The minister said that the environmental protection force and the department were fully mobilised, that all sectoral squads were present in the field, and that brick kilns were being monitored through drones, in addition to issuing a live report. She added that anti-smog cannons and air-quality monitors are deployed and that AQI forecasting, which she said has been introduced for the first time in Punjab, has enabled earlier interventions to curb pollution spikes.

Only a picture of Mr Zardari’s meeting with the lawmakers was issued by Saturday night, while a handout issued by the PPP regarding the meeting with Mr Bhutto-Zardari also did not mention the possibility of a no-confidence motion against the AJK premier. The party leaders discussed the AJK’s “political situation” in the meeting, said the official statement. Sources, however, claimed the party meeting considered names for Mr Haq’s successor. They said the PPP had “almost finalised” the decision to oust the AJK prime minister through a no-trust motion. A formal decision, according to sources, is likely in a day or two. The insiders said the party leaders deliberated upon all possible options, including giving some time to the AJK prime minister for “an honourable exit”, before making any move to remove the premier through a no-trust vote. According to the sources, the meeting also explored potential successors, with Chaudhry Yaseen, Chaudhry Latif Akbar and Sardar Yaqoob emerging as strong contenders for the coveted post. In the AJK assembly, the PPP, with the support of the PML-N, has the support of more than 27 lawmakers — a magic number required to form the government. The PPP has 17 members in the house, 10 of whom are ministers and two are advisers, while AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar also hails from the PPP. It may be noted that the PPP had already decided it would not remain a part of the government, but it remained undecided about whether to sit on the opposition benches or form its own government in the region. Meanwhile, the official statement by the party said that Mr Bhutto-Zardari presided over the PPP AJK Parliamentary group meeting and “discussed the political situation” in AJK. The statement added that the PPP leaders of the AJK chapter discussed improving the organisational structure of the party in the region and the current political situation in AJK. The meeting was also attended by former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and former Kashmir affairs minister Qamar Zaman Kaira, who had recently led a federal government delegation to talk to the protesters in AJK and remained successful in ending the protest after an agreement was signed in the first week of October. At least 10 had been killed while scores were injured in clashes between the law enforcers and the protesters that lasted for days. PPP Women Wing’s Central President Faryal Talpur was also present in the meeting. Others who attended the meeting included Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, Faisal Mumtaz, Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Sardar Javed Ayub, Sardar Muhammad Yaqub Khan, Mian Abdul Waheed, Javed Iqbal Bandhanvi, Syed Bazil Naqvi, Syed Zia Qamar, Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Chaudhry Aamir Yasin, Aamir Ghaffar Lone, Javed Butt, Rafiq Nayyar, Nabila Ayub, Chaudhry Muhammad Riaz, and Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.
