      "summary_orig": "A Levies constable deployed for the security of a polio team was killed when unidentified assailants opened fire on him in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district on Tuesday, according to the police. The attack comes a day after the government launched a nationwide polio eradication campaign, aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children. A special order was issued for the campaign, with the deployment of 285 police personnel across the country to provide security to the vaccination teams. According to Swat’s District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan, the martyred Levies constable was performing his duty along with a polio team comprising two female health workers. “The workers were administering vaccines inside a house while the constable was standing guard outside when he was attacked,” he said. “The assailants fled the scene after the incident.” Khan added that police and law enforcement officials had reached the area and launched an investigation. “The area has been cordoned off, and a search operation is underway to arrest the culprits. No anti-state elements will be allowed to sabotage peace in Swat,” he said, adding that those involved in the attack would be brought to justice. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and paid tribute to the official who was martyred in the shooting. In a statement, he expressed his heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the family of the deceased. “The assailants who fired on the team that was securing the future of children do not deserve any concession,” the statement quoted him as saying. Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in KP. Data from September showed that the number of vaccine refusals in KP dropped in the most recent immunisation drive. However, in some areas, such as Lowi Mamund tehsil, residents announced a boycott of the drive. In May, a policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was martyred in a gun attack by unidentified assailants in Balochistan’s Noshki district, while another was killed in KP’s Bajaur district in February . Meanwhile, in August, two more polio cases were reported in KP, bringing the national tally to 23 this year. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had previously claimed similar attacks on polio teams, falsely portraying the inoculation campaigns as a Western conspiracy to sterilise children. Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts.",

      "summary_orig": "Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Tuesday dismissed the presence of an insurgency in the province, blaming “India-backed so-called separatist movements” for the worsening security situation. In recent months, Balochistan has witnessed a rise in terrorist attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces. Addressing participants of the 17th National Workshop in Quetta, the chief minister maintained that there was “no insurgency in Balochistan but so-called separatist movements” in the province. “The purpose of these anti-state elements is to harm and divide Pakistan,” he said. He added that the Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was behind the deterioration of the security situation in the province. “The Indian agency RAW has a clear role behind the deteriorating situation in Balochistan,” he said. “Separatists are pleased with India but want to harm Pakistan.” CM Bugti added that the war against terrorism was not only the armed forces’ prerogative but “the whole nation’s joint fight”. He added that a “false impression of uneven development” was deliberately created in the province to sow division, adding that terms like “disgruntled Baloch were coined to justify terrorism”. “A person who resorts to violence and takes up arms is not angry but a terrorist,” he said. The chief minister also said that distances were created between the youth and the state through social media propaganda. “The government is going to universities and every forum to hear the grievances of the youth,” he maintained. Bugti said that in order to improve the security situation in the province and deal with terrorism, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD)’s capacity was being enhanced. “For this purpose, Rs100 million has been allocated. Security forces are conducting operations in areas where it is difficult to distinguish between friends and foes,” he said. According to recent reports issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), the first three quarters of 2025 in the country saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024. In 2024, KP recorded the highest number of terrorist incidents with 295 attacks; meanwhile, attacks by various outlawed Baloch insurgent groups, primarily the BLA and the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), saw a staggering 119 per cent increase , accounting for 171 incidents in Balochistan.",

      "title_orig": "26th Amendment case: CJP has power to form full court, lawyer tells Constitutional Bench",
      "summary_orig": "Senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi on Tuesday told the Supreme Court’s (SC) Constitutional Bench (CB) that the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) had the power to form a full court as it took up a set of petitions against the 26th Amendment . The 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the CJP’s term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment. The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. Thus far, Zuberi , Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan , Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA)’s counsel Munir A. Malik , and petitioner Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed have presented their arguments. They have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the legality of the 26th Amendment. The case was initially taken up in January , and after the CB’s approval of petitioners’ request for it, the proceedings were being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8. The hearing Zuberi, also a former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president, continued his arguments in the case today. The hearing was later adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow. The live-stream for the hearing began with a delay of about 40 minutes due to internet issues. The Pakistan Telecommunications Limited (PTCL) has said users would experience degraded internet services today as a submarine cable is being repaired . “There are internet issues today. The live stream will not be possible,” Justice Aminuddin said at the outset of the hearing. Justice Mazhar also said the livestream YouTube link was down and asked staff to check this. Zuberi then cited various past court verdicts to support his arguments. “A party cannot raise an objection on the judge. The judge has the authority [to decide] whether to hear a case or not,” the former SCBA president said. “On the one hand, you are saying 16 judges and on the other, you also talk about ‘collective knowledge’,” Justice Mandokhail remarked when Zuberi sought a full court comprising pre-Amendment judges. The judge asked the lawyer to clarify what his request was. “Do not say a full court; say ‘those judges who were present from before the Amendment’,” Justice Mandokhail said. Zuberi referred to the case upholding Practice and Procedure Act 2023 and contended that the current eight-member bench would not give the petitioners the right to appeal. “The number of judges nominated as part of the Constitutional Bench is 15, whereas at least nine more judges are needed for hearing an appeal,” Zuberi said. Here, Justice Ayesha observed that it was now the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s prerogative whether to give someone the right to appeal or not. She said the JCP could “give the right to appeal by nominating additional judges, [but] if it did not wish so, then the right to appeal can also be taken away”. “This is simply a matter of the judiciary’s independence,” she remarked. Justice Mandokhail then pointed out that even a 16-member bench, as sought by Zuberi, would not have the right to appeal. Zuberi said the SC had declared that the right to appeal was not mandatory for “decisions based on collective knowledge”. Justice Mandokhail questioned how Article 191A , under which the constitutional benches were formed in the SC, could be ignored, as it was a part of the Constitution. Justice Ayesha noted that there were past verdicts present on “how the challenged provisions are kept aside”, at which Justice Mandokhail said to let Zuberi answer the question. The lawyer contended that benches will be formed under the newly framed Supreme Court Rules 2025 , explaining that a committee will form the benches as per Order 11 of the Rules. Justice Mandokhail remarked, “Nowhere in these rules is it written that only the chief justice will form the benches.” Zuberi contended that the full court was not a bench. “Your judgment is also present on how full courts have been constituted until now.” Justice Mandokhail replied that the SC Rules 2025 should have mentioned the procedure for a full court. The hearing also witnessed a disagreement between Justice Mandokhail and Justice Ayesha over the procedure for adopting the SC Rules 2025. Justice Mandokhail remarked that all “24 judges” had convened regarding the SC Rules, which were “made in front of them”. Justice Ayesha interjected: “They were not made in front of everyone. My note exists.” She was among four judges who expressed their reservations regarding the process being adopted for rules’ approval and stayed away from a September full court administrative meeting. In response, Justice Mandokhail asked that the meeting notes be brought. “All judges were told to give their input. This case will not proceed further unless this matter is clarified.” The exchange prompted Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, who was present during the hearing, to urge the judges not to discuss the matter in court as it was their “internal matter”. Justice Mandokhail said, “I am being called a liar here. A meeting of [all] 24 judges was held. The matter regarding some provisions was referred to the committee. A few judges gave their input and some did not.” Justice Ayesha then said that the Practice and Procedure Committee , which comprises senior judges who form benches for constitutional matters and suo motu notices, had “been made to constitute benches [and] it has not been given the powers to make a full court”. “[…] That vests in the Supreme Court; that’s the inherent jurisdiction,” she added. “And the power of the [Practice and Procedure] Committee is not the power of the chief justice. They are two different entities,” Justice Ayesha said, which Zuberi agreed with. “We are not talking about benches, but full courts,” the judge said. Here, Justice Aminuddin asked Zuberi whether the CJP had the authority to form a full court comprising CB judges, to which the lawyer replied: “That inherent power of the chief justice is still available to the honourable chief justice.” The ex-SCBA president cited several past judgments and asserted that the CB could issue directives to form a full court. Justice Aminuddin remarked, “You are asking us to tell the chief justice that he may constitute a full court, but in that [case], he formed it himself.” Zuberi referred to a paragraph in the 1998 Malik Asad Ali case and argued that a three-member bench “had directed the acting chief justice to constitute the full court”. He added that the acting chief justice declined, at which the matter was sent to the then-senior puisne judge, who formed a full court. The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow. The petitions The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",

Justice Aminuddin remarked, “You are asking us to tell the chief justice that he may constitute a full court, but in that [case], he formed it himself.” Zuberi referred to a paragraph in the 1998 Malik Asad Ali case and argued that a three-member bench “had directed the acting chief justice to constitute the full court”. He added that the acting chief justice declined, at which the matter was sent to the then-senior puisne judge, who formed a full court. The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow. The petitions The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",

Addressing Israel’s Knesset on Monday ahead of joining an international peace summit in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh, Trump said that Iran wants to reach a peace deal with the US “even if they said, ‘We don’t want to make a deal,’”. In a statement carried by the state news agency IRNA , the foreign ministry said: “The US, as the world’s largest generator of terrorism and supporter of the terrorist and genocidal Zionist (Israeli) regime, has no moral authority to level accusations against others.” “The repetition of false claims regarding Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme can in no way justify the joint crimes of the US and the Zionist regime” in violating Iran’s soil, the ministry said. Israel launched a surprise attack on Tehran on June 13, targeting military, nuclear, and civilian sites as well as senior military commanders and nuclear scientists. Tehran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes, while the US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites . The 12-day conflict came to a halt under a US-sponsored ceasefire that took effect on June 24. The ministry called for holding Washington accountable for its role “in the impunity” of Israel, “including by preventing any effective action against Israel in the UN Security Council and obstructing international judicial processes aimed at prosecuting Israeli criminals.” Since October 2023, Israeli attacks have killed more than 67,800 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, leaving the enclave largely uninhabitable.

      "summary_orig": "A day after experiencing a significant downturn, the Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 index rebounded during intraday trade on Tuesday, gaining over 5,000 points and recouping the previous day’s losses. Bearish sentiment had taken hold of the market on Monday, with the 100-Index plummeting 4,600 points, wiping out Rs534 billion from market capitalisation, amid rising tensions with Afghanistan, political instability in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and violent protests in Punjab. The market had closed at 158,443 points, lower by 4,654 points, or 2.85 per cent. Today, the KSE-100 index surged 5,054.50 points, or 3.19pc, to 163,497.92 by 2pm. Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com that the market had rebounded today as “ tensions with Afghanistan and domestic unrest following the breakup of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protests had eased overnight”. “After entering a corrective phase following the trade data released on October 2, participants are now focused on next week’s current account print and progress toward a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund,” he said. Stating that 12,334 new investor accounts were opened in the month of September, Farooq suggested that retail investors take a “long-term approach, build positions gradually, and consider exchange-traded funds or mutual funds if inexperienced”. “While valuations are reasonable, potential slippage on the current account and fiscal side could pose near-term headwinds, and a repeat of the last two years’ returns over the next two years appears unlikely,” he added. Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the market had “rebounded after correction”. He also said the “easing of geopolitical conditions” had supported the market. Intense border fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan that started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning cast a shadow over the bourse yesterday. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. Separately, a crackdown against protesters of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in multiple cities and political uncertainty in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had added more pressure.",

The PTI said the gover­n­­ment could not carry out a transparent probe into the massacre, hence independent observers and hu­­man rights organisations must be included to ensu­­re a fair investigation. In a statement, PTI Central Information Sec­r­etary Sheikh Waqqas Akram condemned the alleged killings of TLP marchers and demanded that all those responsible for the carnage be held accountable and brought to justice without delay.

He lamented that the TLP leadership repeatedly sought dialogue until the very last moment. “Had meaningful dialogue been initiated before the protests began, a peaceful solution could certainly have been found.” Mr Akram called for immediate medical assistance for the injured, along with compensation for the families of those who lost their lives. He also called for an independent, tra­nsparent, and judicial inquiry into the incident to en­­sure that all those responsible are identified and face exemplary punishment.

      "summary_orig": "THE former prime minister of UK, Tony Blair , appears to have been approved by the Palestinian Authority to be involved in the reconstruction of Gaza, after a meeting in Jordan, The Guardian reported. Blair met Hussein al-Sheikh, the deputy president of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, in the Jordanian capital on Sunday. Hamas, which has said it will not have a future role in the government of Gaza, has opposed Blair’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as foreign guardian for Palestine state. In a statement, al-Sheikh said: “Today, I met Mr Tony Blair to discuss the day after the war and making President Trump’s efforts, which aim at stopping the war and establishing lasting peace in the region, a success. We have confirmed our readiness to work with President Trump, Mr Blair and the partners to consolidate the ceasefire, the entry of aid, the release of hostages and prisoners, and then start with the recovery and reconstruction.” Hamas has opposed ex-UK PM’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as guardian for Palestinian state “We stressed the importance of stopping the undermining of the PA, and especially the return of withheld Palestinian revenues, and preventing the undermining of the two-state solution in preparation for a comprehensive and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy,” he was quoted as saying by The Guardian. The PA is keen that tax revenues withheld by the Israeli government are released, since this is preventing salary payments and undermining its liquidity, in violation of the Oslo accords. Israel has also threatened not to renew next month the annual waiver of terrorist financing laws, which allows Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks. Sharhabeel al-Zaeem, the PA’s justice minister, last week criticised Blair’s involvement, saying: “Is this the independent Palest­in­ian state we are aiming for? All these struggles for all these years in order to have Mr Blair, who failed in London, who failed in Bri­tain, who failed in Iraq, come and — with all due respect at a personal level to Mr Blair — be our guardian as if we were minors?” Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he travelled to Israel on Monday, Trump questioned whether Blair would be popular enough with other leaders to serve on the board that the US president envisages overseeing the governance of Gaza.

      "summary_orig": "• Taliban foreign minister claims omission of women journalists from his first media interaction was ‘unintentional’ • UN terms Afghan restrictions on women ‘gender apartheid’ • India’s Ministry of External Affairs denies any role in Friday’s press interaction at Afghan embassy A PICTURE is worth a thousand words — and the image splashed across Indian newspapers on Monday, showing female journalists seated prominently in the front row at the Taliban foreign minister’s press conference in Delhi, perfectly embodies that sentiment. The conference — Amir Khan Muttaqi’s second press event at the Afghan embassy within 48 hours — was convened following widespread outrage over the exclusion of female journalists from his initial briefing on Friday, BBC News reported. Mr Muttaqi said at Sunday’s conference that the exclusion was unintentional and not “deliberate”. “With regard to the [Friday’s] press conference, it was on short notice and a short list of journalists was decided, and the participation list that was presented was very specific. “It was more a technical issue… Our colleagues had decided to send an invitation to a specific list of journalists and there was no other intention apart from this,” he added. The UN has described the situation in Afghanistan as a form of “gender apartheid, ” where women and girls are barred from secondary and higher education, prohibited from visiting parks and gyms, and face growing restrictions on employment. The Taliban government also enforces strict dress codes and limits their freedom of movement. The Taliban, who regained power in 2021, maintain that they uphold women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law. However, Western diplomats say the severe restrictions on women have hindered the group’s efforts to gain international recognition. The curbs on women’s freedoms are widely regarded as the harshest in the world. Mr Muttaqi had arrived in India on Thursday for a week of high-level talks with the government from Russia, the only country so far to fully recognise their government. New Delhi has not officially recognised Afghanistan’s de facto rulers but, like several other countries, continues to maintain limited diplomatic engagement — operating a small mission in Kabul and providing humanitarian assistance to the country. The visit is viewed as a significant step in strengthening ties between the two sides — offering the Taliban a boost in their pursuit of international recognition, while allowing India to advance its strategic and security objectives. On Friday, Mr Muttaqi met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would reopen its embassy in Kabul which was shut after the Taliban returned to power in 2021. The press event later in the day was attended by around 16 male reporters while female journalists were turned away from the embassy gates. India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) clarified that it “had no role” in organising the press interaction, noting that it took place at the Afghan embassy. However, the exclusion of female journalists on Indian soil sparked strong criticism from politicians and media circles, who faulted the government for allowing it.  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that by permitting the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “sending a message to every woman in India that she is too weak to be defended.” Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",

The UN has described the situation in Afghanistan as a form of “gender apartheid, ” where women and girls are barred from secondary and higher education, prohibited from visiting parks and gyms, and face growing restrictions on employment. The Taliban government also enforces strict dress codes and limits their freedom of movement. The Taliban, who regained power in 2021, maintain that they uphold women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law. However, Western diplomats say the severe restrictions on women have hindered the group’s efforts to gain international recognition. The curbs on women’s freedoms are widely regarded as the harshest in the world. Mr Muttaqi had arrived in India on Thursday for a week of high-level talks with the government from Russia, the only country so far to fully recognise their government. New Delhi has not officially recognised Afghanistan’s de facto rulers but, like several other countries, continues to maintain limited diplomatic engagement — operating a small mission in Kabul and providing humanitarian assistance to the country. The visit is viewed as a significant step in strengthening ties between the two sides — offering the Taliban a boost in their pursuit of international recognition, while allowing India to advance its strategic and security objectives. On Friday, Mr Muttaqi met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would reopen its embassy in Kabul which was shut after the Taliban returned to power in 2021. The press event later in the day was attended by around 16 male reporters while female journalists were turned away from the embassy gates. India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) clarified that it “had no role” in organising the press interaction, noting that it took place at the Afghan embassy. However, the exclusion of female journalists on Indian soil sparked strong criticism from politicians and media circles, who faulted the government for allowing it.  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that by permitting the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “sending a message to every woman in India that she is too weak to be defended.” Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Dozens arrested, several injured as armoured vehicles, water cannon used to disperse charged crowd • Police say inspector martyred; around 50 cops badly injured in violent clashes • Conflicting reports emerge about fate of TLP chief; IGP says Saad Rizvi ‘not in custody’ • Second-tier leaders call on TLP supporters to converge on Lahore for protest on 17th LAHORE: The fate of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi remained shrouded in mystery after law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the religious party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes , widespread chaos and dozens of arrests. The operation, which began around 3:30am, quickly spiralled into one of the most serious confrontations between police and TLP in recent months, continuing for nearly six hours. According to officials, some 1,500 police personnel in full anti-riot gear, supported by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons, surrounded the protest camp along the GT Road. By morning, authorities said they had detained hundreds of demonstrators, though exact figures remained unclear. There was, however, a significant discrepancy in casualty reports, with local media reporting a few deaths and dozens of injuries, while social media was rife with exaggerated claims. Nevertheless, Punjab Police confirmed the death of Inspector Shehzad Nawaz, who they said was shot during the operation. Local media reports said that at least four people, including the police officer, had been killed and 56 others injured. Unverified social media posts, however, claimed the toll among TLP supporters was far higher, with some alleging “dozens if not hundreds” of deaths — claims dismissed by Punjab’s police chief, Dr Usman Anwar, as “baseless rumours” and “a conspiracy to evoke public sympathy”. Adding to the uncertainty were unverified reports about the fate of Saad Rizvi, which spread rapidly across social media and WhatsApp groups on Monday. Several posts alleged that Mr Rizvi had been shot and was in critical condition, while other accounts claimed that he had been taken into custody. Interestingly, despite its active online presence, the TLP’s official accounts and spokespersons remained conspicuously silent on the matter, neither confirming nor denying rumours about their leader’s condition or whereabouts. Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that TLP chief Saad Rizvi had not been arrested, nor injured in Monday morning’s clashes. Ripples across the country By mid-morning, the unrest had spread to several other parts of the country. In Lahore, hundreds of TLP supporters took to the streets, blocking key intersections and damaging vehicles in protest at what they called a “brutal crackdown”. In Burewala, five police officers, including a deputy superintendent, were injured when TLP activists clashed with local law enforcers. In Faisalabad, demonstrators blocked the Chenab Chowk for nearly two hours, forcing the Government College University Faisalabad to postpone its scheduled examinations. Further south, dozens of protesters obstructed the national highway at Mian Channu for half an hour, while in Bahawalnagar, TLP members blocked the Bahawalnagar–Head Sulemanki Road near Minchinabad, prompting another round of arrests and the registration of criminal cases under multiple charges. In Karachi, similar scenes played out as TLP activists organised protests in North Karachi and New Karachi to denounce the police action in Punjab. Fear and uncertainty gripped the city as demonstrators blocked major thoroughfares and clashed with police. West Zone deputy inspector general Irfan Ali Baloch said protesters had set up sit-ins at 4-K Chowrangi and Sindhi Hotel, where they blocked roads and attacked police with stones, injuring two constables. “The police responded with tear gas and arrested five of them,” he told Dawn. “The situation was brought under control and traffic resumed.” Late on Monday night, Mufti Wazeer Ahmad Rizvi, a member of the TLP’s Majlis-e-Shura (executive committee), released a video message urging party supporters to end their agitation, clear all roads, and await further instructions. “We will announce our next strategy soon,” he said. Wazir Ahmad Rizvi, the group’s Balochistan emir, also called on protesters to disperse and converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar shrine on Oct 17. Stalled negotiations Explaining why an operation was launched against TLP workers, senior police officials said the crackdown had initially been halted after reports of renewed negotiations between the government and the TLP leadership. However, the talks quickly broke down. “The TLP’s demands were completely unreasonable,” said a senior Punjab police officer involved in the operation. “They wanted security forces withdrawn from the entire route to Islamabad and insisted that all arrested workers be released unconditionally.” According to the official, two rounds of talks were held between the early hours of Tuesday and Saturday night, but no progress was made. When the protesters began to march towards Islamabad despite repeated warnings, police deployed anti-riot units to block their advance. The situation escalated when “armed men among the protesters opened fire on police”, critically injuring Inspector Nawaz. ‘State brutality’ Following the heavy-handed government response, JUI-F’s leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman condemned the government’s use of force against Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists. Describing the operation as “state brutality”, Maulana asserted that the right to peaceful protest is fundamental for every citizen, criticising the government’s violent crackdown on TLP demonstrators as unacceptable. Maulana suggested that the government could have resolved the issue through dialogue rather than resorting to force. However, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif expressed a different perspective on the events, calling the protests “an insult to religion”. “Forming armed groups in the name of religion, blocking roads and holding the public hostage is an insult to religion. For two years, tyranny and a festival of blood were played out in Gaza, yet no one remembers any protests. When the ceasefire happened there, the protests began. The time has come to stop holding our society hostage… through violence in the name of religion,” he wrote on X.

      "summary_orig": "• Trump, China offer to mediate; Russia welcomes ‘stabilisation’ of situation • FO tells Kabul to ‘mind own business’ after Mujahid’s comment on TLP protests • Cross-border trade, travel remain suspended ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Pakistan’s defence minister termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism. On Monday, troops stood on high alert, with border crossings closed for trade and travel after deadly clashes over the weekend. Fighting between the two sides erupted after Pakistan supposedly undertook an operation against militant hideouts along the  Afghan border. Speaking on Geo News , Defence Min­ister Khawaja Asif said that as of today, there are ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”. The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.” Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained. At least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side late on Saturday night. Mediation offers For his part, US President Donald Trump appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, saying he was ‘good at making peace’. “I hear there’s a war now going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel. “I said, I’ll have to wait till I get back. You know, I’m doing another one, because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace,” he said. China, which shares borders with both Pakistan and Afghanistan, also expressed willingness to play a constructive role in improving relations between the two neighbours. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Monday voiced deep concern over the latest clashes, and similar sentiments were also shared by Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday called on Kabul and Islamabad to exercise restraint. “According to the incoming information, the situation is stabilising. We welcome this process,” it stated. ‘Mind your own business’ On the other hand, Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who is on a visit to New Delhi, said Afghanistan did not wish to fight with anyone and all its other neighbours were happy with Kabul. “War is not a solution to problems. There is a need for dialogue. This has been our policy,” Muttaqi told reporters in the Indian capital. But in an uncharacteristic comment about domestic politics, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid criticised Pakistan’s use of force against Tehreek-i-Labbaik protesters. Reacting sharply, the Foreign Office asked the Afghan spokesperson “to prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside [your] jurisdiction”. “The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters.” While the exchange of fire between the two countries ceased on Monday, all entry points have been “closed since Saturday following the unprovoked attacks by the Afghan Taliban forces,” a senior Pakistani security official told Reuters. Another official said there were a few incidents of exchange of small arms fire on Sunday night, but the overall situation was calm. This view was echoed by Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayat­ullah Khowarazmi, who said the “current situation” on the border was normal. However, cross-border trade remained suspended on Monday. Loaded vehicles, including containers and trucks, are stuck on both sides of the border. Besides fresh fruit and vegetables, they are carrying imports and exports and transit trade goods and causing millions of rupees of losses to the two countries as well as traders,” said Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, senior vice president of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry.— Agencies / with input from Baqir Sajjad Syed Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",

The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.” Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained. At least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side late on Saturday night. Mediation offers For his part, US President Donald Trump appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, saying he was ‘good at making peace’. “I hear there’s a war now going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel. “I said, I’ll have to wait till I get back. You know, I’m doing another one, because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace,” he said. China, which shares borders with both Pakistan and Afghanistan, also expressed willingness to play a constructive role in improving relations between the two neighbours. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Monday voiced deep concern over the latest clashes, and similar sentiments were also shared by Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday called on Kabul and Islamabad to exercise restraint. “According to the incoming information, the situation is stabilising. We welcome this process,” it stated. ‘Mind your own business’ On the other hand, Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who is on a visit to New Delhi, said Afghanistan did not wish to fight with anyone and all its other neighbours were happy with Kabul. “War is not a solution to problems. There is a need for dialogue. This has been our policy,” Muttaqi told reporters in the Indian capital. But in an uncharacteristic comment about domestic politics, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid criticised Pakistan’s use of force against Tehreek-i-Labbaik protesters. Reacting sharply, the Foreign Office asked the Afghan spokesperson “to prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside [your] jurisdiction”. “The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters.” While the exchange of fire between the two countries ceased on Monday, all entry points have been “closed since Saturday following the unprovoked attacks by the Afghan Taliban forces,” a senior Pakistani security official told Reuters. Another official said there were a few incidents of exchange of small arms fire on Sunday night, but the overall situation was calm. This view was echoed by Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayat­ullah Khowarazmi, who said the “current situation” on the border was normal. However, cross-border trade remained suspended on Monday. Loaded vehicles, including containers and trucks, are stuck on both sides of the border. Besides fresh fruit and vegetables, they are carrying imports and exports and transit trade goods and causing millions of rupees of losses to the two countries as well as traders,” said Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, senior vice president of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry.— Agencies / with input from Baqir Sajjad Syed Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",

      "summary": "• Trump, China offer to mediate; Russia welcomes ‘stabilisation’ of situation • FO tells Kabul to ‘mind own business’ after Mujahid’s comment on TLP protests • Cross-border trade, travel remain suspended ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Pakistan’s defence minister termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism. On Monday, troops stood on high alert, with border crossings closed for trade and travel after deadly clashes over the weekend. Fighting between the two sides erupted after Pakistan supposedly undertook an operation against militant hideouts along the  Afghan border. Speaking on Geo News , Defence Min­ister Khawaja Asif said that as of today, there are ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now.

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday night issued a strongly-worded statement telling Afghanistan to focus on issues pertinent to itself and not to interfere in Islamabad’s internal affairs. The FO was responding to a statement by Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid slamming the police crackdown on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The TLP, which began its protest march in Lahore on Friday, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. On Monday, police and law enforcement agencies launched an early-morning operation to disperse the protesters, who were encamped in Muridke. The clashes left a police officer and four civilians dead, including three TLP workers. Mujahid issued a statement earlier today in which Kabul expressed its condolences and said it was “profoundly saddened” by the violence and deaths and noted that the demonstrations were carried out “in accordance with the country’s legal framework”. “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and to the entire nation of Pakistan, and we wish a swift recovery to those who have been wounded,” Mujahid’s statement read. “We urge the Pakistani government and its ruling authorities to cease any further acts of violence against their people and to pursue resolution through dialogue and mutual understanding.” In response, the FO took to X and acknowledged the statement, urging Kabul to “prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside their jurisdiction”. “The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters,” the FO wrote. It also urged Kabul to abide by its obligations to the international community under the Doha Process and to “not allow its land to be used for terrorism against other countries”. “Besides, the regime should focus on [the] formation of an inclusive and truly representative government, instead of engaging in baseless propaganda,” the FO concluded.",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump especially thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and “my favourite” Field Marshal Asim Munir on Monday for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza, among many other world leaders. Trump was addressing a ceremony following the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas at the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit in Egypt. He also invited PM Shehbaz to deliver a special address at the ceremony. Taking the podium, PM Shehbaz thanked Trump and the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for their efforts in securing the peace deal. “Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace [and] who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity.” ’’I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team. And today again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East.“ PM Shehbaz said he wanted to salute Trump for his “exemplary [and] visionary leadership”. View this post on Instagram “You are the man this world needed the most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything [and] went out of the way to stop seven and today eight wars,” he added. The premier also thanked the Qatari emir for his efforts in securing peace in Gaza and the wider region, along with the efforts of the Turkish, Saudi and Emirati leadership. “Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, had he not intervened with his wonderful team during those four days, the war could’ve escalated to a level and who would’ve lived to tell what happened.” “Similarly, here in this part of the world in the Middle East, Mr president, your valuable contribution along with President Sisi, I think history will remember in golden words.” Retaking the podium, Trump quipped: “Wow! I didn’t expect that. Let’s go home, there’s nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered, thank you very much.” PM meets other leaders PM Shehbaz earlier reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for peace in the region and solidarity with the people of Palestine as he met world leaders in Egypt. Two years of Israeli bombardment in the Palestinian enclave have claimed more than 67,000 lives, with the continuing to rise as more bodies are recovered. Last month, US President Trump had mediated a truce with the help of eight Muslim nations between Hamas and Israel and paved the way for the end of genocide in Gaza through a 20-point plan . Last week, Hamas and Israel had signed an agreement to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of Trump’s initiative to end the conflict. Yesterday, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said that the summit was the result of the diplomatic efforts that began on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th Session in New York last month. PM Shehbaz arrived in Egypt earlier today to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. The premier arrived at the Congress Centre to participate in the summit and was received upon arrival by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. The prime minister met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in Gaza. The meeting marked a rare moment of convergence between the two Caucasus nations and underscored the broader international commitment to de-escalation in the Middle East. The prime minister also held bilateral discussions with prominent global leaders, including King Abdullah II of Jordan, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres, President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. The premier also met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who thanked Pakistan for its “unwavering political and diplomatic support’’. Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the Gaza ceasefire, and PM Shehbaz lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Palestinian people. During these meetings, PM Shehbaz emphasised the urgent need for coordinated international efforts to restore peace in the region. He highlighted Pakistans consistent stance on the Palestinian issue, reaffirming Islamabads unwavering diplomatic and moral support for the Palestinian people. “Our position is rooted in justice and humanity,” he said. “Pakistan will continue to stand by the Palestinian cause and support all peaceful initiatives aimed at ending violence and ensuring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.” The meetings also included discussions on broader regional stability, strengthening multilateral cooperation, and promoting dialogue to resolve long-standing conflicts. He later met Trump, who also arrived in Egypt to attend the signing ceremony and met world leaders as he welcomed them. View this post on Instagram Earlier, PM Shehbaz hailed the peace plan a “crucial step towards lasting peace in the Middle East”. “Grateful to our co-hosts, President El Sisi and President Trump. We would not have seen this moment without President Trump’s outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment,” PM Shehbaz said on X. “It took his single-minded pursuit of peace to end the needless killing and destruction,” he said. PM Shehbaz added that the ceremony marked the “closing of a genocidal chapter, one that the international community must ensure is never repeated anywhere again”. He said the “brave and resilient” Palestinian people deserve to live in a free Palestine, “with pre 1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as their capital city”. Trump, along with Sisi, will chair the summit set to be attended by world leaders, including the head of the United Nations. The gathering in the Red Sea resort town will bring together “leaders from more than 20 countries”, Sisi’s office had said. It will seek “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security”. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and Pedro Sanchez of Spain will also attend the summit. French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, according to their offices. The European Council will be represented by its president, Antonio Costa, a spokesperson said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II is also expected to attend, according to state media. Israel and Hamas, however, will not attend the summit. “No Israeli official will attend,” Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told AFP yesterday. Similarly, Hamas confirmed it will not participate directly. Hossam Badran, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told AFP that the Palestinian group “will not be involved.” He noted that Hamas “acted principally through … Qatari and Egyptian mediators” during previous negotiations.",
