Lee made the remarks on X, formerly Twitter, as he posted a news article reporting that police have launched an investigation into the head of the group for allegedly insulting such statues nationwide. \"This is an absurd case of defamation of the deceased,\" Lee wrote. According to the news report, the activist group held multiple protest rallies in front of such statues across the nation, calling for their removal and disparaging the victims. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war. Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910-45.",

      "summary_orig": "THE people of Karachi definitely breathed a huge sigh of relief after intelligence and law enforcement agencies revealed they had thwarted a terrorist plot to target the bustling metropolis. The images and information coming out about the failed attempt are enough to send shivers down the spine — 2,000kg of explosive material, packed into blue plastic drums and faux gas cylinders was found hidden under a pile of clothes on a ready-to-blow vehicle based improvised explosive device (VBIED). The vehicle in question was a truck — known locally as a ‘Mazda’. Although VBIEDs are not often used by local terror outfits — given the logistical difficulty involved in preparing and transporting them — some of the deadliest attacks in the country’s history were perpetrated using them as a delivery mechanism. The most obvious parallel can be drawn with the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, one of the deadliest attacks ever perpetrated in the capital. Security analyst sees possibility of ‘operational synergy’ among groups such as the TTP, BLA and BLF as outfits shift focus back to civilian targets I covered the aftermath of that bombing, which left a crater 34 feet deep and 59 feet wide at the main entrance to the hotel building. At the time, I had interviewed a witness who told me that he was standing near the gate when a man started firing and at the same time a dumper appeared at the main gate. “I ran away from the scene to save my life but later heard an explosion.” The dumper caught fire and the security guards started extinguishing the fire. That was when the vehicle exploded. The explosion had been heard clear across the city; there were casualties in Balochistan House — located across the road — and nearby PTV Headquarters as well. Follow-up investigations revealed that around 1,000kg of explosive material had been used — a mix of ammonium powder, RDX and TNT, as well as mortar shells and artillery rounds. Given the scale of that bombing, one can safely assume that if the attack on Karachi had occurred, the potential death and destruction it would have wreaked would have been off the charts. The fact that the plot was foiled following a tip-off from intelligence agencies — a fact alluded to during the official CTD presser on Monday — is also a heartening development, indicating that security agencies are actively working to keep Karachi safe from terrorists. In recent years, urban centres such as Karachi and Lahore had been largely spared any major attack on civilian targets, as was the norm in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Over the past couple of years, terror outfits across the country had seemingly shifted their focus to security forces, targeting their positions rather than softer, civilian targets. However, the discovery of the Karachi terror plot seems to indicate a return to form for these nefarious groups. Talking to Dawn , security analyst Imtiaz Gul said that it was quite likely that militants would again start targeting civilians. “If we believe the official version, that it was the BLA that planned this subversion, it makes things pretty obvious that they have chosen to inflict damage in non-Baloch areas so as to not to annoy their own population.” This, he recalled, is what happened to the TTP, Ahrarul Hind and similar smaller groups after they targeted both civilians and the security apparatus — it generated widespread resentment and rejection among the masses and they were forced to change their tactics. Given the scale and ambition of the terror plot, one of the theories doing the rounds alludes to a possible collaboration between multiple terror outfits, since it would be quite a challenge for any one group to assemble a VBIED of this scale and smuggle it into a well-guarded city like Karachi. When asked about the possibility, Mr Gul said there was “very obvious operational synergy among groups such as the TTP, BLA and BLF who are believed to be the critical links in the externally-driven proxy terrorism that Pakistan is facing”. This also means these groups and their handlers are imparting training and techniques for subversive activities, he noted. Published in Dawn, January 6th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "NEW YORK: Pakistan on Monday expressed “profound concern” over the developments in Venezuela, warning that escalating tensions in the country posed risks to regional and international peace and security. The statement was made at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) summoned to discuss the recent developments in Venezuela. This is also the first meeting for the year of the UNSC, with Somalia in the chair. The US had launched a shock military operation in Venezuela on Saturday, with special forces capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in a nighttime raid . Pakistan’s Acting Permanent Representative Ambassador Usman Jadoon said in his address that at a time when the world was already facing multiple crises, instability in the region “does not augur well for regional and international peace and security”. He reminded Council members that the UN Charter bound states to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, and to uphold sovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs and the peaceful settlement of disputes. @dawn.today Pakistan on Monday expressed “profound concern” over the developments in Venezuela, warning that escalating tensions in the country posed risks to regional and international peace and security. The statement was made at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) summoned to discuss the recent developments in Venezuela.

Pakistan’s Acting Permanent Representative Ambassador Usman Jadoon said in his address that at a time when the world was already facing multiple crises, instability in the region “does not augur well for regional and international peace and security”. DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com Ambassador Jadoon added that unilateral military action contravened these “sacrosanct principles” as well as the doctrine of sovereign immunity, warning that such actions set dangerous precedents and risked eroding the foundations of the global legal framework. He cautioned that such actions also fuel instability, which, “as history has shown time and again, can lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable outcomes for years to come“. Calling for de-escalation, the Pakistani envoy said that at this critical juncture, “the path forward must be one of dialogue and diplomacy,” stressing that durable solutions to political differences could only be achieved through peaceful means and with full respect for the will of the Venezuelan people, free from external interference. He expressed hope that Latin America and the Caribbean, recognised as a ‘Zone of Peace’, would remain free from conflict and confrontation and continue moving towards enhanced regional cooperation and improved prosperity. The United Nations Security Council holds an emergency meeting to discuss recent US actions in Venezuela at the UN headquarters in New York City on January 5. — AFP Pakistan urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint, de-escalate tensions, refrain from actions that could exacerbate the situation, and engage in dialogue, including by utilising sincere offers of mediation. Jadoon noted that the offices of the secretary-general remained available for that purpose. Concluding his remarks, he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to contributing constructively to the Security Council’s primary responsibility for addressing threats to international peace and security by diffusing tensions, promoting pacific settlement and upholding respect for international law and the UN Charter. “Peace and stability of Venezuela and the welfare and prosperity of its people, with full ownership, must be the overriding objective of all efforts,” he said. UN chief concerned about instability in Venezuela, legality of US operation United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres raised concerns about a possible intensification of instability in Venezuela after Maduro’s capture. “I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability in the country, the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted,” Guterres said in a statement delivered to the council by UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo. Guterres called on all Venezuelan actors to engage in an inclusive and democratic dialogue, adding: “I welcome and am ready to support all efforts aimed at assisting Venezuelans in finding a peaceful way forward.” He also expressed concern that the US operation to capture Maduro in Caracas on Saturday did not respect the rules of international law. Pakistan urges restraint, dialogue on Venezuela ‘Surgical law enforcement operation’ As UN officials and several UN diplomats sharply criticised Washington’s intervention in Venezuela, US Ambassador Michael G. Waltz defended the action before the Security Council as a justified “surgical law enforcement operation”. “If the United Nations in this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist with the same treatment in this Charter as a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organisation is this?” Waltz asked. The US envoy said Washington had acted to apprehend two indicted fugitives, naming President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Celia Flores, and insisted the operation did not constitute a war against Venezuela or its people. He described Maduro as a fugitive and the leader of a “vicious foreign terrorist organisation”, alleging links to international drug trafficking networks that use “illegal narcotics as a weapon”. US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz speaks at a United Nations Security Council meeting at the UN headquarters concerning the situation in Venezuela on January 5. — AFP Waltz compared the action to the 1989 US operation that led to the arrest of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega. Citing broader human rights concerns, the ambassador referred to allegations of extra-judicial killings, torture and arbitrary detentions in Venezuela, and said more than eight million Venezuelans had fled the country. China’s representative said his country was “deeply shocked by, and strongly condemns” what he described as the United States’ “unilateral, illegal and bullying acts” against Venezuela. He accused Washington of “wantonly trampling upon Venezuela’s sovereignty, security and legitimate rights and interests“, placing power above multilateralism and military action above diplomacy. Warning of a grave threat to peace in Latin America and beyond, the Chinese envoy urged the United States to heed what he called the “overwhelming voice” of the international community and return to dialogue. Russian Ambassador Vassily A. Nebenzia condemned the United States for what he called armed aggression against Venezuela in violation of international law, urging Washington to immediately release the “legitimately elected President” and his spouse. Calling on Council members to abandon double standards, Mr Nebenzia warned against justifying “such an egregious act of aggression” out of fear of what he termed the “American global gendarme”. He further accused the United States of seeking control over Venezuela’s natural resources, saying its actions were generating “fresh momentum for neocolonialism and imperialism”. Following Maduro’s capture, US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Washington would govern Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition takes place”. “We don‘t want to be involved with having somebody else get in and we have the same situation that we had for the last, long period of years,” the US president said. “So we’re going to run the country, until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. We’re going to run it, essentially.”",

The rally was organised by All Parties Kech in collaboration with traders, the Doctors Association and civil society. Marchers moved through main roads and streets of the district headquarters of Kech district, starting from Officer Bazaar, passing through various routes, reaching the Press Club and then proceeding to Shaheed Fida Chowk, where the march turned into a protest. “The protection of citizens is the responsibility of the state and its institutions,” National Party President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch said while describing the situation in Kech as “alarming”. Political leaders warn of district-wide strike Demonstrators demanded the recovery of two recently abducted youths, Haseeb Haji Yaseen and Shah Nawaz Gul Jan, and called on state institutions to protect citizens. Mr Malik, while demanding the recovery, warned that attempts were once again being made to push Kech toward instability, but said the people of Kech would resist such efforts. He urged the district administration to provide protection to citizens and said that for the past month, affected families and political leaders had approached relevant institutions, but each continued to shift responsibility to others. All Parties Kech Convener Nawab Khan Shambezai announced that a district-wide strike would be observed on Jan 7 if the two youths did not return. The Kech Bar Association boycotted court proceedings in solidarity with the families of the abducted. Advocate Syed Majeed Shah, the association’s president, condemned the kidnappings. Business activities and daily life have been severely disrupted by the recent wave of crime, according to local leaders. Mir Ghafoor Ahmed Bizenjo, a former minister, said that citizens were “living under a sense of fear” and called on the state to ensure public safety.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Overwhel­mingly led by Sindh, the country’s total contingent liabilities arising out of public-private partnership (PPP) projects — both at the Centre and the four provinces — exceeded Rs472 billion by the end of last month, according to the Ministry of Finance. In its first of the kind “ Fiscal Risk Monitoring Framework for Contingent Liabilities of PPP Projects ”, in line with commitments made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the ministry’s Debt Management Office reported a total of Rs472.3bn in such liabilities as of Dec 2025. More than 71pc (Rs335.6bn) of the total pertained to contingent liabilities of the Sindh government, which has the largest portfolio of 17 PPP projects — almost half of 36 across the country. Total liabilities exceeded Rs472bn by end of last month The federal government’s total contingent liabilities against PPP projects amounted to Rs90.6bn, or 19.3pc of the cumulative amount, followed by Punjab at Rs26.5bn (5.6pc) and Rs19.6bn (4.2pc of the total) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. Balochistan has no such liabilities, although its five projects were among the 36 total PPP project portfolio across the country. In its latest written commitment to the IMF, the government had promised to improve the risk monitoring framework of public-private partnerships, including those at the provincial level. “We will subject PPP-funded projects to the same rigorous selection criteria applied to projects funded through other sources”, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said, adding that Risk Management Unit (RMU) in the Ministry of Finance, in coordination with other stakeholders, was in the process of establishing a monitoring framework for quantifying contingent liabilities related to PPPs for publishing estimates by end-December 2025. Contingent liabilities are those contractual obligations of the state for which public sector entities have assumed risks against these PPP projects and are calculated in nominal values calculated over the life of the contract. Of the total liabilities, Rs368.3bn pertain to contingent fiscal responsibilities that may accrue due to minimum revenue guaranteed by the respective governments against a specific project, cost escalation, interest rate fluctuations or terminal liabilities, while another Rs104bn have been pitched as financial guarantees. Cost escalation The report suggests Sindh’s direct contingent liabilities because of cost escalation, minimum revenue guarantee and terminal liabilities stand at Rs255.5bn, accounting for close to 70pc of the Rs368.3bn consolidated national amount. Sindh’s largest risk exposure for contingent liabilities stems from cost escalation estimated at Rs146.6bn, followed by Rs61bn for minimum revenue guaranteed by the provincial government to private partners. This is in addition to about Rs80bn in financial guarantees. The federal government’s total PPP liabilities of Rs90.6bn include Rs83.7bn on account of termination liabilities and Rs7bn in financial guarantees. Financial guarantees are instruments issued against a financial commitment agreed to be undertaken by the public sector like viability gap financing support. The report highlighted ‘high’ risk of these contingent liabilities becoming actually due on account of Rs150bn each for cost escalation and termination liabilities, Rs104bn on account of financial guarantees and about Rs66bn for minimum revenue guarantees, led by Sindh with Rs61bn. IMF stipulation The framework is required under the IMF programme to establish a consistent system for identifying, quantifying, and reporting contingent liabilities arising from PPP projects at both federal and provincial government levels. This is because the PPP contracts can create fiscal exposures that do not immediately appear in budget or debt statements, but could materialise later through guarantee calls, revenue support mechanisms, indexation adjustments or termination-related payments. The framework provides a uniform methodology to classify and quantify both direct and contingent liabilities and to consolidate these into a single national PPP fiscal exposure dataset managed by the RMU of the Ministry of Finance.

Addressing a press conference alongside CTD Additional Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Ali Larik in Karachi, CTD Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ghulam Azfar Mahesar said that law enforcement agencies and the “premier intelligence agency” received information that terrorists were planning an attack to target the city. Mahesar said that the terrorists were planning to attack specific targets in Karachi to “destabilise” national security. He said that intelligence agencies, the Special Branch, the Intelligence Bureau as well as Sindh and Balochistan CTD designed a strategy to thwart these plans. He said that intelligence officials were deployed in different locations, while focusing on Karachi’s west region. Mahesar said that after several days of robust efforts, officials succeeded in getting information on a terrorist hideout in Raees Goth, Karachi, where terrorists had prepared a large amount of explosive material. He said that upon receiving the information, Sindh CTD and the “premier intelligence agency” conducted a joint raid. “We captured one terrorist, while three or four of them managed to escape the scene,“ he said. Mahesar affirmed that the agencies had initiated a search operation to ensure their capture. “The officials recovered a Mazda truck loaded with explosive materials,” he said. He said 30 drums filled with explosives, five cylinders filled with explosives, 2,000kg of explosives and detonators had been seized.

He said a total of three terrorists had been arrested. Mahesar said that during the initial interrogation, the terrorists revealed that they were associated with the Bashir Zeb network of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Majeed Brigade.

      "summary_orig": "Landing in my birthplace always gives me the feeling of a tired child resting his head in his mother’s lap, the comfort that says I’m home. This time, the feeling was warmer, for I had brought with me the joy of my son’s wedding to share with my family and friends. It felt like returning to a celebration. But joy in this country is always fragile, more so in the border regions. The minute I touched down in Islamabad, news broke of yet another suicide attack — 12 killed, dozens injured. The headline cut through my heart before I even reached baggage claim. Still, I drove to Peshawar, to my roots. To the soil that has always known both happiness and heartbreak. The walls of Peshawar’s old qahwa khanas tea houses, which once echoed with Rehman Baba’s verses and the faces of film stars, are now filled with Quranic calligraphy, reflecting a changing moral and social landscape. When I reached home, the air was the same as when I left it. Dry, warm, filled with the scent of dust and bright sunshine. Children I once saw in school uniforms are now married. Cousins have grey hair. New faces sit where elders once did. But the streets have grown crowded, the tolerance thinner, the city restless. Yet, every corner still tells a story of life, and survival. And the unbreakable stubbornness of its people. A native returns to his home in what was once known as the ‘City of Flowers’ and tries to make sense of its slow erosion, over decades, of culture, tolerance and joy. Where the city once pulsed with music, cinema, dance, poetry and coexistence, it struggles today under the weight of fear, radicalisation and silence. Is the old Peshawar just destined to exist only in his memory? THE CITY THAT WAS Forty years ago, Peshawar was one of the most vibrant cultural cities in South Asia. What Paris had in sophistication, what New York had in artistic energy, my city had in its own distinct, confident way. A vendor on Peshawar’s Cinema Road pictured 30 years ago. I still remember my teenage days in a small village near Peshawar in the early 1980s. Back then, the city was alive with colour and melody, cinemas showing Pashto, Urdu, English and Punjabi films, the sound of the rabab floating through Dabgari Bazaar, and wedding nights throbbing with dance, drums and currency notes being showered over performers. Peshawar was a city of art, of scandal, of tradition and temptation. There were musicians’ streets, poetry festivals, bookshops and open-air performances that carried on late into the night. In the Saddar neighbourhood, Khyber Café served as the informal headquarters of Pakistan Television’s Peshawar Centre, where actors, poets, writers and producers gathered daily. A short walk away stood Saint John’s and Saint Cathedral churches, and beside them the historic Jamia Darvesh Mosque. A coexistence of faiths carved naturally into the city’s landscape. A worshipper sits inside the historic Mohabbat Khan Mosque. Amid fading frescoes and worn marble floors, the centuries-old mosque remains a place of solitude and devotion. In Kali Bari street, Muslim, Hindu and Christian families lived side-by-side in a harmony that felt permanent. Every year, the month-long Jashn-i-Khyber festival filled the night air with announcements and music from Peshawar Stadium’s loudspeakers. And in Dabgari Chowk, the celebrated Pashto ghazal singer Khyal Muhammad would perform all night in the middle of the road, surrounded by people who came for poetry, not politics. That was the Peshawar I grew up in: confident, open, generous. Painter and sculptor Arbab Muhammad Sardar in his gallery: in 1997, after receiving threats warning him against painting human faces and creating sculptures, he began removing his works from display. THE TRANSFORMATION But then came the Afghan war and Gen Ziaul Haq’s call for ‘jihad’. Overnight, Peshawar became the frontline of a global game. It turned into a Kalashnikov capital, a smuggler’s paradise, a city of spies and sudden millionaires. To own a gun was to be powerful, to fire it in the air was to be feared. Over decades, religious seminaries multiplied, public art vanished and cultural spaces disappeared or were muted. Suspicion replaced neighbourliness. Extremism was not an accident, it was a slow, deliberate recalibration of society, one that suffocated the city’s cultural lungs. Supporters of a religious political party burn an American flag during a protest at Peshawar’s Martyrs’ Monument, erected in memory of members of the non-violent Khudai Khidmatgar movement killed by British forces. The moment underscores the contrast between a site rooted in peaceful resistance and later waves of political anger shaped by global events. On my second day in the city, I photographed a young Islamist student wrapped in a white turban, wearing a light-brown Schott NYC US Army jacket. The irony hit me like a flash: an American brand on a madrassa [seminary] student. When I asked about it, he smiled and said it was his “trophy”. I didn’t ask more. He happily posed for a picture. That single moment pulled me 30 years back, to 1996, when the Taliban had just taken control of Afghanistan. Back then, they walked freely in Peshawar’s streets. The city was their resting ground, their moral laboratory. Tora Bora, Afghanistan: Foot soldiers rest during a pause in fighting. Some prepare for prayer, while one listens quietly to Indian songs on the All India Radio. Beyond labels such as Taliban or mujahid holy warrior, the image reveals the ordinary human contradictions of war — faith, fatigue, memory and music coexisting in a single moment. And here I was again, 30 years later — the same story, the same spirit, just new clothes and a different brand. I didn’t ask this young man about his ‘trophy’. Not because I was afraid, but because I understood that, in our land, questions can sometimes be louder than answers. History in this part of the world never moves forward — it keeps circling, dressing old beliefs in new symbols. A WALK ON CINEMA ROAD The afternoon light falls softly on Cinema Road, the street that once carried the heartbeat of the city. The air still smells of dust, tea and faint memories of songs that used to spill from cassette shops. My steps now echo where music once lived. Near the Sethi House, Peshawar’s old streets still carry the elegance of carved balconies, fading paint and narrow passages that once shaped everyday life. Caught between neglect and survival, these lanes stand as quiet witnesses to a city whose architectural memory is slowly slipping away. Inside a narrow tea shop, Jan Muhammad sits cross-legged beside his brass samovar. This was once the German Tea Shop, now everyone calls it Jan Muhammad Chai Khana. He pours boiling milk into cups, the sound of hissing steam blending with the low hum of conversation. He looks up and says, “Alhamdulillah [Praise be to Allah], the bazar is clean now, no obscenity, only business.” The clang of kettles and the breath of steam are all that remain from a time when this road was alive with sound, posters and film lights. There was a time when Cinema Road glowed every evening. Three proud cinema halls stood shoulder-to-shoulder: Picture House, Novelty and Tasweer Mahal. People knew them not by their official names but by what they looked like: Picture House was Makhamkh Cinema, the one in the front; Novelty was Manz Cinema, the middle one; and Tasweer Mahal was Pehla Cinema, the first one in the row. At Picture House Cinema on Cinema Road in the early 2000s, film billboards were altered during the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure, with female faces removed and only male actors left visible. The cinema itself has since been bulldozed, marking the physical erasure of a once-thriving cultural space from the city’s landscape. Crowds of young men filled the street. Truck drivers, students and visitors from the villages of Khyber, Charsadda, Mardan and Kohat. They came for the films, for the laughter, for the noise that made this road feel like a fair. Music shops lined both sides: Sherbaz Khan Music Centre, Shalimar and Gul Sattar Khan. Their cassette racks glimmered under yellow bulbs, filled with Pashto, Indian, Persian and English songs. The road itself throbbed like a radio tuned between worlds. The photo studios were tiny rooms where magic happened. A young man could pose and see himself printed beside Badar Munir, Musarrat Shaheen, Yasmin Khan or Suraya Khan — a small miracle made with scissors, negatives and glue. He would take that photo back to his hujra [communal space], proud and smiling, showing it as proof that he had met fame. Now those same shops sell PVC boards and stationery — the film stars are gone, but the cracked walls still remember them. And through Photoshopping now, young men opt to be transformed into images of militants, guns in hand and a rocket-launcher on the shoulder. A little ahead, the Tasweer Mahal lies buried under a 13-storey plaza. Novelty and Picture House have also been erased, bulldozed like memories no one asked to keep. Dust has replaced the crowd clamouring at the cinema gate, eager to get in. Only silence stands where the hero once leapt across the screen amidst applause from cine-goers. Further down stands the Aina Cinema, its doors half-open to… whom? The ‘Ladies Gate’ sign still hangs above the narrow staircase. Aina Cinema, once alive with music, colour and collective dreams, is now reduced to a parking lot. The ‘Pay Box’ lettering survives, though a car now blocks the view. And above, the mural of dancers and musicians — colours faded — still hangs on through the years. This hall once echoed with clapping hands and Pashto film dialogue. Now it rents its floor to cars. No one I ask says they miss those days. Maybe they have forgotten, maybe forgetting is easier. But for those who grew up in that sound and smoke, the loss runs deep — not just of cinemas, but of openness. An image from 1996 that captures the tension between public piety and private curiosity. There was a balance once. Faith and fun walking side by side. Falak Sair and Capital Cinemas in Saddar, the Takhtu Jumat mosque between them, Blue Bells Music Centre beside. Naz Cinema near Masjid Mahabat Khan and Cinema Road itself beside Madani Masjid of Namak Mandi. After Friday prayers, some men went to the cinema, some to Dabgari Bazar — both part of one rhythm that made the city move. In Peshawar’s Dabgari Bazaar, musicians traditionally kept their balcony windows open so passers-by could see and hire them. During the MMA provincial government’s campaign against music, pressure from authorities forced these windows shut. In this image from 2003, two musicians cautiously peer onto the street — a quiet moment reflecting how fear and regulation pushed a once public art into the shadows Evening falls again on Cinema Road. At Jan Muhammad’s shop, the kettles cool slowly and the tea tastes like nostalgia — thick, sweet and a little burnt. The steam curls upward like the city’s last song. The walls are cleaner now but quieter. We have built plazas and lost poetry, scrubbed away the music but not the memory. During the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure in KP in the early 2000s, cinema posters along Cinema Road were altered as female faces were removed or blacked out A CITY THAT WALKS THROUGH SMOKE The morning sun in Peshawar was pale and kind. And then, that morning, a car bomb. A suicide attacker struck right in front of the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters — formerly the Frontier Constabulary — in the heart of Saddar. The blast ripped through the stillness of an ordinary workday. A white Suzuki, packed with explosives, rammed the gate before a suicide bomber detonated himself. Within seconds, concrete dust, smoke and fear clouded the street. The echoes rolled beneath the overhead BRT [Bus Rapid Transit] track, bouncing between the concrete pillars that now bear the stains of shrapnel. Three FC personnel were martyred on the spot, several others were wounded. Under the overhead bridge, men gathered in silence. Children clutched schoolbags. Bikers slowed to watch the police lift the burned car with a forklift, its tires dangling mid-air. A haunting image of another day gone wrong. Nearby, an FC soldier stood guard over a blood-soaked shroud, staring at what little was left of the attacker. And yet, just a few hundred meters away, life went on. Shops re-opened, schools and offices stayed functional, and traffic crawled as usual. The people of Peshawar, hardened by decades of violence, carried on with that familiar numbness that only a city long at war can understand. By noon, the road was cleared. The glass shards on the asphalt shimmered like tiny memorials in the sunlight. For outsiders, it was a terror attack — for Peshawar, it was Monday. A security personnel member stands near the remains of a suicide bomber after an attack on the Frontier Corps headquarters on November 24, 2025 WALTZING WITH TERROR This November, when my son was getting married in New York, my sisters in Peshawar insisted to have a traditional nakreezy — a henna night with music and dance — in my hometown. They wanted a Pashto singer, someone whose voice could bring back even a trace of the old Peshawar. Our friend, the renowned Pashto singer Sarfaraz Afridi, offered to perform along with his young son, Arman Faraz. I wanted to host them on a stage worthy of artists, decorated with candles and roses. The way Peshawar once honoured its musicians. I visited 17 wedding halls. Everyone refused. “No live music,” they said. “It is a sin.” As if joy itself had become forbidden. As if melody threatened the order of things. So I built my own stage. On the rooftop of our four-storey family home, in the heart of our village, we placed speakers on all four sides. Not to provoke anyone, but to remind them of what had been forgotten. Sarfaraz and Arman performed until dawn. Their voices floated over our neighbourhood like a small rebellion. That night was my protest. My refusal to accept silence as the new normal. For the main wedding, I had invited a Khattak dance troupe, a symbol of Pakhtun identity and pride. The FC, whose dancers I had invited, was burying its own after the bomb attack. I assumed the performance would be cancelled. But on the wedding day, the troupe arrived. Still grieving. Still shaken. But determined. Their presence was more than entertainment — it was a declaration. A refusal to let terror dictate how people live, celebrate or express their culture. In front of 1,000 guests, their dance was a quiet but unmistakable act of defiance. For a brief moment, I saw my old Peshawar again. The dance troupe that performed at the wedding of the writer’s son. Just two days earlier, they had survived a bomb attack. THE UNHEARD SONGS In my father’s youth, in the 1960s, things were different. He told me that when women dancers were invited to weddings, they would first go to the women’s side of the house. Female hosts would welcome them with tea, speak kindly and drape a chador over their shoulders. A gesture of respect, of protection. Only then would the dancers step toward the hujra, escorted by male elders of the family. Before the music began, an elder would raise his hand and declare: “She is our guest. She has come to bring joy to our celebration. Respect her as you would respect your own daughter.” Those few words were like a royal decree, an invisible shield. No one dared misbehave, no one dared touch. That was Pashtunwali — the old code of honour that balanced pride with protection. A rabab-maker in Dabgari Bazar. I grew up in the early 1980s, when the night air smelled of kerosene lamps in my village. In our villages, there was no cinema, no television, no theatre. Only the female dance party in the hujra. The night would go on — currency notes showered upon the dancers, tossed over the groom and his friends, laughter mixing with the music. The mehfil glowed until midnight, when it ended with bursts of gunfire in the air, a final announcement to the surrounding villages that the dance was over. Yet, within that fiery, fraught atmosphere, the dancing girls somehow felt safe. They came from everywhere — from Swat’s Banr Bazaar, from Mardan, from Rawalpindi, sometimes from Lahore or from Dabgari Bazaar itself, the old red-light heart of Peshawar. Names whispered in gossip and admiration: Shamshad Begum known as Shamshado, Farzana, Shahnaz, Babli, Chanoo. Women who carried the rhythm of a culture and the shame of a society that refused to own them. But that balance has been shattered. First by the Kalashnikov culture of the 1980s, then by the militancy and false piety that followed. The same land that once danced to the rabab began to tremble under sermons and gunfire. The same people who clapped to melodies now judge with verses. During the MMA government, music cassettes, CDs, DVDs and VHS tapes were publicly burned in Peshawar’s Jinnah Park after Friday prayers. At the very spot where Quaid-i-Azam once addressed the city, flames replaced melody, marking a moment when culture was condemned and Peshawar began to lose its plural, joyful voice. Today, a woman with a song is a threat. A woman who dances is fair game for anyone’s bullet. Her name was Muniba Shah. A name that most of Peshawar didn’t know until it was followed by the phrase “shot dead.” She was a damma, a Pakhtun dancer, an artist, a survivor of a cruel tradition that praises art but punishes the artist. She danced her last dance in the City of Flowers. No protest. No statement. No civil society outrage. Only a few blurred photos on social media, her painted face frozen mid-smile… and a city moving on as if nothing had happened. Muniba Shah is not the first. She joins a silent chorus: Shabana, the dancer from Swat, shot dead in 2009, her body dumped in a public square. Ayman Udas, singer and TV performer, murdered by her brothers for “dishonour”. Ghazala Javed, the nightingale of Peshawar, gunned down with her father in 2012. Sumbul, Sonia, Resham, Lubna, Khushboo — each killed for saying no, for performing, for living. Eighteen names that are known. Countless others lost. No monuments. No memorials. No justice. Just Facebook comments asking what she wore, what she did, as if death needed justification. But if music is our soul, why do we keep killing our singers? We praise God for beauty but destroy the ones who carry it in their bones. Muniba Shah will not perform again. Her anklets lie still, her music cut short. Somewhere tonight, another girl in Banr Bazaar may look at her picture and feel both wonder and warning — dreaming of the stage, fearing its price. Cinema Road used to be alive with music cassette shops where film songs, ghazals and Pashto songs were bought and sold. THE HIGH AND THE LOW He was known in our streets as “Nasimy”. His real name was Nasim Maseeh, but names fade fast in the dust of forgotten lives. He was the man with the broom — a long jharroo in one hand, a small steel cart in the other — walking through Nothia Jadeed, Miskeen Abad, Judge Bungalow and Kotla Mohsin Khan every dawn. A faded Palestinian-style scarf tied around his head, dark skin shining with sweat, white teeth flashing when he laughed. A laughter full of life and, at times, full of quiet sorrow. After sweeping, he would sit cross-legged on the ground, cracking jokes, calling out to the housewives in his broken Pashto: “ Ay baaji, chai milay gi? Ay mory, aik paratha mere liye bhi ! [Sister, can I get a cup of tea? One paratha for me too!] Every woman in the neighbourhood knew him, respected him. And he, in return, respected everyone. Working and smiling, never demanding more than a greeting or a cup of tea. But when someone threw waste food, plastic or burned trash on the same street he had just cleaned, Nasimy would laugh again. A deep, tired, saddened laugh, the kind that hides pain behind politeness. A few days ago, I learned that Nasimy had died. Inside a blocked gutter at Darul Uloom Usmania, the very madrassa whose drains he was cleaning. He suffocated there, in the dark, doing the work no one else wanted to do. He died where the city’s conscience never dares to go. I asked around: was he married? Did he have children, a home, a family? No one knew. There are thousands like Nasimy in Pakistan — most belonging to Christian and Hindu minorities, living without contracts, safety or respect. They clean the mess of millions, yet die in silence. Sometimes I think we Pakhtuns, indeed the entire Pakistani nation, are among the most contradictory of people, with arrogance born out of the caste system. Those who cut our hair and make us beautiful, we call nai, implying a lowly status. Those who shape the clay into pots that feed us, we call kolal, equally lowly. Those who bring colour to our lives, we still treat as low. We are blind to the truth that they — not us — keep the rhythm of life alive. FROM KALASHNIKOVS TO TIKTOK Forty-five years later, the story has not changed, only the platforms have. From Iqbaly and Dabangy to Tila Khan, Ayuby and Papu, these names ruled the underworld. They were legends of ‘badmaashi’ — gangsters, assassins, drug lords — until SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) Sifwat Ghayur arrived with an iron will. One by one, his team took down the city’s crime lords. But in a cruel irony of fate, SSP Ghayur and his men would later be killed by the Taliban they once fought to contain. Leaders and supporters of religious political parties address a public gathering during a rally in which Osama bin Laden was publicly portrayed as a “mujahid holy warrior”. The gangsters of Peshawar are no longer hiding in dark alleys; they are performing on TikTok. They threaten, boast and mock each other in viral videos, before ending up dead in police encounters that everyone knows are paid for. Just a few days ago, Malik Adam Khan, an Afghan-Pakistani figure once feared, was killed along with his companions. Rumours spread across the city that his rivals, Mumtazy “Two Feet”, Haji Habib and Breet Khan, paid the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police for the ‘operation’. Hours later, Mumtazy threw a celebration, a night of dance and gunfire, mocking the death of his rival. In the 1980s, Peshawar’s poison was heroin and opium — today it’s ice, crystal meth, a drug that burns young minds faster than war ever did. The city’s streets are no longer full of storytellers or musicians — they’re full of dealers, addicts and a lost generation. And then, the ultimate tragedy. Videos surface of fathers selling their own children for food. Crying boys and girls under the age of 12, auctioned in shame because poverty has crushed the last pillars of Pakhtun honour. It was unthinkable once. It’s the reality now. Guns, drugs, gangs and tears — the story repeats itself. But somewhere between the smoke of the Kalashnikov and the glow of a TikTok screen, the soul of Peshawar burns among its ashes. WHAT REMAINS I often say I lost my city. In many ways, I have. The Peshawar of my youth — diverse, artistic, tolerant — survives now only in memory and in scattered pockets of resistance. Once a walled city entered through many gates, Peshawar has recently restored these gateways as symbols of its centuries-old identity. Kabuli Gate, the historic entry to Qissa Khwani Bazaar, stands again — marking the threshold where stories, trade and history have flowed for generations. But I also know this: culture is resilient. Music finds cracks to slip through. Joy returns in unexpected places. It does sometimes on rooftops, sometimes on a wedding stage trembling after an attack. The extremists took much from Peshawar. But they have not taken its soul entirely. Not yet. I carry that belief like I carry an old photograph — edges fading, centre glowing. And I hold on to it, because cities don’t die when buildings fall or when cultures are silenced. They die when their people stop remembering what they once were. Until then, every Pakhtun must ask: what kind of flower garden are we, if we keep watering the soil with the blood of our own roses?

Aina Cinema, once alive with music, colour and collective dreams, is now reduced to a parking lot. The ‘Pay Box’ lettering survives, though a car now blocks the view. And above, the mural of dancers and musicians — colours faded — still hangs on through the years. This hall once echoed with clapping hands and Pashto film dialogue. Now it rents its floor to cars. No one I ask says they miss those days. Maybe they have forgotten, maybe forgetting is easier. But for those who grew up in that sound and smoke, the loss runs deep — not just of cinemas, but of openness. An image from 1996 that captures the tension between public piety and private curiosity. There was a balance once. Faith and fun walking side by side. Falak Sair and Capital Cinemas in Saddar, the Takhtu Jumat mosque between them, Blue Bells Music Centre beside. Naz Cinema near Masjid Mahabat Khan and Cinema Road itself beside Madani Masjid of Namak Mandi. After Friday prayers, some men went to the cinema, some to Dabgari Bazar — both part of one rhythm that made the city move. In Peshawar’s Dabgari Bazaar, musicians traditionally kept their balcony windows open so passers-by could see and hire them. During the MMA provincial government’s campaign against music, pressure from authorities forced these windows shut. In this image from 2003, two musicians cautiously peer onto the street — a quiet moment reflecting how fear and regulation pushed a once public art into the shadows Evening falls again on Cinema Road. At Jan Muhammad’s shop, the kettles cool slowly and the tea tastes like nostalgia — thick, sweet and a little burnt. The steam curls upward like the city’s last song. The walls are cleaner now but quieter. We have built plazas and lost poetry, scrubbed away the music but not the memory. During the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure in KP in the early 2000s, cinema posters along Cinema Road were altered as female faces were removed or blacked out A CITY THAT WALKS THROUGH SMOKE The morning sun in Peshawar was pale and kind. And then, that morning, a car bomb. A suicide attacker struck right in front of the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters — formerly the Frontier Constabulary — in the heart of Saddar. The blast ripped through the stillness of an ordinary workday. A white Suzuki, packed with explosives, rammed the gate before a suicide bomber detonated himself. Within seconds, concrete dust, smoke and fear clouded the street. The echoes rolled beneath the overhead BRT [Bus Rapid Transit] track, bouncing between the concrete pillars that now bear the stains of shrapnel. Three FC personnel were martyred on the spot, several others were wounded. Under the overhead bridge, men gathered in silence. Children clutched schoolbags. Bikers slowed to watch the police lift the burned car with a forklift, its tires dangling mid-air. A haunting image of another day gone wrong. Nearby, an FC soldier stood guard over a blood-soaked shroud, staring at what little was left of the attacker. And yet, just a few hundred meters away, life went on. Shops re-opened, schools and offices stayed functional, and traffic crawled as usual. The people of Peshawar, hardened by decades of violence, carried on with that familiar numbness that only a city long at war can understand. By noon, the road was cleared. The glass shards on the asphalt shimmered like tiny memorials in the sunlight. For outsiders, it was a terror attack — for Peshawar, it was Monday. A security personnel member stands near the remains of a suicide bomber after an attack on the Frontier Corps headquarters on November 24, 2025 WALTZING WITH TERROR This November, when my son was getting married in New York, my sisters in Peshawar insisted to have a traditional nakreezy — a henna night with music and dance — in my hometown. They wanted a Pashto singer, someone whose voice could bring back even a trace of the old Peshawar. Our friend, the renowned Pashto singer Sarfaraz Afridi, offered to perform along with his young son, Arman Faraz. I wanted to host them on a stage worthy of artists, decorated with candles and roses. The way Peshawar once honoured its musicians. I visited 17 wedding halls. Everyone refused. “No live music,” they said. “It is a sin.” As if joy itself had become forbidden. As if melody threatened the order of things. So I built my own stage. On the rooftop of our four-storey family home, in the heart of our village, we placed speakers on all four sides. Not to provoke anyone, but to remind them of what had been forgotten. Sarfaraz and Arman performed until dawn. Their voices floated over our neighbourhood like a small rebellion. That night was my protest. My refusal to accept silence as the new normal. For the main wedding, I had invited a Khattak dance troupe, a symbol of Pakhtun identity and pride. The FC, whose dancers I had invited, was burying its own after the bomb attack. I assumed the performance would be cancelled. But on the wedding day, the troupe arrived. Still grieving. Still shaken. But determined. Their presence was more than entertainment — it was a declaration. A refusal to let terror dictate how people live, celebrate or express their culture. In front of 1,000 guests, their dance was a quiet but unmistakable act of defiance. For a brief moment, I saw my old Peshawar again. The dance troupe that performed at the wedding of the writer’s son. Just two days earlier, they had survived a bomb attack. THE UNHEARD SONGS In my father’s youth, in the 1960s, things were different. He told me that when women dancers were invited to weddings, they would first go to the women’s side of the house. Female hosts would welcome them with tea, speak kindly and drape a chador over their shoulders. A gesture of respect, of protection. Only then would the dancers step toward the hujra, escorted by male elders of the family. Before the music began, an elder would raise his hand and declare: “She is our guest. She has come to bring joy to our celebration. Respect her as you would respect your own daughter.” Those few words were like a royal decree, an invisible shield. No one dared misbehave, no one dared touch. That was Pashtunwali — the old code of honour that balanced pride with protection. A rabab-maker in Dabgari Bazar. I grew up in the early 1980s, when the night air smelled of kerosene lamps in my village. In our villages, there was no cinema, no television, no theatre. Only the female dance party in the hujra. The night would go on — currency notes showered upon the dancers, tossed over the groom and his friends, laughter mixing with the music. The mehfil glowed until midnight, when it ended with bursts of gunfire in the air, a final announcement to the surrounding villages that the dance was over. Yet, within that fiery, fraught atmosphere, the dancing girls somehow felt safe. They came from everywhere — from Swat’s Banr Bazaar, from Mardan, from Rawalpindi, sometimes from Lahore or from Dabgari Bazaar itself, the old red-light heart of Peshawar. Names whispered in gossip and admiration: Shamshad Begum known as Shamshado, Farzana, Shahnaz, Babli, Chanoo. Women who carried the rhythm of a culture and the shame of a society that refused to own them. But that balance has been shattered. First by the Kalashnikov culture of the 1980s, then by the militancy and false piety that followed. The same land that once danced to the rabab began to tremble under sermons and gunfire. The same people who clapped to melodies now judge with verses. During the MMA government, music cassettes, CDs, DVDs and VHS tapes were publicly burned in Peshawar’s Jinnah Park after Friday prayers. At the very spot where Quaid-i-Azam once addressed the city, flames replaced melody, marking a moment when culture was condemned and Peshawar began to lose its plural, joyful voice. Today, a woman with a song is a threat. A woman who dances is fair game for anyone’s bullet. Her name was Muniba Shah. A name that most of Peshawar didn’t know until it was followed by the phrase “shot dead.” She was a damma, a Pakhtun dancer, an artist, a survivor of a cruel tradition that praises art but punishes the artist. She danced her last dance in the City of Flowers. No protest. No statement. No civil society outrage. Only a few blurred photos on social media, her painted face frozen mid-smile… and a city moving on as if nothing had happened. Muniba Shah is not the first. She joins a silent chorus: Shabana, the dancer from Swat, shot dead in 2009, her body dumped in a public square. Ayman Udas, singer and TV performer, murdered by her brothers for “dishonour”. Ghazala Javed, the nightingale of Peshawar, gunned down with her father in 2012. Sumbul, Sonia, Resham, Lubna, Khushboo — each killed for saying no, for performing, for living. Eighteen names that are known. Countless others lost. No monuments. No memorials. No justice. Just Facebook comments asking what she wore, what she did, as if death needed justification. But if music is our soul, why do we keep killing our singers? We praise God for beauty but destroy the ones who carry it in their bones. Muniba Shah will not perform again. Her anklets lie still, her music cut short. Somewhere tonight, another girl in Banr Bazaar may look at her picture and feel both wonder and warning — dreaming of the stage, fearing its price. Cinema Road used to be alive with music cassette shops where film songs, ghazals and Pashto songs were bought and sold. THE HIGH AND THE LOW He was known in our streets as “Nasimy”. His real name was Nasim Maseeh, but names fade fast in the dust of forgotten lives. He was the man with the broom — a long jharroo in one hand, a small steel cart in the other — walking through Nothia Jadeed, Miskeen Abad, Judge Bungalow and Kotla Mohsin Khan every dawn. A faded Palestinian-style scarf tied around his head, dark skin shining with sweat, white teeth flashing when he laughed. A laughter full of life and, at times, full of quiet sorrow. After sweeping, he would sit cross-legged on the ground, cracking jokes, calling out to the housewives in his broken Pashto: “ Ay baaji, chai milay gi? Ay mory, aik paratha mere liye bhi ! [Sister, can I get a cup of tea? One paratha for me too!] Every woman in the neighbourhood knew him, respected him. And he, in return, respected everyone. Working and smiling, never demanding more than a greeting or a cup of tea. But when someone threw waste food, plastic or burned trash on the same street he had just cleaned, Nasimy would laugh again. A deep, tired, saddened laugh, the kind that hides pain behind politeness. A few days ago, I learned that Nasimy had died. Inside a blocked gutter at Darul Uloom Usmania, the very madrassa whose drains he was cleaning. He suffocated there, in the dark, doing the work no one else wanted to do. He died where the city’s conscience never dares to go. I asked around: was he married? Did he have children, a home, a family? No one knew. There are thousands like Nasimy in Pakistan — most belonging to Christian and Hindu minorities, living without contracts, safety or respect. They clean the mess of millions, yet die in silence. Sometimes I think we Pakhtuns, indeed the entire Pakistani nation, are among the most contradictory of people, with arrogance born out of the caste system. Those who cut our hair and make us beautiful, we call nai, implying a lowly status. Those who shape the clay into pots that feed us, we call kolal, equally lowly. Those who bring colour to our lives, we still treat as low. We are blind to the truth that they — not us — keep the rhythm of life alive. FROM KALASHNIKOVS TO TIKTOK Forty-five years later, the story has not changed, only the platforms have. From Iqbaly and Dabangy to Tila Khan, Ayuby and Papu, these names ruled the underworld. They were legends of ‘badmaashi’ — gangsters, assassins, drug lords — until SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) Sifwat Ghayur arrived with an iron will. One by one, his team took down the city’s crime lords. But in a cruel irony of fate, SSP Ghayur and his men would later be killed by the Taliban they once fought to contain. Leaders and supporters of religious political parties address a public gathering during a rally in which Osama bin Laden was publicly portrayed as a “mujahid holy warrior”. The gangsters of Peshawar are no longer hiding in dark alleys; they are performing on TikTok. They threaten, boast and mock each other in viral videos, before ending up dead in police encounters that everyone knows are paid for. Just a few days ago, Malik Adam Khan, an Afghan-Pakistani figure once feared, was killed along with his companions. Rumours spread across the city that his rivals, Mumtazy “Two Feet”, Haji Habib and Breet Khan, paid the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police for the ‘operation’. Hours later, Mumtazy threw a celebration, a night of dance and gunfire, mocking the death of his rival. In the 1980s, Peshawar’s poison was heroin and opium — today it’s ice, crystal meth, a drug that burns young minds faster than war ever did. The city’s streets are no longer full of storytellers or musicians — they’re full of dealers, addicts and a lost generation. And then, the ultimate tragedy. Videos surface of fathers selling their own children for food. Crying boys and girls under the age of 12, auctioned in shame because poverty has crushed the last pillars of Pakhtun honour. It was unthinkable once. It’s the reality now. Guns, drugs, gangs and tears — the story repeats itself. But somewhere between the smoke of the Kalashnikov and the glow of a TikTok screen, the soul of Peshawar burns among its ashes. WHAT REMAINS I often say I lost my city. In many ways, I have. The Peshawar of my youth — diverse, artistic, tolerant — survives now only in memory and in scattered pockets of resistance. Once a walled city entered through many gates, Peshawar has recently restored these gateways as symbols of its centuries-old identity. Kabuli Gate, the historic entry to Qissa Khwani Bazaar, stands again — marking the threshold where stories, trade and history have flowed for generations. But I also know this: culture is resilient. Music finds cracks to slip through. Joy returns in unexpected places. It does sometimes on rooftops, sometimes on a wedding stage trembling after an attack. The extremists took much from Peshawar. But they have not taken its soul entirely. Not yet. I carry that belief like I carry an old photograph — edges fading, centre glowing. And I hold on to it, because cities don’t die when buildings fall or when cultures are silenced. They die when their people stop remembering what they once were. Until then, every Pakhtun must ask: what kind of flower garden are we, if we keep watering the soil with the blood of our own roses?

      "title": "LOSING THE PESHAWAR THAT I ONCE KNEW",
      "summary": "Landing in my birthplace always gives me the feeling of a tired child resting his head in his mother’s lap, the comfort that says I’m home. This time, the feeling was warmer, for I had brought with me the joy of my son’s wedding to share with my family and friends. It felt like returning to a celebration. But joy in this country is always fragile, more so in the border regions. The minute I touched down in Islamabad, news broke of yet another suicide attack — 12 killed, dozens injured. The headline cut through my heart before I even reached baggage claim. Still, I drove to Peshawar, to my roots. To the soil that has always known both happiness and heartbreak. The walls of Peshawar’s old qahwa khanas tea houses, which once echoed with Rehman Baba’s verses and the faces of film stars, are now filled with Quranic calligraphy, reflecting a changing moral and social landscape. When I reached home, the air was the same as when I left it. Dry, warm, filled with the scent of dust and bright sunshine. Children I once saw in school uniforms are now married. Cousins have grey hair. New faces sit where elders once did. But the streets have grown crowded, the tolerance thinner, the city restless. Yet, every corner still tells a story of life, and survival. And the unbreakable stubbornness of its people. A native returns to his home in what was once known as the ‘City of Flowers’ and tries to make sense of its slow erosion, over decades, of culture, tolerance and joy. Where the city once pulsed with music, cinema, dance, poetry and coexistence, it struggles today under the weight of fear, radicalisation and silence. Is the old Peshawar just destined to exist only in his memory? THE CITY THAT WAS Forty years ago, Peshawar was one of the most vibrant cultural cities in South Asia. What Paris had in sophistication, what New York had in artistic energy, my city had in its own distinct, confident way. A vendor on Peshawar’s Cinema Road pictured 30 years ago. I still remember my teenage days in a small village near Peshawar in the early 1980s. Back then, the city was alive with colour and melody, cinemas showing Pashto, Urdu, English and Punjabi films, the sound of the rabab floating through Dabgari Bazaar, and wedding nights throbbing with dance, drums and currency notes being showered over performers. Peshawar was a city of art, of scandal, of tradition and temptation. There were musicians’ streets, poetry festivals, bookshops and open-air performances that carried on late into the night. In the Saddar neighbourhood, Khyber Café served as the informal headquarters of Pakistan Television’s Peshawar Centre, where actors, poets, writers and producers gathered daily. A short walk away stood Saint John’s and Saint Cathedral churches, and beside them the historic Jamia Darvesh Mosque. A coexistence of faiths carved naturally into the city’s landscape. A worshipper sits inside the historic Mohabbat Khan Mosque. Amid fading frescoes and worn marble floors, the centuries-old mosque remains a place of solitude and devotion. In Kali Bari street, Muslim, Hindu and Christian families lived side-by-side in a harmony that felt permanent. Every year, the month-long Jashn-i-Khyber festival filled the night air with announcements and music from Peshawar Stadium’s loudspeakers. And in Dabgari Chowk, the celebrated Pashto ghazal singer Khyal Muhammad would perform all night in the middle of the road, surrounded by people who came for poetry, not politics. That was the Peshawar I grew up in: confident, open, generous. Painter and sculptor Arbab Muhammad Sardar in his gallery: in 1997, after receiving threats warning him against painting human faces and creating sculptures, he began removing his works from display. THE TRANSFORMATION But then came the Afghan war and Gen Ziaul Haq’s call for ‘jihad’. Overnight, Peshawar became the frontline of a global game. It turned into a Kalashnikov capital, a smuggler’s paradise, a city of spies and sudden millionaires. To own a gun was to be powerful, to fire it in the air was to be feared. Over decades, religious seminaries multiplied, public art vanished and cultural spaces disappeared or were muted. Suspicion replaced neighbourliness. Extremism was not an accident, it was a slow, deliberate recalibration of society, one that suffocated the city’s cultural lungs. Supporters of a religious political party burn an American flag during a protest at Peshawar’s Martyrs’ Monument, erected in memory of members of the non-violent Khudai Khidmatgar movement killed by British forces. The moment underscores the contrast between a site rooted in peaceful resistance and later waves of political anger shaped by global events. On my second day in the city, I photographed a young Islamist student wrapped in a white turban, wearing a light-brown Schott NYC US Army jacket. The irony hit me like a flash: an American brand on a madrassa [seminary] student. When I asked about it, he smiled and said it was his “trophy”. I didn’t ask more. He happily posed for a picture. That single moment pulled me 30 years back, to 1996, when the Taliban had just taken control of Afghanistan. Back then, they walked freely in Peshawar’s streets. The city was their resting ground, their moral laboratory. Tora Bora, Afghanistan: Foot soldiers rest during a pause in fighting. Some prepare for prayer, while one listens quietly to Indian songs on the All India Radio. Beyond labels such as Taliban or mujahid holy warrior, the image reveals the ordinary human contradictions of war — faith, fatigue, memory and music coexisting in a single moment. And here I was again, 30 years later — the same story, the same spirit, just new clothes and a different brand. I didn’t ask this young man about his ‘trophy’. Not because I was afraid, but because I understood that, in our land, questions can sometimes be louder than answers. History in this part of the world never moves forward — it keeps circling, dressing old beliefs in new symbols. A WALK ON CINEMA ROAD The afternoon light falls softly on Cinema Road, the street that once carried the heartbeat of the city. The air still smells of dust, tea and faint memories of songs that used to spill from cassette shops. My steps now echo where music once lived. Near the Sethi House, Peshawar’s old streets still carry the elegance of carved balconies, fading paint and narrow passages that once shaped everyday life. Caught between neglect and survival, these lanes stand as quiet witnesses to a city whose architectural memory is slowly slipping away. Inside a narrow tea shop, Jan Muhammad sits cross-legged beside his brass samovar. This was once the German Tea Shop, now everyone calls it Jan Muhammad Chai Khana. He pours boiling milk into cups, the sound of hissing steam blending with the low hum of conversation. He looks up and says, “Alhamdulillah [Praise be to Allah], the bazar is clean now, no obscenity, only business.” The clang of kettles and the breath of steam are all that remain from a time when this road was alive with sound, posters and film lights. There was a time when Cinema Road glowed every evening. Three proud cinema halls stood shoulder-to-shoulder: Picture House, Novelty and Tasweer Mahal. People knew them not by their official names but by what they looked like: Picture House was Makhamkh Cinema, the one in the front; Novelty was Manz Cinema, the middle one; and Tasweer Mahal was Pehla Cinema, the first one in the row. At Picture House Cinema on Cinema Road in the early 2000s, film billboards were altered during the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure, with female faces removed and only male actors left visible. The cinema itself has since been bulldozed, marking the physical erasure of a once-thriving cultural space from the city’s landscape. Crowds of young men filled the street. Truck drivers, students and visitors from the villages of Khyber, Charsadda, Mardan and Kohat. They came for the films, for the laughter, for the noise that made this road feel like a fair. Music shops lined both sides: Sherbaz Khan Music Centre, Shalimar and Gul Sattar Khan. Their cassette racks glimmered under yellow bulbs, filled with Pashto, Indian, Persian and English songs. The road itself throbbed like a radio tuned between worlds. The photo studios were tiny rooms where magic happened. A young man could pose and see himself printed beside Badar Munir, Musarrat Shaheen, Yasmin Khan or Suraya Khan — a small miracle made with scissors, negatives and glue. He would take that photo back to his hujra [communal space], proud and smiling, showing it as proof that he had met fame. Now those same shops sell PVC boards and stationery — the film stars are gone, but the cracked walls still remember them. And through Photoshopping now, young men opt to be transformed into images of militants, guns in hand and a rocket-launcher on the shoulder. A little ahead, the Tasweer Mahal lies buried under a 13-storey plaza. Novelty and Picture House have also been erased, bulldozed like memories no one asked to keep. Dust has replaced the crowd clamouring at the cinema gate, eager to get in. Only silence stands where the hero once leapt across the screen amidst applause from cine-goers. Further down stands the Aina Cinema, its doors half-open to… whom? The ‘Ladies Gate’ sign still hangs above the narrow staircase. Aina Cinema, once alive with music, colour and collective dreams, is now reduced to a parking lot. The ‘Pay Box’ lettering survives, though a car now blocks the view. And above, the mural of dancers and musicians — colours faded — still hangs on through the years. This hall once echoed with clapping hands and Pashto film dialogue. Now it rents its floor to cars. No one I ask says they miss those days. Maybe they have forgotten, maybe forgetting is easier. But for those who grew up in that sound and smoke, the loss runs deep — not just of cinemas, but of openness. An image from 1996 that captures the tension between public piety and private curiosity. There was a balance once. Faith and fun walking side by side. Falak Sair and Capital Cinemas in Saddar, the Takhtu Jumat mosque between them, Blue Bells Music Centre beside. Naz Cinema near Masjid Mahabat Khan and Cinema Road itself beside Madani Masjid of Namak Mandi. After Friday prayers, some men went to the cinema, some to Dabgari Bazar — both part of one rhythm that made the city move. In Peshawar’s Dabgari Bazaar, musicians traditionally kept their balcony windows open so passers-by could see and hire them. During the MMA provincial government’s campaign against music, pressure from authorities forced these windows shut. In this image from 2003, two musicians cautiously peer onto the street — a quiet moment reflecting how fear and regulation pushed a once public art into the shadows Evening falls again on Cinema Road. At Jan Muhammad’s shop, the kettles cool slowly and the tea tastes like nostalgia — thick, sweet and a little burnt. The steam curls upward like the city’s last song.

The echoes rolled beneath the overhead BRT [Bus Rapid Transit] track, bouncing between the concrete pillars that now bear the stains of shrapnel. Three FC personnel were martyred on the spot, several others were wounded. Under the overhead bridge, men gathered in silence. Children clutched schoolbags. Bikers slowed to watch the police lift the burned car with a forklift, its tires dangling mid-air. A haunting image of another day gone wrong. Nearby, an FC soldier stood guard over a blood-soaked shroud, staring at what little was left of the attacker. And yet, just a few hundred meters away, life went on. Shops re-opened, schools and offices stayed functional, and traffic crawled as usual. The people of Peshawar, hardened by decades of violence, carried on with that familiar numbness that only a city long at war can understand. By noon, the road was cleared. The glass shards on the asphalt shimmered like tiny memorials in the sunlight. For outsiders, it was a terror attack — for Peshawar, it was Monday.

He was the man with the broom — a long jharroo in one hand, a small steel cart in the other — walking through Nothia Jadeed, Miskeen Abad, Judge Bungalow and Kotla Mohsin Khan every dawn. A faded Palestinian-style scarf tied around his head, dark skin shining with sweat, white teeth flashing when he laughed. A laughter full of life and, at times, full of quiet sorrow. After sweeping, he would sit cross-legged on the ground, cracking jokes, calling out to the housewives in his broken Pashto: “ Ay baaji, chai milay gi? Ay mory, aik paratha mere liye bhi ! [Sister, can I get a cup of tea? One paratha for me too!] Every woman in the neighbourhood knew him, respected him. And he, in return, respected everyone. Working and smiling, never demanding more than a greeting or a cup of tea. But when someone threw waste food, plastic or burned trash on the same street he had just cleaned, Nasimy would laugh again. A deep, tired, saddened laugh, the kind that hides pain behind politeness. A few days ago, I learned that Nasimy had died. Inside a blocked gutter at Darul Uloom Usmania, the very madrassa whose drains he was cleaning. He suffocated there, in the dark, doing the work no one else wanted to do. He died where the city’s conscience never dares to go. I asked around: was he married? Did he have children, a home, a family? No one knew. There are thousands like Nasimy in Pakistan — most belonging to Christian and Hindu minorities, living without contracts, safety or respect. They clean the mess of millions, yet die in silence. Sometimes I think we Pakhtuns, indeed the entire Pakistani nation, are among the most contradictory of people, with arrogance born out of the caste system. Those who cut our hair and make us beautiful, we call nai, implying a lowly status. Those who shape the clay into pots that feed us, we call kolal, equally lowly. Those who bring colour to our lives, we still treat as low. We are blind to the truth that they — not us — keep the rhythm of life alive. FROM KALASHNIKOVS TO TIKTOK Forty-five years later, the story has not changed, only the platforms have. From Iqbaly and Dabangy to Tila Khan, Ayuby and Papu, these names ruled the underworld. They were legends of ‘badmaashi’ — gangsters, assassins, drug lords — until SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) Sifwat Ghayur arrived with an iron will. One by one, his team took down the city’s crime lords. But in a cruel irony of fate, SSP Ghayur and his men would later be killed by the Taliban they once fought to contain. Leaders and supporters of religious political parties address a public gathering during a rally in which Osama bin Laden was publicly portrayed as a “mujahid holy warrior”. The gangsters of Peshawar are no longer hiding in dark alleys; they are performing on TikTok. They threaten, boast and mock each other in viral videos, before ending up dead in police encounters that everyone knows are paid for. Just a few days ago, Malik Adam Khan, an Afghan-Pakistani figure once feared, was killed along with his companions. Rumours spread across the city that his rivals, Mumtazy “Two Feet”, Haji Habib and Breet Khan, paid the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police for the ‘operation’. Hours later, Mumtazy threw a celebration, a night of dance and gunfire, mocking the death of his rival. In the 1980s, Peshawar’s poison was heroin and opium — today it’s ice, crystal meth, a drug that burns young minds faster than war ever did. The city’s streets are no longer full of storytellers or musicians — they’re full of dealers, addicts and a lost generation. And then, the ultimate tragedy. Videos surface of fathers selling their own children for food. Crying boys and girls under the age of 12, auctioned in shame because poverty has crushed the last pillars of Pakhtun honour. It was unthinkable once. It’s the reality now. Guns, drugs, gangs and tears — the story repeats itself. But somewhere between the smoke of the Kalashnikov and the glow of a TikTok screen, the soul of Peshawar burns among its ashes. WHAT REMAINS I often say I lost my city. In many ways, I have. The Peshawar of my youth — diverse, artistic, tolerant — survives now only in memory and in scattered pockets of resistance. Once a walled city entered through many gates, Peshawar has recently restored these gateways as symbols of its centuries-old identity. Kabuli Gate, the historic entry to Qissa Khwani Bazaar, stands again — marking the threshold where stories, trade and history have flowed for generations. But I also know this: culture is resilient. Music finds cracks to slip through. Joy returns in unexpected places. It does sometimes on rooftops, sometimes on a wedding stage trembling after an attack. The extremists took much from Peshawar. But they have not taken its soul entirely. Not yet. I carry that belief like I carry an old photograph — edges fading, centre glowing. And I hold on to it, because cities don’t die when buildings fall or when cultures are silenced. They die when their people stop remembering what they once were. Until then, every Pakhtun must ask: what kind of flower garden are we, if we keep watering the soil with the blood of our own roses?

      "summary_orig": "Iran will offer no leniency to “rioters,” though the public has a right to demonstrate, the head of the judiciary said on Monday, following more than a week of protests . The demonstrations began last Sunday in Tehran when shopkeepers staged a strike over high prices and economic stagnation, but they have since spread to other regions and expanded to include political demands. “I instruct the attorney general and prosecutors across the country to act in accordance with the law and with resolve against the rioters and those who support them… and to show no leniency or indulgence,” Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency. He added that Iran “listens to the protesters and their criticism, and distinguishes between them and rioters”. Protests have taken place in 25 out of Iran’s 31 provinces and affected, to varying degrees, at least 45 different cities, most of them small or medium-sized and concentrated in the west, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and media reports. At least 12 people have been killed since December 30 in localised clashes, including members of the security forces, according to a tally based on official announcements, and there have been media reports of episodes of property damage in the west. The Fars news agency said on Monday that “the trend observed on Sunday night shows a notable decrease in the number of gatherings and their geographic reach compared to previous nights”. Local media’s accounting of the protests is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed their coverage of the demonstrations, while videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify. The national currency, the rial, has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year, while double-digit inflation has been undermining Iranians’ purchasing power for years. The rial was depreciating again on Monday against the greenback after strengthening in recent days, according to the informal black-market rate, which stands at around 1.4 million rials, compared with about 770,000 a year earlier. Publicly, officials have struck a conciliatory tone when it comes to protesters’ economic demands, while vowing to take a hard line against any chaos and destabilisation.",

      "summary_orig": "India’s Supreme Court denied bail on Monday for former student leader Umar Khalid , who has been detained for more than five years on charges of conspiracy to trigger deadly riots . Khalid, 38, was arrested in September 2020 under a sweeping anti-terrorism law and has remained in custody since, aside from brief releases to attend family weddings. His case has become a touchstone for critics who say India’s more than 200 million Muslims face discriminatory treatment in the Hindu-majority nation. Khalid was detained after the February 2020 sectarian riots in Delhi when 53 people were killed — mostly Muslims, but also several Hindus. The Supreme Court in New Delhi dismissed his appeal for bail, saying that “prolonged incarceration” was not grounds to grant him release. It also denied bail on the same grounds to another student activist, Sharjeel Imam. But it approved bail for five others in the same case. Khalid, a former student at Delhi’s prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University, was charged with rioting with a deadly weapon, as well as attempted murder, sedition and causing enmity between different groups. He denies all charges. Police also accused Khalid of delivering “provocative speeches” ahead of the riots. In 2022, he published an open letter saying that “we can be kept in jail for years, without those framing us needing to prove anything”. His partner, Banojyotsna Lahiri, has said that Khalid “became the victim of the injustice that he always fought against”. Amnesty International and six other rights groups issued a statement in September calling for the release of Khalid. “Khalid’s prolonged persecution exemplifies the derailment of justice in India, as it makes a mockery of international human rights principles,” Amnesty said in a statement to mark Khalid’s fifth year in prison. Khalid’s arrest came months after protests against India’s contentious Citizen Amendment Act (CAA). The 2019 law makes it easier for persecuted religious minorities from three neighbouring countries to obtain citizenship, but not if they are Muslim.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday called on lawyers in Islamabad to stand up for an independent judiciary as he continued his efforts to rally support for the PTI’s street movement . The KP CM made the remarks while addressing the legal fraternity at an event organised by the Islamabad Bar Association. After completing a three-day visit to Lahore, Afridi has announced Karachi as his next destination. “If you do not stand up for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law and for an independent judiciary, then future generations will spit on us and you as well,” Afridi said. He urged them to announce a lawyers’ movement, adding that the youth will support them. “Long live resistance,” the chief minister said. “You must support the PTI founder [Imran Khan] against oppression and barbarity. Whose conscience is even one per cent alive will stand against the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, as well as unfair trials — whether of journalists or politicians — and will demand the release of all political workers who are wrongfully in jail,” Afridi said. CM Afridi also stressed that Imran did not seek his release, but rather a fair trial. “A convicted person was received at the airport,” the PTI leader said, apparently referring to ex-premier Nawaz Sharif landing in Islamabad after he returned to Pakistan in October 2023. During his address, Afridi also praised Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, who was among the audience. “Imaan Mazari has created a new history of resistance. The youth receive encouragement from her,“ Afridi said. He also mentioned that some journalists were recently sentenced after their “trials in absentia”. “ Arshad Sharif had to leave his country to save his life because he was not getting justice and security here, but he was not spared even abroad,” the KP CM said, referring to the journalist being shot dead in Kenya on Oct 23, 2022. Afridi cautioned the lawyers that while the PTI was facing “oppression and fascism today”, it could be their turn tomorrow. “You will not be able to tolerate what the PTI has,“ he said. Afridi once again lamented that he was repeatedly being denied a meeting with Imran, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail. “Three judges [of the IHC] issued orders for [my] meeting with the PTI founder, but the Adiala jail’s superintendent threw that directive in the trash,” the KP CM said. He said that Imran was “fighting our war in jail”, adding that “those who took cars from the Toshakhana were the rulers and the person who took items legally was in prison“. “They have incapacitated you all,” the chief minister said. CM Afridi further said that “people from all schools of thought” in KP believed that a military operation was not the solution to rising militancy in the province. “But there are still preparations for an operation. This is not a functioning system but hooliganism,” the chief minister said.",

      "summary_orig": "The promise of digitisation and artificial intelligence (AI) for Pakistan is unmistakable: a path to modernised governance, efficient services, and new economic frontiers. Yet as the country accelerates its digital transformation, 2026 is shaping up to be a decisive year in which policy visions must confront hard operational realities. A dual pressure — an epidemic of financial scams and a new wave of mandatory cybersecurity regulations — is forcing a hard turn from aspiration to implementation. The scale of digital risk is no longer theoretical. According to the Global State of Scams Report 2025 , Pakistan loses an estimated $9 billion annually to financial and digital scams, a figure equivalent to roughly 2.5 per cent of GDP and larger than the value of the recent $7 billion IMF loan programme. This “silent economic haemorrhage” stems from increasingly sophisticated fraud that exploits digital payment systems, social media, and telecom networks. Fraudsters are using AI-polished phishing, fake investment platforms and scams impersonating banks, couriers and service providers, exacting a heavy toll on citizens and businesses alike. Some reports of mega frauds find space in the main daily newspapers, but details of many other incidents keep circulating on social media. Given the rise in AI adoption and resulting misuse, the country has begun laying a strategic foundation for its digital future that involves setting up training centres and starting a national fund Authorities have responded, launching major crackdowns such as Operation Grey, which led to hundreds of arrests, including foreign nationals. The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) led this operation, with support from the Federal Investigation Authority and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority. But these efforts also underscore a critical vulnerability: rapid digital adoption has far outpaced the development of robust cyber governance and public awareness. In direct response to the accelerating pace of digitisation and AI adoption, Pakistan’s regulatory landscape is undergoing its most significant transformation to date. The year 2026 marks a clear shift away from voluntary or advisory frameworks toward mandatory, legally enforceable requirements. For businesses operating across sectors, regulatory compliance is no longer a matter of best practice or reputational comfort; it is rapidly becoming a basic condition for continued operation and market access. A central pillar of this shift is the introduction of the Pakistan Security Standards (PSS), which mandate compulsory adoption across all public and private sector information technology and cryptographic systems. Full compliance is required by June 1, 2028 (for defence-sector entities, the deadline was December 31, 2025). The implications for industry are substantial: future hardware and software procurement must explicitly specify PSS-compliant products and systems, and non-compliance risks operational disruption, regulatory sanctions and exclusion from government contracts. Alongside the PSS, regulators are rolling out increasingly stringent sector-specific requirements. The State Bank of Pakistan’s Technology Risk Management frameworks now demand demonstrable technical and governance controls, formal board-level oversight of cyber risk, and integration of cyber resilience into overall operational resilience planning. These measures reflect a clear expectation that cyber risk be treated as a core enterprise risk, not a purely technical concern. The telecommunications sector is also facing far-reaching change under the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s CTDISR-2025 framework , which mandates data localisation, 24-hour reporting of cybersecurity incidents, clear accountability through designated chief information security officers, and a move toward Zero Trust architectures. Meanwhile, the anticipated Personal Data Protection Bill — once enacted — is expected to introduce strict data localisation rules and a 72-hour breach notification mandate, further raising the compliance bar for organisations that collect, process or store personal data within Pakistan. As is evident from the above discussion, Pakistan has begun laying a strategic foundation for its digital future. The cabinet- approved National Artificial Intelligence Policy 2025 sets ambitious targets, including training one million people in AI-related skills, establishing national Centres of Excellence, and creating a dedicated National AI Fund. The policy signals intent, but its success will depend on execution and alignment with ground realities. Early pilot projects already demonstrate how AI can address longstanding development gaps. In taxation, machine-learning models using satellite imagery are being deployed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab to identify previously unassessed properties and expand the tax base. In environmental governance, AI-driven dashboards enable real-time smog monitoring and enforcement actions in Punjab. Urban planners in Lahore are using telecom data and AI analytics to map informal economic activity and migration patterns, offering insights that were previously invisible to policymakers. Policymakers must accelerate institutional readiness. The establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority should be fast-tracked to serve as a central coordinating body, while the National AI Council must prioritise “AI for development,” linking initiatives directly to measurable outcomes such as improved tax compliance, environmental enforcement and climate adaptation. The public and media also have a critical role to play. Awareness campaigns must evolve from general warnings to practical education, helping citizens recognise AI-generated scams, phishing attempts and the importance of basic safeguards such as multi-factor authentication. Pakistan’s digital ambition cannot be separated from its digital security. The promise of AI and digitisation is real, but it rests on systems that are trusted, resilient and enforceable. As the National AI Conference approaches in early 2026, the national conversation must focus on this integration — harnessing innovation not just for growth but for secure and sustainable growth.

Some reports of mega frauds find space in the main daily newspapers, but details of many other incidents keep circulating on social media. Given the rise in AI adoption and resulting misuse, the country has begun laying a strategic foundation for its digital future that involves setting up training centres and starting a national fund Authorities have responded, launching major crackdowns such as Operation Grey, which led to hundreds of arrests, including foreign nationals. The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) led this operation, with support from the Federal Investigation Authority and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority. But these efforts also underscore a critical vulnerability: rapid digital adoption has far outpaced the development of robust cyber governance and public awareness. In direct response to the accelerating pace of digitisation and AI adoption, Pakistan’s regulatory landscape is undergoing its most significant transformation to date. The year 2026 marks a clear shift away from voluntary or advisory frameworks toward mandatory, legally enforceable requirements. For businesses operating across sectors, regulatory compliance is no longer a matter of best practice or reputational comfort; it is rapidly becoming a basic condition for continued operation and market access. A central pillar of this shift is the introduction of the Pakistan Security Standards (PSS), which mandate compulsory adoption across all public and private sector information technology and cryptographic systems. Full compliance is required by June 1, 2028 (for defence-sector entities, the deadline was December 31, 2025). The implications for industry are substantial: future hardware and software procurement must explicitly specify PSS-compliant products and systems, and non-compliance risks operational disruption, regulatory sanctions and exclusion from government contracts. Alongside the PSS, regulators are rolling out increasingly stringent sector-specific requirements. The State Bank of Pakistan’s Technology Risk Management frameworks now demand demonstrable technical and governance controls, formal board-level oversight of cyber risk, and integration of cyber resilience into overall operational resilience planning. These measures reflect a clear expectation that cyber risk be treated as a core enterprise risk, not a purely technical concern. The telecommunications sector is also facing far-reaching change under the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s CTDISR-2025 framework , which mandates data localisation, 24-hour reporting of cybersecurity incidents, clear accountability through designated chief information security officers, and a move toward Zero Trust architectures. Meanwhile, the anticipated Personal Data Protection Bill — once enacted — is expected to introduce strict data localisation rules and a 72-hour breach notification mandate, further raising the compliance bar for organisations that collect, process or store personal data within Pakistan. As is evident from the above discussion, Pakistan has begun laying a strategic foundation for its digital future. The cabinet- approved National Artificial Intelligence Policy 2025 sets ambitious targets, including training one million people in AI-related skills, establishing national Centres of Excellence, and creating a dedicated National AI Fund. The policy signals intent, but its success will depend on execution and alignment with ground realities. Early pilot projects already demonstrate how AI can address longstanding development gaps. In taxation, machine-learning models using satellite imagery are being deployed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab to identify previously unassessed properties and expand the tax base. In environmental governance, AI-driven dashboards enable real-time smog monitoring and enforcement actions in Punjab. Urban planners in Lahore are using telecom data and AI analytics to map informal economic activity and migration patterns, offering insights that were previously invisible to policymakers. Policymakers must accelerate institutional readiness. The establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority should be fast-tracked to serve as a central coordinating body, while the National AI Council must prioritise “AI for development,” linking initiatives directly to measurable outcomes such as improved tax compliance, environmental enforcement and climate adaptation. The public and media also have a critical role to play. Awareness campaigns must evolve from general warnings to practical education, helping citizens recognise AI-generated scams, phishing attempts and the importance of basic safeguards such as multi-factor authentication. Pakistan’s digital ambition cannot be separated from its digital security. The promise of AI and digitisation is real, but it rests on systems that are trusted, resilient and enforceable. As the National AI Conference approaches in early 2026, the national conversation must focus on this integration — harnessing innovation not just for growth but for secure and sustainable growth.
