      "summary_orig": "Reporters Without Borders said on Tuesday that Israel was responsible for nearly half of all journalists killed this year worldwide, with 29 Palestinian reporters slain by its forces in Gaza. In its annual report , the Paris-based media freedom group said the total number of journalists killed reached 67 globally this year, slightly up from the 66 killed in 2024. Israeli forces accounted for 43 per cent of the total, making them “the worst enemy of journalists”, RSF said in its report, which documented deaths over 12 months from December 2024. The most deadly single attack was a so-called “double-tap” strike on a hospital in south Gaza on August 25, which killed five journalists, including two contributors to international news agencies Reuters and the Associated Press . In total, since the start of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in October 2023, nearly 220 journalists have died, making Israel the biggest killer of journalists worldwide for three years running, RSF data shows. Foreign reporters are still unable to travel to Gaza — unless they are in tightly controlled tours organised by the Israeli military — despite calls from media groups and press freedom organisations for access. Elsewhere in the RSF annual report, the group said that 2025 was the deadliest year in Mexico in at least three years, with nine journalists killed there, despite pledges from left-wing President Claudia Sheinbaum to help protect them. War-wracked Ukraine (three journalists killed) and Sudan (four journalists killed) are the other most dangerous countries for reporters in the world, according to RSF. The overall number of deaths last year is far down from the peak of 142 journalists killed in 2012, linked largely to the Syrian civil war, and is below the average since 2003 of around 80 killed per year. The RSF annual report also counts the number of journalists imprisoned worldwide for their work, with 121 in China, 48 in Russia and 47 in Myanmar. As of December 1, 2025, 503 journalists were detained in 47 countries across the world, the report said.",

Each side has blamed the other for the clashes, which have derailed a fragile ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump that ended five days of fighting in July. Cambodia’s Defence Ministry said two civilians had been killed overnight, taking its death toll to six. One Thai soldier has died in the fighting. In a statement on Tuesday morning, the Thai Navy said Cambodian forces had been detected inside Thai territory in the coastal province of Trat and military operations were launched to expel them, without providing further details. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said late on Monday that Thailand “must not use military force to attack civilian villages under the pretext of reclaiming its sovereignty”. Earlier, Cambodia said it had not retaliated even after its forces came under sustained attack. The Thai Navy said Cambodian forces were increasing their presence, deploying snipers and heavy weapons, improving fortified positions and digging trenches, adding it saw the actions “as a direct and serious threat to Thailand’s sovereignty”. Monday’s clashes were the fiercest since a five-day exchange of rockets and heavy artillery in July, when at least 48 people were killed and 300,000 displaced, before Trump intervened to broker a ceasefire. Thailand evacuated 438,000 civilians across five border provinces and authorities in Cambodia said hundreds of thousands of people had been moved to safety. Thailand’s army said 18 soldiers were wounded and Cambodia’s government reported nine civilians injured. Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817-km (508-mile) land border, with disputes over ancient temples stirring nationalist fervour and occasional armed flare-ups, including a deadly week-long artillery exchange in 2011. Tensions rose in May following the killing of a Cambodian soldier during a skirmish, which led to a major troop buildup at the border and escalated into diplomatic breakdowns and armed clashes.",

Thailand evacuated 438,000 civilians across five border provinces and authorities in Cambodia said hundreds of thousands of people had been moved to safety. Thailand’s army said 18 soldiers were wounded and Cambodia’s government reported nine civilians injured. Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817-km (508-mile) land border, with disputes over ancient temples stirring nationalist fervour and occasional armed flare-ups, including a deadly week-long artillery exchange in 2011. Tensions rose in May following the killing of a Cambodian soldier during a skirmish, which led to a major troop buildup at the border and escalated into diplomatic breakdowns and armed clashes.",

      "summary_orig": "SO, Rahul Gandhi was not invited to the state banquet for Russian President Vladimir Putin. We are told Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ensured that the leader of opposition in parliament’s Lower House — the shadow prime minister in the British system — wasn’t allowed to make even a courtesy call on the visiting dignitary. Rahul took his exclusion demurely, calling it a reflection of the government’s insecurity. He didn’t seem too bothered. When he travels abroad, he said, he finds it difficult to meet senior leaders because they had been advised to not interact with him. Modi’s peevishness with the Gandhi family is well recorded, but there is evidently more to it than the challenge of competing with Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy and the palpable inferiority complex the combat engenders. His spite for Rahul can be linked to 2005 when Modi was denied visas by the US and European countries. The Congress government headed by Manmohan Singh had taken over the previous year from a BJP-led coalition of prime minister A.B. Vajpayee. Modi’s tourist visa to the US was revoked during Congress rule. The American embassy cited his alleged role in the 2002 communal violence in Gujarat when he was chief minister of the state. Did PM Singh indeed have a role in instigating foreign embassies to stall Modi’s travels abroad? If so, it was a foolish and counterproductive idea. If there was indeed a case against Modi, and Zakia Jaffri swears there were several, then the Indian state should not have taken refuge behind foreign governments. If the Congress didn’t have the courage to impound his passport or send him to jail — assuming it had clinching evidence of Modi’s role in the 2002 carnage — it showed cowardice bordering on complicity. Modi hasn’t a care for diplomatic finesse. When two women journalists were assigned to interview Putin at the Kremlin before his Delhi visit, they came across as Modi’s envoys. Which Indian prime minister in Putin’s view had contributed the most to cement India’s ties with Russia? The host wasted no time in ticking off the journalists for asking an “indecent” question. Rahul Gandhi is not unaware of the risks of calling out Modi on issues of high corruption, electoral fraud and divisive politics. The visit was said to be essentially about optics for both sides. However, the aspect made public was gross. Struggling to cope with Delhi’s acrid air, Putin walked bravely on a red carpet that seemed to have been rented from the lowest (or highest) bidder. As for the comparison of himself with Nehru Modi never stops making, one needs to regard a slice of history. For contrast, consider Indira Gandhi’s class. Minutes before the Non-Aligned Movement’s summit was to begin at Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan in March 1983, Mrs Gandhi walked over to the packed press enclosure. It was a complex international event delicately involving 100 countries. Ziaul Haq and Fidel Castro came calling for opposing ideological corners. Mrs Gandhi didn’t breeze into the press enclosure to take advantage of the presence of global media. She headed straight to the cafeteria, instead, to ensure her fabled housekeeping rules. “Soggy sandwiches,” she declaimed, ordering frantic officials to remove the trays and get a fresh lot quickly. She then walked back briskly to the summit to take the gavel from Castro. Regardless of the spite rivals like Z.A. Bhutto, Richard Nixon or George Fernandes reserved for her, Indira Gandhi was an authentic world leader accustomed to the grace and competence required of an Indian PM. She could regale Queen Elizabeth with colonial history in Goa or reward Ronald Reagan for his warm reception at the White House with an adroit but cheerful thank you address. She didn’t position Indian photographers to impress the world when Leonid Brezhnev broke protocol to receive her at the head of an entire Soviet politburo when she landed in Moscow, defying bilious Western reproach. In 1972, Mrs Gandhi chose to overlook the slurs Bhutto had hurled at her in an interview with Oriana Fallaci and concluded that signing the Shimla Accord was more important than getting even. Indira could speak better French than her father but lacked the intellectual heft of Nehru. But practically all of Modi’s predecessors were better educated than him. And Nehru, his bugbear, wrote brilliant books on Indian and global history, that too during his days in colonial prisons. As prime minister, Nehru negotiated a perilously polarised world and displayed great sagacity at a dire moment in history. Nikita Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy were close to destroying the planet before they struck up an enviable friendship. And they both courted Nehru equally. Khrushchev sought his friendship when they visited each other in 1955. Kennedy made a display of his respect for Nehru by climbing the plane’s ladder to welcome the visitor to the US. It was for his widely acknowledged political integrity that Moscow, Washington and Beijing agreed to India’s intervention in the Korean War to negotiate a tricky moment in ending the bloody conflict. Putin knows this even if Indian journalists don’t. Next, Rajiv Gandhi who was happily married to Italian-born Sonia Maino and enjoying being the father of their two children. He shunned limelight and was pleased with his lack of ambition or pugnacity of his younger brother. If anything, he was content to be a skilled commercial pilot. After Sanjay Gandhi died in a plane crash and his mother was assassinated in a hail of bullets, Sonia urged her husband not to walk into the dangerous power vacuum. She was right. He was assassinated after a tormented tenure despite an unparalleled 414 seats in the 543-member House. Rahul Gandhi is not unaware of the risks of calling out Modi on issues of high corruption, electoral fraud and divisive politics. When a peeved Modi excluded him from a state banquet, he signalled Rahul’s larger challenge. Unlike Cinderella’s struggle with those who envied her presence at the royal ball, Rahul knows well that there are no fairy godmothers in cutthroat politics to bail him out.

Putin knows this even if Indian journalists don’t. Next, Rajiv Gandhi who was happily married to Italian-born Sonia Maino and enjoying being the father of their two children. He shunned limelight and was pleased with his lack of ambition or pugnacity of his younger brother. If anything, he was content to be a skilled commercial pilot. After Sanjay Gandhi died in a plane crash and his mother was assassinated in a hail of bullets, Sonia urged her husband not to walk into the dangerous power vacuum. She was right. He was assassinated after a tormented tenure despite an unparalleled 414 seats in the 543-member House. Rahul Gandhi is not unaware of the risks of calling out Modi on issues of high corruption, electoral fraud and divisive politics. When a peeved Modi excluded him from a state banquet, he signalled Rahul’s larger challenge. Unlike Cinderella’s struggle with those who envied her presence at the royal ball, Rahul knows well that there are no fairy godmothers in cutthroat politics to bail him out.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The United Nations and its partners on Monday launched their 2026 global humanitarian appeal, with $64.9 million specifically earmarked to support 1.9m vulnerable people in Pakistan as part of the $33bn plan aimed at saving lives threatened by wars, climate disasters, epidemics, earthquakes and crop failures worldwide. The humanitarian appeals’ immediate priority is to save 87 million lives with $23bn in funding, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said. Ultimately, in 2026, the aim is to raise a total of $33bn to support 135m people through 23 country operations and six plans for refugees and migrants. The appeal, titled ‘2026 Response Plan’ earmarks $64.9m to provide assistance to 1.9m people in Pakist­­an. The aim of the appeal, called ‘Life by Life’, is to reach 135m in 50 countries in 2026, the UN agency said. UNOCHA noted that in 2025, 98m people received help despite funding cuts and attacks on aid workers. Occupied Palestinian Territory gets the largest individual plan — $4.1bn for three million people In 2026, the largest individual response plan is for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, where $4.1bn is needed to assist 3 million people who have experienced shocking levels of violence and destruction. In Sudan, the world’s largest displacement crisis, $2.9bn is needed for 20 million people. The largest regional plan is for Syria, with $2.8bn targeted for 8.6 million people. The highly prioritised appeal follows a year in which humanitarian lifelines were strained and, in some places, snapped due to severe funding cuts. Funding for the 2025 appeal — $12bn — was the lowest in a decade, resulting in 25 million fewer people being reached compared to 2024. Amidst this devastation, civilians endured blatant disregard for the laws of war, and more than 320 aid workers, the vast majority of them local staff, were killed. The consequences were immediate: hunger surged, health systems came under crushing strain, education collapsed, mine clearance stalled and families suffered blow after blow, with no shelter, no cash assistance and no protection services. “This appeal sets out where we need to focus our collective energy first: life by life,” said UN Humanitarian Chief Tom Fletcher. “The Global Humanitarian Over­view 2026 is grounded in reform, evidence and efficiency. We are shifting power to local organisations, putting more money directly into the hands of those who need it, and, behind all, renewing and reimagining hu­­manitarian action with idealism, humility and hope.” Published in Dawn, December 9th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Ayaz Sadiq feels dialogue the only way forward, says he is still ready to play his role • Barrister Gohar calls for defusing tensions, indicates all party lawmakers will resign if ‘minus-one formula’ is implemented ISLAMABAD: With the main opposition PTI threatening to boycott parliamentary proceedings if the government continued to push it against the wall, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Monday reiterated his offer to mediate between the government and the party. Responding to the points raised by PTI interim Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the NA speaker noted that dialogue was the only way forward. He asked the opposition to consult on his offer and said he would also make a request to the government. “What can be achieved by criticising the institutions. The army not only defends the borders but also fights terrorism in the country,” Mr Sadiq rema­rked. He added that while his previous efforts to resolve issu­es between the between government and the opposition had not succeeded, he was still ready to play his role. ‘En masse resignation’ Earlier speaking in the House, Barrister Gohar called for defusing tensions and warned that if would not be possible for them to sit in the House if the prevailing situation continued. He also made it clear that the “minus-one [PTI founder Imran Khan] formula” would not work at all. The PTI leader indicated that all the party’s members would resign if there were any attempt to implement the minus-one formula. He said the enemies of Pakistan and democracy wanted a fight between “tita­ns and gladiators”, and that the country’s enemies would benefit if a major political party and a state institution came face to face. “It will be very unfortunate if the ongoing tensions in the country is not defused. There should be tolerance and not anarchy in politics,” he added. The PTI leader said the whole nation had been concerned since last Friday — when Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general held a press conference , wherein he launched a scathing attack on the PTI founder. Without naming the DG ISPR, Barrister Gohar said certain press conferences were very “disappointing”. He regretted that the PTI founder had been labelled a security threat, saying that it was unexpected. “Press conferences are not addressed like this,” he remarked. He maintained that Imran Khan was a guarantee for the continuation of democracy and not a threat to national security. Barrister Gohar said they had been demanding the PTI founder’s release, but a ban on meetings with him had now been placed. “We never desire that infighting in the country starts after Pakistan’s victory against a hostile neighbour,” he said. He asked the speaker and parliament to play their roles in defusing the tensions. Financial position Earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told the House that the government’s efforts to broaden and deepen the tax base were yielding results and the tax-to-GDP ratio had entered double digits after a long time. “It was 8.5 per cent in 2023-24 and 10.3pc last year. We are hopeful that it will be 11pc this year,” he remarked. He added that the total tax collection last year was Rs 11.7 trillion — a 27pc year-on-year increase. The minister continued that income tax collection increased by 28pc, sales tax by 26pc, federal excise duty by 33pc, and customs duty by 16pc. He added that revenue collection figures till November this year showed a 10.3pc increase. The minister said sugar and cement were the first two sectors where production was being digitally monitored through artificial intelligence. He elaborated that from July to November this year, Rs7bn in additional revenues from the sugar industry and Rs10bn from the cement sector had been collected compared to the same period last year. Mr Aurangzeb said digital monitoring would be ex­­panded to other sectors, including tobacco and beverages. “Technology is a big equaliser. It brings transparency. Technology brings a world which is no place to hide,” he said. The NA on Monday passed ‘The National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority Bill, 2025’ and ‘The Capital Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2025’. ‘The National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) (Amendment) Bill, 2025’ was also introduced in the House.

We are hopeful that it will be 11pc this year,” he remarked. He added that the total tax collection last year was Rs 11.7 trillion — a 27pc year-on-year increase. The minister continued that income tax collection increased by 28pc, sales tax by 26pc, federal excise duty by 33pc, and customs duty by 16pc. He added that revenue collection figures till November this year showed a 10.3pc increase. The minister said sugar and cement were the first two sectors where production was being digitally monitored through artificial intelligence. He elaborated that from July to November this year, Rs7bn in additional revenues from the sugar industry and Rs10bn from the cement sector had been collected compared to the same period last year. Mr Aurangzeb said digital monitoring would be ex­­panded to other sectors, including tobacco and beverages. “Technology is a big equaliser. It brings transparency. Technology brings a world which is no place to hide,” he said. The NA on Monday passed ‘The National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority Bill, 2025’ and ‘The Capital Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2025’. ‘The National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) (Amendment) Bill, 2025’ was also introduced in the House.

      "summary": "• Ayaz Sadiq feels dialogue the only way forward, says he is still ready to play his role • Barrister Gohar calls for defusing tensions, indicates all party lawmakers will resign if ‘minus-one formula’ is implemented ISLAMABAD: With the main opposition PTI threatening to boycott parliamentary proceedings if the government continued to push it against the wall, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Monday reiterated his offer to mediate between the government and the party. Responding to the points raised by PTI interim Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the NA speaker noted that dialogue was the only way forward. He asked the opposition to consult on his offer and said he would also make a request to the government. “What can be achieved by criticising the institutions. The army not only defends the borders but also fights terrorism in the country,” Mr Sadiq rema­rked. He added that while his previous efforts to resolve issu­es between the between government and the opposition had not succeeded, he was still ready to play his role. ‘En masse resignation’ Earlier speaking in the House, Barrister Gohar called for defusing tensions and warned that if would not be possible for them to sit in the House if the prevailing situation continued. He also made it clear that the “minus-one [PTI founder Imran Khan] formula” would not work at all. The PTI leader indicated that all the party’s members would resign if there were any attempt to implement the minus-one formula. He said the enemies of Pakistan and democracy wanted a fight between “tita­ns and gladiators”, and that the country’s enemies would benefit if a major political party and a state institution came face to face. “It will be very unfortunate if the ongoing tensions in the country is not defused. There should be tolerance and not anarchy in politics,” he added. The PTI leader said the whole nation had been concerned since last Friday — when Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general held a press conference , wherein he launched a scathing attack on the PTI founder. Without naming the DG ISPR, Barrister Gohar said certain press conferences were very “disappointing”. He regretted that the PTI founder had been labelled a security threat, saying that it was unexpected. “Press conferences are not addressed like this,” he remarked. He maintained that Imran Khan was a guarantee for the continuation of democracy and not a threat to national security. Barrister Gohar said they had been demanding the PTI founder’s release, but a ban on meetings with him had now been placed. “We never desire that infighting in the country starts after Pakistan’s victory against a hostile neighbour,” he said. He asked the speaker and parliament to play their roles in defusing the tensions.

      "summary_orig": "Saudi Arabia and Qatar on Monday signed a deal to construct a high-speed rail connecting the Gulf countries’ capitals, marking the latest sign of improved ties between the two nations that were once deeply at odds. According to a statement in the official Saudi press, the “high-speed electric passenger railway” would connect Riyadh and Doha. The Saudi cities of Al-Hofuf and Dammam are also expected to be on the network. The train would reach speeds exceeding 300 kilometres per hour and the trip would take roughly two hours between the two capitals. A direct flight between the cities clocks in at around 90 minutes. The project, set to be completed in six years, expects to serve 10 million passengers per year, the statement said. The agreement was signed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani during the latter’s visit to Riyadh. The deal is just the latest in a series of moves marking the dramatic improvement in ties between the Gulf countries in recent years. Saudi Arabia and its allies, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, had cut all diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017. The four nations accused Doha of backing radical extremists and seeking closer ties with Saudi Arabia’s arch-rival Tehran — allegations that Qatar vehemently denied. Relations were fully restored in January 2021 after a summit in the Saudi desert city of Al Ula. Prince Mohammed visited Doha in December 2021 for the first time since the thaw in ties, as part of a regional Gulf tour. Since then, leaders from the two monarchies have met regularly and joined forces to back diplomatic initiatives, including calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Riyadh also threw its support behind Qatar following Israeli strikes on Doha over the summer.",

      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik on Monday stated that Pakistan did not benefit from the PTI “project”, arguing that it aimed to destroy the country. In a blistering press conference on Friday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”. The PTI emphatically deplored the “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson, saying the party founder was “not a security threat” and lamented the weakening of democracy in the country following the passage of recent constitutional amendments. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, the minister highlighted that during its tenure, the PTI government “ran a campaign against the country, writing to the IMF and lobbying US politicians”. “Has the PTI taken a single beneficial step for Pakistan?” Malik asked, further questioning what development projects are underway in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the party is running the provincial administration. “When it comes to sovereignty and national security, we (PML-N) have never compromised,” he added. “There is a night and day difference between the policies of the PTI and the PML-N.” Malik pointed out that Imran himself claimed, when he was in power, that the army chief was akin to the “father of the nation” and that nobody could speak out against him. “Look at what Imran Khan is saying on Twitter,” he added, referring to posts against Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir. “I can say that the youth have introspected and found that countries cannot progress on hollow words, hollow promises and pure popularity,” Malik added. “I am not denying that there are questions around the 2024 general elections, but did Nawaz Sharif write any letters to the IMF? Was he involved in foreign lobbying?” Later, PTI Chief Whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar joined the programme and was asked about allegations labeling Imran a “security threat” by senior political and military leadership. “Who is (Information Minister) Atta Tarar to say these things about us?” Dogar replied. “He is a Form 47 politician who has only 16,000 votes, and now he’s lecturing the party of the country’s legitimate leader.” “No power can stop Imran Khan. They cannot stop us from speaking or protesting. We have endured so much over the past three years. What more can they do to us?” Dogar then highlighted how PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif gave interviews to Indian journalists and asked whether those would be forgotten. In response to a question about the PTI founder being called a security threat, Dogar said, “This is unfortunate and has been going on for 75 years. Fatima Jinnah, the mother of the nation, was once declared a security risk by Ayub Khan.” He also cited the examples of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman being deemed a security threat by Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto being declared a security threat by Ziaul Haq, stating that the country’s most popular leaders have been targeted throughout Pakistan’s history. “Where did all these people — Yahya, Ayub Khan — go? Political figures return in some way or another, because ideas never die,” Dogar stated. “Under this hybrid system, Pakistan’s future has been imprisoned. Read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission; the situation is similar.” Imran’s social media ‘not under’ party’s control When questioned about Imran’s social media accounts, Dogar noted that the account is not under the party’s control, nor is it under Imran’s. “Even today, in a parliamentary committee meeting, we agreed that messages from Imran in jail should not be disseminated like a vlogger outside the prison gates,” he said. “The party realises that we need to do whatever we can to ensure the release of our leader and workers.” PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, while talking to Dawn , said that Dogar’s statement had been misunderstood. “He meant that there were several young members in the social media team, but after the crackdown they left the country and are now operating their accounts on their own,” he said. Responding to a question, he said that whenever a leader or family member meets Imran Khan, the message is written on a piece of paper and then sent abroad, after which it is tweeted as it is. “The messages are sent directly abroad and then tweeted. They are not issued through the party’s media wing, so the media wing has nothing to do with them,” he added.",

      "summary_orig": "In another fatal incident involving a heavy vehicle, a dumper of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board carrying garbage struck and killed a motorcycle rider in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi on Monday, according to police. New Karachi Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammed Saud said the deceased, Hameedur Rehman, was riding a motorcycle under the Nagan bridge when the dumper crushed him to death. People gathered at the spot where the incident occurred, caught the dumper driver, Allah Rakha, and beat him until the police arrived. The police then took the accused into custody. The body was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities. The spot did not have closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to capture the incident, the SHO said and added that the incident occurred around 11:30 am. Eyewitnesses, present at the scene, informed the police that the motorcyclist was driving on the wrong side of the road. Rise in heavy vehicle accidents In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumpers and water tankers. Nearly 500 people lost their lives and 4,879 were injured in 2024 in road accidents resulting from various reasons, from reckless driving to construction activities, hospital data showed . On November 4, angered citizens set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it killed a man and injured his wife, resulting in some people opening fire on them. On October 12, a reckless dumper driver smashed into six vehicles , including three ambulances of the Edhi Foundation, near Merewether Clock Tower, killing a man and injuring two others. The driver, who possessed a “fake” licence, was arrested. On August 10, two siblings were killed and their father was injured when a dumper truck ran over them on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall. A mob then set seven trucks on fire, which sparked protests from transporters. August 15 recorded two accidents involving heavy vehicles, including one where a speeding water tanker ran over and killed a four-year-old boy in Orangi Town. In another accident, a young couple lost their lives when a fast-moving dumper truck hit their motorcycle in the Sultanabad area on M.T. Khan Road.",
