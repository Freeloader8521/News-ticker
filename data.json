      "summary_orig": "Three United States military personnel, two soldiers and a civilian interpreter, were killed on Saturday by a suspected Islamic State (IS) attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces, the US military said. Three other US soldiers were wounded, the US military’s Central Command said. In a statement, Central Command said the attack by a lone gunman occurred “as the soldiers were conducting a key leader engagement” in the central Syrian town of Palmyra. “Partner forces” killed the attacker, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth wrote in a social media post. IS did not immediately claim responsibility, but a senior US official said initial assessments indicate the militant group probably carried out the attack. It took place in an area not controlled by the Syrian government, the official said. The soldiers’ names will be withheld until 24 hours after the next-of-kin notification, the US military said. Syrian state news agency SANA quoted a security source as saying two Syrian service personnel were injured, without providing further details. The source told SANA that American helicopters evacuated the injured to a US base in Syria’s Al-Tanf region near the Iraqi border. Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkiye and special envoy to Syria, condemned the attack. “We mourn the loss of three brave US service members and civilian personnel and wish a speedy recovery to the Syrian troops wounded in the attack,” Barrack said in a statement. “We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.” The attack came barely a month after Syria announced it had signed a political cooperation agreement with the US-led coalition against IS, which coincided with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s visit to the White House. The coalition has carried out air strikes and ground operations in Syria targeting IS suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces. Syria last month also carried out a nationwide campaign arresting more than 70 people accused of links to the group. The US has troops stationed in northeastern Syria as part of a decade-long effort to help a Kurdish-led force there.",

      "summary_orig": "Norway has termed the presence of its ambassador at the Supreme Court hearing of the husband-and-wife lawyer duo, Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chattha, “in line with international law,” despite Pakistan’s protest. Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsaas attended the hearing on Thursday, with his presence during court proceedings causing a stir in court and on social media. The Foreign Office had summoned the Norwegian envoy and urged him to “adhere to the established norms of diplomatic engag­ement” after his “unwarranted” attendance. “Noting that his actions amount to interference in the internal affairs of the country, the Ambassador was urged to adhere to the established norms of diplomatic engagement, as outlined in the relevant articles of the Vienna Convention,” said the FO statement. Mazari had defended the envoy’s presence during the hearing, saying that “diplomats routinely observe court proceedings — that is not equivalent to them taking a position on any case”. Norwegian media outlet Dagbladet reported a day ago that Cecilie Roang, senior communications adviser at the country’s foreign ministry, said: “Such lawful presence and observation of a court hearing in the recipient state is within the functions of embassies and is in line with international law.” She added that such a presence was something that Norway, along with other countries, did in many places all over the world, particularly in “matters of public interest at the place of duty”. “Reporting back home about events in the country of service is a core task of diplomacy. Legally attending public court hearings is not an unusual way to gather knowledge,” said the senior communications adviser at the Norwegian ministry. Mazari and her husband are facing a trial under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca) and had moved an application in the SC requesting the urgent hearing of their appeal against the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) refusal to grant interim relief. The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency, Islamabad, before the Federal Investigation Agency’s Cybercrime Reporting Centre under Peca. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The two have already filed a criminal revision before the IHC challenging the trial proceedings on grounds of due process violations under the Criminal Procedure Code, particularly the recording of evidence in their absence.",

      "summary_orig": "RT India has deleted a post on social media platform X about Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “waiting to meet” Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that it “may have been a misrepresentation of events”, it emerged on Saturday. The development came as PM Shehbaz was in Ashgabat to attend an international forum. On Friday, the premier met a host of leaders on the sidelines of the gathering, including Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon, Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov and Putin. “Great interactions with world leaders. Pakistan shining at the global stage,” said Information Minister Ataullah Tarar on X on Friday night, sharing a video of PM Shehbaz shaking hands with Putin as the two stood in what appeared to be a hallway. He also termed the meetings with Putin, Erdogan and Pezeshkian “warm and cordial exchanges”. Prime Minister’s Spokesperson for Foreign Media Mosharraf Zaidi also shared the same video, saying PM Shehbaz had “productive meetings with his peers from all the countries” that attended the forum. “The customary warmth in relations was in ample evidence as the prime minister shared the day with President Erdogan, President Putin and a host of other key world leaders,” he said. The same video was also shared by the Russian embassy in Pakistan. However, RT India , appeared to have shared a different video, which has since been deleted from X. In a clarification issued late on Friday night, it said, “We deleted an earlier post about Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif waiting to meet Vladimir Putin at the Peace and Trust forum in Turkmenistan. The post may have been a misrepresentation of the events.” RT India is the newest branch of Russia’s state-funded global media network. Putin had launched the RT India news channel last week during a visit to New Delhi. According to Indian media, the original RT India post stated that PM Shehbaz waited for Putin for 40 minutes before “growing tired and gate-crashing” the Russian leader’s meeting with Erdogan. “He left ten minutes later,” Times of India and Hindustan Times quoted the original post as saying. Meanwhile, Russia’s RIA news agency reported that PM Shehbaz had later joined the talks between Erdogan and Putin, which had lasted 40 minutes behind closed doors. In a remark on the situation, Tarar told Dawn : “No need for any comment on an Indian outlet which posted a fake story then deleted it, calling a misrepresentation of facts.”",

      "summary_orig": "Germany will host US and Ukrainian delegations over the weekend for talks on a ceasefire in Ukraine, before a summit with European leaders and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Berlin on Monday, a German official said. A US official said President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were travelling to Germany for talks involving Ukrainians and Europeans. The choice to send Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia regarding a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress after nearly four years of war since Russia’s 2022 invasion . The White House had said on Thursday Trump would send an official to talks only if he felt there was enough progress to be made. Show of support for Ukraine “Talks on a possible ceasefire in Ukraine are taking place in Berlin this weekend between foreign policy advisers from, among others, the US and Ukraine,” a German government source said on Saturday when asked about the meetings. On Monday, Merz is hosting Zelenskiy and European leaders for a summit in Berlin, the latest in a series of public shows of support for the Ukrainian leader from allies across Europe as Kyiv faces pressure from Washington to sign up to a peace plan that initially backed Moscow’s main demands. Britain, France and Germany have been working in the last few weeks to refine the US proposals, which, in a draft disclosed last month, called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its ambition to join NATO and accept limits on its armed forces. Merz said in a speech on Saturday that Europe had to brace for a fundamental shift in its relations with the US while facing a growing threat from Russia. “The decades of Pax Americana are largely over for us in Europe, and for us in Germany as well. It no longer exists as we knew it. And nostalgia won’t change that,” he told a party congress in the southern city of Munich. “The Americans are now very, very aggressively pursuing their own interests. And that can only mean one thing: that we, too, must now pursue our own interests.” Attacks cause blackout in Odesa The European Union has sought to shore up Ukraine’s position by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget. Ukraine meanwhile has battled to contain Russian advances on the battlefield and the frequent bombardment of its energy and water supplies going into winter. The southern Black Sea port city of Odesa and the surrounding region suffered blackouts on Saturday after a large missile and drone attack on the electricity grid that left more than a million households without power, officials said. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, said “peace is not far away” and that he hoped to discuss a peace plan with Trump. Erdogan had told Putin on Friday that a limited ceasefire in the war, focused on energy facilities and ports in particular, could be beneficial. “The Black Sea should not be seen as a battleground. Such a situation would only harm Russia and Ukraine,” Erdogan said in comments released by his office on Saturday. Russia attacked two Ukrainian ports on Friday, damaging three Turkish-owned vessels including a ship carrying food supplies, Ukrainian officials and one ship-owner said, days after Moscow threatened to cut Ukraine off from the sea.

      "title": "US, Ukraine to discuss ceasefire in Berlin before European summit",
      "summary": "Germany will host US and Ukrainian delegations over the weekend for talks on a ceasefire in Ukraine, before a summit with European leaders and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Berlin on Monday, a German official said. A US official said President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were travelling to Germany for talks involving Ukrainians and Europeans. The choice to send Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia regarding a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress after nearly four years of war since Russia’s 2022 invasion . The White House had said on Thursday Trump would send an official to talks only if he felt there was enough progress to be made. Show of support for Ukraine “Talks on a possible ceasefire in Ukraine are taking place in Berlin this weekend between foreign policy advisers from, among others, the US and Ukraine,” a German government source said on Saturday when asked about the meetings. On Monday, Merz is hosting Zelenskiy and European leaders for a summit in Berlin, the latest in a series of public shows of support for the Ukrainian leader from allies across Europe as Kyiv faces pressure from Washington to sign up to a peace plan that initially backed Moscow’s main demands. Britain, France and Germany have been working in the last few weeks to refine the US proposals, which, in a draft disclosed last month, called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its ambition to join NATO and accept limits on its armed forces. Merz said in a speech on Saturday that Europe had to brace for a fundamental shift in its relations with the US while facing a growing threat from Russia. “The decades of Pax Americana are largely over for us in Europe, and for us in Germany as well. It no longer exists as we knew it. And nostalgia won’t change that,” he told a party congress in the southern city of Munich. “The Americans are now very, very aggressively pursuing their own interests. And that can only mean one thing: that we, too, must now pursue our own interests.” Attacks cause blackout in Odesa The European Union has sought to shore up Ukraine’s position by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget. Ukraine meanwhile has battled to contain Russian advances on the battlefield and the frequent bombardment of its energy and water supplies going into winter. The southern Black Sea port city of Odesa and the surrounding region suffered blackouts on Saturday after a large missile and drone attack on the electricity grid that left more than a million households without power, officials said. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, said “peace is not far away” and that he hoped to discuss a peace plan with Trump. Erdogan had told Putin on Friday that a limited ceasefire in the war, focused on energy facilities and ports in particular, could be beneficial. “The Black Sea should not be seen as a battleground. Such a situation would only harm Russia and Ukraine,” Erdogan said in comments released by his office on Saturday. Russia attacked two Ukrainian ports on Friday, damaging three Turkish-owned vessels including a ship carrying food supplies, Ukrainian officials and one ship-owner said, days after Moscow threatened to cut Ukraine off from the sea.

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday held ex-spymaster Faiz Hameed responsible for the ouster of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017, adding that more charges against him were to come soon. The minister’s remarks come two days after Hameed, in a first, was sentenced to a 14-year jail term after being convicted on four counts related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others. Addressing a press conference in Sialkot, the defence minister said, “A former head of ISI has been convicted in a trial that ran for 15 months; there are still other charges on which legal proceedings will be initiated soon.” The defence minister assailed the former spymaster, claiming that Nawaz was ousted through a “conspiracy”. “The removal of Nawaz, the cases lodged against him, the allegations, and Imran’s coming into power, this whole project was enacted under the supervision of Faiz Hameed,” the defence minister said. He said that Hameed, along with his “partner” Imran, was responsible for causing “significant damage” to the country. Asif also said that Hameed was “in charge of project Imran”, highlighting the 2018 general elections. “Faiz was the most important part of that government,” the minister stated. He said that during PTI’s tenure, the ex-spymaster facilitated the “imprisonment of opponents”. “He used to threaten and imprison political opponents,” he said, stressing that Imran’s “vision” was materialised through Hameed. The minister also said that Hameed’s main beneficiary was Imran. The minister termed the period a “shameful” chapter in the country’s history. The minister alleged that “bringing Imran into power, lodging cases against Nawaz, exiling him, imprisoning his family and his party leaders and workers”, all of it was orchestrated by Hameed. He went on to say that the former ISI chief “was given the opportunity to govern Pakistan through Imran”. The minister said that during the ex-spymaster’s tenure, the institution used to “dictate” legislation to parliament. “Decisions for the country’s future used to be made in the backyard of the prime minister’s house,” he said. He noted that after Hameed’s transfer, his “project” started to slowly “unravel”. He went on to say that as a corps commander, Hameed continued to facilitate Imran. He further alleged that Hameed was involved in the violent riots in the country on May 9, 2023. “It was his planning; people within the institution also played a part, but the manpower was PTI workers,” he said. “It was a joint venture by General Faiz,” he claimed. At this point, the minister paused to correct himself for calling Hameed a general. “I keep saying general because it has only been four days since his title was revoked,” he said. He further maintained that the “conspirators attempting to prop up Imran today and bring him back to power, all these seeds were sown by Faiz.” “These two personalities can not be separated,” he stressed. Calling the May 9 riots an “attack” on the sanctity of armed forces, he emphasised that the same armed forces had raised the nation’s pride after the operation “ Bunyan ul Marsoos ” against India in May. It brought Pakistan international acclaim, the minister said. “Now imagine, if Faiz and Imran’s plans had succeeded, where would we be today?” he warned. “God forbid, if the Faiz-Imran nexus still existed, perhaps there would not have been a need for war at all since they would have ensured the country’s destruction from the inside,” he said. In his concluding remarks, the minister vowed to continue the “process” of accountability, stressing that “Pakistan’s enemies will be held accountable”. “Those who have put the country’s future at stake for power can not be considered Pakistanis. Whether they are in uniform like Faiz or in a waistcoat and Peshawari sandals like Imran,” he said.",

He further alleged that Hameed was involved in the violent riots in the country on May 9, 2023. “It was his planning; people within the institution also played a part, but the manpower was PTI workers,” he said. “It was a joint venture by General Faiz,” he claimed. At this point, the minister paused to correct himself for calling Hameed a general. “I keep saying general because it has only been four days since his title was revoked,” he said. He further maintained that the “conspirators attempting to prop up Imran today and bring him back to power, all these seeds were sown by Faiz.” “These two personalities can not be separated,” he stressed. Calling the May 9 riots an “attack” on the sanctity of armed forces, he emphasised that the same armed forces had raised the nation’s pride after the operation “ Bunyan ul Marsoos ” against India in May. It brought Pakistan international acclaim, the minister said. “Now imagine, if Faiz and Imran’s plans had succeeded, where would we be today?” he warned. “God forbid, if the Faiz-Imran nexus still existed, perhaps there would not have been a need for war at all since they would have ensured the country’s destruction from the inside,” he said. In his concluding remarks, the minister vowed to continue the “process” of accountability, stressing that “Pakistan’s enemies will be held accountable”. “Those who have put the country’s future at stake for power can not be considered Pakistanis. Whether they are in uniform like Faiz or in a waistcoat and Peshawari sandals like Imran,” he said.",
      "title": "Khawaja Asif holds ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed responsible for Nawaz’s ouster, says more charges to come",
      "summary": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday held ex-spymaster Faiz Hameed responsible for the ouster of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017, adding that more charges against him were to come soon. The minister’s remarks come two days after Hameed, in a first, was sentenced to a 14-year jail term after being convicted on four counts related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others. Addressing a press conference in Sialkot, the defence minister said, “A former head of ISI has been convicted in a trial that ran for 15 months; there are still other charges on which legal proceedings will be initiated soon.” The defence minister assailed the former spymaster, claiming that Nawaz was ousted through a “conspiracy”. “The removal of Nawaz, the cases lodged against him, the allegations, and Imran’s coming into power, this whole project was enacted under the supervision of Faiz Hameed,” the defence minister said. He said that Hameed, along with his “partner” Imran, was responsible for causing “significant damage” to the country. Asif also said that Hameed was “in charge of project Imran”, highlighting the 2018 general elections. “Faiz was the most important part of that government,” the minister stated. He said that during PTI’s tenure, the ex-spymaster facilitated the “imprisonment of opponents”. “He used to threaten and imprison political opponents,” he said, stressing that Imran’s “vision” was materialised through Hameed. The minister also said that Hameed’s main beneficiary was Imran. The minister termed the period a “shameful” chapter in the country’s history. The minister alleged that “bringing Imran into power, lodging cases against Nawaz, exiling him, imprisoning his family and his party leaders and workers”, all of it was orchestrated by Hameed. He went on to say that the former ISI chief “was given the opportunity to govern Pakistan through Imran”. The minister said that during the ex-spymaster’s tenure, the institution used to “dictate” legislation to parliament. “Decisions for the country’s future used to be made in the backyard of the prime minister’s house,” he said. He noted that after Hameed’s transfer, his “project” started to slowly “unravel”. He went on to say that as a corps commander, Hameed continued to facilitate Imran.

The disaster, which has hit the northwestern island of Sumatra over the past fortnight, has also injured more than 5,400, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said in its latest toll.

      "summary_orig": "A United Nations’ (UN) special rapporteur warned on Friday that PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards. In September, his legal team approached the rapporteur to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple. Prime Minister’s Aide Rana Ihsan Afzal, however, dismissed the concerns of the UN rapporteur and said Imran was being kept “according to prison rules and the jail manual”. “His children have access and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide. He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner. “He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available and ample space is also available.” The UN official, Alice Jill Edwards, urged Pakistan to take immediate and effective action to address reports of the 73-year-old’s inhumane and undignified detention conditions . “I call on Pakistani authorities to ensure that Khan’s conditions of detention fully comply with international norms and standards,” Edwards said in a statement . “Since his transfer to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on September 26, 2023, Imran Khan has reportedly been held for excessive periods in solitary confinement, confined for 23 hours a day in his cell, and with highly restricted access to the outside world,” she said. “His cell is reportedly under constant camera surveillance.” “Khan’s solitary confinement should be lifted without delay,” she said. UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself. Imran’s supporters allege that he is being denied prison visits from lawyers and family, prompting multiple protests and sit-ins outside or near the prison. Jemima says X’s AI confirms content linked to Imran is being throttled Imran’s ex-wife, Jemimah Goldsmith, took to X and directly addressed platform CEO Elon Musk, informing him that the platform’s algorithm was limiting posts about the PTI founder, including those from her account. “According to Grok — your own AI — ‘Every time you post anything about Imran’s jail conditions, solitary confinement or your son’s access to their father, the algorithm limits the post … the Pakistani authorities have made criticism from Imran Khan’s immediate circle one of their top online enforcement priorities, and X is quietly complying just enough to keep the platform alive in the country’,” she wrote, quoting the AI tool. “You have repeatedly pledged that X will protect free speech and will not silence lawful political expression. Yet Grok has examined my X analytics … and concluded my account is subjected to what Grok calls ‘secret throttling’ — the algorithm deliberately hides my posts from almost everyone, even though the account is not suspended.” Citing Grok, Jemima attached statistics with her post, stating that between 2023 and early 2024, she averaged 400–900 million impressions per month in engagement on her account, which has 3.5m followers. However, when 2025 came around, impressions plummeted to 28.6m in total — a drop of over 97 per cent to only 3pc of her expected reach. “The turning point was May 2025: one post spiked to 4m impressions the day Pakistan’s X ban ended — proving my audience was still engaged. Thereafter, impressions were instantly crushed to near zero and stayed there,” she wrote, requesting that Musk remove secret throttling from the platform. Jemima also wrote that Imran has been imprisoned for 22 months and their sons, Kasim and Suleman, have been unable to meet him, speak with him, or even send letters. “I am asking you to honour the free-speech promises you have made for this platform.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health. In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.",

In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.",

      "summary": "A United Nations’ (UN) special rapporteur warned on Friday that PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards. In September, his legal team approached the rapporteur to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple. Prime Minister’s Aide Rana Ihsan Afzal, however, dismissed the concerns of the UN rapporteur and said Imran was being kept “according to prison rules and the jail manual”. “His children have access and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide. He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner. “He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available and ample space is also available.” The UN official, Alice Jill Edwards, urged Pakistan to take immediate and effective action to address reports of the 73-year-old’s inhumane and undignified detention conditions . “I call on Pakistani authorities to ensure that Khan’s conditions of detention fully comply with international norms and standards,” Edwards said in a statement . “Since his transfer to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on September 26, 2023, Imran Khan has reportedly been held for excessive periods in solitary confinement, confined for 23 hours a day in his cell, and with highly restricted access to the outside world,” she said. “His cell is reportedly under constant camera surveillance.” “Khan’s solitary confinement should be lifted without delay,” she said. UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself. Imran’s supporters allege that he is being denied prison visits from lawyers and family, prompting multiple protests and sit-ins outside or near the prison. Jemima says X’s AI confirms content linked to Imran is being throttled Imran’s ex-wife, Jemimah Goldsmith, took to X and directly addressed platform CEO Elon Musk, informing him that the platform’s algorithm was limiting posts about the PTI founder, including those from her account. “According to Grok — your own AI — ‘Every time you post anything about Imran’s jail conditions, solitary confinement or your son’s access to their father, the algorithm limits the post … the Pakistani authorities have made criticism from Imran Khan’s immediate circle one of their top online enforcement priorities, and X is quietly complying just enough to keep the platform alive in the country’,” she wrote, quoting the AI tool. “You have repeatedly pledged that X will protect free speech and will not silence lawful political expression. Yet Grok has examined my X analytics … and concluded my account is subjected to what Grok calls ‘secret throttling’ — the algorithm deliberately hides my posts from almost everyone, even though the account is not suspended.” Citing Grok, Jemima attached statistics with her post, stating that between 2023 and early 2024, she averaged 400–900 million impressions per month in engagement on her account, which has 3.5m followers. However, when 2025 came around, impressions plummeted to 28.6m in total — a drop of over 97 per cent to only 3pc of her expected reach. “The turning point was May 2025: one post spiked to 4m impressions the day Pakistan’s X ban ended — proving my audience was still engaged. Thereafter, impressions were instantly crushed to near zero and stayed there,” she wrote, requesting that Musk remove secret throttling from the platform. Jemima also wrote that Imran has been imprisoned for 22 months and their sons, Kasim and Suleman, have been unable to meet him, speak with him, or even send letters. “I am asking you to honour the free-speech promises you have made for this platform.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.

      "summary_orig": "Thailand’s leader vowed to keep fighting on the disputed border with Cambodia as fighter jets struck targets on Saturday, hours after US President Donald Trump said he had brokered a ceasefire . Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul posted on Facebook that the Southeast Asian nation would “continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people”. Trump, who brokered a ceasefire in the long-running border dispute in October, spoke to Anutin and Cambodian premier Hun Manet on Friday, and said they had agreed to “cease all shooting”. Neither of them mentioned any agreement in statements after their calls with Trump, and Anutin said there was no ceasefire. “I want to make it clear. Our actions this morning already spoke,” Anutin said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the continued fighting. Hun Manet, in a statement on Saturday on Facebook, said Cambodia continues to seek a peaceful resolution of disputes in line with the October agreement. Since Monday, Cambodia and Thailand have been exchanging heavy-weapons fire at multiple points along the 817km (508 mile) border, in some of the heaviest fighting since the five-day clash in July. Trump halted that fighting, the worst in recent memory, with calls to both leaders. Trump, who has repeatedly said he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, has been keen to intervene again to rescue the truce. Thailand suspended it last month after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine, one of many that Bangkok says were newly laid by Cambodia. Cambodia, which nominated Trump for the peace prize in August, rejects the landmine allegations. On Saturday, a Thai Defence Ministry spokesman, Rear Admiral Surasant Kongsiri, told a press conference that clashes had taken place across seven border provinces and Cambodia had fired heavy weapons, “making it necessary for Thailand to retaliate”. Cambodia’s Information Ministry said Thai forces had struck bridges and buildings overnight and fired artillery from a naval vessel. Thai leader Anutin dismissed comments by Trump that a “roadside bomb” that wounded Thai soldiers was accidental, saying the incident was “definitely not a roadside accident”. Cambodia’s Hun Manet said he had asked the US and Malaysia, which has been a mediator in peace talks, to use their intelligence gathering capabilities to “verify which side fired first” in the latest round of fighting.",

      "summary_orig": "• Calls for lasting ceasefire, humanitarian access and reconstruction in Gaza • Meets Iranian president; cites mutual support during external aggression • Holds informal interactions with Putin and Erdogan, Tajik and Kyrgyz presidents ISLAMABAD: Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed Ankara’s readiness to contribute to a mechanism established to maintain stability amid ‘extended ceasefire’ between Pakistan and Afghanistan, after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at an international forum on Friday urged the global community to press the Afghan Taliban to honour their international obligations and curb terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil. President Erdogan made the offer during a meeting with PM Shehbaz on the sidelines of the international forum held in Turkmenistan, where the premier also held meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon and Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov. Addressing the event dedicated to the International Year of Peace and Trust 2025, the International Day of Neutrality and the anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality, PM Shehbaz said peaceful dispute resolution was “a cornerstone” of Pakistan’s foreign policy. In this regard, he also cited Pakistan’s support for the Gaza Peace Plan and its subsequent endorsement by the UN Security Council. Pakistan began the year by taking its seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Cou­ncil, where it was working to uphold global peace and security, he said. “While we persevere in this quest for peace, the scourge of terrorism is, however, raising its head yet again, and this time, unfortunately, from Afghan soil,” he said, urging the international community to press the Taliban government to fulfil its commitments and rein in terrorist elements operating from its territory. PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude to Qatar, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates for their efforts in brokering a ceasefire between Isla­mabad and Kabul. He noted that the ceasefire still stood though it remained ‘fragile’. He also underscored Pakistan’s commitment to ‘peaceful dispute resolution’. He also referred to the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2788 earlier this year as an endorsement of Pakistan’s approach to the peaceful settlement of disputes. The premier said he hoped ongoing peace efforts in the Middle East would help protect Palestinian lives, ensure a lasting ceasefire, enable the flow of humanitarian assistance and support reconstruction in Gaza. He reiterated Pakistan’s support for the right to self-determination of the people of Palestine and Kashmir. Stressing that lasting peace was intrinsically linked to sustainable development, PM Shehbaz said the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provided a blueprint for a more peaceful world and described socio-economic development as a key government priority. He said Pakistan had made progress in areas including financial inclusion and greater economic participation for women and marginalised groups. He said Pakistan’s pursuit of sustainable development faced headwinds from climate-induced disasters and inequities in international economic relations, adding that access to advanced technologies, particularly digital technologies, must be equitable and non-discriminatory. He urged global leaders to treat the forum as a call for urgent action and a new paradigm in international relations, calling for investment in connectivity as “bridges for people, ideas and prosperity”. Earlier, the prime minister congratulated Turkmenistan on the 30th anniversary of its permanent neutrality and on the UN’s designation of 2025 as the International Year of Peace and Trust. The premier also joined other leaders at the Neutrality Monument, where they attended a wreath-laying ceremony before addressing the forum. PM meets Iran president PM Shehbaz later held a bilateral meeting with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the forum, the Prime Minister’s Office said. Both leaders appreciated the support the neighbouring countries provided to each other when they faced external aggression earlier this year, according to the statement. Referring to the 22nd meeting of the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission, PM Shehbaz emphasised the need to strengthen bilateral cooperation to expand trade, operationalise border markets, enhance border security and improve connectivity, including through the Isla­mabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail network. He also reiterated the need to urge the Afghan Taliban to take meaningful action to address Pakistan’s security concerns related to terrorism. The two leaders discussed Gaza as well, the PM Office said. President Pezeshkian expressed a desire to further strengthen ties with Pakistan, and both sides agreed to maintain regular high-level engagement. Mr Sharif conveyed his regards to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In his interaction with President Erdogan, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the significance of bilateral ties and discussed cooperation in areas including energy, the economy, defence and investment. He welcomed Turkish interest and investment in petroleum, energy and minerals and underscored the importance of regional connectivity including the revival of the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail link. President Erdogan thanked the prime minister and expressed a desire to work together to strengthen relations. Published in Dawn, December 13th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has held that a husband cannot be prosecuted for rape of his wife unless the pronouncement of divorce takes legal effect in accordance with the mandatory requirements of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (MFLO) 1961. Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh issued the ruling on a petition filed by Jameel Ahmad seeking the quashing of an FIR registered at Police Station City Liaqatpur under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribes punishment for rape. The complainant had alleged that the petitioner lured her into cohabitation and later married her on April 22, 2024. She claimed she later discovered he was already married and, upon her protest, he divorced her on Oct 14, 2024. According to the FIR, three days later — on Oct 17 — the petitioner and a co-suspect allegedly entered her home at night, where the petitioner raped her at gunpoint. The petitioner, however, denied the allegation of a live-in relationship and contended that the FIR was fabricated as retaliation for the divorce. He admitted issuing a written Talaq deed but argued that he had revoked the divorce on Dec 23, 2024, within the 90-day statutory reconciliation period. Court quashes FIR registered against petitioner He further submitted that he had filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights, which remained pending. In his judgement, announced at the court’s Bahawalpur bench, Justice Sheikh noted that the central question before the court was whether Talaq had legally taken effect by Oct 17, 2024 — the date of the alleged offence. The judge undertook a survey of Islamic jurisprudence as well as statutory requirements under Section 7 of the MFLO, observing that although Islamic law recognises multiple forms of Talaq, Pakistani law mandates a specific legal mechanism. Section 7 requires a notice of Talaq to be provided to the chairman of the relevant union council, and mandates a 90-day reconciliation period. Talaq does not become effective unless this period expires without revocation. The judge noted that the petitioner had dispatched notice of Talaq to the union council but had subsequently revoked it before the expiry of the statutory period. Citing Supreme Court precedents, Justice Sheikh reiterated that failure to comply with statutory requirements renders the divorce legally ineffective, even where a Talaqnama exists under Islamic law. The judge observed that under Section 7(3) of MFLO, the parties remain husband and wife until either the 90-day period expires or the husband explicitly revokes Talaq, whichever comes first. He concluded that on Oct 17, 2024, the date of the alleged incident, the marriage had not dissolved in the eyes of the law. Under Shariah, the judge noted, a crime is an act prohibited by divine injunction and punishable by Hadd or Ta’zir penalties. In the present case, Justice Sheikh maintained, the marital bond between the parties continued to exist legally at the time of the alleged occurrence. He said the petitioner’s conduct may be considered immoral or inappropriate under religious or social norms, but prosecution under Section 376 of PPC could not be sustained as the essential ingredients of the offence were not made out on the FIR’s own assertions. With these observations, the judge allowed the petition and quashed the FIR registered against the petitioner. Published in Dawn, December 13th, 2025",
