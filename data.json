For Pakistan, even modest increases carry heavy consequences. For every $10 rise in oil prices, the current account deficit increases by roughly $1.5–$2 billion, explains former chief executive officer of the Pakistan Business Council, Ehsan Malik. “If prices were to climb to $100, the deficit could expand by $5–$7bn on an annualised basis, potentially undoing recent gains that allowed FY25 to post a $2bn current account surplus.” Markets are extremely erratic right now, says energy analyst Syed Rashid Husain. Iran produces roughly 3–3.5 million barrels of oil per day, exporting about 1–1.5m barrels. While this is far lower than the output of the United States (about 13.5m barrels per day) or Saudi Arabia (around 9–10m), even a loss of one million barrels per day can tighten global balances and push prices higher. Compounding the risk is the strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway through which roughly 20pc of global oil consumption passes. For years, Iran has threatened to block this passage during periods of heightened conflict. According to Reuters , oil and gas shipments through the area have already faced disruption, with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards reportedly warning ships that passage is not permitted, although Tehran has not formally confirmed such an order. Analysts say scenarios range from limited disruptions to Iranian exports to a full blockade of Hormuz. The ripple effects are already visible. Late Saturday night, petrol prices at pumps in Canada had risen by roughly 10–15 cents per litre, Husain said, speaking from experience. Russia-Ukraine crisis flashbacks For Pakistan, the situation evokes the economic horror of the Russia–Ukraine war. During 2022-23, Brent crude hovered around $100–125 per barrel, leading Pakistan to float perilously close to sovereign default. The chain reaction was brutal. The war pushed up oil prices, widening Pakistan’s import bill and putting pressure on the exchange rate. The rupee slid from around Rs170 per dollar in early 2022 to a peak of Rs305 on Aug 28, 2023, before stabilising in the Rs270–280 range toward the end of that year. There was, however, an important cushion at the time. Despite sanctions, Russia still exported oil and gas by hook or by crook to many countries; Pakistan also tried to get oil from Russia, and India became a major importer of Russian oil. Since then, however, the US has pressured India to stop importing and tightened the screws on all of Russia’s supplies. If Iranian barrels are disrupted simultaneously, two significant discounted supply streams could disappear, pushing crude firmly into triple-digit territory if tensions do not de-escalate. There are already signs of strain. Saudi Aramco has reportedly not allocated a March cargo to a Pakistani refinery amid volatility in global oil markets. Uncertainty in global crude trade has made it difficult to secure shipments for March, and this was before the news of the assassination of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Marine insurers are also considering repricing or cancelling policies in parts of the Middle East, according to reports. A chain reaction and the IMF Oil prices have a multiplier effect as they impact secondary markets. For example, edible oil prices — of which Pakistan imported roughly $3.7bn in FY25 — are indirectly linked to crude oil markets, Malik explains. Much of the economic breathing space that enabled recent stabilisation came from relatively stable global commodity prices. “For every $10 increase in oil prices, Pakistan’s inflation typically rises by about 0.5–0.6 percentage points,” says Waqas Ghani, Head of Equity Research at JS Global Capital. If oil prices surge, inflation would rise again, making further policy rate cuts unlikely. Industry would face higher input costs, weakening exports. At the same time, fiscal space would shrink, limiting the government’s ability to lower taxes or provide relief, adds Malik. “The veneer of stability has been damaged,” says Ammar H Khan, Professor of Practice at the Institute of Business Administration Karachi. Capital outflows could increase, or new investment could slow, hurting job creation and — at the margins — reducing demand for migrant labour abroad. These repercussions may also extend to remittances, which are vital for keeping the current account afloat. Even if the conflict lasts only a few days and does not turn into a prolonged war, heightened regional risk can weigh on financial flows, he adds. All this is taking place in the background of talks with the visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF) team. Industry sources say there had been positive talks with the Fund regarding possible tax relief in the upcoming budget. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also emphasised the need to reduce direct tax rates. However, given the current global uncertainty, meaningful relief now appears unlikely. Pakistan was already receiving very little foreign direct investment, notes M Abdul Aleem, secretary general of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “What little was in the pipelines, like investments in Reko Diq, will slow down for now,” he says. “Equally concerning is the law-and-order environment, particularly when it involves the safety of foreign nationals.” Referring to the recent incident at the US consulate in Karachi, he said stronger preventive security measures should have been in place. PSX and gold For equity markets, the implications extend beyond macroeconomic concerns. Pakistan’s manufacturing sectors rely heavily on imported raw materials and energy inputs. “Take the cement sector as an example,” says Waqas Ghani, Head of Equity Research. “It relies on coal and petcoke as key inputs. If oil prices rise, the prices of these fuels also increase, raising production costs.” Because many industries depend on imported inputs across the value chain, higher commodity prices quickly squeeze profit margins. “When input costs rise, margins come under pressure, and corporate earnings can deteriorate,” he said. “Apart from oil and exploration companies, most sectors would face headwinds.” Beyond fundamentals, market sentiment itself has turned cautious. “Investors are already becoming more risk-averse,” Ghani noted. “When uncertainty rises, equities are usually the first asset class where investors reduce exposure.” Several technical factors are also amplifying selling pressure. Foreign investors have been net sellers in recent weeks, while mutual funds are facing redemption pressures from retail investors. When investors withdraw money, fund managers are forced to liquidate holdings, increasing supply in the market. “At the same time, settlement dynamics can intensify the pressure,” Ghani added. The Pakistan Stock Exchange currently operates on a T+1 settlement cycle, while the banking system operates on a T+2 cycle, which can create short-term liquidity stress for brokers and investors during periods of volatility. “All these factors combined can create a downward spiral where selling feeds on itself,” he said. For now, the key trigger that could stabilise markets would be a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions. “If the conflict subsides and oil prices stabilise, sentiment could recover fairly quickly,” Ghani said. “But until then, markets are likely to remain under stress.” Much, however, will depend on how global markets react when trading begins. “It all depends on the evolving situation and any ceasefire news,” said Muhammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities. “A lot will hinge on how US futures open, along with the trend in oil prices and Asian markets.” Pakistani stocks are likely to fall initially, he added, though the extent will depend on developments overnight. Some markets that opened on Sunday were already down close to two per cent. Ali Nawaz, CEO of Chase Securities, expects early weakness in trading when it begins. “The market is likely to see a decline in the opening hours, driven by investor concerns over the US-Iran conflict, the broader Middle East situation and rising oil prices,” he said. However, he expects the pressure to ease as the week progresses. “A recovery could follow as the situation moves towards resolution and institutional investors step in for value buying,” Nawaz said. Given the market’s recent corrections, further declines may create attractive valuations for investors, echoing the age-old advice to buy the dip. As the Pakistan Stock Market bleeds, investors may turn to gold, which is expected to surge. On Saturday, local gold prices jumped by Rs10,000 per tola in Pakistan. Qasim Shikarpuri, president of the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association, expects international prices to rise by $200–$300 per ounce once markets reopen. “If that happens, local gold prices could surge by as much as Rs60,000 per tola,” he said. Bazaars and shopping Retailers say geopolitical tensions are already affecting shopping activity during Ramazan, a critical sales period for bazaars and malls. “We have seen this before,” said Asfandyar Farrukh, Chairman of the Chainstore Association of Pakistan. “Even a few days ago, when tensions flared between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and warnings were issued, there was an immediate impact.” The effect is most visible over the weekend, when shopping activity typically peaks. “Weekend footfall is usually the highest, especially on Sundays. But in such situations, visitor numbers can fall by half,” he said. If the tensions subside quickly, retailers expect the slowdown to be temporary. “If things improve within two or three days, the lost sales can be made up,” he said. “But if uncertainty continues through Ramazan, then the impact could become more significant.” According to Farrukh, shoppers tend to adjust their behaviour during prolonged uncertainty rather than abandoning shopping altogether. “People still need to shop for Eid. What they usually do is go out earlier in the day or spread their visits over time,” he said. “But overall, there could still be a 20–25pc decline in footfall during periods of heightened tension.” Retail activity during Ramazan typically peaks in the final ten days before Eid, though momentum had only recently begun building in markets. “The last ten days are usually when Ramazan shopping really accelerates,” he said. “But we are already beginning to see some slowdown.” Farrukh does not expect security concerns to push shoppers significantly toward online retail. “Eid shopping is an experience. People want to see the fabric, the material, the footwear, hence they prefer to visit markets,” he said. “Online shopping has been growing, but it does not replace the Eid shopping experience.” Instead, the larger risk for retail spending comes from rising fuel prices. “If oil prices surge, that will have the biggest impact on consumer spending,” he said. “Fuel prices have already increased, and further hikes are expected. If this situation continues for several days, it would directly affect household spending.” A path for de-escalation? Ultimately, much will depend on whether the conflict escalates or finds an off-ramp. “Domestic politics in the United States may ultimately shape how far this confrontation goes. The US faces congressional midterm elections in November 2026,” notes Husain. With the American economy already grappling with tariff shocks and a cooling job market amid massive AI investments, the cost of living remains a top voter concern. Surveys cited by The Wall Street Journal show that inflation and household costs remain the most persistent economic complaints. If gas prices surge sharply, it could damage Republicans at the ballot box, potentially costing them control of the House or the Senate and undermining the administration’s ability to pass major legislation. That may explain why Donald Trump has suggested there are several “off-ramps” from the military operation, in recent comments to media outlet Axios . Trump is also facing pressure from how own Make America Great Again (MAGA) political base to avoid a prolonged Middle East intervention. Equally important is Iran’s reaction. “Iranians have historically been pragmatic in such circumstances,” Husain said. After the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020 and the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in 2024, Tehran’s responses were calibrated. “There will almost certainly be face-saving measures,” Husain said. “But if past behaviour is any guide, those may eventually be accompanied by efforts to de-escalate as well.” Pakistan has paid a heavy price on its path to stabilisation. Its fragile economic recovery relies heavily on stable oil prices. The difference between escalation and restraint could mean the difference between continued stabilisation and another severe macroeconomic shock.

With the American economy already grappling with tariff shocks and a cooling job market amid massive AI investments, the cost of living remains a top voter concern. Surveys cited by The Wall Street Journal show that inflation and household costs remain the most persistent economic complaints. If gas prices surge sharply, it could damage Republicans at the ballot box, potentially costing them control of the House or the Senate and undermining the administration’s ability to pass major legislation. That may explain why Donald Trump has suggested there are several “off-ramps” from the military operation, in recent comments to media outlet Axios . Trump is also facing pressure from how own Make America Great Again (MAGA) political base to avoid a prolonged Middle East intervention. Equally important is Iran’s reaction. “Iranians have historically been pragmatic in such circumstances,” Husain said. After the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020 and the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in 2024, Tehran’s responses were calibrated. “There will almost certainly be face-saving measures,” Husain said. “But if past behaviour is any guide, those may eventually be accompanied by efforts to de-escalate as well.” Pakistan has paid a heavy price on its path to stabilisation. Its fragile economic recovery relies heavily on stable oil prices. The difference between escalation and restraint could mean the difference between continued stabilisation and another severe macroeconomic shock.

The UAE Capital Markets Authority said the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and Dubai Financial Market would remain shut on March 2 and March 3, citing its supervisory and regulatory role over the country’s capital markets. “The Authority will continue to monitor developments in the region and assess the situation on an ongoing basis, taking any further measures as necessary,” it said in a statement.

PM Shehbaz speaks to Jordan, Bahrain kings Separately, PM Shehbaz spoke to Jordan’s King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein to discuss the “evolving regional situation”, according to the Prime Minister’s Office. “The two leaders exchanged views on the serious regional developments following the recent escalation from the Israeli attack on Iran, which was followed by attacks on Jordan and other regional countries,” the statement said. “The prime minister expressed Pakistan’s deep concern over the situation and emphasised the urgent need for restraint, de-escalation, and dialogue to preserve regional peace and stability,” the statement said. It added that the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the kingdom as well as other brotherly countries in the region during this “challenging time”. “He also reiterated Pakistan’s readiness to support all efforts aimed at restoring calm and promoting stability. Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional developments,” the statement said. The premier also posted about it on X, saying, “We emphasised the urgent need for restraint, dialogue, and de-escalation to preserve peace and stability.” He also spoke to Bahrain King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa to discuss the “ongoing crisis” in the Middle East and Iran’s attacks on several Gulf countries, including Bahrain, after US-Israeli attacks. According to the PMO, the premier said that such unprovoked acts of aggression only escalated the situation and threatened the peace and stability of the entire region. “He assured the leadership of Bahrain that Pakistan stood firmly with Bahrain and other brotherly Gulf countries and underscored the need for maximum restraint in this difficult time,” the statement said. PM Shehbaz also emphasised the need to “preserve the primacy of international law and reiterated that Pakistan would always remain committed to supporting peace efforts and urge all parties to engage in diplomacy and seek a negotiated solution to the crisis”. In a post on X about his conversation with Bahrain’s king, PM Shehbaz said, “While praying for the safety and security of our brothers and sisters in Bahrain, I emphasised restraint, respect for international law, and the urgent need for dialogue and diplomacy to restore peace and stability in the region.”",

      "summary_orig": "Brent crude jumped 10 per cent to about $80 a barrel over the counter on Sunday, oil traders said, while analysts predicted that prices could climb as high as $100 after US and Israeli strikes on Iran plunged the Middle East into a new war. The global oil benchmark has rallied this year and reached $73 a barrel on Friday for its highest since July, buoyed by growing concern over the potential attacks that arrived a day later. Futures trading is closed over the weekend. “While the military attacks are themselves supportive for oil prices, the key factor here is the closing of the Strait of Hormuz ,” said Ajay Parmar, director of energy and refining at ICIS. Most tanker owners, oil majors and trading houses have suspended crude oil, fuel and liquefied natural gas shipments via the Strait of Hormuz, trade sources said, after Tehran warned ships against moving through the waterway. More than 20pc of global oil is moved through the Strait of Hormuz. Middle East leaders have warned Washington that a war on Iran could lead to oil prices jumping to more than $100 a barrel, said RBC analyst Helima Croft. Rabobank analysts are slightly less bullish, seeing prices holding above $90 a barrel in the near term. The OPEC+ group of oil producers agreed on Sunday to raise output by 206,000 barrels per day (bpd) from April, a modest increase representing less than 0.2pc of global demand. While some alternate infrastructure could be used to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, the net impact from its closure would be a loss of 8million to 10m bpd of crude oil supply even after diverting some flows through Saudi Arabia’s East-West pipeline and Abu Dhabi’s pipeline, said Rystad Energy economist Jorge Leon. Rystad expects prices to rise by $20 to about $92 a barrel when trade opens. The Iran crisis also prompted Asian governments and refiners to assess oil stockpiles and alternative shipping routes and supplies. Kpler analysts said in a webinar on Sunday that India might turn to Russian oil to make up for potential Middle East supply loss.",

      "summary_orig": "Multiple users and accounts on social media platforms X and Facebook on March 1 were sharing an alleged image of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s body under rubble after he was assassinated in airstrikes by the United States and Israel. However, the image is AI-generated. Khamenei, who ruled the Islamic Republic for over 30 years, was assassinated in a strike in the early hours of Sunday, by the US and Israel — the two countries that had been calling for regime change in Tehran. Iran called the strikes “unprovoked and illegal”, responding with missiles fired at Israel and at least seven other countries, including Gulf states that host US bases, while vowing revenge for Khamenei’s assassination. On March 1, a pro-Iranian user, based on his profile picture and past posts, shared a picture of Khamenei under rubble on X with the following caption: “My leader gave up his life, but the Muslim nation did not compromise or sell out the followers of Imam Hussain.” The post gained 4.8 million views and was liked by 30,000 users. The same picture was shared by another pro-Iranian user in the same context. The post was captioned: “My dear leader, my life be sacrificed for you” The post gained 2m views while 16,000 users liked the post. Another user also shared the same image with the following caption: “Iran releases image of Khamenei’s body beneath rubble.” The post gained 4.6m views. An Indian National Congress supporter also shared the image with a similar claim with the following caption: “Salute to the martyrdom of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Sahib! May Allah bestow forgiveness” The post garnered 340,000 views. A Pakistani account also shared the same image with the following caption: “The intelligence was so solid that a photo of Imam Khomeini’s body was even delivered to the Israeli Prime Minister. Internal enemies are always the most dangerous; it’s a lesson for Pakistan.” The post gained 170,000 views. Multiple international digital media outlets, such as Antikor , Ahdaath net , Our Islam 24 , Harianaceh , Gelora , Andhraj Yothy , Dosja , Face News , Punjab Kesari , Al Wafd news and Dimpe News also shared the same image with a similar claim on their websites. The same image with a similar claim was further shared on X as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here and here ; collectively gaining more than 400,000 views. It was also circulated on LinkedIn and Facebook, as can be seen here , here , here , here and here . Separately, a pro-Iranian user, based on his profile picture and past posts, shared a different image that allegedly showed Khamenei’s body on a bed with the following caption: “Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s dead body”. The post gained 400,000 views. A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter of the Iranian supreme leader’s assassination. A keyword search was conducted to corroborate whether any credible and mainstream international or Iranian news outlets had shared or reported the image, but yielded no results. Inspecting the image, a rescue worker can be seen standing directly on the rubble over Khamenei’s alleged body, an atypical scenario to real-life rescue or recovery operations, which proceed cautiously to retrieve the injured and the dead. A forensic analysis of the image through AI-detection tools showed that multiple tools, such as Undetectable.ai , AI or Not , Sightengine , Hive Moderation , and Truth Scan , flagged it as AI-generated. Analysing the image using Google Gemini’s SynthID further indicated that most of the image had been edited or generated using Google’s AI tools. As for the second picture, where Khamenei can be seen on a bed, a reverse image search yielded the same visuals shared by Euro News in a September 8, 2014, YouTube video with the following title: “Iran supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has ‘successful’ prostate surgery”. According to the video description, Khamenei had successfully undergone prostate surgery. The same news with similar visuals was covered by multiple other international media outlets such as BBC , Al-Arabiya English and Mashregh News . Therefore, the claim that a viral image shows Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s body found from the rubble of a coordinated US-Israeli airstrike is false.

The smell of gunpowder was in the air, regularly punctuated by the deep thumps of tear gas shells being fired. Hundreds of law enforcement personnel, including paramilitary forces, riot police and special units, were in the area — forming security cordons, keeping protesters at bay, and even those taking refuge from the afternoon sun. A burnt motorbike lies on the road after it was burned by protesters as they gathered outside the US Consulate General, following news of US and Israeli strikes on Iran that assassinated supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — Reuters The protesters, young Shia men, were scattered, their numbers waxing and waning, but not more than a thousand. A couple of hundred angry protesters were crowded at the end of the Mai Kolachi Road, which is where the bow of the massive US consulate compound is located. Security personnel fire tear gas as protesters shout slogans during a protest outside the US consulate in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — AFP Quite a few were armed with rudimentary weapons: bamboo sticks and tree branches.

Security forces fire teargas to disperse protesters, outside the US Consulate General in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — Reuters Most of them had pieces of cloth tied around their face; to conceal their identity and minimise the impacts of tear gas. Every now and then, a fiery speech would be followed by slogans, with a couple of young men demanding that the security perimeter be breached, only to be talked down by the elders. Protesters shout slogans during a protest as they attempt to storm the US consulate in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — AFP On the sidelines of the protest, when a Rangers’ soldier asked a young man to put down the stick he was wielding, he refused. “This is not for you. This is for them,” he said, pointing to the US Consulate in the background. Their demand: to take down the US flag fluttering atop the consulate and burn it. Another young man told a cameraman not to film them. Meanwhile, at least one journalist had his phone taken away over the same objection, getting it back only after the intervention of community elders. A police officer retrives items in front of a police checkpost burned by protesters near the US Consulate General in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — Reuters Earlier in the day, protesters had stormed the consulate, scaling its towering gate and damaging property on the premises. The protesters dissipated following gunfire, including by local law enforcement and armed protesters, but as the news of deaths among protesters spread, more returned to the site — to avenge their comrades as well as their spiritual leader. According to Imran, a rescue worker with the Edhi Foundation’s ambulance service, the protesters started converging early in the day. He said that motorcyclists started showing up on the spacious Mai Kolachi Road along the embassy, which was unusual for the weekend. “A lot of people race here — on bikes, donkey carts, etc,” he explained. He said that by 6am, around 500-600 people had already gathered outside the consulate. Imran said his ambulance also came under attack during the protest, showing a dent on the side of the vehicle. Protesters throw stones at riot police during a protest outside the US consulate in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — AFP “It was right after I grabbed a policeman, who was struggling after being hit by a stone. I shoved him inside the ambulance,” he said. “If they had caught him, I don’t know what they would have done,” he said. This uncertainty was also present among the protesters, gathered in pockets all the way to the Keamari bridge; three of them discussed how to salvage a burnt motorcycle, while another said that their leadership had let them down. “None of our major leaders are here, instead going to Numaish and other places,” he said. “Either come here to take us there or send us a clear message,” he added. A police personnel douses fire during a clash with protesters as they attempt to storm the US consulate in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — AFP He had arrived early and was part of the protest. He said that young men were trying to break the bulletproof glass inside the consulate, without success, when they came under fire. He then pointed to the solar panels and surveillance cameras located on the road. “Hopefully, we damaged that,” he said. Meanwhile, back at the main site of the protest, a forklift was bringing a shipping container to seal off access to the US consulate from the Mai Kolachi side. However, young men soon started hurling stones as police responded with teargas. The clash was back on, and the sounds of gunshots permeated the air, dissipating the crowd, even if for a little while.

Protesters shout slogans during a protest as they attempt to storm the US consulate in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — AFP On the sidelines of the protest, when a Rangers’ soldier asked a young man to put down the stick he was wielding, he refused. “This is not for you. This is for them,” he said, pointing to the US Consulate in the background. Their demand: to take down the US flag fluttering atop the consulate and burn it. Another young man told a cameraman not to film them. Meanwhile, at least one journalist had his phone taken away over the same objection, getting it back only after the intervention of community elders. A police officer retrives items in front of a police checkpost burned by protesters near the US Consulate General in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — Reuters Earlier in the day, protesters had stormed the consulate, scaling its towering gate and damaging property on the premises. The protesters dissipated following gunfire, including by local law enforcement and armed protesters, but as the news of deaths among protesters spread, more returned to the site — to avenge their comrades as well as their spiritual leader. According to Imran, a rescue worker with the Edhi Foundation’s ambulance service, the protesters started converging early in the day. He said that motorcyclists started showing up on the spacious Mai Kolachi Road along the embassy, which was unusual for the weekend. “A lot of people race here — on bikes, donkey carts, etc,” he explained. He said that by 6am, around 500-600 people had already gathered outside the consulate. Imran said his ambulance also came under attack during the protest, showing a dent on the side of the vehicle.

This uncertainty was also present among the protesters, gathered in pockets all the way to the Keamari bridge; three of them discussed how to salvage a burnt motorcycle, while another said that their leadership had let them down. “None of our major leaders are here, instead going to Numaish and other places,” he said. “Either come here to take us there or send us a clear message,” he added.

Meanwhile, back at the main site of the protest, a forklift was bringing a shipping container to seal off access to the US consulate from the Mai Kolachi side. However, young men soon started hurling stones as police responded with teargas.

      "summary": "KARACHI: Spent casings of tear gas shells littered the road outside the US consulate in Karachi on Sunday, which was sprinkled with charred remains of several motorcycles — including one that belonged to a Dawn photographer. The smell of gunpowder was in the air, regularly punctuated by the deep thumps of tear gas shells being fired. Hundreds of law enforcement personnel, including paramilitary forces, riot police and special units, were in the area — forming security cordons, keeping protesters at bay, and even those taking refuge from the afternoon sun. A burnt motorbike lies on the road after it was burned by protesters as they gathered outside the US Consulate General, following news of US and Israeli strikes on Iran that assassinated supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — Reuters The protesters, young Shia men, were scattered, their numbers waxing and waning, but not more than a thousand. A couple of hundred angry protesters were crowded at the end of the Mai Kolachi Road, which is where the bow of the massive US consulate compound is located. Security personnel fire tear gas as protesters shout slogans during a protest outside the US consulate in Karachi on March 1, 2026. — AFP Quite a few were armed with rudimentary weapons: bamboo sticks and tree branches. One even had a stone tied to a piece of cloth — an improvised bludgeon. A large number carried portraits of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, assassinated the night before in a joint US-Israeli strike .

      "summary_orig": "The assassination of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a joint US-Israeli strike has plunged the Islamic Republic into one of the most consequential political transitions since the 1979 revolution, triggering a swift constitutional process to select a new leader while the country grapples with regional escalation and internal uncertainty. Khamenei, who dominated Iran’s political and religious landscape for nearly three decades, was assassinated early Saturday when his high-security residential compound in central Tehran was targeted. Several family members — including his daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and a grandchild — were also killed in the strike. The attack came as Israel and the US launched coordinated strikes across multiple Iranian cities, including Tehran, reportedly killing more than 200 people, according to health officials. The escalation followed three rounds of indirect nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington — most recently in Geneva on Thursday — that failed to produce a breakthrough. With Khamenei’s death, attention has shifted to the constitutional mechanism that will determine Iran’s next supreme leader. His office announced Sunday that during the transition, the president, the head of the judiciary and a cleric from the Guardian Council will jointly oversee the functions of the Supreme Leader’s office until a successor is chosen. Role of the Assembly of Experts At the centre of the succession process is the Assembly of Experts, an influential body tasked with selecting the Islamic Republic’s highest political and religious authority. It is composed of 88 senior Islamic jurists and clerics elected by popular vote to serve eight-year terms. Its primary responsibility is to appoint a new supreme leader in the event of death, resignation or incapacity. Since the 1979 revolution, Iran has had only two supreme leaders: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, and Ali Khamenei, who succeeded him in 1989. Article 107 of the Iranian Constitution states that “the determination of the Leader rests with the experts elected by the people,” underscoring the Assembly’s authority to vet and appoint the country’s top figure. Beyond selecting the leader, the body is responsible for supervising his performance and holds the authority to dismiss him if he fails to fulfil his duties. The assembly’s most recent elections were held in 2024, and it is currently headed by veteran cleric Mohammad Ali Movahedi Kermani. How is the new leader chosen? Potential candidates must first be vetted and approved by the Guardian Council, a constitutionally mandated body that screens candidates for key political positions. Only individuals who pass this vetting process are eligible for consideration. Following Khomeini’s death on June 3, 1989, the Assembly of Experts convened to fill the leadership vacuum at a critical moment, as Iran was emerging from the eight-year war with Iraq. Khamenei was selected as successor, aided by Khomeini’s personal recommendation and an overwhelming vote during an emotionally charged session. Under constitutional criteria, the supreme leader must be a qualified Islamic jurist, just and pious, well-versed in political and social affairs, and capable of leadership and sound judgment. If no candidate fully meets all qualifications, the Assembly may select an individual demonstrating strong leadership ability and political competence. After deliberations, members vote internally, and the candidate securing a majority of votes from those present is appointed. Internal deliberations Before a formal vote, the Assembly conducts private deliberations to assess multiple candidates based on religious scholarship, political experience and administrative competence. These sessions are held behind closed doors, and details are rarely disclosed publicly. However, the 1989 session in which Khamenei was chosen was recorded, and footage shows him visibly emotional after his selection. Experts note that succession planning is not improvised but the result of years of preparation. Committees within the Assembly evaluate potential candidates and maintain shortlists to ensure readiness. After Khomeini’s death, several figures were considered before Khamenei ultimately secured 60 out of 74 votes. His experience as president, role during the Iran-Iraq war, and relatively young age at the time were decisive factors. Potential successors Unlike 1989, analysts say there is currently no single dominant figure widely viewed as capable of matching Khamenei’s combined political authority and religious standing. Several names have circulated in non-Iranian media, including his son, Mojtaba Khamenei. However, assessments suggest he is not in the running, or at least not among the leading contenders. Mojtaba’s wife was reportedly among those killed in the strike on Khamenei’s compound, and he was not present at the compound at the time. Another figure mentioned in non-Iranian media is Hassan Khomeini, grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, but insiders say he is also not being considered. Former President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May 2024, had been viewed by many observers as a potential successor, but his death removed a prominent candidate from consideration.",

After Zimbabwe scored 153-7 in New Delhi, South Africa survived an early wobble. Dewald Brevis hit 42 off 18 balls as the 2024 runners-up reached 154-5 in 17.5 overs. Raza earlier hit 73 and then took 3-29 with his off-spin for Zimbabwe, who had stunned Australia and co-hosts Sri Lanka in the group stage to reach the Super Eights. Raza struck on the third ball of the South African chase to send back Quinton de Kock, caught behind for a duck. Raza bowled skipper Aiden Markram for four in the next over. Ryan Rickelton was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Brad Evans and took five minutes to recover. He then lifted Evans for two straight sixes in the next over before the bowler had him caught for 31. Brevis and David Miller, who hit 22, put on 50 before two more quick strikes from Zimbabwe. Blessing Muzarabani dismissed Miller, and Raza removed Brevis. Tristan Stubbs (21) and George Linde (30) then put on an unbeaten 53 to steer their side to the target. After choosing to bat, Zimbabwe lost the in-form opener Brian Bennett, who hit an unbeaten 97 in the defeat by India, for 15. Raza reached his fifty off 29 balls before falling to left-armer Kwena Maphaka, caught by Miller off a leading edge. Clive Madande boosted the total with 26 not out off 20 balls at the end. Maphaka took 2-21 from his four overs and Corbin Bosch 2-40.",

Raza earlier hit 73 and then took 3-29 with his off-spin for Zimbabwe, who had stunned Australia and co-hosts Sri Lanka in the group stage to reach the Super Eights. Raza struck on the third ball of the South African chase to send back Quinton de Kock, caught behind for a duck. Raza bowled skipper Aiden Markram for four in the next over. Ryan Rickelton was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Brad Evans and took five minutes to recover. He then lifted Evans for two straight sixes in the next over before the bowler had him caught for 31. Brevis and David Miller, who hit 22, put on 50 before two more quick strikes from Zimbabwe. Blessing Muzarabani dismissed Miller, and Raza removed Brevis. Tristan Stubbs (21) and George Linde (30) then put on an unbeaten 53 to steer their side to the target. After choosing to bat, Zimbabwe lost the in-form opener Brian Bennett, who hit an unbeaten 97 in the defeat by India, for 15. Raza reached his fifty off 29 balls before falling to left-armer Kwena Maphaka, caught by Miller off a leading edge. Clive Madande boosted the total with 26 not out off 20 balls at the end. Maphaka took 2-21 from his four overs and Corbin Bosch 2-40.",

      "summary_orig": "UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan struck a delicate balance at a tense UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, condemning unwarranted attacks on Iran, expressing solidarity with Gulf states, and urging an immediate return to negotiations and diplomacy. The Council’s emergency session examined the repercussions of the US and Israeli air strikes on Iran and laid bare the deep divisions within the 15-member body over the escalating crisis. Speaking at the meeting, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, outlined Islamabad’s growing concern as the situation in the Middle East becomes more complex with each new development. “Pakistan condemns the initiation of unwarranted attacks against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in violation of international law,” the ambassador said. At the same time, he stressed that Pakistan also “condemns the attacks against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and stands in solidarity with all these brotherly countries.” He warned that, at a time when renewed diplomatic efforts were underway, such actions would “undermine the peace and stability of the entire region, with far-reaching consequences.” Ambassador Ahmad made clear that Pakistan’s concern extends beyond any single capital. Instead, it is focused on the security architecture of the entire Gulf region — home to millions of Pakistani expatriates and a region with which Islamabad maintains deep political, economic and security ties. This dual condemnation — of strikes on Iran and of attacks on Gulf states — illustrates the fine line Pakistan is walking. It cannot afford to alienate Tehran, a neighbor with whom it shares a sensitive border and a complex security equation. Nor can it distance itself from Gulf partners that host large Pakistani communities and play a critical role in Pakistan’s economy. The envoy’s emphasis on mediation and dialogue further underscored this balancing act. “We particularly laud Oman’s role in facilitating and mediating dialogue between Iran and the United States,” he said, aligning Pakistan firmly with diplomatic efforts rather than military blocs. In another pointed observation, he lamented that “diplomacy has once again been derailed as these attacks have happened right in the middle of negotiations,” warning that “these military actions undermine dialogue and further erode trust that was already in short supply.” Islamabad’s legal framing was equally deliberate. The ambassador reminded the Council that “the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct,” stressing that the Charter “prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states.” This formulation allows Pakistan to oppose unilateral or pre-emptive military actions without directly isolating any particular power beyond the immediate incidents. At the humanitarian level, Pakistan sought to humanise the crisis. Ambassador Ahmad offered condolences to “civilians caught in the middle of these violent acts,” specifically mentioning “school children in Iran” and the family of a Pakistani national killed in the United Arab Emirates. In doing so, Islamabad reinforced its message that ordinary people — Iranians, Arabs and Pakistanis alike — are the real victims of escalation. The strategic anxiety was also explicit. “We are deeply alarmed at the risk of regional conflagration,” the ambassador said, noting that the “safety and well-being of millions of our compatriots in the countries of the region is also our top priority.” Ultimately, Pakistan’s message was straightforward but urgent: “Pakistan calls on all sides to immediately halt escalation and urgently resume diplomacy with a view to achieving a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis.” Whether the balance Islamabad seeks to maintain can endure will depend not only on its own diplomatic agility, but also on whether the region itself steps back from the brink.",

      "summary_orig": "On the international chessboard, no piece can move as freely as the United States. It moves vertically, horizontally and diagonally, across any number of squares. Regime change in Venezuela , blockades on Cuba , strikes on Iran , all within a few months. It can move north, east, south and west. And Iran? Iran is the opposing king trapped in a corner by not only the king and rook (Israel), but also its own pawns — the many factions inside Iran that the Israelis have been funding to rise up against it. A war against it from abroad and at home. In refusing to capitulate, the Iranians have decided they would rather die on their feet than be checkmated on their knees in front of their rivals. The opening gambit By the day prior to the strikes, the US had at least 50 per cent of its deployable air power around the Middle East poised to attack Iran, including more than 250 combat aircraft. As Professor Pape from the University of Chicago notes , the US had never deployed this much force against a potential enemy and not launched strikes. All the while, the Iranians were making significant concessions to the US, including importantly that they would even allow American inspectors into the country for verification on their nuclear programme. Trump’s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff remarked that Trump was surprised that the Iranians were not completely capitulating with this much firepower at their doorstep. But Trump had fundamentally misread the Iranian regime’s goal in entering these discussions; which was to prevent their evisceration without subjugation. At the heart of this, is the Iranian government’s core principle after the revolution of 1979: independence ( istiqlal ). Iran’s refusal to give up its ballistic missile programme and support for proxies was the country stating that it would rather court war than give up its sovereignty. Consequently, the ambition of Tel Aviv comes up against the defiance of Tehran. The Omani Foreign Minister went on CBS News the night before the strikes to publicly state how well the negotiations were going, in what seems to be a last ditch effort to avert war. Most importantly, states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Turkey were against this war. These states have been lobbying behind the scenes against the US attacking. The Saudis’ shift in stance appears to have come after Israel’s attack on Hamas in Qatar last year, and its apparent realisation that there needs to be a counter to Israeli hegemony. However, the unprecedented compromises made by the proud pragmatists of Iran were not enough for the Israelis and their powerful co-religionists in the US for whom the balkanisation of Iran is the goal . It has now been revealed by an Israeli officer that the day for the strikes was decided weeks ago, regardless of how negotiations were going. It seems that again negotiations were used as a ruse for preparations. This is yet another indication that the Russians are right about the Americans: they are agreement non-capable . Dialogue does not matter, only the clenched fist. A game played outside the rules The strikes against Iran are manifestly illegal and a clear violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter. The Western press has already publicised the incorrect claim that Israel and the US are fighting a war of pre-emptive self-defence against Iran. As Marco Milanović, international law scholar points out , the use of force against Iran would be lawful only if “(1) Iran had the intent (i.e. its leadership decided) to attack the US/Israel; (2) it had the capability to do so; (3) and it was necessary to use force today, because today would be the last window of opportunity to prevent this future attack”. None of these conditions are met and the argument for pre-emptive self-defence (even if an argument for pre-emption is accepted which many states reject) is even weaker considering President Trump said that the US had “ obliterated ” Iran’s nuclear capability last year. There is no argument of international law under which these strikes could be lawful given there was no imminent armed attack by Iran which is being thwarted. Iran now has the right to self-defence, under Article 51 of the UN Charter, to respond to these attacks. The coming moves Despite President Trump’s fervent belief in the invincibility of the US military, there were a number of leaks from the Pentagon in the days leading up to the war in which officials flagged their concerns about a lengthy conflict. A long war seems to be Iran’s best bet with the US military being better at ‘one and done’ strikes like the abduction of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro and the assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Lengthier conflicts, like Iraq and Afghanistan, are much riskier, especially given the current run on the US’ munitions stockpiles and air defence interceptors. Wargames conducted in 2023 noted that in the event of a war with China, “the United States would likely run out of some munitions — such as long-range, precision-guided munitions — in less than one week.” However, that is if Iran can last that long. So far it seems that the US has engaged in attacking military targets while Israel has engaged in decapitation strikes, which includes their key target: Iranian Ayatollah Khamenei . They are going after regime officials in an effort to topple it and end the war sooner. However, it may be that regime hardliners come into power and wrest control. Iran is exporting the destruction meted upon it to the US bases of the Arab regimes which surround it. These regimes have subcontracted their protection to the Americans, and Iran has chosen to attack them for this dignity deficit. It hopes that the more damage it inflicts on them means they will clamour for a ceasefire to the Americans on its behalf. Part of this strategy may include Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz through which 20 per cent of world’s oil consumption flows, destabilising the world’s economy. As it is with most asymmetric conflicts, Iran wins if it doesn’t lose, and the US loses if it doesn’t win. The board after the game On February 27, the day before Israel struck Iran, Yoav Gallant, former Israeli Minister of Defence and wanted war criminal by the International Criminal Court, wrote an article titled ‘The Next Strategic Shift in the Middle East’ . I read the article anticipating it would be about Israel’s war with Iran, but it wasn’t. Gallant’s focus of the piece was Turkiye. He advocates for a pivot to countering the Eurasian country, stating that ‘[t]he weakening of Iran is a significant achievement. But the structure replacing it will define the next generation of regional order. Turkey is already positioning itself at the center of that structure, with the military capacity, the institutional reach, and the ambition to shape what comes next’. When the US was invading Iraq in 2003, Zionists were supporting that war but already wanting to turn to Iran immediately after, popularising the slogan “Anyone can go to Baghdad. Real men go to Tehran.” It seems now, Israelis are already saying “Anyone can go to Tehran. Real men go to Ankara.” Israel is, as always, planning a few moves ahead.",

These regimes have subcontracted their protection to the Americans, and Iran has chosen to attack them for this dignity deficit. It hopes that the more damage it inflicts on them means they will clamour for a ceasefire to the Americans on its behalf. Part of this strategy may include Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz through which 20 per cent of world’s oil consumption flows, destabilising the world’s economy. As it is with most asymmetric conflicts, Iran wins if it doesn’t lose, and the US loses if it doesn’t win. The board after the game On February 27, the day before Israel struck Iran, Yoav Gallant, former Israeli Minister of Defence and wanted war criminal by the International Criminal Court, wrote an article titled ‘The Next Strategic Shift in the Middle East’ . I read the article anticipating it would be about Israel’s war with Iran, but it wasn’t. Gallant’s focus of the piece was Turkiye. He advocates for a pivot to countering the Eurasian country, stating that ‘[t]he weakening of Iran is a significant achievement. But the structure replacing it will define the next generation of regional order. Turkey is already positioning itself at the center of that structure, with the military capacity, the institutional reach, and the ambition to shape what comes next’. When the US was invading Iraq in 2003, Zionists were supporting that war but already wanting to turn to Iran immediately after, popularising the slogan “Anyone can go to Baghdad. Real men go to Tehran.” It seems now, Israelis are already saying “Anyone can go to Tehran. Real men go to Ankara.” Israel is, as always, planning a few moves ahead.",

      "summary_orig": "The assassination of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader and Marjai Taqleed for millions of Shia Muslims, in coordinated US-Israeli airstrikes marks a turning point not only for the Islamic Republic of Iran but for the wider West Asian region. His assassination removes a figure who for more than three decades stood at the apex of Iran’s political, military and religious order. Yet those expecting the immediate collapse of the Iranian system may be misreading both its structure and its history. Ayatollah Khamenei was not merely a head of state. As Supreme Leader, he exercised ultimate authority over foreign policy, the armed forces and the direction of the revolution. As Marjai Taqleed, a source of emulation in Shia jurisprudence, he embodied religious legitimacy that extended beyond Iran’s borders. His passing, therefore, creates a vacuum that is institutional as much as personal. Under Iran’s constitution, an interim council comprising President Masoud Pezeshkian, the judiciary chief, and a cleric from the Guardian Council is to assume responsibilities until the Assembly of Experts appoints a successor. The Assembly must choose from among senior Shia clerics. No consensus candidate has so far emerged. Names circulating in Tehran include Sadeq Larijani, the former judiciary chief and a close aide to Khamenei; Alireza Arafi, who oversees Iran’s seminaries; Mohsen Araki, a longtime member of the Assembly; Mohsen Qomi, an adviser within the Supreme Leader’s office; and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ruhollah Khomeini. Arafi, a source said, may be the favourite for filling in the space left behind by Ayatollah Khamenei. The late Ebrahim Raisi had been widely seen as a frontrunner before his own death in an air crash. Reports that Ayatollah Khamenei had quietly identified three potential successors during earlier crises suggest that contingency planning was already underway, though the names remain undisclosed. Institutional depth Despite the shock, Iran’s system is not built around one man alone. The Islamic Republic rests on multiple pillars, including the clerical establishment, security services, the bureaucracy, and an ideological base shaped by the doctrine of Velayat e Faqih. Unlike personality-driven autocracies, it therefore has institutional depth. During the transition phase, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is likely to play a decisive role in managing the affair. Whether as a stabiliser or dominant force, it will seek to prevent fragmentation. People react as they gather at the Enghelab Square, after Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was killed in Israeli and US strikes on Saturday, in Tehran, Iran on March 1, 2026. — Reuters That, however, does not mean friction is impossible. Economic sanctions have already strained society and fueled periodic unrest. Elite rivalries could surface as factions maneuver for influence over the next Supreme Leader. A hardline successor would definitely double down on ideological orthodoxy. Even if a relatively moderate cleric is chosen, immediate flexibility toward the West appears unlikely, as regimes, in moments of perceived siege, tend to project strength, not compromise. Iran’s own history counsels against premature obituaries. The Islamic Republic has faced moments far more perilous and yet endured. During the Iran-Iraq War, when the revolution was still young, Iran confronted invasion, diplomatic isolation, and crippling arms embargoes. It answered not by retreat but by mobilising society through revolutionary zeal and religious conviction, expanding the Basij volunteer force and adjusting its economy to survive under siege. During that period, the Hafte Tir bombing, carried out by the militant Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), eliminated 74 senior officials in one stroke, among them Chief Justice Mohammad Beheshti and several cabinet members. It was a decapitation attempt targeting the heart of the nascent revolution. Yet the system did not unravel. Vacancies were filled with speed, institutions closed ranks, and the doctrine of Velayat e Faqih was consolidated rather than diluted. The external consequences are already visible. Iran has responded to aggression with missile and drone strikes against Israel and US facilities in the Gulf. Its network of regional allies and proxies, often described as the Axis of Resistance, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, is expected to intensify asymmetrical attacks. Ayatollah Khamenei’s death will be framed as martyrdom, a narrative that resonates deeply within Shia political theology and could mobilise supporters from Iraq to Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei meets with a group of girls who reached the age of puberty in Tehran, Iran on February 3, 2023. — Reuters/File For Israel, the operation may have removed a principal adversary, but it also introduces new unpredictability. Khamenei, though implacably opposed to Israel, was a calculating actor who calibrated escalation. A leadership in transition, under pressure to demonstrate resolve, may be less restrained. Multi-front confrontations stretching from the Gulf to the Levant become more conceivable. Strategic gamble The US under President Donald Trump has presented the assassination as an act of “justice” and even an opportunity for Iranians to reclaim their country. Yet history offers caution. Air power alone seldom topples entrenched systems absent ground intervention or a coherent internal uprising. Instead, external attack often consolidates ruling elites and blunts domestic dissent, at least in the short term. The strategic gamble is therefore immense. If retaliation expands to target US assets across West Asia, Washington could find itself drawn deeper into a conflict without a clear political end state. Moreover, with the erosion of deterrence, cycles of strike and counterstrike may harden into a wider war. And if the Islamic Republic survives, as seems probable in the near term, it may emerge more securitized and more distrustful. Khamenei’s assassination has closed one chapter in Iran’s revolutionary history, but it does not automatically open another aligned with the ambitions of those who ordered the strike. Instead, it ushers in a period of uncertainty. The Islamic Republic is wounded but not necessarily weakened and the region is unsettled and more combustible.

The Islamic Republic rests on multiple pillars, including the clerical establishment, security services, the bureaucracy, and an ideological base shaped by the doctrine of Velayat e Faqih. Unlike personality-driven autocracies, it therefore has institutional depth. During the transition phase, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is likely to play a decisive role in managing the affair. Whether as a stabiliser or dominant force, it will seek to prevent fragmentation. People react as they gather at the Enghelab Square, after Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was killed in Israeli and US strikes on Saturday, in Tehran, Iran on March 1, 2026. — Reuters That, however, does not mean friction is impossible. Economic sanctions have already strained society and fueled periodic unrest. Elite rivalries could surface as factions maneuver for influence over the next Supreme Leader. A hardline successor would definitely double down on ideological orthodoxy. Even if a relatively moderate cleric is chosen, immediate flexibility toward the West appears unlikely, as regimes, in moments of perceived siege, tend to project strength, not compromise. Iran’s own history counsels against premature obituaries. The Islamic Republic has faced moments far more perilous and yet endured. During the Iran-Iraq War, when the revolution was still young, Iran confronted invasion, diplomatic isolation, and crippling arms embargoes. It answered not by retreat but by mobilising society through revolutionary zeal and religious conviction, expanding the Basij volunteer force and adjusting its economy to survive under siege. During that period, the Hafte Tir bombing, carried out by the militant Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), eliminated 74 senior officials in one stroke, among them Chief Justice Mohammad Beheshti and several cabinet members. It was a decapitation attempt targeting the heart of the nascent revolution. Yet the system did not unravel. Vacancies were filled with speed, institutions closed ranks, and the doctrine of Velayat e Faqih was consolidated rather than diluted. The external consequences are already visible. Iran has responded to aggression with missile and drone strikes against Israel and US facilities in the Gulf. Its network of regional allies and proxies, often described as the Axis of Resistance, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, is expected to intensify asymmetrical attacks. Ayatollah Khamenei’s death will be framed as martyrdom, a narrative that resonates deeply within Shia political theology and could mobilise supporters from Iraq to Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei meets with a group of girls who reached the age of puberty in Tehran, Iran on February 3, 2023. — Reuters/File For Israel, the operation may have removed a principal adversary, but it also introduces new unpredictability. Khamenei, though implacably opposed to Israel, was a calculating actor who calibrated escalation. A leadership in transition, under pressure to demonstrate resolve, may be less restrained. Multi-front confrontations stretching from the Gulf to the Levant become more conceivable. Strategic gamble The US under President Donald Trump has presented the assassination as an act of “justice” and even an opportunity for Iranians to reclaim their country. Yet history offers caution. Air power alone seldom topples entrenched systems absent ground intervention or a coherent internal uprising. Instead, external attack often consolidates ruling elites and blunts domestic dissent, at least in the short term. The strategic gamble is therefore immense. If retaliation expands to target US assets across West Asia, Washington could find itself drawn deeper into a conflict without a clear political end state. Moreover, with the erosion of deterrence, cycles of strike and counterstrike may harden into a wider war. And if the Islamic Republic survives, as seems probable in the near term, it may emerge more securitized and more distrustful. Khamenei’s assassination has closed one chapter in Iran’s revolutionary history, but it does not automatically open another aligned with the ambitions of those who ordered the strike. Instead, it ushers in a period of uncertainty. The Islamic Republic is wounded but not necessarily weakened and the region is unsettled and more combustible. The world may soon discover that removing a man is far easier than reshaping the order he helped build.",

      "summary_orig": "• Civil Defence official testifies power shutdown, closed exits and lack of emergency lighting hampered evacuation • Says building was inspected twice in 2024, 2025 and fire safety mesasures were found inadequate KARACHI: An official of Civil Defence has informed the Gul Plaza Judicial Commission that the fire and rescue service of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), as well as the Rescue 1122, were equipped with advanced machinery, but failed to douse the fire efficiently and rescue people trapped inside the burning building on Jan 17. He also deposed that premature shutdown of electricity, lack of emergency/backup lights and closure of gates had further exacerbated panic among people stuck in the ill-fated building and significantly impaired evacuation efforts. Mirza Mursaleen Baig, a technical instructor at the Civil Defence department, further testified that fire safety measures were found inadequate during an inspection of the building, but a challan could not be filed in court over non-compliance with safety regulations. While mainly shifting responsibility of the tragic incident to the fire crew and rescue services, he maintained that Civil Defence was facing a severe shortage of staff and resources, and it was impossible to inspect all the buildings comprehensively. Earlier, the single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court had directed additional controller Civil Defence Fatima Memon to respond to its various questions after outgoing director Abdul Hameed informed it that he could not reply to the questionnaires as he was no longer holding the charge. However, Mr Baig turned up before the commission, tasked with probing the devastating blaze, and informed it that he was assisting Ms Memon, who has been placed under suspension after the Gul Plaza fire incident. In his testimony recorded under oath, the technical instructor said that inspection and fire prevention in commercial and industrial sectors and holding training sessions for firefighting/casualty were core responsibilities of Civil Defence. He deposed that inspections of the ill-fated building were carried out in 2024 and 2025, and that fire safety measures were found inadequate, while the building management was directed to comply with safety regulations. He also said that generally, Civil Defence used to file challans before the special courts in case of non-compliance, but the same could not be filed in this particular case due to the unavailability of courts/judge. The official conceded that the courts had become functional in July last year; however, the challan was not placed before it till the devastating fire incident took place. Based on available information, Mr Baig further testified that it was a class “B” fire involving multiple types of highly flammable material/fuel, including plastic, rubber, melamine crockery, fabrics, cosmetic products, etc. As per standard fire safety principles, the electricity is ordinarily shut down where the fire originates from an electrical short circuit, categorising the same as class “C” fire, whereas immediate disconnection of power in class “B” fire was not necessarily mandated unless there is a direct electrical hazard, he maintained. He also deposed that the premature shutdown of power had contributed to darkness in the premises and panic among the people present inside the building at the time of the incident. The official of Civil Defence further testified that the exit points should have remained open to facilitate the evacuation, as closure of gates, darkness and smoke have significantly impaired evacuation efforts. Under the applicable fire safety laws and standard operating procedures (SOPs), the technical instructor was of the view that the building management was required to maintain firefighting capacity sufficient for around 15 minutes before the arrival of emergency services. He also said that no separate emergency lighting arrangements were installed at the passages/corridors, which were normally required to function in the event of a power shutdown during a fire emergency. The absence of such emergency lights had further exacerbated panic among occupants, particularly in darkness combined with thick smoke, he said, and further asserted that Civil Defence was facing a severe shortage of staff and resources as there were only 88 personnel for the whole province. He maintained that only six persons were assigned to the South district with no supporting staff, and under such constraints, it was humanly impossible to inspect all buildings comprehensively. About the Gul Plaza fire, the technical instructor of Civil Defence said, “I state that the primary responsibility lies with the KMC fire and rescue services and the Rescue 1122 department. They are equipped with advanced machinery such as special oxygen masks with tanks, tools and specialised SOPs to handle such emergencies. Unfortunately, due to a lack of awareness or negligence, they failed to extinguish the fire effectively and rescue the trapped individuals”. Thereafter, the commission invited the director general of Rescue 1122 and the chief fire officer to cross-examine the technical instructor of Civil Defence, as he had levelled accusations of serious nature.

However, Mr Baig turned up before the commission, tasked with probing the devastating blaze, and informed it that he was assisting Ms Memon, who has been placed under suspension after the Gul Plaza fire incident. In his testimony recorded under oath, the technical instructor said that inspection and fire prevention in commercial and industrial sectors and holding training sessions for firefighting/casualty were core responsibilities of Civil Defence. He deposed that inspections of the ill-fated building were carried out in 2024 and 2025, and that fire safety measures were found inadequate, while the building management was directed to comply with safety regulations. He also said that generally, Civil Defence used to file challans before the special courts in case of non-compliance, but the same could not be filed in this particular case due to the unavailability of courts/judge. The official conceded that the courts had become functional in July last year; however, the challan was not placed before it till the devastating fire incident took place. Based on available information, Mr Baig further testified that it was a class “B” fire involving multiple types of highly flammable material/fuel, including plastic, rubber, melamine crockery, fabrics, cosmetic products, etc. As per standard fire safety principles, the electricity is ordinarily shut down where the fire originates from an electrical short circuit, categorising the same as class “C” fire, whereas immediate disconnection of power in class “B” fire was not necessarily mandated unless there is a direct electrical hazard, he maintained. He also deposed that the premature shutdown of power had contributed to darkness in the premises and panic among the people present inside the building at the time of the incident. The official of Civil Defence further testified that the exit points should have remained open to facilitate the evacuation, as closure of gates, darkness and smoke have significantly impaired evacuation efforts. Under the applicable fire safety laws and standard operating procedures (SOPs), the technical instructor was of the view that the building management was required to maintain firefighting capacity sufficient for around 15 minutes before the arrival of emergency services. He also said that no separate emergency lighting arrangements were installed at the passages/corridors, which were normally required to function in the event of a power shutdown during a fire emergency. The absence of such emergency lights had further exacerbated panic among occupants, particularly in darkness combined with thick smoke, he said, and further asserted that Civil Defence was facing a severe shortage of staff and resources as there were only 88 personnel for the whole province. He maintained that only six persons were assigned to the South district with no supporting staff, and under such constraints, it was humanly impossible to inspect all buildings comprehensively. About the Gul Plaza fire, the technical instructor of Civil Defence said, “I state that the primary responsibility lies with the KMC fire and rescue services and the Rescue 1122 department. They are equipped with advanced machinery such as special oxygen masks with tanks, tools and specialised SOPs to handle such emergencies. Unfortunately, due to a lack of awareness or negligence, they failed to extinguish the fire effectively and rescue the trapped individuals”. Thereafter, the commission invited the director general of Rescue 1122 and the chief fire officer to cross-examine the technical instructor of Civil Defence, as he had levelled accusations of serious nature.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: There was no let-up in fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the conflict entered its third day despite efforts by the international community to de-escalate the situation, which has claimed scores of lives since Thursday night. The clashes started after the Afghan Taliban targeted Pakistani positions along the border in response to earlier air strikes by Pakistan in multiple Afghan provinces to target the militants involved in cross-border attacks. Pakistan launched the operation ‘Ghazb lil Haq’ in response and took out military targets across Afghanistan. On Saturday, the armed forces continued ground and air operations against the Afghan Taliban overnight, striking formation headquarters in Nangarhar and other areas. The headquarters of the Afghan army in Kandahar and Nangarhar provinces were destroyed in targeted air strikes carried out by the armed forces, said security sources. State-run media reported that air strikes “hit two targets at the Mohmand Dara Base in Nangarhar” while Afghan Taliban posts near Miranshah and in the Ghulam Khan sector along the border were also destroyed. Info ministry says 331 Taliban combatants killed, 104 posts destroyed so far In a statement on Saturday, Info­rmation Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed that under the operation ‘Ghazab lil-Haq’, the armed forces have killed “331 Afghan Taliban personnel and injured more than 500 others” since the start of the operation. He said that the armed forces had destroyed 104 posts and captured 22 others. According to the minister, 163 tanks and other vehicles were also destroyed, and 37 locations had been targeted across the border. Amid intense clashes along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, authorities across the country took a series of precautionary measures, such as hospital emergencies in areas near the border and a ban on drones in almost all parts of the country. According to a notification, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government imposed an immediate and complete ban on outdoor drone flying across the territory for 30 days to ensure the safety of citizens and protection of public and private installations amid heightened tensions along the country’s western borders. Meanwhile, in Landi Kotal, the authorities relocated all 37 under-trial prisoners to a lockup in Jamrud after mortar shells fired from Afghanistan fell in the nearby tehsil offices compound. Officials said that the tehsil offices compound was earlier vacated, with district administration officials advised to work from home. The ‘open war’ also took a toll on the Afghan refugees, as the state authorities intensified their crackdown against them. Claim rejected The information ministry rejected claims about a Pakistani jet being shot down in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar. The ministry’s fact-check account on X attributed the claims to Afghan Taliban officials that were “amplified by Indian media”. “The Ministry of Defence of the so-called Islamic Emirate claimed that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani fighter jet in Nangarhar and captured its pilot alive. The claim was widely amplified by Indian media and Afghan propaganda outlets,” it said. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington did not view Pakistan as the aggressor in the latest escalation and that Islamabad was under pressure to address its security challenges, Reuters reported, adding Wash­ington hoped the situation would not escalate further. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that “our cup of patience has overflowed” and described the fighting as “open war”, warning that Pakistan would respond to further attacks. According to Reuters , Taliban deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said 19 civilians were killed and 26 wounded in Khost and Paktika. Reuters could not verify the claim. Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani said in a speech in Khost province that the conflict “will be very costly”, and that Afghan forces had not deployed broadly beyond those already engaged. Pakistan’s military capabilities far exceed those of Afghanistan, with a standing army of hundreds of thousands and a modern air force. In stark contrast, the Taliban lacks a conventional air force and relies largely on light weaponry and ground forces. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LA PAZ : At least 22 people were killed when a Bolivian military cargo plane carrying banknotes crashed while landing near the capital city La Paz, police said Friday, as crowds attempted to loot the site. The aircraft, a C-130 Hercules transport plane — manufactured by Lockheed Martin — veered off the runway at El Alto Intern­ational Airport and crashed into an avenue, destroying multiple cars and damaging trucks, local media footage showed. Mangled parts of the aircraft were seen on the road where the plane came down and bystanders could be seen rushing to grab the scattered cash prompting police to deploy tear gas to repel the hordes. Authorities were later seen setting the money alight in a bonfire at the scene of the crash. It was not immediately known what caused the crash but witnesses told AFP that the weather had been treacherous. 28 injured as hospitals launch emergency blood donation drive The Ministry of Defence said it would launch an investigation into the crash. Colonel Rene Tambo, head of the police homicide division in El Alto, told reporters late Friday that “there are about 20, maybe a few more,” casualties. Colonel Pavel Tovar of the National Fire Department gave an earlier toll of “between 15 and 16 people” dead in the disaster. “We are recovering the bodies of these people who have sadly suffered in the accident,” he said. Bolivia’s health ministry rep­orted that at least 28 people were injured. Money grab ‘a crime’ Fatalities were recorded both at the airport and on the busy avenue where the plane crashed and struck several vehicles. The Bolivian Air Navigation and Airports authority NAABOL said in a statement that the C-130 Hercules had departed from the eastern city of Santa Cruz and crashed while landing at El Alto international airport, which has since suspended operations. The defence ministry in a statement said that “the money transported in the crashed aircraft has no official serial number… therefore it has no legal or purchasing power.” It said that “its collection, possession, or use constitutes a crime.” The La Paz Prosecutor’s Office received reports of businesses that were also targeted by criminals taking advantage of the chaos. “Twelve people have been arrested” for questioning, prosecutor Luis Carlos Torres told reporters. Hospitals in El Alto also launched a blood donation campaign to treat the injured. La Paz, at an altitude of 1,975 feet and surrounded by Andean peaks, is the highest administrative capital in the world. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Airspace shut over Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan • Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, 24 other airlines ground flights ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Int­ernational Airlines (PIA) suspended flights to several Gulf countries on Saturday, joining a cascade of global carriers grounding aircraft across the Middle East after US and Israeli strikes on Iran plunged the region into a renewed military conflict and shut down major air corridors. According to a statement by the PIA spokesperson, flights have been suspended to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait. “These flights will not operate until tomorrow evening or until the restoration of airspace, whichever comes later,” the spokesperson said. “PIA flights to Saudi Arabia will continue; however, their routes have been changed,” he added. “Flights have been shifted to Boeing 777 aircraft and will reach their destinations via longer routes,” the spokesperson added. The national carrier requested the travellers to contact the PIA call centre at 111-786-786 for information related to their flights or changes in the booking of flights. The widespread disruption followed a series of Israeli strikes on Iran and retaliatory missile salvoes from Tehran, forcing an immediate shutdown of airspace over at least seven countries. The conflict’s most significant impact was felt at Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel. Dubai Airports announced a suspension of all flights until further notice, a move echoed by its flagship carrier, Emirates. Flydubai, its sister airline, also halted operations, while in the neighbouring Emirati capital, Etihad Airways suspended all departures from Abu Dhabi until Sunday morning and cancelled expected arrivals. The skies over Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan were virtually empty on Saturday, according to flight-tracking service Flightradar24, as civilian aircraft were rerouted around a vast no-fly zone. The European Union’s aviation regulator, EASA, recommended that its airlines stay out of the affected airspace. Oman Air has also announced cancellations and temporary suspensions of several flights due to the evolving regional situation. Major international carriers moved swiftly to suspend services. British Airways cancelled flights to Tel Aviv and Bahrain until March 3. Germany’s Lufthansa suspended flights to and from Dubai for the weekend and halted routes to Tel Aviv, Beirut and Oman until March 7. Air France cancelled flights to Tel Aviv, Beirut and Dubai, while Italy’s ITA Airways suspended its Tel Aviv route and announced it would avoid the airspace of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon until March 7. Wizz Air halted flights to Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman until the same date. The chaos rippled eastward, with Air India and Indigo suspending flights to the Middle East. Russia’s transport ministry said its air carriers had suspended flights to both Iran and Israel. Regional carriers were also profoundly affected, with Qatar Airways and Kuwait Airways temporarily suspending all flights from their home hubs after their national airspace was closed. Turkish Airlines cancelled flights to 10 Middle Eastern nations, though some Gulf suspensions were only for Saturday. The sudden shutdown caught many flights mid-air, with a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Dubai forced to return to its origin city. Virgin Atlantic said it would temporarily avoid Iraqi airspace, causing some re-routing. Throughout the day, more airlines suspended services, including Swiss, KLM, Iberia Express, SAS, Finnair, and Norwegian. Regional operators like Air Algerie and Aegean Airlines also grounded routes. Japan Airlines also cancelled a flight to the region. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",
