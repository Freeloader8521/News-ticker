      "summary_orig": "Pakistan struck a delicate balance at a tense UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, condemning unwarranted attacks on Iran, expressing solidarity with Gulf states, and urging an immediate return to negotiations and diplomacy. The Council’s emergency session examined the repercussions of the US and Israeli air strikes on Iran and laid bare the deep divisions within the 15-member body over the escalating crisis. Speaking at the meeting, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, outlined Islamabad’s growing concern as the situation in the Middle East becomes more complex with each new development. “Pakistan condemns the initiation of unwarranted attacks against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in violation of international law,” the ambassador said. At the same time, he stressed that Pakistan also “condemns the attacks against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and stands in solidarity with all these brotherly countries.” He warned that, at a time when renewed diplomatic efforts were underway, such actions would “undermine the peace and stability of the entire region, with far-reaching consequences.” Ambassador Ahmad made clear that Pakistan’s concern extends beyond any single capital. Instead, it is focused on the security architecture of the entire Gulf region — home to millions of Pakistani expatriates and a region with which Islamabad maintains deep political, economic and security ties. This dual condemnation — of strikes on Iran and of attacks on Gulf states — illustrates the fine line Pakistan is walking. It cannot afford to alienate Tehran, a neighbor with whom it shares a sensitive border and a complex security equation. Nor can it distance itself from Gulf partners that host large Pakistani communities and play a critical role in Pakistan’s economy. The envoy’s emphasis on mediation and dialogue further underscored this balancing act. “We particularly laud Oman’s role in facilitating and mediating dialogue between Iran and the United States,” he said, aligning Pakistan firmly with diplomatic efforts rather than military blocs. In another pointed observation, he lamented that “diplomacy has once again been derailed as these attacks have happened right in the middle of negotiations,” warning that “these military actions undermine dialogue and further erode trust that was already in short supply.” Islamabad’s legal framing was equally deliberate. The ambassador reminded the Council that “the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct,” stressing that the Charter “prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states.” This formulation allows Pakistan to oppose unilateral or pre-emptive military actions without directly isolating any particular power beyond the immediate incidents. At the humanitarian level, Pakistan sought to humanise the crisis. Ambassador Ahmad offered condolences to “civilians caught in the middle of these violent acts,” specifically mentioning “school children in Iran” and the family of a Pakistani national killed in the United Arab Emirates. In doing so, Islamabad reinforced its message that ordinary people — Iranians, Arabs and Pakistanis alike — are the real victims of escalation. The strategic anxiety was also explicit. “We are deeply alarmed at the risk of regional conflagration,” the ambassador said, noting that the “safety and well-being of millions of our compatriots in the countries of the region is also our top priority.” Ultimately, Pakistan’s message was straightforward but urgent: “Pakistan calls on all sides to immediately halt escalation and urgently resume diplomacy with a view to achieving a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis.” Whether the balance Islamabad seeks to maintain can endure will depend not only on its own diplomatic agility, but also on whether the region itself steps back from the brink.",

Once Sri Lanka had eliminated Pakistan from the tournament, the rest of the match was irrelevant from a Pakistani perspective. In the end both Pakistan and Sri Lanka were losers. Pakistan had failed to defeat any major team in the tournament before this game, and that says everything you need to know about the current standing of Pakistan in world cricket. With three changes in Kandy, Pakistan relied on their bowlers to exploit Sri Lanka’s batting weakness. However, it was the stunning performance of Pakistan’s opening batsmen that created hope before Sri Lanka reminded the world of their own talent. Farhan took the batting glory on his way to his second tournament hundred and to race past Virat Kohli’s record for most runs scored in a World T20. The conditions supported his vigorous stroke play, the ball coming on nicely in pace and in line. The sense was that Farhan just needed to find some support from his fellow batsman, and here he found a willing accomplice in Fakhar Zaman. Naseem Shah, one of the returning players, made the first incision of Sri Lanka’s chase. He spotted Nissanka making room and cleverly produced a perfectly pitched googly that found Sri Lanka’s danger man overstretching. The wicket started taking turn towards the end of Pakistan innings, and was now a more appetising prospect for spinners. Sri Lanka had won the toss and could only blame themselves for this slight imbalance. Abrar rekindles hope Abrar Ahmed, who had fluffed his lines against India, was the man who made Pakistan fans dare to believe. Full of confidence here, he slowed his pace down dramatically to repeatedly deceive Sri Lanka’s batsmen. When Mohammad Nawaz chipped in to take the fifth wicket, and with Sri Lanka still some 50 runs short of the target that would eliminate Pakistan, hopes were high of completing a mission that wasn’t impossible.. Rathnayake had other ideas. As the rest of Sri Lanka’s batsmen struggled, Rathnayake launched into Nawaz and Shadab Khan. The ghosts of Pakistan’s inadequate tournament performance were back to haunt them. Pakistan had backed spin and spin bowling all-rounders, and the strategy hadn’t delivered. When Shanaka plundered Usman Tariq for 13 runs in the 16th over, Pakistan were out and New Zealand were through to the semi-finals. Now, Pakistan had to somehow find the desire to win this game, and thanks to Shanaka’s brutal late hitting they almost didn’t. Earlier Sri Lanka had put Pakistan in to bat, and Pakistan quietly expected. But nobody quite expected what followed. Farhan and Zaman took the attack to Sri Lanka, quickly setting the run rate at 10 an over, and keeping it there. It was Farhan who generated the momentum, powerfully punching boundaries almost at will. He was also aware enough to settle for a single when it was the best option. Farhan’s acceleration took the pressure off Fakhar in his return to the team. But once Fakhar too found his trademark strokes, Pakistan were flying. Sri Lanka probably settled too early to defend runs by targeting width rather than seeking to slow down Pakistan by taking wickets. Both batsmen, as is the modern way, line up shots and then get their front leg out of the way to generate power. Farhan is more orthodox, while Fakhar is an innovator. The result was a partnership of 176. At that moment Pakistan looked well set for a total above 220. After such a brilliant opening stand, the eventual target felt at least 20 runs short. Question mark over Babar, Shaheen In the end, Pakistan’s big decision to drop Babar Azam made no material difference to their score other than forcing the responsibility onto others. It really is hard to see how, as prolific as he has been, Babar has a future in the T20 team after this tournament. Pakistan will point to recent improvements in performance leading up to this World Cup, and perhaps they got unlucky when their match with New Zealand was rained off. But the hard truth is that Pakistan are short of high-quality cricketers in this format and probably the other formats as well. When the problems with Pakistan’s cricket are so systemic and deep-rooted, it seems almost academic to focus on individuals. Of course that must be done, and the areas are clear. Pakistan fall short in quality of top order batting and pace bowling. The all-rounders aren’t good enough to support a strategy built on them. Then there is the question of whether the captain and a whole generation of senior players should continue in the T20 team — and, yes, this includes Babar and Shaheen Shah Afridi, alongside Nawaz and Shadab Khan. The brutal answer is no. Pakistan must shed the deadwood that is now drenched in failure. Grow the tree again. As ever, Pakistan do unearth talented new cricketers, but the problem is that the development of these cricketers is failing. The PSL cannot continue to be the main pipeline for Pakistan’s cricket team across the three formats. The problems, therefore, are systemic and the challenge is complex and long-term. But what the PCB has continued to demonstrate, under every leadership and regime for the last 20 years and more, is that it does not have the patience to cure the disease at the core of Pakistan’s cricket. Unless it does so, these disappointments will endure — and sadly failure is something that Pakistani fans are now numb too. The message to the PCB is simple: shed the deadwood, grow a new tree from the roots upwards, and make the trunk — the core — strong. What’s true for the T20 team is also true for Pakistan cricket as a whole. Pakistan’s main contribution to this tournament, the performance of Sahibzada Farhan aside, was to fulfil their obligations to the ICC and Sri Lanka by playing India.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: There was no let-up in fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the conflict entered its third day despite efforts by the international community to de-escalate the situation, which has claimed scores of lives since Thursday night. The clashes started after the Afghan Taliban targeted Pakistani positions along the border in response to earlier air strikes by Pakistan in multiple Afghan provinces to target the militants involved in cross-border attacks. Pakistan launched the operation ‘Ghazb lil Haq’ in response and took out military targets across Afghanistan. On Saturday, the armed forces continued ground and air operations against the Afghan Taliban overnight, striking formation headquarters in Nangarhar and other areas. The headquarters of the Afghan army in Kandahar and Nangarhar provinces were destroyed in targeted air strikes carried out by the armed forces, said security sources. State-run media reported that air strikes “hit two targets at the Mohmand Dara Base in Nangarhar” while Afghan Taliban posts near Miranshah and in the Ghulam Khan sector along the border were also destroyed. Info ministry says 331 Taliban combatants killed, 104 posts destroyed so far In a statement on Saturday, Info­rmation Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed that under the operation ‘Ghazab lil-Haq’, the armed forces have killed “331 Afghan Taliban personnel and injured more than 500 others” since the start of the operation. He said that the armed forces had destroyed 104 posts and captured 22 others. According to the minister, 163 tanks and other vehicles were also destroyed, and 37 locations had been targeted across the border. Amid intense clashes along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, authorities across the country took a series of precautionary measures, such as hospital emergencies in areas near the border and a ban on drones in almost all parts of the country. According to a notification, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government imposed an immediate and complete ban on outdoor drone flying across the territory for 30 days to ensure the safety of citizens and protection of public and private installations amid heightened tensions along the country’s western borders. Meanwhile, in Landi Kotal, the authorities relocated all 37 under-trial prisoners to a lockup in Jamrud after mortar shells fired from Afghanistan fell in the nearby tehsil offices compound. Officials said that the tehsil offices compound was earlier vacated, with district administration officials advised to work from home. The ‘open war’ also took a toll on the Afghan refugees, as the state authorities intensified their crackdown against them. Claim rejected The information ministry rejected claims about a Pakistani jet being shot down in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar. The ministry’s fact-check account on X attributed the claims to Afghan Taliban officials that were “amplified by Indian media”. “The Ministry of Defence of the so-called Islamic Emirate claimed that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani fighter jet in Nangarhar and captured its pilot alive. The claim was widely amplified by Indian media and Afghan propaganda outlets,” it said. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington did not view Pakistan as the aggressor in the latest escalation and that Islamabad was under pressure to address its security challenges, Reuters reported, adding Wash­ington hoped the situation would not escalate further. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that “our cup of patience has overflowed” and described the fighting as “open war”, warning that Pakistan would respond to further attacks. According to Reuters , Taliban deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said 19 civilians were killed and 26 wounded in Khost and Paktika. Reuters could not verify the claim. Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani said in a speech in Khost province that the conflict “will be very costly”, and that Afghan forces had not deployed broadly beyond those already engaged. Pakistan’s military capabilities far exceed those of Afghanistan, with a standing army of hundreds of thousands and a modern air force. In stark contrast, the Taliban lacks a conventional air force and relies largely on light weaponry and ground forces. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "THE latest episode of the US-Israel conflict with Iran is neither merely about another exchange of missiles between Israel and Iran, nor is it only about American involvement at a higher level than before. What has unfolded since Saturday morning has instead signified a shift in objective, in tactics, in timing and in political framing of this long-running conflict bet­ween the US and Israel, and Iran. The US-Israel war aga­inst Iran has, since the last 12-day confrontation, mo­­ved from deterrence management to regime change and this transformation will determine the direction of this confrontation. Only days ago, diplomacy was not dead. Under Omani mediation, discussions were progressing and technical talks involving the International Atomic Energy Agency were scheduled for Monday. Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Al Busaidi, had publicly spoken of near agreement on Iran not producing nuclear weapons, down-blending of existing stockpiles, not stockpiling in future and IAEA inspection and verification mechanism. Moreover, despite Iran’s reluctance to discuss its support for regional non-state actors and its missile programme, there was an understanding that Tehran would discuss that with regional countries. By all standards, that was not empty signalling. Tehran may not have agreed to surrender, as US President Donald Trump wanted, but had almost agreed on a structured compromise. Endurance, not spectacle, appears to be the guiding principle for Iranian leaders The shift, however, began when rhetoric from Washington moved beyond enrichment caps and verification mechanisms. As President Trump spoke in terms that blurred nuclear rollback with political change inside Iran, it was clear that the goal post had been shifted. Against that backdrop, the US and Israel launched strikes against Iran. During the June 12-day war, the strikes were limited to degrading missile depots and eliminating military top brass for operational decapitation. This time, the targeting pattern suggested something deeper as sites linked not only to military command but to the political leadership, including buildings associated with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian, were struck right at the start, signalling a widening of intent. The difference is not that leaders were targeted in both wars; rather, it is about which layer of leadership and with what political implications. The timing was also telling. Previous Israeli operations occurred under the cover of darkness, whereas this round began in broad daylight. It was meant to maximise disruption and expose the collapse of the system; in other words, strikes were designed for overt shock, not attrition. The American role further distinguished this phase. During the June war, Washington initially stayed back before entering the fray to bomb the nuclear sites and then went back. This time, there was deeper operational coordination from the outset, which shaped Iran’s response. Within hours, Iranian missiles struck not just Israel but also the US assets across the Gulf. If the June retaliation was calibrated and largely symbolic, leaving room for de-escalation, this time horizontal escalation came early, which hints at prior authorisation and readiness. This perception is reinforced by the maritime dimension. Saturday evening reports indicated that Iran had moved to close the Strait of Hormuz, warning vessels against passage. Introducing the long-feared Strait of Hormuz closure into the equation at an early stage signalled preparations for a protracted conflict. This brings us to the central divergence in strategy. Washington and Tel Aviv appear to pre­­fer compressed plans, with a quick vic­­tory involving a short, decisive campaign that eliminates leadership, degra­des Iranian military capability and avo­ids prolonged engagement. For Trump, duration carries domestic implications. A brief conflict framed as decisive stren­gthens his standing, whereas a long war erodes it. Similarly, Israel doesn’t prefer sustained attacks because of its ‘geography curse’ and the character of its economy. Tehran’s calculus is almost the mirror opposite. Time can work in its favour by stretching interceptor stocks, raising energy prices and increasing regional economic pressure. In Iranian calculation if the conflict extends without the US ground involvement, Iran’s doctrine of endurance begins to look more viable than shock. Iran’s layering strategy for missile use, deploying older systems first to saturate defences is another indication of preparation for sustained engagement rather than immediate maximal retaliation. Therefore, endurance, not spectacle, appears to be the guiding principle for the Iranian leaders. The key question now is whether leadership cohesion in Tehran remains intact. If the upper tier fractures, the shock doctrine may succeed and the war could compress. If cohesion holds, the confrontation shifts into an endurance phase in which escalation control beco­mes more fragile with each passing day. Three trajectories are likely: rapid containment with mediation resuming after calibrated exchanges; extended but controlled confrontation involving sustained strikes and avoiding full energy infrastructure destruction; and a reg­ional war, where proxies expand the theatre and maritime disruption intensifies. All sides would certainly not like the third option, whereas this episode is already beyond symbolic exchange, leaving the sides with the second scenario. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LA PAZ : At least 22 people were killed when a Bolivian military cargo plane carrying banknotes crashed while landing near the capital city La Paz, police said Friday, as crowds attempted to loot the site. The aircraft, a C-130 Hercules transport plane — manufactured by Lockheed Martin — veered off the runway at El Alto Intern­ational Airport and crashed into an avenue, destroying multiple cars and damaging trucks, local media footage showed. Mangled parts of the aircraft were seen on the road where the plane came down and bystanders could be seen rushing to grab the scattered cash prompting police to deploy tear gas to repel the hordes. Authorities were later seen setting the money alight in a bonfire at the scene of the crash. It was not immediately known what caused the crash but witnesses told AFP that the weather had been treacherous. 28 injured as hospitals launch emergency blood donation drive The Ministry of Defence said it would launch an investigation into the crash. Colonel Rene Tambo, head of the police homicide division in El Alto, told reporters late Friday that “there are about 20, maybe a few more,” casualties. Colonel Pavel Tovar of the National Fire Department gave an earlier toll of “between 15 and 16 people” dead in the disaster. “We are recovering the bodies of these people who have sadly suffered in the accident,” he said. Bolivia’s health ministry rep­orted that at least 28 people were injured. Money grab ‘a crime’ Fatalities were recorded both at the airport and on the busy avenue where the plane crashed and struck several vehicles. The Bolivian Air Navigation and Airports authority NAABOL said in a statement that the C-130 Hercules had departed from the eastern city of Santa Cruz and crashed while landing at El Alto international airport, which has since suspended operations. The defence ministry in a statement said that “the money transported in the crashed aircraft has no official serial number… therefore it has no legal or purchasing power.” It said that “its collection, possession, or use constitutes a crime.” The La Paz Prosecutor’s Office received reports of businesses that were also targeted by criminals taking advantage of the chaos. “Twelve people have been arrested” for questioning, prosecutor Luis Carlos Torres told reporters. Hospitals in El Alto also launched a blood donation campaign to treat the injured. La Paz, at an altitude of 1,975 feet and surrounded by Andean peaks, is the highest administrative capital in the world. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Airspace shut over Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan • Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, 24 other airlines ground flights ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Int­ernational Airlines (PIA) suspended flights to several Gulf countries on Saturday, joining a cascade of global carriers grounding aircraft across the Middle East after US and Israeli strikes on Iran plunged the region into a renewed military conflict and shut down major air corridors. According to a statement by the PIA spokesperson, flights have been suspended to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait. “These flights will not operate until tomorrow evening or until the restoration of airspace, whichever comes later,” the spokesperson said. “PIA flights to Saudi Arabia will continue; however, their routes have been changed,” he added. “Flights have been shifted to Boeing 777 aircraft and will reach their destinations via longer routes,” the spokesperson added. The national carrier requested the travellers to contact the PIA call centre at 111-786-786 for information related to their flights or changes in the booking of flights. The widespread disruption followed a series of Israeli strikes on Iran and retaliatory missile salvoes from Tehran, forcing an immediate shutdown of airspace over at least seven countries. The conflict’s most significant impact was felt at Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel. Dubai Airports announced a suspension of all flights until further notice, a move echoed by its flagship carrier, Emirates. Flydubai, its sister airline, also halted operations, while in the neighbouring Emirati capital, Etihad Airways suspended all departures from Abu Dhabi until Sunday morning and cancelled expected arrivals. The skies over Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan were virtually empty on Saturday, according to flight-tracking service Flightradar24, as civilian aircraft were rerouted around a vast no-fly zone. The European Union’s aviation regulator, EASA, recommended that its airlines stay out of the affected airspace. Oman Air has also announced cancellations and temporary suspensions of several flights due to the evolving regional situation. Major international carriers moved swiftly to suspend services. British Airways cancelled flights to Tel Aviv and Bahrain until March 3. Germany’s Lufthansa suspended flights to and from Dubai for the weekend and halted routes to Tel Aviv, Beirut and Oman until March 7. Air France cancelled flights to Tel Aviv, Beirut and Dubai, while Italy’s ITA Airways suspended its Tel Aviv route and announced it would avoid the airspace of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon until March 7. Wizz Air halted flights to Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman until the same date. The chaos rippled eastward, with Air India and Indigo suspending flights to the Middle East. Russia’s transport ministry said its air carriers had suspended flights to both Iran and Israel. Regional carriers were also profoundly affected, with Qatar Airways and Kuwait Airways temporarily suspending all flights from their home hubs after their national airspace was closed. Turkish Airlines cancelled flights to 10 Middle Eastern nations, though some Gulf suspensions were only for Saturday. The sudden shutdown caught many flights mid-air, with a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Dubai forced to return to its origin city. Virgin Atlantic said it would temporarily avoid Iraqi airspace, causing some re-routing. Throughout the day, more airlines suspended services, including Swiss, KLM, Iberia Express, SAS, Finnair, and Norwegian. Regional operators like Air Algerie and Aegean Airlines also grounded routes. Japan Airlines also cancelled a flight to the region. Published in Dawn, March 1st, 2026",

      "title_orig": "Khamenei — the supreme leader who held ultimate control over Iran’s political, military, religious institutions",
      "summary_orig": "Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who ruled he Islamic republic for over 30 years, has been killed in a an strike by US and Israel — the two countries that had been calling for a regime change in Tehran. Khamenei, 86, became Iran’s highest authority in 1989, following the death of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He remained in power after overcoming 1999 student demonstrations, 2009 mass protests sparked by disputed presidential elections and 2019 demonstrations that were brutally suppressed. He also survived the 2022-2023 “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement sparked by the death in custody of Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women. As supreme leader, he held ultimate control over Iran’s political, military and religious institutions, shaping domestic policy and guiding foreign relations. An article published in Al Jazeera said “critical to Khamenei’s power is the loyalty of two of Iran’s premier security institutions – the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Basij paramilitary forces, which have hundreds of ⁠thousands of volunteers”. Khamenei upheld the conservative vision of his predecessor, Khomeini, quashing the ambitions of elected presidents who sought more open policies at home and abroad. Under his rule, authorities sidelined reformists pushing for less confrontation with the West. He backed the 2015 nuclear deal brokered with world powers and pragmatist former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, which briefly eased Iran’s isolation. But tensions spiked after US President Donald Trump abandoned the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions. Israel has long seen him as a destabilising force in the Middle East, citing his alleged backing for a network of militant allies. When Israel and Iran fought a 12-day air war in June 2025, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened to assassinate him, saying the supreme leader “cannot continue to exist.” Khamenei was forced to go into hiding during the war, which exposed deep Israeli intelligence penetration of the Islamic republic that led to the killing of key security officials in air strikes. But he survived that war and, after nationwide protests again shook Iran earlier this year, he emerged defiant as ever. Tight security Khamenei lived under the tightest security, and his relatively infrequent public appearances were never announced in advance or broadcast live. As supreme leader he never set foot outside the country, a precedent set by Khomeini following his triumphant return to Tehran from France in 1979. Khamenei’s last known foreign trip was an official visit to North Korea in 1989 as president, where he met Kim II Sung. There had long been speculation about his health given his age, but there was nothing in his most recent appearance to fuel any new rumours. Khamenei’s right arm was partially paralysed following an assassination attempt in 1981 that authorities have always blamed on the People’s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) group, one-time allies of the revolution now outlawed in the country. ‘I am opposed’ Repeatedly arrested under the late Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza for his anti-imperial activism, Khamenei, shortly after the Islamic revolution, became Friday prayer leader of Tehran and also served on the front line during the Iran-Iraq war. He was elected president in 1981 following the assassination of Mohammad Ali Rajai, another attack blamed on the MEK. During the 1980s, Khomeini’s most likely successor was seen as the senior cleric Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri, but the revolutionary leader changed his mind shortly before his death after Montazeri objected to the mass executions of MEK members and other dissidents. When Khomeini died and the Islamic republic’s top clerical body the Assembly of Experts, met, it was Khamenei whom they chose as leader. Khamenei famously initially rejected the nomination, putting his head in his hands in a show of despair and declaring, “I am opposed”. But the clerics stood in unison to seal his nomination and his grip on power has never slackened. Khamenei worked with six elected presidents, a far less powerful position than supreme leader, including more moderate figures, such as Mohammad Khatami, who were allowed to make stabs at cautious reform and rapprochement with the West. But in the end, Khamenei always came down on the side of hardliners. He was believed to have six children although only one, Mojtaba, had public prominence. He was placed under sanctions by the United States in 2019 and is one of the most powerful backstage figures in Iran. A family dispute also caught attention: his sister Badri fell out with her family in the 1980s and fled to Iraq in the war to join her husband, a dissident cleric.",

      "summary_orig": "The Avrocar was the result of a Canadian effort to develop a supersonic, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) fighter-bomber in the early 1950s. However, its circular shape gave it the appearance of a “flying saucer” out of science fiction movies of the period. A.V. Roe (Avro) Aircraft Limited (later Avro Canada) based its design concept for the Avrocar on using the exhaust from turbojet engines to drive a circular “turborotor” which produced thrust. By directing this thrust downward, the turborotor would create a cushion of air (also known as “ground effect”) upon which the aircraft would float at low altitude. When the thrust was directed toward the rear, the aircraft would accelerate and gain altitude. In 1952, the Canadian government provided initial funding but dropped the project when it became too expensive. Avro offered the project to the U.S. government, and the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force took it over in 1958. Each service had different requirements: the Army wanted to use it as a subsonic, all-terrain troop transport and reconnaissance craft, but the USAF wanted a VTOL aircraft that could hover below enemy radar then zoom up to supersonic speed. Avro’s designers believed they could satisfy both services, but these two sets of requirements differed too much. Research data originally indicated that a circular wing might satisfy both the Army’s and Air Force’s requirements, and Avro built two small test vehicles to prove the concept. Designated the VZ-9AV Avrocar (“VZ” stood for “experimental vertical flight,” “9” for the ninth concept proposal, and “AV” for Avro). Tests with scale models at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, indicated that the cushion of air under the Avrocar would become unstable just a few feet off the ground. The aircraft would be incapable of reaching supersonic speeds, but the testing went ahead to determine if a suitable aircraft could be developed for the Army. The first prototype -- the Avrocar on display (serial number 58-7055) -- was sent to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif. There, wind tunnel tests proved that the aircraft had insufficient control for high speed flight and was aerodynamically unstable. The second Avrocar prototype underwent flight tests that validated the wind tunnel tests. If it flew more than three feet above the ground, the Avrocar displayed uncontrollable pitch and roll motions, which the Avro engineers called \"hubcapping.\" The Avrocar could only reach a maximum speed of 35 mph, and all attempts to end the hubcapping failed. The project was cancelled in December 1961. The second prototype aircraft went to the U.S. Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis, Va., and the first prototype Avrocar came to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in 2007.

      "summary_orig": "The United States and Israel launched strikes on Iran on Saturday, targeting its leadership and plunging the Middle East into a new conflict that President Donald Trump said would end a security threat and give Iranians a chance to topple their rulers. The strikes put nearby oil-producing Gulf Arab countries on edge as fears of escalation grew, and Tehran responded by launching missiles towards Israel. Here’s how the conflict could play out across world markets. Oil spike Oil is the main barometer of Middle East tension. Iran is a major producer and lies opposite the oil-rich Arabian Peninsula across the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20 per cent of global oil supply passes. Conflict could limit oil entering the global market and push up prices. Brent crude traded on Friday around $73 a barrel, already up by a fifth this year. Some oil majors and top trading houses suspended crude oil and fuel shipments via the Strait of Hormuz because of the attacks, four trading sources said on Saturday. William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that even if the conflict was contained, Brent might rise to about $80, which was the peak during the 12-day war in Iran last June . A prolonged conflict affecting supply could cause oil prices to jump to around $100, potentially adding 0.6-0.7 percentage points to global inflation, he said in a note. Wild swings, everywhere The conflict is likely to exacerbate volatility across global markets, which have already swung wildly this year owing to Trump’s tariffs and a sharp tech selloff. The VIX volatility index has risen by a third this year, and implied US bond volatility is up 15 per cent. Currency markets are unlikely to be immune, analysts say. The dollar index fell by around 1pc during the June war, CBA notes. But that fall was short-lived and unwound after three or four days. “In current circumstances, the size of the fall will depend on how large and how long-lasting the conflict is expected to be,” CBA analysts said in a note a week ago. “If the conflict was long-lasting and disrupted oil supplies, we expect the US dollar would lift against most currencies except the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The US is a net energy exporter and so benefits from higher oil and gas prices that would result from a disrupted oil supply.” Israel’s shekel will almost certainly be another mover — Iran quickly retaliated against Israel on Saturday. It dropped 5pc at the start of the June war and also reacted after Israel struck Iran’s Damascus consulate in April 2024 and when Iran launched missiles at Israel that October. All episodes were short-lived and followed by quick shekel rebounds. However, JPMorgan said it could be different this time if the conflict and a rise in market risk premia proved more persistent. “This would especially be the case if confrontation with Iran also triggers more intensive operations against Iran’s proxies,” the Wall Street bank said. Safe havens do their thing The Swiss franc, widely regarded as a safe haven in times of turmoil, is expected to face further upward pressure, creating a headache for the Swiss National Bank. It is up 3pc this year against the US dollar. Investors could also make another dash for gold, which has had a record run and is up 22pc so far in 2026, and into silver, which has also been on a roll. The conflict could also add to demand for US Treasuries, whose yields have been falling in the past few weeks. The outlier has been Bitcoin, no longer seen as a haven. It fell 2pc on Saturday and has shed more than a quarter of its value in two months. Watch Middle East markets Trading in bourses in the Middle East on Sunday, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, will provide an initial indicator of investor sentiment. While these markets are highly correlated to oil prices, an escalating conflict could ripple through the economies. “I suspect markets will be down if these hostilities continue through the day,” said Ryan Lemand, chief executive officer and co-founder of Neovision Wealth Management. Depending on the scale of the conflict, Gulf equities could drop by 3-5pc, he said. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index dropped 1.3pc in five days through Thursday, its second consecutive week of declines. Dubai’s main market, which reopens on Monday, fell in the last two weeks. Airline and defence stocks Global airlines cancelled flights across the Middle East on Saturday, and their stocks could be under pressure if the conflict spreads and forces more airspace closures. European weapons makers, up 10pc this year, could see more demand.",

While these markets are highly correlated to oil prices, an escalating conflict could ripple through the economies. “I suspect markets will be down if these hostilities continue through the day,” said Ryan Lemand, chief executive officer and co-founder of Neovision Wealth Management. Depending on the scale of the conflict, Gulf equities could drop by 3-5pc, he said. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index dropped 1.3pc in five days through Thursday, its second consecutive week of declines. Dubai’s main market, which reopens on Monday, fell in the last two weeks. Airline and defence stocks Global airlines cancelled flights across the Middle East on Saturday, and their stocks could be under pressure if the conflict spreads and forces more airspace closures. European weapons makers, up 10pc this year, could see more demand.",

The US president announced the death of the ayatollah, who has ruled Iran as supreme leader since 1989, in a post on Truth Social. “Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead,” Trump wrote. The death of Iran’s supreme leader was announced after waves of air attacks across the country. Iran’s Red Crescent reported more than 200 deaths and 747 injuries in daylong attacks across 24 provinces. At least 100 people were reportedly killed in a strike on a primary school in Minab, in the south-east. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had earlier said there were “many signs” Khamenei was “no longer alive”, and Israeli officials briefed media that his body had been recovered. Tehran fired retaliatory strikes against Israeli and US bases across the Middle East. Iran’s attacks targeted more than six countries, pulling in places that had been previously untouched by the escalating crisis. In Israel, one person died and 22 others are injured, media reports say, after an Iranian missile strike hit a building in Tel Aviv. An official said the building was aflame and had partially collapsed. In Dubai, a number of people were injured after an incident occurred at Dubai international airport, the Dubai media office has said. The Burj Al Arab and Fairmont hotels caught fire amid Iranian attacks. The United Arab Emirates said in a statement that it had intercepted the vast majority of the 137 missiles and 209 drones fired at its territory by Iran in the hours after the US and Israel launched a regime change war on the Islamic Republic. In Bahrain, an Iranian drone flew into a high-rise building in what looked like a targeted attack, exploding and engulfing the skyscraper in flames. Earlier, the country’s national security agency was also struck by an Iranian missile. Social media footage also appeared to show a missile hitting the huge US naval base in Bahrain. In Kuwait, a drone crashed into the country’s main airport, wounding several employees and damaging the facility. In Lebanon , gas stations across the country had lines 10 cars deep within an hour of the strikes. People in Beirut airport watched as commercial flights were cancelled, and grocery stores were filled with the more cautious stocking up on essential goods – the memory of the 2024 war with Israel fresh in their minds. At least one person was killed and seven wounded during an “incident” at Abu Dhabi’s Zayed international airport, officials said after Iranian strikes targeting the United Arab Emirates and Gulf states.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, police on Saturday issued a public safety advisory which stated that Karachi had been placed on “high alert”. The advisory issued by the office of the Karachi additional inspector general of police, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said, “Karachi has been placed on high alert following increased military tensions between Pakistan and Afghan Taliban forces near the Pak-Afghan border.” “Police and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) have strengthened surveillance and tightened security at key entry-exit points, transportation hubs, sensitive and important places to pre-empt potential security threats,” it said. In the safety guidelines for residents and visitors, the Karachi police urged them to stay vigilant and alert to announcements from local police, law enforcement and provincial officials. The advisory urged the citizens to report suspicious activity and immediately notify local police or emergency services if they observe unusual movements, unattended packages, unfamiliar persons loitering in sensitive areas, illegal foreigners or any other suspicious activity. It also urged citizens to follow the directions of security personnel and comply promptly with instructions from police checkpoints or clearance operations. Further, it urged citizens to verify information and to avoid spreading unverified rumours or “panic content” on social media. The advisory pointed out to a recent fake threat alert on social media related to a few shopping centres and commercial areas that caused “fear and panic” in public. It advised the citizens to “rely on official statements from Sindh Police, local administration, or government press briefings”. Further, air travellers were advised to leave their homes for the airport at least one hour earlier than usual due to enhanced screening, stop-and-search measures and increased security around airport and key points. It stated that only one visitor or attendant should accompany one passenger to the designated drop off or pick-up point to avoid crowding at the airport. Citizens were also told to carry their computerised national identity cards (CNICs) with them at all times, as they may be required for verification at various checkpoints. “National security forces and law enforcement agencies are fully prepared to respond to threats and protect citizens. All measures are designed to maintain peace, stability, and public safety,” the advisory concluded.",

      "summary_orig": "Multiple videos have been circulating on social media platform X since February 27, claiming to show Afghan BM-21 rocket strikes, launched from the Alishero border district, targeting Pakistani military installations. However, the videos are unrelated to the current situation and are old. Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban, after the neighbouring country opened fire on multiple locations across the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on late Thursday. Authorities in Kabul had called it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend. On Feb 27, a pro-Indian account on X shared a video of buildings set on fire. “Afghan BM-21 rocket strikes have begun from areas of Alishero district targeting Pakistani military installations across the so-called (imaginary) border… look what’s happened,” reads the caption. The post gained 100,800 views. Another pro-Indian account shared the same video with the caption: “Reports of BM 21 rocket strikes from Afghanistan’s Alishero district targeting Pakistani military installations.” That post garnered 11,100 views. The clip with similar captions was shared by several other pro-Indian and pro-Afghan accounts, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . A separate video, showing rockets being launched in the darkness of the night, was shared by pro-Afghan accounts with similar claims. One such user posted the clip with the caption: “Breaking BM-21 rocket strikes have begun from areas of Alishero district targeting Pakistani military installations across the so-called (imaginary) border.” The post gained 22,400 views. This video was further amplified by multiple pro-Afghan and pro-Indian accounts on X, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the ongoing conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan. A keyword search was conducted to verify whether any credible Pakistani or international media outlets had reported Afghan rocket strikes targeting Pakistani military installations, but it did not yield any results. A reverse image search of the first viral video yielded Facebook posts and Egyptian news coverage. It was shared on Facebook by a user two weeks before the Pakistan-Afghanistan conflict broke out, with the caption, “Muslim extremists set fire to a Coptic Christian neighbourhood in the Egyptian capital Cairo”. Another Facebook page, namely Global Disaster News, also shared the clip on Jan 29 with a similar context. “Emergency teams respond to a large fire burning structures in the Mokattam area southeast of Cairo, Egypt; eyewitness video shows at least one person on top of a building. - factual,” the caption reads. This indicates that the video predates the current Pakistan-Afghanistan tensions and is unrelated to any cross-border rocket strikes. A pro-Christian Instagram account also posted the same video on February 8, 2026, describing a fire in “Garbage City,” a Christian area in Cairo, stating that 21 houses were destroyed and two children died. The post received 1,300 likes. An English-language Egyptian news outlet, Egypt Today , published a report on Jan 29 titled “Cairo fire brought under control; firefighting drone deployed”. The report stated that a fire broke out in several homes in Mansheyat Nasser in western Cairo and was later contained by Civil Defence forces. No fatalities were reported at the time, though several people were treated for smoke inhalation. Another Egyptian news portal, Gomhuria Online , published a report the same day titled “Fire in 3 houses in Manshiyat Nasser brought under control with no injuries”. Separately, a reverse image search of the second viral video, allegedly showing the BM-21 rocket launch, yielded a YouTube video dated August 29, 2018, titled “M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)”. The description states: “5thBN3rdFAR conducts a night live fire exercise with the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) in support of their Battery External Evaluations.” The video had 42,142 views, indicating it is years old and unrelated to current events. One video shows a residential fire in Cairo, Egypt, from January 2026, while another depicts a 2018 HIMARS live-fire exercise. Neither video is related to the current situation between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Therefore, the claim that viral videos show Afghan BM-21 rocket strikes on Pakistani military installations is false.

      "title_orig": "Trump directs US agencies to toss Anthropic’s AI as Pentagon calls startup a supply risk",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said on Friday he is directing the government to stop work with Anthropic, and the Pentagon said it would declare the start-up a supply-chain risk, dealing a major blow to the artificial intelligence lab after a showdown about technology guardrails. Trump added there would be a six-month phase-out for the Defence Department and other agencies that use the company’s products. If Anthropic does not help with the transition, Trump said, he would use “the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow”. The actions mark an extraordinary rebuke by the United States against one of the premier companies that has kept it in the lead on national security-critical AI, threatening to give Anthropic a pariah status that Washington until now had reserved for enemy suppliers. Google and Amazon are among Anthropic’s financial backers. The moves further set a precedent that US law alone would constrain how AI is deployed on the battlefield, with the Pentagon seeking to preserve all flexibility in defence and not be limited by warnings from the technology’s creators against powering weapons with unreliable AI. In a statement, Anthropic said it would challenge any risk designation in court by the Department of Defence, which the Trump administration has renamed the Department of War. “We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government,” the company said. “No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons.” Late on Friday, rival OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, Amazon and others, announced its own deal to deploy technology in the Defence Department’s classified network. CEO Sam Altman on X said the Pentagon shared its principles for human responsibility over weapon systems and for having no mass US surveillance. “We put them into our agreement,” Altman said of the points. “We also will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted.” It was not immediately clear whether these contractual details differed from the red lines proposed by Anthropic. The Pentagon and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ‘Nuclear War’ Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said Anthropic would be designated a supply-chain risk, following an impasse in months of talks on whether the company’s policies could constrain military action. Meeting with Hegseth this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei argued for weapons and surveillance limits and irked Pentagon officials. The Pentagon said US law, not a private company, would determine how to defend the country. The designation could bar tens of thousands of contractors from using Anthropic’s AI when working for the Pentagon. That represents an existential threat to its business with the government and could harm its private-sector relationships, said Franklin Turner, an attorney who specialises in government contracts. “Blacklisting Anthropic is the contractual equivalent of nuclear war,” he said. Similar US action was taken to remove Chinese tech giant Huawei from the Pentagon’s supply chains. Starting in 2017, the US restricted Defence Department use of Huawei equipment, prohibited federal agencies from purchasing its technology, and halted federal grant and loan funds for Huawei equipment. Anthropic has raced to win fierce competition to sell novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of a widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision. Saif Khan, who served in the National Security Council in former President Joe Biden’s White House, said the Defence Department’s action “may be the most draconian domestic AI regulation any government has ever issued.” “The Department is arguably treating Anthropic as a greater national security threat than any Chinese AI companies, none of whom they’ve designated supply-chain risks,” Khan said. ‘Killer Robots’ Tech companies and the Pentagon have repeatedly locked horns since at least 2018, when employees at Google protested against the Pentagon’s use of its AI to analyse drone footage. A rapprochement ensued with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jousting for defence business, while several big-tech CEOs pledged co-operation last year with the Trump administration. But theoretical “killer robots” have worried human-rights and technology activists as wars in Ukraine and Gaza showcased increasingly automated systems. Bolder US military action in the past year has added to these concerns, said Jack Shanahan, who had directed the Pentagon’s algorithmic warfare effort Project Maven. “People might be a little bit more nervous about no restrictions,” Shanahan said. The White House’s legal sign-off could be “top cover for anybody that does anything that would potentially result in lack of due process, civilian casualties, collateral damage.” The Pentagon signed agreements worth up to $200 million each with major AI labs in the past year, including Anthropic, OpenAI and Google. Anthropic, negotiating for awards under that ceiling, had flagged concerns about the legal system’s ability to keep up with AI progress. At present, for instance, US laws do not prevent the use of technology to compile seemingly innocuous data to reveal information about people’s private lives, its CEO Amodei has said. Anthropic’s AI has been in use across the intelligence community and armed services, and it was first among peer AI companies to work with classified information, through a supply deal via cloud provider Amazon.",

Justice Muhammad Asif took up the matter amid a request from the state to transfer the appeal to another bench. During the proceedings, the assistant attorney general submitted that a case of similar nature had earlier been heard by Justice Azam Khan and reques­ted that the present appeal also be placed before his court. He argued that it would be appropriate for the same bench to hear related matters. Rights activists granted bail by anti-terrorism court in two other cases However, the counsel for the appellants, Advocate Riasat Ali Azad, opposed the request, maintaining that no such case was pending before any other court of the country. He pointed out that the present appeal had been heard by Jus­tice Muhammad Asif since its inception and questioned how the government could raise objections to the bench at this stage. Expressing full confidence in the court, Mr Azad urged the ju­­dge to fix the matter for hearing before Eid, saying an early date would bring relief to his clients. Justice Asif asked the state to clarify which case was pending before Justice Azam Khan. Observers present in the courtroom noted that while other cases involving the accused might be pending elsewhere, the instant appeal had consistently remained before the same bench. The judge later rose and proceeded to his chambers after re­­marking, “Let’s see,” in response to the request for an early date. The state counsel informed the court that it had no objection if a date was fixed. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned without immediate scheduling of the suspension pleas. Bail granted In a separate development, Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Abul Hasanat Muhammad Zulqarnain granted bail to Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha in two other cases. The bail was allowed against surety bonds of Rs5,000 each in cases related to an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court and a protest outside the National Press Club. In the case concerning the al­­leged altercation outside the high court, an affidavit submitted by the complainant and Islamabad High Court Bar Association president Syed Wajid Ali Gillani was made part of the record. However, in the controversial tweets case — in which both rights activists have been convicted — bail has yet to be granted. Owing to the absence of relief in that matter, their release remains subject to the outcome of the pending suspension of sentence applications before the high court.

      "summary_orig": "• Israel’s Supreme Court freezes ban on foreign aid organisations in enclave • US public sympathy shifts to Palestinians over Israel, new Gallup poll reveals CAIRO: Relentless Israeli attacks killed at least seven Palestinians in Gaza on Friday, medics said, adding to a death toll of at least 600 people killed by Israeli fire since a US-brokered ceasefire agreement came into effect last October. Gaza’s health officials reported that in southern Gaza, five people were killed and several others were injured, some critically, in Israeli drone strikes. The strikes targeted two police checkpoints in Khan Yunis and in the Abu Hujair area northwest of the Bureij refugee camp later in the day, medics said. Separately, an Israeli airstrike against a group of Palestinians in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood in northern Gaza killed two people and wounded several others. Ban on NGOs frozen Meanwhile, Israel’s Supreme Court decided in a ruling published on Friday to freeze a government ban on 37 foreign NGOs working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank pending a final decision. “Without taking any position, a temporary interim order is hereby issued,” the court said in a ruling responding to a petition from more than a dozen NGOs, seeking to reverse the ban after Israel’s government revoked their status in Israel. The decision theoretically allows the NGOs to work in Gaza and the West Bank until a final ruling, but aid groups are unsure about the freeze’s implementation. Organisations like MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and CARE were informed on Dec 30, 2025, that their Israeli registrations expired and they had 60 days to renew them by providing Palestinian staff lists. If they failed to do so, they would have to cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, from March 1. The NGOs, through AIDA, petitioned the Supreme Court after losing their charity registration in Israel, following a year-long refusal to disclose their Palestinian employees to Israeli authorities. The court said in its ruling that there existed a “genuine legal dispute” due to the foreign NGOs’ responsibilities to their employees’ privacy under European law. “We are still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate”, Athena Rayburn, AIDA director, told AFP, calling it “a step in the right direction”. Sympathy shifts to Palestinians Separately, a fresh Gallup poll shows that for the first time, Americans sympathise more with Palestinians than with Israelis in their decades-long conflict. The poll, released on Friday, found that 41 per cent of Americans sympathise more with the Palestinians and 36pc sided with Israel, a sharp reversal from just a year ago when Israel led in sympathies 46 to 33pc. For the first time in over two decades, Israel is not leading in Gallup’s poll, though the gap is not significant. Partisan views on the Middle East show more independents shifting towards Palestinians, with an 11-point preference over Israel in the past year. Democrats overwhelmingly support Palestinians, with 65pc sympathising with them versus 17pc for Israel. Democrats blame ex-president Joe Biden for insufficient action to curb Israel’s offensive in Gaza after October 7,2023, escalation. Gallup surveyed 1,001 US adults by telephone from February 2 to 16.

      "summary_orig": "• Qatar, Saudi Arabia lead diplomatic scramble; Iran offers to facilitate talks • Trump ‘refuses’ to intervene because of ‘fondness’ for Pakistan • UN, China, Russia, UK call for immediate ceasefire ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers said on Friday they were willing to negotiate after Pakistan unleashed air strikes on major Afghan cities, killing dozens in the most serious clashes between the allies-turned-foes, which Defence Minister Khawaja Asif described as an “open war”. The Afghan Taliban, who claimed to have launched “retaliatory attacks” over strikes against terrorists’ hideouts last weekend, said on Friday that they were “ready for dialogue”. “Afghanistan… has always preferred to reso­lve issues based on mutual understanding and respect,” the Afghan foreign ministry quoted Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi as telling Qatar’s junior Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khalifi by telephone. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid echoed that sentiment, saying “now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue”. Key regional powers are also quickly mobilising to prevent the conflict from spiralling. Iran, which borders both nations, offered to mediate. “The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue and to enhance understanding and cooperation between the two countries,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X. Saudi Arabia and Qatar were also engaged in a diplomatic drive to halt the hostilities, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP. “Saudi Arabia, in coordination with Qatar, is making efforts to reduce tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the source said, adding the goal is to “de-escalate the situation and prevent it from spiralling out of control”. Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, in a phone call with his Afghan counterpart Muttaqi, expressed concern over the recent situation. Meanwhile, during a phone call with Paki­stan’s Ishaq Dar, the Saudi foreign minister agreed to stay closely engaged. Similarly, Turkish Fore­ign Minister Hakan Fidan held separate calls with his counterparts from Paki­stan, Afghanistan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia to discuss the conflict, a Turkish diplomatic source said. From Moscow to Beijing, international powers also issued urgent calls for de-escalation. China, a neighbour and major investor in the region, expressed deep concern over the violence. “China supports combating all forms of terrorism and calls on both parties to remain calm and exercise restraint, properly resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation, achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, and avoid further loss of life,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. She confirmed that China was mediating through its own channels and had requested both sides ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and projects. Moscow urged an immediate halt to the attacks and a return to diplomacy. Russia, which is the only country to officially recognise the Taliban government and also maintains good relations with Pakistan, said the clashes were a dangerous development. “We call on our friends Afghanistan and Pakistan to abandon this dangerous confrontation and return to the negotiating table to resolve all differences through political and diplomatic means,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram.

      "summary_en": "• Qatar, Saudi Arabia lead diplomatic scramble; Iran offers to facilitate talks • Trump ‘refuses’ to intervene because of ‘fondness’ for Pakistan • UN, China, Russia, UK call for immediate ceasefire ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers said on Friday they were willing to negotiate after Pakistan unleashed air strikes on major Afghan cities, killing dozens in the most serious clashes between the allies-turned-foes, which Defence Minister Khawaja Asif described as an “open war”. The Afghan Taliban, who claimed to have launched “retaliatory attacks” over strikes against terrorists’ hideouts last weekend, said on Friday that they were “ready for dialogue”. “Afghanistan… has always preferred to reso­lve issues based on mutual understanding and respect,” the Afghan foreign ministry quoted Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi as telling Qatar’s junior Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khalifi by telephone. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid echoed that sentiment, saying “now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue”. Key regional powers are also quickly mobilising to prevent the conflict from spiralling. Iran, which borders both nations, offered to mediate. “The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue and to enhance understanding and cooperation between the two countries,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X. Saudi Arabia and Qatar were also engaged in a diplomatic drive to halt the hostilities, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP. “Saudi Arabia, in coordination with Qatar, is making efforts to reduce tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the source said, adding the goal is to “de-escalate the situation and prevent it from spiralling out of control”. Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, in a phone call with his Afghan counterpart Muttaqi, expressed concern over the recent situation. Meanwhile, during a phone call with Paki­stan’s Ishaq Dar, the Saudi foreign minister agreed to stay closely engaged. Similarly, Turkish Fore­ign Minister Hakan Fidan held separate calls with his counterparts from Paki­stan, Afghanistan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia to discuss the conflict, a Turkish diplomatic source said. From Moscow to Beijing, international powers also issued urgent calls for de-escalation. China, a neighbour and major investor in the region, expressed deep concern over the violence. “China supports combating all forms of terrorism and calls on both parties to remain calm and exercise restraint, properly resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation, achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, and avoid further loss of life,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. She confirmed that China was mediating through its own channels and had requested both sides ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and projects. Moscow urged an immediate halt to the attacks and a return to diplomacy. Russia, which is the only country to officially recognise the Taliban government and also maintains good relations with Pakistan, said the clashes were a dangerous development. “We call on our friends Afghanistan and Pakistan to abandon this dangerous confrontation and return to the negotiating table to resolve all differences through political and diplomatic means,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that Moscow was “closely monitoring this situation.” From Europe, Britain expressed grave concern. “We are deeply concerned by the significant escalation in tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan,” UK Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said on X. “We urge both sides to take immediate steps toward de-escalation, avoid further harm to civilians, and re-engage in mediated dialogue.” Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, known for his enthusiasm in mediating conflicts and a strong desire for a Nobel Peace Prize, offered a stance that diverged from his usual eagerness to resolve disputes.
