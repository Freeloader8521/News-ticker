      "summary_orig": "Pakistan put up a fast-bowling masterclass as South Africa were bundled out for a paltry 110 after they were put into bat in the second Twenty20 International at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Friday. Faheem Ashraf took 4-23 while Salman Mirza — replacing Shaheen Shah Afridi in the Pakistan XI — returned figures of 3-14 and Naseem Shah chipped in with 2-28. South Africa’s best batting display came from Dewald Brevis, but the right-hander’s burst was too short to lead the visitors to a competitive total. They reeled at 31-4 by the end of the powerplay as Salman rattled their top-order with immaculate line and length and subtle movement. The left-armer struck as early as on the second ball of the match, bamboozling South African opener Reeza Hendricks — who hit a match-winning half century in the first match — with an in-swinger that crashed into the stumps. Naseem pushed the Proteas deeper into trouble, deceiving Quinton de Kock with a slower one, which the right-hander holed to Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha at mid-off. Salman then returned to get Tony de Zorzi caught at deep fine before castling Matthew Breetzke with a stunning off-cutter. The incoming Brevis, one of the most promising prospects in global T20 cricket, went after the Pakistan bowlers to bring back South Africa in the game, dispatching spinners Mohammad Nawaz and Abrar Ahmed and medium-pacer Faheem  for handsome sixes, but was undone by a shorter ball by Faheem to depart with 25 off 16 against his name. Faheem then returned to make South African captain Donovan Ferreira drag the ball on to his stumps just at the halfway stage, to leave the visitors at 66-6. The right-armer returned to send back George Linde in the same manner two overs later. South Africa’s struggles only kept on increasing, with Naseem producing a caught-behind dismissal of Corbin Bosch in the 14th over. Abrar Ahmed got himself in the wickets column, thanks to a carrom ball that clipped Nandre Burger’s off-stump before Faheem came back to be gifted a fourth and South Africa’s last wicket on the second ball of the 20th over. Pakistan are looking to stage a comeback after getting a 55-run thrashing in the opening game of the three-match series to level it and keep it alive. The hosts have made on change, bringing in Salman in place of spearhead Shaheen. Meanwhile, for South Africa, pacer Ottneil Baartman has come in for Lizaad Williams. The visitors, meanwhile, will be aiming to seal the series. Pakistan will be desperate for their batting to click after being bowled out for 139 while chasing 195 in the first match. Pakistan’s batting line-up — featuring Babar Azam, Salman Ali Agha, Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, Hasan Nawaz and Usman Khan — failed to live up to expectations, with no player able to play a substantial innings in recent outing. The bowling department too did not impress at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, with Shaheen (1-45), Naseem (1-34) and Abrar 1-42) all proving expensive. All-rounders Nawaz (3-26 and 36 runs) and Saim (2-31 and 37 runs) were the only bright spots in an otherwise dismal performance. Pakistan will be banking on former captain Babar to rediscover his form after being dismissed for a duck in his first T20I appearance in nearly 10 months. Babar, with 4,223 runs in 129 matches at an average of 39.46 and a strike-rate of 129.14, remains Pakistan’s most seasoned batter in the format. Among others, only Hasan (strike-rate 156.94) and Saim (134) have maintained better scoring rates, while Salman’s average of 22.52 and lack of a fifty in his last 13 innings continue to raise concerns. Teams: South Africa: Reeza Hendricks, Quinton de Kock (wicket-keeper), Tony de Zorzi, Dewald Brevis, Matthew Breetzke, Donovan Ferreira (captain), George Linde, Corbin Bosch, Nandre Burger, Ottneil Baartman, Lungi Ngidi Pakistan: Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, Babar Azam, Salman Ali Agha (captain), Usman Khan(wicket-keeper), Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Naseem Shah, Salman Mirza, Abrar Ahmed",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday rubbished and strongly condemned the contentious remarks made by government spokesperson Danyal Chaudhry regarding the role of Pakistani troops in the Gaza peace force, which also included the disarming of Hamas. Addressing the remarks by the federal parliamentary secretary for information and broadcasting in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’, the defence minister said: “I will say God forbid on all these three remarks; what kind of statement has he given. Nothing from this is our target or suits us.” In an interview on Tuesday on Ary News show ‘11th Hour’, Chaudhry had said regarding the mandate of the Gaza peace force: “Pakistan and the other countries that will be chosen will make sure there is no extremism or violence … or that there is no cross-border attack. Pakistan will enforce that.” Chaudhry also said that the security of any Pakistani soldier deputed for duty in the force would be the utmost priority. “We will fulfil our duty and protect Muslim brothers and make sure there are no cross-border violations or terrorism.” Questioned if the mandate would also include the disarmament of Hamas, Chaudhry had said: “Yes absolutely, if [Hamas] will be disarmed, only then the other force will be able to carry on. Things will only move forward after disarmament.” A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. According to officials close to the discussions, an announcement is expected soon from the federal government regarding the decision. Addressing the matter while slamming Chaudhry’s remarks, Asif said Pakistan would follow whatever collective decision is taken for the force. He also questioned on whose behalf the federal parliamentary secretary was speaking in terms of enforcing peace. “I have no information about this. I am frankly speaking that if we are saying such things on a personal level on any TV [channel] then it is inappropriate.” Questioned if the role of the force was really as per Chaudhry’s remarks, Asif said: “I won’t be in favour then. There has been no discussion like this.” He agreed when asked that the inclusion of any Pakistani troops in such a force in the face of continued Israeli bombing would cause a complicated situation. Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, have said discussions within the government and military establishment are at an “advanced stage”. According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission. The ISF’s mandate would include maintaining internal security, disarming Hamas, securing border crossings, and assisting with humanitarian relief and reconstruction under the supervision of a transitional Palestinian authority. Officials in Islamabad argue that Pakistan’s potential participation stems from both moral responsibility and diplomatic necessity. They noted that Pakistan was part of the original eight-country peace proposal conceived in late 2024, and backed by several Muslim-majority states, that formed the basis of the US-brokered Gaza peace plan finalised earlier this month. Since the ISF was a key pillar of that plan, officials said, Pakistan’s participation would signal consistency and credibility. Another argument giv­en by the government circles supporting Pakistan’s inclusion in the ISF is its strong track record in int­ernational peacekeeping. Pakistan is one of the largest troop contributors to United Nations peace missions, having deployed more than 200,000 personnel to over 40 operations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Officials contend that this experience not only equips Pakistani forces to manage volatile post-conflict environments but also lends credibility and legitimacy to the ISF. Beyond moral and operational grounds, foreign policy imperatives also underpin the government’s case for participation. Officials argue that joining the Gaza stabilisation force could strengthen Pakistan’s relations with the United States. Islamabad’s ties with Washington have been on a gradual mend since Trump’s return to the White House, following years of friction over Afghanistan and counter-terrorism. Participating in a US-supported multilateral initiative, they said, could further this thaw and open avenues for economic cooperation, defence support and regional influence. However, officials cautioned that there is still no clarity on the legal framework for the deployment. “Ideally, we would like this deployment to take place under a UN mandate,” an official said. Still, such a deployment would not be without risk. Gaza remains highly volatile, and domestic opinion in Pakistan presents an additional challenge. Many Pakistanis, deeply sympathetic to the Pales­tinian cause, may perceive participation in a US-desi­gned stabilisation mission as serving Israeli interests or even as a betrayal of Palestinian resistance. “It’s a difficult but defining choice,” said another official. Asif had said on Tuesday that a decision on sending Pakistani troops for the Gaza peace force was still being finalised and “it is in process”.",

      "title_orig": "Taliban acknowledged presence of TTP, other terror groups in Afghanistan: FO spokesperson",
      "summary_orig": "Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi on Friday said that the Afghan Taliban government in Kabul had acknowledged the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other terrorist organisations in its territory. The talks were scheduled as Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to continue a ceasefire between the two countries and following a rapid deterioration of ties and a brief conflict along their shared border earlier this month. The agreement capped five days of a second round of tense negotiations — with the first one held in Doha on October 18 and 19 — in Istanbul mediated by Turkiye and Qatar. The round, which had begun on Saturday, had reached a point of near-collapse on Wednesday, with Islamabad saying that its long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Afghanistan remained a major point of contention. But a breakthrough in the stalemate came after Turkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week. Fielding questions after delivering a weekly press briefing, the spokesperson said: “The Afghan Taliban government has acknowledged the presence of TTP and other terrorist organisations. “Afghan authorities have given various justifications for not taking action against these organisations,” he added. “The presence of terrorist elements on Afghan soil reinforces Pakistan’s security concerns.” In response to a question, Andrabi said that Pakistan has been in constant contact with the Afghan Taliban over the past four years, noting that Islamabad took a “cautiously optimistic” approach to negotiations with Kabul. “[We are] not extremely optimistic, but maintaining optimism in diplomacy is a professional requirement,” he explained. “Optimism is an integral part of our diplomatic process.” When asked about opening the Torkham border crossing — a major border crossing between the Pakistani city of Torkham and Afghanistan — the spokesperson said he had “no information on the matter” and referred the question to the interior ministry. “Contact is being maintained with Pakistani residents, traders and businesspeople in Afghanistan,” he said. “Traders have the option to return through direct flights [and] work is underway to determine the number of people who wish to return.” Andrabi noted that the border will remain closed until further notice. During the briefing, he said that Pakistan hoped for a “positive outcome” of the next round of talks with the Afghan Taliban set to begin on November 6. “Pakistan will continue to remain engaged in the mediation process and hopes for a positive outcome for the November 6 talks,” he said during a weekly FO briefing. Andrabi recalled during the briefing that the second round of talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban regime in the presence of mediators concluded in Istanbul yesterday evening. “Pakistan participated in the Istanbul talks, which started on October 25, in a good spirit and with a positive intention,” he added. The FO spokesperson said the talks were initially scheduled for two days. “However, in an effort to reach an amicable agreement with the Taliban regime, the Pakistan side, in earnest, continued the talks for four days. “Pakistan positively engaged with the Taliban regime without compromising on its clearly stated position that Afghanistan soil should not be used for terrorism against Pakistan.” He asserted that Pakistan did not seek further escalation of hostilities but “expects the Afghan Taliban regime to honour its commitment to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking concrete and verifiable actions against terrorist entities, including Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan ”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term designated by the state for the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, and Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term that the state uses for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Andrabi said that Pakistan had been urging the Afghan Taliban for the past four years to take “decisive and effective measures” against terrorist outfits present on Afghanistan soil. “We repeatedly shared credible information about the presence of top leadership of Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan on Afghan soil with the Taliban regime. However, despite repeated assurances in the past, there has been a surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghanistan.” He said the “consistent and total disregard” of Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by the Afghan Taliban over the last four years and the “unprovoked aggression against Pakistan with the support of Fitna-al-Khawarij on Oct 11 and 12 and later Oct 14 and 15 led to violent exchanges across the international border”. “Pakistan decisively responded to Afghan provocation aimed at destabilising the border area, facilitating terrorism, and furthering the Fitna-al-Khawarij ’s nefarious designs”. Pakistan would respond resolutely if provocations continue in the future, he further warned. The FO spokesperson emphasised that Pakistan had always been desirous of a peaceful, stable and regionally integrated and prosperous Afghanistan, “which is at peace with itself and its neighbours”. “With the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August 2021, we expected the vision of regional peace and connectivity to be realised. “In the same spirit, despite our various security concerns, Pakistan took many initiatives this year to support and help Afghanistan and extended a number of concessions to Afghanistan, especially for Afghan transit trade”. He further highlighted that Islamabad had elevated its diplomatic representation with Afghanistan from charge d’affaires to the ambassador level and also agreed to expand the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project to Afghanistan. Andrabi recalled that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had visited Kabul thrice, including on July 17, to sign an agreement on the joint feasibility study of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project. He further stated that the “government and armed forces stand ready to take all possible measures to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty and ensure the safety and security of its people”. The FO spokesperson then went on to appreciate the “constructive role of brotherly countries of Qatar and Turkiye”. “They have been making their best efforts for an amicable and peaceful resolution of the issue,” he said. ‘Ceasefire can’t be effective until terrorism stops’ Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who had been particularly directing strong criticism towards Afghanistan since the beginning of border hostilities earlier this month, also confirmed while speaking to Geo News that an interim agreement had been reached between the two countries with the mediation of Turkiye and Qatar. “Another round of negotiations will be held on November 6,” he said. Asif asserted that Pakistan’s main demand continued to be the “stopping of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”. He added that “there is a ray of hope, but not because of Afghanistan and only so because of Qatar and Turkiye’s influence” over Kabul. The defence minister further said, “There have been some ceasefire violations from Afghanistan”, and also emphasised that “until terrorism stops, the ceasefire can not be effective.” Border skirmishes and talks Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week , the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Türkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. However, after Turkiye and Qatar’s efforts, the two sides to continue the ceasefire, set up a joint monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace along their shared border and penalise any violators.",

The FO spokesperson then went on to appreciate the “constructive role of brotherly countries of Qatar and Turkiye”. “They have been making their best efforts for an amicable and peaceful resolution of the issue,” he said. ‘Ceasefire can’t be effective until terrorism stops’ Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who had been particularly directing strong criticism towards Afghanistan since the beginning of border hostilities earlier this month, also confirmed while speaking to Geo News that an interim agreement had been reached between the two countries with the mediation of Turkiye and Qatar. “Another round of negotiations will be held on November 6,” he said. Asif asserted that Pakistan’s main demand continued to be the “stopping of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”. He added that “there is a ray of hope, but not because of Afghanistan and only so because of Qatar and Turkiye’s influence” over Kabul. The defence minister further said, “There have been some ceasefire violations from Afghanistan”, and also emphasised that “until terrorism stops, the ceasefire can not be effective.” Border skirmishes and talks Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week , the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Türkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. However, after Turkiye and Qatar’s efforts, the two sides to continue the ceasefire, set up a joint monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace along their shared border and penalise any violators.",
      "title": "Taliban acknowledged presence of TTP, other terror groups in Afghanistan: FO spokesperson",
      "summary": "Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi on Friday said that the Afghan Taliban government in Kabul had acknowledged the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other terrorist organisations in its territory. The talks were scheduled as Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to continue a ceasefire between the two countries and following a rapid deterioration of ties and a brief conflict along their shared border earlier this month. The agreement capped five days of a second round of tense negotiations — with the first one held in Doha on October 18 and 19 — in Istanbul mediated by Turkiye and Qatar. The round, which had begun on Saturday, had reached a point of near-collapse on Wednesday, with Islamabad saying that its long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Afghanistan remained a major point of contention. But a breakthrough in the stalemate came after Turkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week. Fielding questions after delivering a weekly press briefing, the spokesperson said: “The Afghan Taliban government has acknowledged the presence of TTP and other terrorist organisations. “Afghan authorities have given various justifications for not taking action against these organisations,” he added. “The presence of terrorist elements on Afghan soil reinforces Pakistan’s security concerns.” In response to a question, Andrabi said that Pakistan has been in constant contact with the Afghan Taliban over the past four years, noting that Islamabad took a “cautiously optimistic” approach to negotiations with Kabul. “[We are] not extremely optimistic, but maintaining optimism in diplomacy is a professional requirement,” he explained. “Optimism is an integral part of our diplomatic process.” When asked about opening the Torkham border crossing — a major border crossing between the Pakistani city of Torkham and Afghanistan — the spokesperson said he had “no information on the matter” and referred the question to the interior ministry. “Contact is being maintained with Pakistani residents, traders and businesspeople in Afghanistan,” he said. “Traders have the option to return through direct flights [and] work is underway to determine the number of people who wish to return.” Andrabi noted that the border will remain closed until further notice. During the briefing, he said that Pakistan hoped for a “positive outcome” of the next round of talks with the Afghan Taliban set to begin on November 6. “Pakistan will continue to remain engaged in the mediation process and hopes for a positive outcome for the November 6 talks,” he said during a weekly FO briefing. Andrabi recalled during the briefing that the second round of talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban regime in the presence of mediators concluded in Istanbul yesterday evening. “Pakistan participated in the Istanbul talks, which started on October 25, in a good spirit and with a positive intention,” he added. The FO spokesperson said the talks were initially scheduled for two days. “However, in an effort to reach an amicable agreement with the Taliban regime, the Pakistan side, in earnest, continued the talks for four days. “Pakistan positively engaged with the Taliban regime without compromising on its clearly stated position that Afghanistan soil should not be used for terrorism against Pakistan.” He asserted that Pakistan did not seek further escalation of hostilities but “expects the Afghan Taliban regime to honour its commitment to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking concrete and verifiable actions against terrorist entities, including Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan ”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term designated by the state for the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, and Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term that the state uses for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Andrabi said that Pakistan had been urging the Afghan Taliban for the past four years to take “decisive and effective measures” against terrorist outfits present on Afghanistan soil. “We repeatedly shared credible information about the presence of top leadership of Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan on Afghan soil with the Taliban regime. However, despite repeated assurances in the past, there has been a surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghanistan.” He said the “consistent and total disregard” of Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by the Afghan Taliban over the last four years and the “unprovoked aggression against Pakistan with the support of Fitna-al-Khawarij on Oct 11 and 12 and later Oct 14 and 15 led to violent exchanges across the international border”. “Pakistan decisively responded to Afghan provocation aimed at destabilising the border area, facilitating terrorism, and furthering the Fitna-al-Khawarij ’s nefarious designs”. Pakistan would respond resolutely if provocations continue in the future, he further warned. The FO spokesperson emphasised that Pakistan had always been desirous of a peaceful, stable and regionally integrated and prosperous Afghanistan, “which is at peace with itself and its neighbours”. “With the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August 2021, we expected the vision of regional peace and connectivity to be realised. “In the same spirit, despite our various security concerns, Pakistan took many initiatives this year to support and help Afghanistan and extended a number of concessions to Afghanistan, especially for Afghan transit trade”. He further highlighted that Islamabad had elevated its diplomatic representation with Afghanistan from charge d’affaires to the ambassador level and also agreed to expand the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project to Afghanistan. Andrabi recalled that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had visited Kabul thrice, including on July 17, to sign an agreement on the joint feasibility study of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project. He further stated that the “government and armed forces stand ready to take all possible measures to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty and ensure the safety and security of its people”.

      "summary_orig": "Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s (TLP) leadership cadre from South Punjab on Friday announced their disassociation from the proscribed religiopolitical party in the wake of the ban imposed on the group for violence and rioting. The interior ministry notified the ban on the TLP last week, saying that the federal government had “reasonable grounds” to believe the religiopolitical party was connected to terrorism. “The Pakistan Army is under threat from the East and the West,” said one leader. “TLP, the party which we were part of, gave calls for marches and protests because of which our state and army had to deal with an internal war along with foreign threats.” Referring to Pakistan’s brief but intense military escalation with India in May, he said calls for protest by TLP during that time also worked in the enemy’s favour. Elaborating further, he said the party is systematically benefiting the enemies of the country, which is why “we’ve decided to separate ourselves from TLP.” He added that terrorists from the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have also shown their support for the TLP in a video statement released earlier. The ban came a day after the federal cabinet approved a proposal to proscribe the group under the anti-terrorism act, days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad. The group currently only has a single seat in the Punjab Assembly, held by Mehmood Ahmad for PP-55 (Narowal-ii). The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on a proposal from the Punjab government. A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting said the ban was “unanimously” approved by the federal cabinet. The interior ministry briefed the cabinet on what it called the TLP’s “violent and terrorist activities”, stressing that the organisation had repeatedly incited unrest across the country. The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It was previously banned by the PTI government in 2021 after violent protests. The interior ministry informed the cabinet that the 2021 ban on TLP was lifted after six months on the assurance that it would refrain from violence. It added that the current ban on TLP stemmed from its reneging on those guarantees.",

      "summary_orig": "Fighters riding camels rounded up a couple of hundred men near the Sudanese city of al-Fasher at the weekend and brought them to a reservoir, shouting racial slurs before starting to shoot, according to a man who said he was among them. One of the captors recognised him from his school days and let him flee, the man, Alkheir Ismail, said in a video interview conducted by a local journalist known to Reuters in the nearby town of Tawila in the country’s western Darfur region. “He told them, ‘Don’t kill him,’” Ismail said. “Even after they killed everyone else — my friends and everyone else.” He said he had been bringing food to relatives still in the city when it was captured by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Sunday — and, like the other detainees, was unarmed. Reuters could not immediately verify his account due to the conflict but has verified earlier material obtained from the journalist. Alkheir Ismail, one of displaced Sudanese who gather and sit in makeshift tents after fleeing Al-Fasher city in Darfur, speaks, in Tawila, Sudan, October 29. — Reuters Ismail was one of four such witnesses and six aid workers interviewed by Reuters who also said people fleeing al-Fasher had been gathered in nearby villages and men separated from women and removed. In an earlier account, one of the witnesses said gunshots then rang out. Activists and analysts have long warned of revenge killings based on ethnicity by the RSF if they seized al-Fasher — the last stronghold of the Sudanese military in Darfur. The UN human rights office shared other accounts on Friday, estimating hundreds of civilians and unarmed fighters may have been executed. Such killings are considered war crimes. The RSF, whose victory in al-Fasher marks a milestone in Sudan’s two-and-a-half-year civil war, has denied such abuses — saying the accounts have been manufactured by its enemies and making counter-accusations against them. Displaced Sudanese gather after fleeing Al-Fasher city in Darfur, in Tawila, Sudan, October 29. — Reuters RSF says men removed for interrogation Reuters has verified at least three videos posted on social media showing men in RSF uniforms shooting unarmed captives and a dozen more showing clusters of bodies after apparent shootings. A high-level RSF commander called the accounts “media exaggeration” by the army and its allied fighters “to cover up for their defeat and loss of al-Fasher”. The RSF’s leadership had ordered investigations into any violations by RSF individuals and several had been arrested, he said, adding that the RSF had helped people leave the city and called on aid organisations to assist those who remained. He said soldiers and fighters pretending to be civilians had been taken away for interrogation. “There were no killings as has been claimed,” the commander told Reuters in response to a request for comment. Displaced Sudanese gather and sit in makeshift tents after fleeing Al-Fasher city in Darfur, in Tawila, Sudan, October 29. — Reuters The RSF’s capture of al-Fasher entrenches the geographical division of a country already reduced by the independence of South Sudan in 2011 after decades of civil war. In a speech on Wednesday night, RSF head Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo called on his fighters to protect civilians and said violations will be prosecuted. He appeared to acknowledge reports of detentions by ordering the release of detainees. Most of the fighters holding back the RSF advance in al-Fasher came from the Zaghawa ethnic group whose enmity with the largely Arab RSF fighters dates from the early 2000s, when, as the Janjaweed militias, they were accused of atrocities in Darfur. Alex de Waal, a genocide expert and specialist on Darfur, said the reported RSF acts in al-Fasher looked “very similar to what they did in Geneina and elsewhere”, referring to another Darfur city the RSF took during the latest war’s early stages as well as the early 2000s conflict. The US said the RSF had committed genocide in Geneina and the attack is under investigation by the International Criminal Court. The Sudanese army and others accuse the United Arab Emirates of supporting the RSF, charges the Gulf state denies. ‘We can’t say they are alive’ Mary Brace, a protection adviser at Nonviolent Peaceforce, an NGO working in Tawila, said those arriving “are women, children and older men generally”, adding that trucks organised by the RSF have taken some people from Garney to Tawila while others have been taken elsewhere. The RSF on Thursday posted a video it said showed the provision of food and medical aid to people displaced in Garney. Aid workers said the force may also be trying to keep people in towns it controls to attract foreign aid. Some 260,000 people were still in al-Fasher around the time of the attack, but only 62,000 have been counted elsewhere, and only several thousand of them in Tawila, which is controlled by a neutral force. In another of the testimonies obtained and verified by Reuters , Tahani Hassan, a former hospital cleaner, said she fled to Tawila early on Sunday after her brother-in-law and uncle were killed by stray bullets. On the way, she and her family were apprehended by three men in RSF uniforms who searched them, beat them and insulted them, she said. “They hit us hard. They threw our clothes on the ground. Even I, as a woman, was searched,” she said, adding that their food and water was also spilled on the ground. They eventually made it to Garney where the fighters separated women and children from the men, most of whom they did not see again, including her brother and brother-in-law. “We can’t say they are alive, because of how they treated us,” Hassan said. “If they don’t kill you, the hunger will kill you, the thirst will kill you.”",

One of the captors recognised him from his school days and let him flee, the man, Alkheir Ismail, said in a video interview conducted by a local journalist known to Reuters in the nearby town of Tawila in the country’s western Darfur region. “He told them, ‘Don’t kill him,’” Ismail said. “Even after they killed everyone else — my friends and everyone else.” He said he had been bringing food to relatives still in the city when it was captured by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Sunday — and, like the other detainees, was unarmed.

Activists and analysts have long warned of revenge killings based on ethnicity by the RSF if they seized al-Fasher — the last stronghold of the Sudanese military in Darfur.

      "summary_orig": "The Israeli military attacked the Gaza Strip for a fourth day on Friday, killing three people, Palestinian health authorities said, in another test of a fragile ceasefire agreement. Residents reported Israeli shelling and gunfire in northern Gaza on Friday, as Israel continued to bombard areas of the enclave despite saying that it remains committed to a ceasefire brokered by United States President Donald Trump. The Israeli military did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. Another Palestinian died of wounds sustained from previous Israeli shelling, the Palestinian WAFA news agency reported. The US-brokered ceasefire, which left thorny issues like the disarmament of Hamas and a timeline for Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip unresolved, has been tested by periodic outbreaks of violence since it came into place three weeks ago. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, Israel retaliated for the death of an Israeli soldier with bombardments that Gaza health authorities said killed 104 people. More bodies handed over Gaza’s health ministry said the Red Cross had delivered to it 30 bodies of Palestinians killed by Israel during the fighting, a day after Hamas handed over two bodies of captives. Under the ceasefire accord, Hamas released all living hostages held in Gaza in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian captives and detainees, while Israel agreed to pull back its troops, halt its offensive and increase aid. Hamas also agreed to hand over the remains of all 28 dead captives in exchange for 360 Palestinian fighters killed in the conflict. After Thursday’s release, it had handed over 17 bodies, while 225 Palestinian bodies have so far been returned to Gaza. Hamas has said that it will take time to locate and retrieve the bodies of all the remaining hostages. Israel has accused Hamas of violating the truce by stalling in the handover. Two years of conflict in Gaza have killed over 68,000 Palestinians and left the enclave in ruins. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led fighters attacked southern Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and bringing 251 hostages back to Gaza.",

      "summary_orig": "The public’s right to know is in serious jeopardy in the United States. The country that once proudly lauded its commitment to free expression and a free press has rapidly adopted the behaviour of autocrats to stifle reporting it does not like. From new rules that threaten the ability of journalists to report on defence (the country’s largest federal employer and third largest expenditure) to spurious lawsuits from the President against news outlets whose reporting he dislikes (some of whom settled, apparently in fear of greater punishment) to regulatory overreach and the gutting of public media, the United States looks less like the champion of a free press and more like its nemesis. This is not hyperbole. The organisation that I run — the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) — has worked on issues related to press freedom and journalists safety for more than four decades. Press freedom under siege Since 1992, CPJ has meticulously documented the killings, arrests, and disappearances of journalists. We know, and academic research shows, that media censorship — tighter regulations, funding cuts (coupled with investments in pliant media), smear campaigns and legal threats — are a precursor to the curtailment of broader freedoms and rights. And we are seeing precisely that in the United States — not just in real time but at high speed. What began with the White House banning the Associated Press from its press pool (and thus the hundreds of news outlets across the country that rely on its services) in January has since morphed into a multi-pronged attack on the press . The attack vectors are familiar to us at CPJ as keen observers of autocratic behaviour: the misuse of law to attack news outlets deemed unfriendly to the regime (this has included lawsuits from Trump against ABC News , CBS News , the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times ); the increased politicisation of the regulator ( ABC briefly suspended comedian Jimmy Kimmel after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, objected to remarks Kimmel had made on air and said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.” Carr told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson , “These companies can find ways to change conduct to take action on Kimmel or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” Kimmel was reinstated, but some operators continued to refuse to carry the show); and the slashing of funding for public media (the Trump administration has all but eliminated funding that was going to support independent media overseas, gutted entities such as Voice of America , Radio Free Europe , and Radio Free Asia , and slashed funding for public media at home to the bone). This matters not because the press is special per se. It matters because of the role the press plays: the role of holding power to account, of exposing corruption and wrongdoing, of helping people access information that is vital to their everyday lives. When wildfires ripped through California earlier this year, for example, listenership to the local radio station KNX News rose 354 per cent as anxious locals turned to the reliable sources with on the ground reporters to understand what was happening and help mitigate risk. When a free press is curtailed, individual freedoms — which rely on access to independent information — are curtailed too. Fighting back now matters because failure to address these curtailments, and the impunity that follows, creates a breeding ground for further restrictions, as we’ve seen before from Buenos Aires to Budapest . And just as restrictions take a multi-pronged approach, so too must resistance. Resistance takes root Thankfully, we are seeing such resistance. We’re seeing it in the use of legal avenues to challenge administrative overreach. So far this year CPJ has supported eight court submissions led by our colleagues at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), that aim to reverse decisions that threaten a free press . We, along with Free Press, have also pushed for and vigorously supported the ACLU’s habeas corpus case to challenge the wrongful detention and eventual deportation of journalist Mario Guevara. With colleagues at the International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF), Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF), PEN America and RCFP, we’re stepping up the provision of safety training and advice. And we’re seeing journalists and newsrooms (though sadly not all ) refuse to be cowed . It is easy to say support certain freedoms and rights when those rights are not contested. The real test is the willingness to do so even, and especially when, that defence brings potential significant risk. Impunity — and with it, the persistent erosion of rights — thrives when those who purport to believe in these rights, and indeed benefit from them, choose silence. George Orwell called this out in his original planned preface to Animal Farm where he noted: “…the chief danger to freedom of thought and speech at this moment is not the direct interference of the MOI [Ministry of Information] or any official body. If publishers and editors exert themselves to keep certain topics out of print, it is not because they are frightened of prosecution but because they are frightened of public opinion. In this country intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face, and that fact does not seem to me to have had the discussion it deserves.” Tackling impunity, then, in the United States as elsewhere, begins with a basic first step: the refusal to remain silent. This article has been published in collaboration with the World Editors Forum to mark the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. The views expressed are those of the author.",

      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has reiterated that any external aggression against Pakistan will be met with a “firm and severe” response, a statement from the military’s media wing said on Friday. His comments come against the backdrop of recent tensions with Afghanistan over Islamabad’s long-standing concern regarding terrorist attacks emanating from Kabul. For its part, Islamabad has demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, in May, the country faced a military standoff — the worst in decades — with neighbouring India. Following an intense, four-day escalation, the two countries agreed to a ceasefire, mediated by the United States. Addressing a meeting today with students and academics from universities in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s (KP) Abbottabad district, the DG ISPR asserted, “The armed forces remain committed to defending the country, and any external aggression will be met with a firm and severe response,” as per ISPR. Lt Gen Chaudhry detailed that “Pakistan has taken effective steps against terrorism and Fitna Al Khwarij .” Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Since the group ended a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in November 2022, the country has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The statement further mentioned that during the meeting, Lt Gen Chaudhry also talked about the current security situation, including Pak-Afghan tensions and Marka-i-Haq ,“ adding that “students and teachers present paid tribute to martyrs. The Pakistan Army has named the period of conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq”. Vice Chancellor Hazara University, Dr Ikramullah Khan, lauded the armed forces’ role and vowed to stand with them, the statement said. “Pakistan army’s resolve is a metaphor for their love for the country,” he was quoted as saying in the statement. Khan was of the view that “terrorist elements are aiming to mislead our youth,” emphasising that the situation called for the dissemination of “accurate and reliable information.” Per the statement, both students and teachers echoed similar views, stating that the discussion with DG ISPR “had helped dispel any false information they had regarding the Pakistan army, as well as the national and provincial situation.” On October 21, the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir had said that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity would be met with a ’firm and decisive response.“",

      "title_orig": "Istanbul dialogue: Pakistan, Afghanistan agree to continue ceasefire",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed early on Friday morning to continue a ceasefire between the two countries following a rapid deterioration of ties and a brief conflict along their shared border earlier this month. A second round of discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had began in Istanbul on Saturday, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Kabul remained a major point of contention, resulting in a stalemate . A breakthrough came after Türkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week, following Pakistan’s announcement on Wednesday that the talks had “failed” and that its negotiators were preparing to return home. A joint statement released by Türkiye, the host of the latest round of talks, early on Friday stated “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. Though the statement didn’t specify who the “principals” would be, it is expected that it meant the defence ministers of the two countries, who led their sides in the first round in Doha, would now meet in Istanbul. The joint statement further said that during this period, the two countries also agreed on a “monitoring and verification mechanism” to ensure the maintenance of peace and to impose a penalty on the side that breaches the ceasefire. “All parties have agreed to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and to impose penalties on the violating party,” said the joint statement released by Türkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The statement further said that as mediators, Türkiye and Qatar expressed their appreciation for the “active contribution of both parties” and the two countries will continue their cooperation with both sides for “lasting peace and stability”. The same statement was also released by Qatar’s foreign ministry. Türkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, commenting on the development, said, “Just as the Islamic emirate seeks good relations with other neighbouring countries, it also desires positive ties with Pakistan and remains committed to relations based on mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs and not posing a threat to any side.” The joint statement came shortly after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — who had earlier issued a strongly worded warning to Kabul after the stalemate in talks — said that a “ray of light” was visible in the Istanbul negotiations. “Different drafts are being exchanged for an eventual agreement. You can say that some ray of light is visible; there is very guarded optimism. Let’s hope that some shape emerges from this,“ he stated while speaking on Geo News show ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath ’. “Qatar and Türkiye are very respected by us and are our well-wishers. Türkiye clearly openly supported us in the Pakistan-India conflict, so we respect them and their opinion,” the defence minister said. ‘Verifiable action’ The Istanbul negotiations centred on Pakistan’s core demand that Afghanistan take “clear, verifiable and irreversible action” against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other terrorist groups involved in cross-border attacks from Afghan territory. Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, speaking earlier in Peshawar, reiterated Pakistan’s red lines, saying that while Islamabad desired peace with all its neighbours, it “will not allow cross-border terrorism to be perpetrated from Afghan soil against Pakistan.” The Taliban delegation, while participating in the dialogue, however, maintained that it could not fully control TTP operatives. A senior Taliban official said the Afghan side had offered to detain and expel any TTP members found on Afghan territory. “But Pakistan keeps insisting that we control TTP’s attacks inside Pakistan,” the official said. “These fighters are Pakistani nationals operating within Pakistan.” Pakistani negotiators also demanded that the Taliban formally declare the TTP a terrorist organisation and publicly denounce it as a fitna — an Islamic term for sedition or mischief. Diplomatic sources said direct interaction between the two delegations remained limited throughout the five days, with most communication handled through mediators. “Even during meal breaks, the sides barely spoke,” one source said. Afghanistan continues to deny harbouring militants, accusing Pakistan instead of violating its sovereignty through airstrikes and, according to Afghan media, allowing US drones to operate from its airspace — a charge Islamabad denies. Kabul insisted during the talks that any future agreement must include assurances against such operations. While the Istanbul agreement marks a breakthrough after days of tension, diplomats cautioned that deep mistrust persists. “This is a framework for peace, not yet peace itself,” a foreign diplomat said. “It will take sustained verification, discipline and trust to make it hold.” Border skirmishes and talks Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week , the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Türkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.",

The case, registered at Margalla Police Station on November 28 last year, accuses the journalist of snatching a government-issued rifle, hitting a vehicle at a police barrier and possessing narcotics. Initiation of legal proceedings against Jan has drawn strong criticism from journalist bodies and rights groups, who maintain that he is being targeted for investigating reports of alleged deaths during law enforcement action against PTI protesters in November last year. At the outset of the hearing today, lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq submitted a power of attorney to Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on behalf of Jan. He also contended that the journalist had been “portrayed as a terrorist” in the case. Judge Sipra remarked that the other side needed to be heard as well and issued a notice to police for November 8 on an application by Jan for the provision of case documents and adjourned the hearing until the said date. Lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, who has also represented Jan in the case, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists President Afzal Butt and other journalists were also present in the court during the hearing. At the last hearing  held yesterday, the ATC had rejected Jan’s acquittal plea. It should be mentioned that several veteran journalists and human rights activists have demanded the immediate withdrawal of the case registered against Jan. Jan’s arrest According to the first information report (FIR) registered against Jan at Margalla Police Station, his car was stopped at a checkpoint in Sector E-9, where he allegedly resisted arrest, rammed his vehicle into a police barrier and snatched a rifle before being subdued. The FIR invokes Section 9(2)4 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA) for possessing 100 to 500 grams of crystal meth and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) for acts of terrorism. Jan was arrested on the night of November 26, 2024, and initially remanded in police custody. However, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had later overturned that decision and sent him to judicial custody. His defence counsels, Advocates Imaan Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chatha, had subsequently secured his post-arrest bail. Meanwhile, Jan had written a letter to the Inspector General of Islamabad Police (IG), alleging abduction and torture prior to his arrest. In the letter, Jan stated that on November 27, 2024, he and fellow journalist Saqib Bashir were abducted from the Pims Hospital parking area by men in police uniforms, blindfolded and taken to an unknown location where they were tortured and illegally detained. He claimed that police later registered a bogus FIR at Margalla Police Station, accusing him of terrorism and drug smuggling. Jan said his colleague’s sworn affidavit before the Anti-Terrorism Court confirmed their abduction. Jan also recalled his 2020 abduction , underscoring that such acts violated his constitutional and professional rights, as well as the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act, 2021. He had urged the IG to appoint an honest and independent officer to investigate the case on merit.",

In a letter addressed to the Ministry of Interior and dated October 30 — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — the Balochistan government requested that the relevant authorities be directed to suspend 3G/4G internet services in Quetta on October 31 (today) for 24 hours. “Owing to the peculiar law and order situation and threat perceptions, the services of 3G and 4G services are required to be jammed in district Quetta,” the missive said. In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened , as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The suspension also comes only two months after mobile data services in the province were suspended in August over “security reasons”. However, on August 21— 16 days into the suspension — the Balochistan High Court (BHC) had ordered the immediate restoration of mobile internet services, leading to the resumption of connectivity in the province. According to a report published in January, Pakistan was leading the world in terms of financial losses suffered as a result of outages and shutdowns of internet and social media apps last year. Pakistan topped the charts with a cumulative financial impact of $1.62 billion. This was higher than the cost in countries like Sudan and Myanmar, which are ravaged by civil wars.",

      "summary_orig": "• Despite Imran’s instructions not to air dirty laundry in public, Salman Akram Raja and Aliya Hamza engage in ‘Twitter war’ over decision to remove party’s central Punjab president and secretary • Dispute between senior lawyers over list of who gets to meet Imran in Adiala leaves many within the party red-faced LAHORE: Mere weeks after incarcerated founder Imr­an Khan warned party leaders against airing their dirty laundry in public, ano­ther tiff — this time over the leadership of PTI in central Punjab — has erupted over the social media platform X, in full public view. In a telling series of tweets on Thursday, Secretary Gene­ral Salman Akram Raja railed against those who were “conspiring against him”, and recalled that Mr Khan had personally tasked him with conveying messages from Adiala jail. Although he didn’t explain the issue at hand, a cursory glance at his earlier tweets and messages posted by other PTI leaders laid bare the dispute. The controversy centres around the ouster of PTI Cen­tral Punjab President Ahmad Chattha and Gene­ral Secre­tary Bilal Ejaz, who were remo­ved on instructions supposedly conveyed by Imran Khan on Oct 16, when he met Barr­ister Gohar Ali Khan and Salman Akram Raja in Adiala jail. Mr Chattha was one of the men shot and injured in Wazirabad when Imran Khan’s container was fired upon during a rally in 2022. A notification, issued on the same day by PTI’s Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza, had announced Mr Chattha’s removal. He was to be replaced by Ali Imtiaz Warraich. Aliya Hamza Following the Oct 16 meeting, however, Mr Raja had tweeted that the party founder had not ordered any change in the Punjab hierarchy in his presence, adding that they would seek confirmation of this decision from Mr Khan at their next meeting. In a tweet on Wednesday, however, he clarified that he was told the ‘decision’ to remove both men was conveyed — ostensibly to Barrister Gohar — before he arrived at the prison. Speaking to the media on Thursday, Mr Raja disclosed that two lawyers, Ali Imran and Mubashir Maqsood Awan, had met Imran Khan in jail, and later claimed that he had instructed the appointment of Mr Warraich as central Punjab president. In a tweet, Mr Raja also claimed that he told the new president, Ali Imtiaz, to start working after being informed that the confusion stemming from the matter had brought the party’s affairs to a standstill in Punjab. But the decision to remove the two men was disputed by Imran’s sister Uzma during an interaction with reporters, as well as a tweet from Mr Khan’s official X account — which he doesn’t have access to while in prison. “I wish to make it clear that Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz are my long-standing and loyal companions. They have stood by me with unwavering loyalty and made tremendous sacrifices. I have not issued any orders for their removal,” said the tweet, published on Wednesday. Diving headfirst into the fray, PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza tweeted that Imran Khan was the final authority on all decisions, and that she was simply implementing the instructions that had been passed to her. Ms Hamza had earlier appointed Ali Imran as the party’s Punjab spokesman. When approached, party insiders alleged that Ali Imran was a controversial person, being one of the men who ‘misguided’ Salman Akram Raja over Ahmad Chattha’s removal. Some went as far as to accuse Ms Hamza of ‘playing for the other team’, claiming that she was preoccupied by optics; holding meetings, visiting workers’ homes, holding cake-cutting ceremonies and protests on court premises, while silencing voices being raised from the party’s Punjab media cell. When approached for comment, Aliya Hamza denied any leadership crisis, saying that the PTI Punjab president’s portfolio was still with Dr Yasmin Rashid, adding that Mr Khan had instructed her to serve as acting president after Hammad Azhar stepped down from the role. List dispute Salman Akram Raja Another dispute that Mr Raja alluded to in his tweets on Thursday was the confusion about who would submit lists for access to Adiala jail. It may be recalled that the Supreme Court had recently specified that the party’s secretary general, i.e. Salman Akram Raja, should be the one to submit such lists. However, a tug-of-war over who has the authority to issue these lists erupted after two separate lists were sent to the Adiala Jail superintendent on Oct 29, one by secretary-general Salman Akram Raja and the other by Barrister Ali Zafar. In another thread of tweets on Thursday, Mr Raja explained that he had personally messaged Barrister Zafar, informing him that he would send the list. He then claimed to have forwarded the list to the superintendent through TCS, WhatsApp and in person through a lawyer. However, he wrote, “Senator Zafar still sent a separate list of meeting participants”. Party leaders Dawn spoke to on Thursday seemed embarrassed, saying that such a controversy erupting between such senior party members was tantamount to ‘party ka mazaaq’ (making a mockery of the party).
