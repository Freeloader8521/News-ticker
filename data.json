      "title_orig": "India wants to keep Pakistan ‘busy’ on western and eastern fronts: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Saturday that India wanted to keep Pakistan busy and engaged on the eastern and western fronts amid tensions with Kabul and New Delhi. Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed early on Friday morning to continue a ceasefire between the two countries following a rapid deterioration of ties and a brief conflict along their shared border last month. The Istanbul talks followed a sharp escalation in tensions that saw Pakistan launch Oct 9 airstrikes on Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan sanctuaries in Afghanistan, triggering Oct 11 border clashes that continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on Oct 18-19. The Istanbul agreement came after days of deadlock that nearly brought the process to a halt, with mediators pulling both delegations back to the table even as Pakistan’s team had already begun preparations to return home. Meanwhile, an uneasy peace persists between Pakistan and India after their May conflict earlier this year that led to a United States-brokered ceasefire. Since then, Indian political and military leadership, including chiefs of the military branches, have continued to make aggressive statements, repeating terrorism allegations that Pakistan has repeatedly refuted and also warning of “geographical changes” in the course of any future conflict. “If there is a need for evidence, then we have it, about what involvement India has in terrorism [in Pakistan] and how it wants to keep us busy on two fronts: the eastern and western,” said the defence minister while talking to Geo News today. He added that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “silenced” after the defeat dealt to India during the May conflict and expressed hope that talks with Afghanistan would reach a reasonable conclusion. “Everyone is onboard — politicians, the establishment and the Pakistani nation — that an immediate solution to the Afghanistan issue is very necessary, which is that terrorism from Afghan soil should be completely stopped,” said the minister in reference to the country’s western neighbour. Asif said the preferable solution would be for both states to maintain a civilised relationship. The second round of negotiations with Afghanistan produced a three-point understanding — the continuation of the ceasefire, the establishment of a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace, and penalties for violations. The operational details of that mechanism are expected to be finalised when the “principals”, senior representatives from both sides, meet again in Istanbul on Thursday. Earlier today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that a fisherman from Pakistan was arrested by the Indian Coast Guard and was coerced into carrying out tasks for the neighbouring country’s intelligence agency. A few days ago, Asif had stated that India was waging a “low-intensity” war against Pakistan from Afghanistan, adding that New Delhi was trying to “settle the score” after facing defeat in the four-day conflict with Islamabad in May. Information ministry rejects Mujahid’s remarks about deporting security threats Separately, the information ministry rubbished remarks by Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid about details of a prisoner exchange scheme in the Istanbul talks. Ariana News reported that he claimed Pakistani was informed in the talks that the Islamic Emirate was willing to deport people Islamabad considered a security threat but Pakistan did not accept the offer. It added that he said that Pakistan requested the Afghan side to control such people within Afghanistan instead of deporting them. Responding to the development, the information ministry said it “rejects deliberate twisting of facts” by Mujahid. “Pakistan had demanded that terrorists in Afghanistan posing a threat to Pakistan be controlled or arrested. When the Afghan side said that they were Pakistani nationals, Pakistan immediately proposed that they be handed over through designated border posts, consistent with Pakistan’s long-standing position. “Any claim to the contrary is false and misleading.” Asif also slammed the “malicious and misleading” comments by Mujahid, saying: “Let it be categorically stated that there exists complete unanimity of views among all Pakistanis, including the country’s political and military leadership, regarding Pakistan’s security policies and its comprehensive approach toward Afghanistan.”",

      "title_orig": "Fawad stresses need for PTI to pursue engagement, shun confrontation to lower political temperature",
      "summary_orig": "Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said on Saturday that there was a dire need to bring down the political temperature, adding that pursuing engagement with other parties and shunning confrontation was the best way to resolve current issues afflicting the party. Chaudhry, who had remained in jail for months after the removal of the PTI government in April 2022, after his release, had condemned the May 9 violent protests by the party’s supporters and, through a post on X on May 24, 2024, had himself announced to part ways with former premier Imran Khan. The PTI had “ completely disassociated ” itself from him in December 2024, stating that he was not authorised to issue statements to the media or participate in TV talk shows on behalf of the party. Talking to Dawn on Saturday in his hometown of Jhelum, Chaudhry said: “I am a politician by birth and I believe in a political solution to political issues. Confrontation and endless confrontation see no light at the end of the tunnel.” The former information minister said that he had categorically pointed out during the early days of turmoil that the current party leadership did not have the ability to secure Imran’s freedom, and his remarks were bitterly criticised. Chaudhry said that winning Imran’s freedom was always his main concern, and that’s why he was again forced to issue a statement that the path of reconciliation, shunning confrontation and “giving a shut-up call to the self-centred social media working from offshore destinations” was the panacea to the party’s current ills. He said that many party leaders who met Imran in jail agreed, and “those who matter in PML-N, they also have the same line of thinking”. Chaudhry said that engaging with the government and establishment was the need of the hour, and he reiterated that he was making sincere efforts to find a political solution. The former PTI spokesperson said he had advocated his position about pursuing engagement over confrontation in a meeting with Imran in Adiala Jail. He remarked that those who were raising the political temperature from the PTI’s end on social media were doing no favours to the party and were jeopardising the party’s future for their own interests. Chaudhry further said that the operators of the party’s social media accounts were no doubt attracting viewership by “airing volatile controversies and by playing with the emotions of the party workers”, but he said this was not the way and not appropriate to pave the path for Imran’s release. He said the PTI was a political party and it had a future to engage in politics at the national level, adding that “pouring fuel on the fire with every new attractive video or so-called analysis” was shrinking political space at the national level. When asked if he was still in the PTI, Chaudhry instantly replied, “If I were out of PTI, I would have been a minister like many who deserted Khan during hard times.“ Chaudhry’s remarks come in the wake of reports from Daily Ausaf and The Express Tribune that said, citing sources, senior politicians who were part of the PTI’s “old leadership” were planning to relaunch a political movement calling for Imran’s release. The media reports had claimed that Chaudhry and Asad Umar, former Sindh governor Imran Ismail, former MNA Mahmood Moulvi, and ex-Punjab Assembly speaker Sibtain Khan were expected to lead the initiative once released. All of them, except for Sibtain, had parted ways with the PTI following the May 9 riots. According to the ET report, sources said the veteran leaders intended to bring on board other experienced political figures from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh. “The movement will pick up real pace after Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s release, when the old guard will be seen back in active political action,” a report quoted a source as saying. The reports came after Chaudhry and Ismail posted near-identical statements on X yesterday, saying they had not only met Qureshi, who was hospitalised recently, but also party leadership and workers imprisoned at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. PTI’s Sheikh Waqas rubbishes notion of old leaders leading any effort Meanwhile, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram downplayed the reports of the ex-party stalwarts playing any role to play in the future in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’. “This is not a new thing that [news] comes about, such people who left the party. In the last year, there have been many attempts to sell this narrative from such characters, and it has not gotten any support. “Such attempts were also made at Adiala … but there was no support for such narratives from Khan’s side, and I think when they were disappointed from there and saw the mood ahead of Sohail Afridi becoming the chief minister, so they [turned] towards Kot Lakpat.” He said there were a “few people who want to remain relevant because they are not part of any party anymore”. “Everyone has a shop to sell, but that has no link or impact on our party,” he said. Questioned about an opinion in the party to lower the political temperature, Akram resolutely said: “There is only one thinking in the PTI: whatever Imran Khan says, will happen. The rest is irrelevant. Who says what doesn’t matter doesn’t hold any weight. End of the story. Who thinks what or doesn’t? nothing [matters].”",

      "summary_orig": "A 20-year-old man from Afghanistan suspected of having links to an offshoot of the Islamic State group has been arrested in France, anti-terrorism prosecutors said on Saturday. The man was charged with participating in a criminal terrorist organisation and financing a terrorist enterprise, the National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor’s Office (PNAT) said. The suspect, who was arrested in Lyon last week, was placed in pre-trial detention. “He is suspected of having been in contact with IS-K (Islamic State in Khorasan),” the anti-terrorism unit said. The man is suspected of “sending funds” and helping translate and relay “the propaganda of this terrorist organisation”, PNAT added. The IS-K, the militant group’s branch in Afghanistan, also operates in Pakistan and former Soviet countries in Central Asia, including Uzbekistan. The group has been responsible for deadly attacks in Afghanistan and Russia, including an attack on a Moscow concert hall in March 2024 that killed 150 people. According to French daily Le Parisien , the Afghan, who arrived in France several years ago, was arrested by officers from the DGSI domestic intelligence agency when he was already in an administrative detention centre in Lyon. Le Parisien said that the suspect, already under investigation for glorifying terrorism, was editing and disseminating extremist propaganda on TikTok and Snapchat social networks. France has been repeatedly targeted by extremist attackers over the past decade, often by individuals inspired by Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State group.",

      "title_orig": "South Korean president Lee asks China’s Xi for help in engaging North Korea",
      "summary_orig": "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung sought Chinese President Xi Jinping’s help in efforts to resume talks with nuclear-armed neighbour North Korea on Saturday, while Xi told Lee he was willing to widen cooperation and jointly tackle the challenges they face. Lee hosted Xi at a state summit and dinner after an annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, marking Xi’s first visit to the United States’ ally in 11 years. Beijing attaches great importance to relations with Seoul and sees South Korea as an inseparable cooperative partner, Xi said ahead of the summit, according to Lee’s office. Lee, who was elected president in a snap election in June, has promised to strengthen ties with the US while not antagonising China and seeking to reduce tensions with the North. “I am very positive about the situation in which conditions for engagement with North Korea are being formed,” Lee said, referring to recent high-level exchanges between China and North Korea. “I also hope that South Korea and China will take advantage of these favourable conditions to strengthen strategic communication to resume dialogue with North Korea.” Lee has called for a phased approach to denuclearising North Korea, starting with engagement and a freeze on further development of nuclear weapons. In a statement on Saturday, Pyongyang, a military and economic ally of China, dismissed the denuclearisation agenda as an unrealisable “pipe dream”. North Korea has repeatedly and explicitly rejected Lee’s overtures, saying it will never talk to the South. In recent years Pyongyang abandoned its longstanding policy of unification with the South and called Seoul a main enemy. Leader Kim Jong Un said he would be willing to talk to the US if Washington drops demands for denuclearisation, but he did not publicly respond when US President Donald Trump offered talks during his visit to South Korea earlier this week. Trump and Lee announced a surprise breakthrough in talks to lower US tariffs in return for billions of dollars in investment from South Korea. The US president then departed before the main Apec leaders’ summit. South Korean national security adviser Wi Sunglac told a briefing that China expressed its willingness to cooperate for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, but the leaders did not specifically discuss what kind of role China would play. Both sides also agreed that the US-North Korea dialogue was most important, the adviser said. Chinese state media reports on the meeting with Lee made no mention of the North Korea discussions. According to Xinhua , Xi proposed ways to open a new chapter in relations, including having each country “respect each others social systems and development paths, accommodate core interests and major concerns, and properly handle differences through friendly consultation“. Xi also called for upholding multilateralism and increasing cooperation in areas such as artificial intelligence, biopharmaceuticals, green industries and aging populations, Xinhua reported. During Xi’s visit, China and South Korea signed seven agreements including a won-yuan currency swap and memorandums of understanding on online crime, businesses that cater to aging populations, and innovation, among other issues. Political and economic concerns South Korea is a military ally and major trading partner of the US, but is also heavily reliant on trade with China. Hundreds of protesters joined an anti-China rally in Seoul today as Xi and Lee met. Protesters carried placards saying “South Korea belongs to South Korea” and “China Out”, while chanting “Chinese and Communism, get out of South Korea” as they marched through the vibrant shopping street in the Hongdae area. Kim Hye Kyung, a 64-year-old conservative protester, said she joined the rally to “protect liberal democracy” in her country. Amid a rise in such protests, in October, Lee ordered a crackdown on anti-Chinese and anti-foreigner rallies that he said were harming the country’s image and economy. Wi said Lee and Xi had a “productive” discussion about Chinese sanctions on five US-linked units of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean. Beijing has said the sanctions were related to security risks stemming from the company’s cooperation with US investigations. Wi said there were discussions at the summit about years-long restrictions on South Korean entertainment content, effectively banned after the 2017 deployment of the US-led Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system in South Korea. He said the two sides could keep communicating on the matter at the working level as they shared the need for cultural exchanges. Lee also raised the issue of structures placed in disputed waters between the countries, which China claims are for fishing purposes. On the sidelines of an Asean defence summit in Malaysia on Saturday, South Korea’s defence minister met his Chinese counterpart and raised the issue of Chinese military activity in Korea’s Air Defence Identification Zone (KADIZ). China’s Xi pushes for global AI body in counter to US Separately, Xi took the centre stage at the Apec summit earlier today to push a proposal for a global body to govern artificial intelligence and position China as an alternative to the US on trade cooperation. China’s President Xi Jinping speaks during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, on Nov 1, 2025. —  Yonhap via Reuters The Apec is a consultative forum of 21 nations representing half of global trade, including the US, China, Russia and Japan. The summit, hosted by South Korea this year, unfolded under the shadow of rising geopolitical tensions and aggressive economic strategies — ranging from US tariffs to China’s export controls — that have pressured global trade. Xi’s comments were the first by the Chinese leader on an initiative Beijing unveiled this year, while the US has rejected efforts to regulate AI in international bodies. Xi said a World Artifical Intelligence Cooperation Organisation could set governance rules and boost cooperation, making AI a “public good for the international community”. In remarks published by the official news agency Xinhua , Xi added, “Artificial intelligence is of great significance for future development and should be made for the benefit of people in all countries and regions.” Chinese officials have said the organisation could be based in the commercial hub of Shanghai. While advanced chips made by California-based Nvidia are central to the AI boom, China-based developer DeepSeek has rolled out lower-cost models taken up by Beijing in a push for what it calls “algorithmic sovereignty”. Xi also urged Apec to promote the “free circulation” of green technologies, a cluster of industries from batteries to solar panels that China dominates. Xi announced that China will host the 2026 Apec summit in Shenzhen, a major hub for manufacturing, from robotics to electric car production. The Chinese president said the city of nearly 18 million had been a fishing village until it boomed as one of the country’s first special economic zones in the 1980s. Trump did not attend the Apec leaders’ summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, flying back to Washington directly after a meeting with Xi that yielded a one-year deal to partially roll back trade and technology controls. In Trump’s absence, analysts had expected Xi to use the Apec meeting to promote China as champion for its own brand of multilateral cooperation on trade and economic development. Apec leaders call for shared trade benefits Facing deepening fractures in the global trade order, Asia-Pacific leaders adopted a joint declaration that emphasised the need for resilience and shared benefits in trade as the annual Apec summit ended. While Trump did not attend the summit, Washington’s views were still on display in the declaration, analysts said, which, unlike last year’s document, did not mention multilateralism or the World Trade Organisation (WTO). “It is a result of member countries acknowledging, at least to some degree, that it will be difficult to restore a free trade order based on multilateralism and the World Trade Organisation,” said Heo Yoon, a professor of international trade at Sogang University in Seoul. “We cannot deny anymore that there is a paradigm shift in the global trade order,” Heo added. With Trump’s swift exit before the leaders’ summit, China positioned itself as a steady advocate of free and open trade, a role the US has dominated for decades. However, Heo and analysts say the joint declaration suggests that member nations were wary of giving an impression that the US was undermining free trade while picturing China as a guardian of multilateralism. “Few countries believe there can be a new trade order that excludes the US,” he said.",

Xi announced that China will host the 2026 Apec summit in Shenzhen, a major hub for manufacturing, from robotics to electric car production. The Chinese president said the city of nearly 18 million had been a fishing village until it boomed as one of the country’s first special economic zones in the 1980s. Trump did not attend the Apec leaders’ summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, flying back to Washington directly after a meeting with Xi that yielded a one-year deal to partially roll back trade and technology controls. In Trump’s absence, analysts had expected Xi to use the Apec meeting to promote China as champion for its own brand of multilateral cooperation on trade and economic development. Apec leaders call for shared trade benefits Facing deepening fractures in the global trade order, Asia-Pacific leaders adopted a joint declaration that emphasised the need for resilience and shared benefits in trade as the annual Apec summit ended. While Trump did not attend the summit, Washington’s views were still on display in the declaration, analysts said, which, unlike last year’s document, did not mention multilateralism or the World Trade Organisation (WTO). “It is a result of member countries acknowledging, at least to some degree, that it will be difficult to restore a free trade order based on multilateralism and the World Trade Organisation,” said Heo Yoon, a professor of international trade at Sogang University in Seoul. “We cannot deny anymore that there is a paradigm shift in the global trade order,” Heo added. With Trump’s swift exit before the leaders’ summit, China positioned itself as a steady advocate of free and open trade, a role the US has dominated for decades. However, Heo and analysts say the joint declaration suggests that member nations were wary of giving an impression that the US was undermining free trade while picturing China as a guardian of multilateralism. “Few countries believe there can be a new trade order that excludes the US,” he said.",

      "title_orig": "Thousands feared ‘in grave danger’ in Sudan’s El-Fasher after fall to RSF",
      "summary_orig": "Thousands of civilians are feared trapped and in imminent danger in the Sudanese city of El-Fasher after its fall to paramilitaries , Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Saturday, as Germany’s top diplomat described the situation there as “apocalyptic”. At war with the regular army since April 2023, the Rapid Support Forces seized El-Fasher on Sunday, pushing the military out of its last stronghold in Darfur after a grinding 18-month siege marked by starvation and bombardment. Since the city’s fall, reports have emerged of summary executions, sexual violence, attacks on aid workers , looting and abductions, while communications remain largely cut off. Survivors from El-Fasher who reached the nearby town of Tawila have told AFP of mass killings, children shot before their parents, and civilians beaten and robbed as they fled. The UN says more than 65,000 people have fled El-Fasher since Sunday but tens of thousands remain trapped. Around 260,000 people were in the city before the RSF’s final assault. “Large numbers of people remain in grave danger and are being prevented by the Rapid Support Forces and its allies from reaching safer areas,” MSF said. The NGO added that only 5,000 people had managed to make their way to Tawila, about 70 kilometres to the west. The numbers of people arriving in Tawila “don’t add up, while accounts of large-scale atrocities are mounting”, said MSF head of emergencies Michel Olivier Lacharite. “Where are all the missing people who have already survived months of famine and violence in El-Fasher?” he added. “The most likely, albeit frightening, answer is that they are being killed, blocked and hunted down when trying to flee.” ‘Mass killing is continuing’ Several eyewitnesses told MSF that a group of 500 civilians, along with soldiers from the military and the army-allied Joint Forces, had attempted to flee on Sunday, but most were killed or captured by the RSF and their allies. Survivors reported that people were separated based on their gender, age or presumed ethnicity, and that many were still being held for ransom. Hayat, a mother of five who fled the city, previously told AFP that “young men travelling with us were stopped” along the way by paramilitaries and “we don’t know what happened to them”. The UN said on Friday the death toll from the RSF’s assault on the city may be in the hundreds, while army allies accused the paramilitary group of killing over 2,000 civilians. Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab suggested on Friday that mass killings were likely continuing in and around El-Fasher. The lab, which uses satellite imagery and open-source information to document human rights abuses during wars, said fresh images from Friday showed “no large-scale movement” of civilians fleeing the city, giving them reason to believe much of the population may be “dead, captured or in hiding”. The lab identified at least 31 clusters of objects consistent with human bodies between Sunday and Friday, across neighbourhoods, university grounds and military sites. “Indicators that mass killing is continuing are clearly visible,” the lab said. ‘Truly horrifying’ At a conference in Bahrain today, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Sudan was “absolutely an apocalyptic situation, the greatest humanitarian crisis of the world”. He added that the RSF had “pledged to protect civilians and they will be held accountable for these actions”. Speaking at the same event, British Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper also described the reported abuses as “truly horrifying”. “Atrocities, mass executions, starvation and the devastating use of rape as a weapon of war, with women and children bearing the brunt of the largest humanitarian crisis in the 21st century,” she said. The United Kingdom announced £5 million ($6.57m) of new funding for Sudan. “For too long, this terrible conflict has been neglected, while suffering has simply increased,” Cooper said. The emergency funding, which comes on top of £120m the UK has pledged to Sudan over a year, will include £2m to support survivors of sexual violence in El-Fasher. “UK diplomats continue to push all parties to cease hostilities to protect civilians to allow unhindered humanitarian access,” the foreign office said in a press release. The RSF said on Thursday that it had arrested several fighters accused of abuses during the capture of El-Fasher, but UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher questioned the group’s commitment to investigating atrocities. Both the RSF — descended from the Janjaweed militias accused of genocide in Darfur two decades ago — and the army have faced war crimes accusations over the course of the conflict. The US has previously determined the RSF committed genocide in Darfur. The RSF has received weapons and drones from the UAE, according to UN reports, though Abu Dhabi has denied giving any support to the paramilitary group. Meanwhile, the army has drawn on support from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkiye. El-Fasher’s capture gives the RSF full control over all five state capitals in Darfur, effectively splitting Sudan along an east-west axis, with the army controlling the north, east and centre. UN officials have warned that the violence is now spreading to the neighbouring Kordofan region, with reports emerging of “large-scale atrocities perpetrated” by the RSF. The wider conflict has killed tens of thousands, displaced nearly 12m and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises.",

      "title_orig": "Militants suffered highest number of losses in 10 years in October: report",
      "summary_orig": "Militants in Pakistan suffered their heaviest losses in ten years during the month of October as security forces intensified counter-militancy operations across multiple regions, according to data compiled by an Islamabad-based think tank. This comes after militants were put on the back foot in September , with 69 attacks recorded and a 52 per cent decline compared to the month of August , as per the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS). In its latest monthly report issued today, PICSS stated that 355 militants were eliminated in October, while 72 security personnel and 31 civilians, including a peace committee member in Bannu, lost their lives. Another 92 security personnel, 48 civilians and 22 militants were injured across the country, the PICSS Militancy Database showed. While the think tank recorded a 29pc rise in militant attacks from 69 in September to 89 in October, overall human losses in these attacks declined by 19pc. The report highlighted that militants kidnapped 55 people last month, the highest monthly figure of abductions in a decade. Security forces also arrested 22 suspected militants. The report detailed that 55 security personnel, 29 civilians and the peace committee member, along with 24 militants, were killed in militant-initiated violence. These attacks also left 88 security personnel, 45 civilians and one militant injured. PICSS noted that while Balochistan witnessed 23 militant attacks in October compared to 21 in September, casualties dropped sharply from 33 security personnel and 38 civilians to 16 security men and three civilians. The number of militants killed remained eight for both months. The number of security personnel left injured fell from 37 in September to 15 in October, and that of civilians declined from 85 to 20, while a militant was also wounded. However, 31 people, mostly labourers, were kidnapped by militants during the month, the PICSS report added. Detailing casualties from counterterrorism operations, PICSS said security forces killed 67 militants — the highest monthly militant death toll in Balochistan since 2002, when the current wave of militancy began. PICSS described this as a notable improvement in the province’s security situation, pointing to a 92pc decline in civilian deaths and a 52pc drop in security personnel fatalities. In the tribal belt (erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas), 22 militant attacks were recorded — the same as in September — but casualties increased significantly. Thirty-one people, including 18 security personnel and 13 civilians, were killed, while 32 security personnel and 13 civilians were among 45 wounded. Militants also kidnapped 18 people from the region. PICSS noted a 200pc rise in security personnel deaths, up from six to 18, and a 48pc overall rise in fatalities, including those of militants. Security operations in the tribal areas killed 209 militants — the highest single-month militant death toll since November 2014. Sixteen security personnel were also killed in these operations , including during the deadliest incident in Orakzai district , which led to border tensions with Afghanistan. The institute confirmed that security forces also eliminated Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) former deputy emir and shadow defence minister, Qari Amjad, in Bajaur — the most high-profile TTP death since the group’s inception in 2007. Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa saw 37 militant attacks in October compared to 25 in September, resulting in 48 deaths — 21 security personnel, 10 civilians, 16 militants and one peace committee member. Forty-two people were injured, including 35 security personnel and seven civilians. Four people were kidnapped by militants. Security operations killed 55 militants, while a security personnel lost his life. PICSS data shows militant deaths in operations dropped from 88 in September to 55 in October. In Sindh, three militant attacks killed three civilians and injured seven people, including four civilians and three security personnel. PICSS reported increased activity of the proscribed Zainabiyoun Brigade, with eight suspected militants, including key commanders, arrested. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted the Jaffar Express in Sindh’s Shikarpur district with an improvised explosive device (IED), derailing four bogies and injuring seven passengers. Gilgit-Baltistan witnessed three attacks, including two attempted target killings apparently by Zainabiyoun Brigade, while the TTP abducted two officials of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda). In Punjab, one low-intensity attack occurred when TTP militants blew up a gas pipeline in Mianwali district. Security forces also arrested an Al-Qaeda operative from the Okara district. Cumulatively, PICSS recorded 2,853 deaths in the first ten months of 2025 — including 1,734 militants, 601 security personnel, 497 civilians and 21 pro-government combatants. The institute concluded that while militant violence persists, the sharp rise in militant deaths underscores the growing effectiveness of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism operations. In March, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45pc to 1,081 over the previous year.",

      "summary_orig": "Officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan said on Saturday that the Torkham border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been reopened for Afghan refugees returning to their country. Speaking to Dawn , Khyber Deputy Commissioner Bilal Rao confirmed that the Torkham border crossing had been reopened earlier today for the resumption of Afghan refugees’ repatriation. Khizer Shah, the spokesman of the Pakistani embassy in Kabul, and Afghan officials also confirmed the development. “Torkham gate is now open for refugees. We welcome our countrymen,” Qureshi Badloon, head of the Information and Culture in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province, told Dawn . The repatriation of Afghan families with or without any travel or identity documents was abruptly suspended on October 11 following border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on October 19. Pakistan had closed all its borders with Afghanistan for all types of movement. Since then, a large number of returning families had been impatiently waiting for the reopening of the Torkham border. Trade between the countries has remained suspended since then, leading to increased prices of essential goods, especially tomatoes . Although Islamabad and Kabul on Friday decided to extend the ceasefire , Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi stated that the “border remains closed for trade for now” and resumption of trade would depend on the security situation. Officials previously said that all relevant staff members had been informed to ensure their presence on duty on Saturday morning. It was not clear whether Pakistanis stranded in Afghanistan would be allowed to return. ‘Thousands of refugees stranded’ Meanwhile, Afghan Consul General Hafiz Mohibullah Shakir told Dawn on Friday that thousands of Afghan refugees were stranded and living on the road due to the closure of the Torkham border crossing. “There are hundreds of vehicles, carrying thousands of refugees, stranded on roads from Nowshera till Torkham,” he had said, adding that many did not have access to food, water or shelter. He had stated that refugees were continuing to be expelled, especially from Punjab, which was leading to an increase in the number of those stranded on roads. He had appealed for the provision of water, tents and food for the stranded refugees. Shakir said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had not helped the stranded refugees either, most of whom he said were registered and held Proof of Registration (PoR) cards. Following the recent border tensions, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had asserted that the government would grant no further extension to Afghan refugees and that all refugee camps will be shut down. He was informed that as of October 16, a total of 1,477,592 Afghan nationals had been repatriated. The government has also warned that harbouring illegal Afghan residents wo­­uld be treated as a serious offence and violators wo­­u­ld face stern punishment.",

      "summary_orig": "Former PTI leader and ex-federal minister Ali Haider Zaidi on Saturday refuted reports of him “planning a political relaunch”, saying that he had no plans of doing so anytime soon. Zaidi was among the top PTI leadership who quit either the party or politics altogether amid a state crackdown on the party following the May 9, 2023 riots , which witnessed military installations being vandalised in protest of Imran’s arrest earlier that day. “Some [are] suggesting that I’m planning a political relaunch. Let me be clear: I am not planning to enter politics anytime soon,” Zaidi said on X. The first reason Zaidi stated for not rejoining politics was that his “financial circumstances and my personal family obligations” would not allow it. “Secondly, there is no politics in a country where the corrupt, the land grabbers, the extortionists, even those with blood on their hands are gifted power through a rigged election, protected by a compromised judiciary, which even today, fails to deliver justice,” he claimed. “When justice dies, politics loses its purpose,” the former PTI Sindh president said. “Imran Khan was, and remains, the only leader who truly tried to change this system. Sadly, he’s rotting in jail. And we all know why,” he added. “I wish all my old colleagues well,” Zaidi further said. The clarification comes after Daily Ausaf and The Express Tribune reported, citing sources, that senior politicians who were part of the PTI’s “old leadership” were planning to relaunch a political movement calling for Imran’s release. The media reports had claimed that ex-ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Asad Umar , former Sindh governor Imran Ismail , former MNA Mahmood Moulvi , and ex-Punjab Assembly speaker Sibtain Khan were expected to lead the initiative once released. All of them, except for Sibtain, had parted ways with the PTI following the May 9 riots. According to the Tribune report, sources said the veteran leaders intended to bring on board other experienced political figures from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh. “The movement will pick up real pace after Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s release, when the old guard will be seen back in active political action,” the publication reported a source as saying. The reports come after Chaudhry and Ismail posted near-identical statements on X yesterday, saying they had not only met PTI vice president Qureshi, who was hospitalised recently, but also party leadership and workers imprisoned at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. “If the PTI leadership can’t even go to inquire about him (Qureshi), then saying that we shouldn’t even visit him is strange logic,” they said. They affirmed that the entire PTI wanted Imran to be freed from prison and alleged that some elements within the party wanted otherwise so “their leadership can keep shining”.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday banned reporters from accessing a core part of the White House press office without an appointment, citing the need to protect “sensitive material”. Journalists are now barred if they do not have prior approval to access the area in the West Wing known as Upper Press — which is where Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s office is located. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended the move, saying without providing evidence that reporters had been “ambushing” cabinet secretaries in the area and secretly recording video and audio. “This memorandum directs the prohibition of press passholders from accessing … ‘Upper Press,’ which is situated adjacent to the Oval Office, without an appointment,” said a memo from the White House National Security Council (NSC). The memo, addressed to Leavitt and Cheung, said the aim was “protecting sensitive material from unauthorized disclosure in Upper Press”. The policy comes amid wider restrictions on journalists by the Trump administration, including new rules at the Pentagon that major outlets including AFP refused to sign earlier this month. White House reporters have until now been able to freely visit the area, often wandering up to try to speak to Leavitt or senior press officers to seek information or confirm stories. Media are still allowed to access the area known as “Lower Press,” next to the famed White House briefing room, where more junior press officers have their desks, the memo said. ‘Eavesdropping’ The memo said the new restrictions were triggered by “recent structural changes to the NSC” that meant White House press officers were dealing with more sensitive material. Republican Trump has effectively absorbed the once powerful NSC into the White House, putting it under the control of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, after former National Security Adviser Mike Waltz was reassigned in May following a scandal over the use of the Signal app to plan strikes on Yemen. But Cheung later went further, saying on X that “some reporters have been caught secretly recording video and audio of our offices, along with pictures of sensitive info, without permission”. “Cabinet Secretaries routinely come into our office for private meetings, only to be ambushed by reporters waiting outside our doors,” he added, also accusing reporters of “eavesdropping on private, closed-door meetings”. Cheung, a Trump veteran who is known for his combative social media approach, did not provide evidence for the claims. US media said Democratic president Bill Clinton’s administration also sought to limit access to the Upper Press area, before rescinding the decision. Trump’s administration has made a major shake-up to access rules for journalists since his return to power in January. Many mainstream outlets have seen their access to areas like the Oval Office and Air Force One reduced, while right-wing, Trump-friendly outlets have been given more prominence. The White House also banned the Associated Press news agency from key areas where Trump speaks after it refused to recognise his order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.",

Media are still allowed to access the area known as “Lower Press,” next to the famed White House briefing room, where more junior press officers have their desks, the memo said. ‘Eavesdropping’ The memo said the new restrictions were triggered by “recent structural changes to the NSC” that meant White House press officers were dealing with more sensitive material. Republican Trump has effectively absorbed the once powerful NSC into the White House, putting it under the control of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, after former National Security Adviser Mike Waltz was reassigned in May following a scandal over the use of the Signal app to plan strikes on Yemen. But Cheung later went further, saying on X that “some reporters have been caught secretly recording video and audio of our offices, along with pictures of sensitive info, without permission”. “Cabinet Secretaries routinely come into our office for private meetings, only to be ambushed by reporters waiting outside our doors,” he added, also accusing reporters of “eavesdropping on private, closed-door meetings”. Cheung, a Trump veteran who is known for his combative social media approach, did not provide evidence for the claims. US media said Democratic president Bill Clinton’s administration also sought to limit access to the Upper Press area, before rescinding the decision. Trump’s administration has made a major shake-up to access rules for journalists since his return to power in January. Many mainstream outlets have seen their access to areas like the Oval Office and Air Force One reduced, while right-wing, Trump-friendly outlets have been given more prominence. The White House also banned the Associated Press news agency from key areas where Trump speaks after it refused to recognise his order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.",

      "summary_orig": "JERUSALEM: The Israeli military’s chief legal officer resigned on Friday over a criminal inquiry into the leaking of a video that showed soldiers abusing a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza conflict . Advocate General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said that she was stepping down because she had approved the video’s leak in August last year. The abuse investigation led to criminal charges against five soldiers and stirred an uproar. The inquiry drew condemnation from right-wing politicians and prompted protesters to storm two military compounds after investigators sought troops for questioning in the case. A week after the break-in at the bases, a security camera video showing the moments of the alleged abuse was leaked to an Israeli television channel. It showed soldiers taking a prisoner aside and crowding around while holding a dog and blocking visibility of their actions with their riot gear. On Wednesday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said that there has been an ongoing criminal inquiry into the video leak and that Tomer-Yerushalmi was on forced leave. Tomer-Yerushalmi defended her action as an attempt to fend off propaganda against the military’s legal department entrusted with upholding the rule of law, and which she said had been subjected to smears throughout the war. ‘Violence must be probed’ The footage came from Sde Teiman detention camp, where some Hamas fighters are held. Rights groups have reported grave abuses of Palestinians in Israeli detention since Oct 2023. Israel’s military is investigating dozens of cases, but says abuse is not systematic. Tomer-Yerushalmi called Sde Teiman detainees  “terrorists of the worst kind”, in her resignation letter, but added that this did not take away from the obligation to investigate suspected abuse. “To my regret, this basic understanding — that there are acts to which even the most vile of detainees must not be subjected — is no longer convincing to all,” she said. Some politicians were swift to seize on Tomer-Yerushalmi’s resignation. Katz said that anyone who fabricates “blood libels against Israeli soldiers was unworthy of donning IDF uniform”. Police Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir welcomed the resignation and called for an inquiry into more legal authorities. He also posted a video of himself standing over Palestinian prisoners who were lying bound on the floor in an Israeli jail, saying that they were Oct 7 attackers who should receive the death penalty. Around 1,700 Gaza detainees were freed this month as part of the ceasefire in exchange for 20 Israeli prisoners. Published in Dawn, November 1st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Trials to be held in Rawalpindi ATC • Home dept says move will help ensure PTI founder’s security, prevent untoward incidents RAWALPINDI: The Punjab government has notified that all eleven FIRs registered against former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with the violent protests of May 9, 2023, will now be tried in the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Rawalpindi. The trials will be conducted via video link from Adiala jail, where the PTI founder remains incarcerated. According to a notification issued by the Home Department, the decision has been made under Sections 15(2) and 21(2)(b) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The order directs that proceedings in all eleven FIRs — registered at various police stations, including RA Bazaar, Civil Lines, City, Waris Khan, New Town, Morgah, Sadiqabad, Saddar Wah, and Cantt — be held at the Rawalpindi ATC through video link from Adiala jail. The Home Department stated that the arrangement aims to ensure Imran Khan’s security and prevent any untoward incident during the hearings. The fresh order replaces earlier notifications dated June 21, 2023, October 4, 2023, and November 6, 2024, which also addressed the transfer of trial venues. The last such notification was withdrawn by the Punjab government after being challenged before the Lahore High Court (LHC). With this latest order, the government has once again sanctioned the holding of Imran Khan’s trials through remote proceedings. An anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi had earlier dismissed the PTI’s plea challenging the government’s decision to have Imran Khan appear via video link in the case pertaining to the violent protest outside the General Headquarters (GHQ) — one of the several May 9 cases. Judge Amjad Ali Shah ruled that the provincial government’s notification was valid and that the accused would continue to attend proceedings virtually from jail. Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023, triggered widespread riots across Pakistan, during which government buildings and military installations — including the GHQ in Rawalpindi — were stormed and vandalised. Following the unrest, dozens of FIRs were lodged against PTI leaders and supporters under anti-terrorism provisions. The new notification consolidates all eleven Rawalpindi district cases before the same ATC, streamlining the trial process. These cases include charges related to attacks on military installations, police stations, and public property during the May 9 riots. The order has been circulated to key officials, including the advocate general of Punjab, the registrar of the Lahore High Court, the presiding judge of the Rawalpindi ATC, and the inspector general of prisons. It also instructs the superintendent of Adiala jail to ensure Imran Khan’s safe and secure participation via video link. Imran Khan, who was indicted in the GHQ attack case on December 5, 2024, has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since August 2023. He was subsequently arrested in additional May 9 cases in January 2024. The PTI founder’s legal team has consistently argued that the government’s insistence on conducting the trials through video link is politically motivated and undermines the principle of open justice. However, the provincial authorities maintain that the arrangement is strictly a security measure. With the latest notification, the stage is now set for all pending May 9 cases in Rawalpindi to proceed simultaneously in the ATC via video link — a move that could expedite proceedings but also reignite the legal debate over the right to a fair and public trial.

The round of negotiations, which concluded earlier this week, produced a three-point understanding — the continuation of the ceasefire, the establishment of a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace, and penalties for violations. The operational details of that mechanism are expected to be finalised when the “principals”, senior representatives from both sides, meet again in Istanbul on Thursday. The Istanbul talks followed a sharp escalation in tensions last month that saw Pakistan launch Oct 9 airstrikes on TTP sanctuaries in Afghanistan, triggering Oct 11 border clashes that continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on Oct 18-19. The Istanbul agreement came after days of deadlock that nearly brought the process to a halt, with mediators pulling both delegations back to the table even as Pakistan’s team had already begun preparations to return home. “The Istanbul round was initially scheduled for two days. However, in an effort to reach an amicable agreement with the Taliban regime, the Pakistani side, in earnest, continued the talks for four days,” Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Hussain Andarabi said at his weekly briefing on Friday. “We would see these deliberations [in Istanbul] as comprehensive and all-encompassing as we move to the next stage,” Mr Andarabi added. He, however, urged against critiquing the statement. “The statement released by the foreign ministry of Turkiye was a kind of covering note on the talks that were held. It should be read as a preface to a book rather than as the book itself,” he explained while responding to questions about the statement not fully reflecting the Pakistani position, especially as it missed a reference to the TTP’s presence in Afghanistan. “Pakistan does not seek further escalation of hostilities but expects the Afghan Taliban regime to honour its commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking concrete and verifiable actions against terrorist entities, including Fitna al-Khawarij (TTP) and Fitna al-Hindustan (Balochistan Liberation Army),” Mr Andarabi said. While the Foreign Office emphasised diplomacy, the security official was explicit about Islamabad’s conditional approach. “Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to peace and stability on its western border but equally emphasises that this ceasefire is not open-ended and not unconditional,” the official emphasised. He added that Pakistan expects “credible evidence of action, including dismantling of militant hideouts, disruption of logistical channels, arrests or prosecutions of leadership and transparent reporting through the agreed monitoring and verification mechanism”. “If Afghanistan fails to deliver verifiable proof of agreed steps, or if militants continue to launch attacks from Afghan soil, Pakistan will deem the ceasefire violated and reserves all options to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens,” he warned. FO ‘fully engaged’ The Pakistani delegation in Istanbul was dominated by military and intelligence officials, though the Foreign Office spokesman insisted it remained fully engaged. “Istanbul talks took place with full engagement from the Foreign Office,” Mr Andarabi said. “The deputy prime minister and foreign minister gave guidance on numerous occasions. The foreign secretary and our Afghanistan Division were also engaged. We need to dispel this impression that there is some sort of fragmentation in our government apparatus.” Mr Andarabi also clarified that “the border remains closed for trade for now. The opening of the border for Afghan transit trade would depend on the evaluation of the security situation, and clearly that evaluation still warrants closure of the border.” On the monitoring system, the security source said, “The monitoring and verification mechanism established under the mediators’ auspices will serve as the impartial and essential instrument to determine compliance by Afghanistan.” Pakistan, however, remains sceptical about the Afghan Taliban’s sincerity. “Despite repeated assurances in the past (by Afghan Taliban), there has been a surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghanistan,” Mr Andarabi recalled. The spokesman further disclosed that the Afghan Taliban had acknowledged the presence of TTP and BLA on Afghan soil, even if they offered excuses for inaction. “As far as the acknowledgement of their physical presence in Afghanistan is concerned, they agreed to it,” he said. Security officials echoed that scepticism, while noting that “the single litmus test of Taliban sincerity is that Afghanistan will not allow its territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan”. Multi-nation monitors Meanwhile, Defence Minister Asif suggested that there might be the inclusion of multiple countries in the monitoring mechanism to ensure its long-term sustainability instead of a breakdown in 12 or 15 months. He said giving a “free hand” to any border crossing of terrorists amounted to abetting them or conniving with them. “If they don’t stop this or monitor this, it means they have connivance and their agreement is involved in terrorists coming and spilling blood in Pakistan,” he said. To a question on whether the Afghan Taliban accepted the presence and usage of their soil by the TTP to conduct attacks on Pakistan, Mr Asif: “They accept this privately.” He said the two were very entangled, and the entire TTP leadership was present in Kabul. “The sanctuaries in Kabul must have been provided by the Afghan Taliban. They (TTP) won’t be living in hotels,” he added. Mr Asif asserted that Pakistan’s main demand continued to be the “stopping of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”. He added that “there is a ray of hope, but not because of Afghanistan and only so because of Qatar and Turkiye’s influence” over Kabul. “There have been some ceasefire violations from Afghanistan,: he said, stressing that “until terrorism stops, the ceasefire cannot be\neffective”.

      "summary_orig": "• Critical Minerals Forum chief meets Aurangzeb • Islamabad welcomes move; asks team to revert with a detailed framework for collaboration ISLAMABAD: A leading US delegation met with Pakistani officials in Islamabad on Friday, seeking to build secure and transparent mineral supply chains for American industry amid Washington’s growing concerns over China’s upper hand in global rare earth materials. The delegation led by Robert Louis Strayer II, president of the US government-funded Critical Minerals Forum (CMF), “discussed avenues of cooperation in the minerals and mining sector, strengthening supply-chain security, and encouraging responsible and sustainable investment in Pakistan’s critical minerals landscape” with a Pakistani team headed by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, according to an official statement. The meeting took place as the US and India announced a 10-year defence framework agreement. The CMF’s focus is driven by the strategic threat posed by Beijing’s control over key resources. “China’s dominance of critical mineral supply chains has become a well-known threat to US national security, economic competitiveness, and long-term strategic objectives,” Strayer wrote in his only article on the CMF website. Mr Strayer told Pakistan that the CMF is working globally to support reliable supply chains for US industry, particularly in emerging markets. The forum, he said, “focused on rare and niche metals, including copper and antimony, and aims to de-risk investments from both financial and security perspectives”. He also promised a commitment to support technology transfer, intel­lectual property protection, and US private-sector investor confidence. Mr Strayer noted that the US viewed Pakistan’s science, engineering, and mathematics talent as a competitive advantage and “acknowledged Pakistan’s potential to become a future hub for critical mineral development,” the statement added. Natalie Baker, the US Chargé d’Affaires in Islamabad who accompanied the delegation, noted the Embassy’s support for American commercial engagement in Pakis­tan and “emphasised the importance of ensuring strong investor confidence and enabling regulatory frameworks in the minerals sector”. In response, Mr Aurangzeb said Pakistan is working on significant legal and regulatory reforms and would welcome structured proposals. “We encourage you to return with a detailed framework for collaboration. Pakistan will evaluate it with a view to facilitating responsible investment and ensuring mutual benefit,” the minister said. Mr Aurangzeb also positioned Pakistan as navigating a complex geopolitical landscape, highlighting its strengthened partnerships. “Pakistan today stands at a constructive intersection of global relationships—renewed momentum in Pakistan-US ties, time-tested relations with China, and forward-looking strategic cooperation with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” he said. He stressed that Pakistan’s mineral sector represents a “transformational opportunity” that could shift the country from “consumption-driven cycles to export-led growth.” He added, “A strong minerals policy framework will help Pakistan break the cycle of periodic balance-of-payments pressures and reduce future reliance on multilateral support.” The minister also updated the delegation that during his recent visit to Washington he met multiple global financial institutions, including Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and International Finance Corporation (IFC), which expressed interest in expanding investments in Pakistan. US stakeholders are concerned about China’s growing control over global critical minerals. The CMF president noted Chinese dominance stems from government subsidies, vertical integration, and lax regulations, especially in processing, which is energy and compliance-dependent, contrasting with US under-investment. According to the influential US Atlantic Council, critical minerals are foundational to the modern economy and state power, essential for advanced technologies in energy, military, and commercial applications. They range from permanent magnets in fighter jets to batteries in electric vehicles. The Atlantic Council warned that these “supply chains have become increasingly brittle: concentrated in a handful of countries, overwhelmingly refined in China, and increasingly exposed to extreme weather disruption.” It noted that China has shown a “willingness to weaponise its dominance”, tightening export restrictions on materials like graphite and antimony in retaliation for US trade controls. However, a major obstacle to US investment remains, Strayer said, citing the “unusually high uncertainty of both production costs and mineral prices”. He added that this uncertainty has “a chilling effect on new investment by profit-seeking companies, as investors prefer to make investments in projects with higher risk-adjusted expected profits.” Published in Dawn, November 1st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "‘Life on Earth is adapted to the rotation of our planet. … There are also indications that chronic misalignment between our lifestyle and the rhythm dictated by our inner timekeeper is associated with increased risk for various diseases.’ — The Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine OUR existence is a rhythm which continues to play every 24 hours, throughout our lives. This is true for all living beings — animals, plants and even microorganisms. Sounds a bit poetic, a bit mystical — indeed that’s how our existence is. Our body functions are hardwired to an endogenous day and night clock. We follow this in autopilot mode — not at the conscious level, but very much like breathing. We breathe all the time but we don’t have to think about breathing. Likewise, a route is set for our bodies to follow every 24 hours (with individual variations of up to four hours or so). It is an intrinsic autonomous daily routine called the circadian rhythm. Here is a super summary of it. As the darkness of the night fades and sunlight gradually takes over, light enters our eyes and strikes the retina at the back. The photoreceptor cells of the retina convert the light into neural signals, which are then transmitted through the optic nerve to the hypothalamus, a part in the forebrain which regulates many autonomic functions, for example, temperature, hunger, sleep and emotions. The light signal stimulates a particular part of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which then triggers the release of a hormone called cortisol. This is primarily secreted by the adrenal glands located on top of our kidneys. To be healthy is to be in sync with our circadian rhythm. Cortisol is an arousal hormone, which activates the body. Between 7am and 8am, our pancreas secretes the maximum insulin and our body needs glucose, so it’s time for a hearty breakfast. Around 9am, testosterone levels are elevated, which imparts a sense of well-being and boosts energy, among other functions. Around 10am our hormones have prepared us to face the world and we are ready for the day. Our alertness peaks at this time. Between 2pm and 6pm, our body temperature reaches its daily high, which makes our muscles more flexible and pliable. We have the greatest cardiovascular and skeletal muscle strength at around 5pm. At 6pm, we have the highest level of lipids in our bloodstream. It is in anticipation of the fasting period at night during sleep since lipid metabolism is slow. At around 8pm, we have the highest level of neutrophils circulating in our body. As guardians against inflammation, these white blood cells are ready to take their position during the night in our cells to undertake immune surveillance and respond to any cell damage. Around 9pm, the small cone-shaped pineal gland, situated almost at the centre of the brain between the two hemispheres, slowly starts releasing the sleep hormone melatonin. We are tired, start yawning and are ready to fall asleep. Between 2am to 4am we have the deepest restorative sleep. This is when we don’t even see dreams and are unconscious. During this phase we have our lowest body temperature in 24 hours. After deep sleep, there is again a gradual build-up of cortisol and we slowly wake up, also due to sunlight, ready for another day. Day after day, apart from autonomous breathing, a beating heart, constant digestive work in our gut, the functioning of our liver and kidneys, there is a timetable followed by our hormones which bring changes in our physiology at fixed times of the day. The science of the circadian rhythm has been a subject of constant inquiry by researchers. Experiments have startled scientists who find that even if a person is kept constantly in a dark environment for 24 hours and there are no external stimuli of light, the body still follows the timings of the circadian rhythm. The same is true for plants. Most readers would know about the plant called touch-me-not (Mimosa Pudica), which folds its leaves on being touched. This plant has been extensively studied. Normally, it folds its leaves at night and unfurls them in sunlight. However, it would still follow the same routine if kept in complete darkness for 24 hours, i.e., folding and unfurling its leaves at fixed times of the 24-hour day. This shows that these attributes of organisms are deeply embedded in our existence at the genetic level. In 1971, a gene was finally located in a fruit fly by American chronobiologists. They called it a ‘period (per) gene’. The per gene is “the first discovered genetic determinant of behavioural rhythmicity”. Later, another gene called the ‘time gene’ was also discovered. They also demonstrated that if these genes are destroyed then the fruit fly loses its circadian rhythm. Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young were given the Nobel Prize of Physiology or Medicine in 2017 for this “cracking the clock” discovery. The quote in the beginning of the column is from a press release issued by the Nobel Committee at the time of bestowing this Nobel Prize. Please read this again. Our state of health and disease has a lot to do with how much we are aligned or misaligned with our circadian rhythm. External stimuli, those in the environment — for instance, light, temperature and especially those we generate ourselves through our lifestyle behaviour — if not aligned with our circadian rhythm, can have a huge negative effect on our health and we become prone to developing various diseases. The lifestyle stimuli include what and when we eat; whether and when and how we exercise; when we sleep and the quality of sleep; how we manage stress; the quality of our social connectedness and relationships and whether we use any addictive substances. To be healthy is to be in sync with our diurnal or circadian rhythm, and to be mindful about it.
