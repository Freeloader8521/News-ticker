      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday night issued a strongly-worded statement telling Afghanistan to focus on issues pertinent to itself and not to interfere in Islamabad’s internal affairs. The FO was responding to a statement by Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid slamming the police crackdown on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The TLP, which began its protest march in Lahore on Friday, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. On Monday, police and law enforcement agencies launched an early-morning operation to disperse the protesters, who were encamped in Muridke. The clashes left a police officer and four civilians dead, including three TLP workers. Mujahid issued a statement earlier today in which Kabul expressed its condolences and said it was “profoundly saddened” by the violence and deaths and noted that the demonstrations were carried out “in accordance with the country’s legal framework”. “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and to the entire nation of Pakistan, and we wish a swift recovery to those who have been wounded,” Mujahid’s statement read. “We urge the Pakistani government and its ruling authorities to cease any further acts of violence against their people and to pursue resolution through dialogue and mutual understanding.” In response, the FO took to X and acknowledged the statement, urging Kabul to “prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside their jurisdiction”. “The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters,” the FO wrote. It also urged Kabul to abide by its obligations to the international community under the Doha Process and to “not allow its land to be used for terrorism against other countries”. “Besides, the regime should focus on [the] formation of an inclusive and truly representative government, instead of engaging in baseless propaganda,” the FO concluded.",

      "title_orig": "Situation remains tense on Pak-Afghan border; hostilities can resume ‘at any time’: Khawaja Asif",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that as of today, there are “no ties” between Islamabad and Kabul in the fallout of Afghanistan’s unprovoked attack on the Pak-Afghan border over the weekend. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” Asif said on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’. “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today.” Asif said hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities. “We cannot lower our guard,” warned the defence minister. When asked if Islamabad will negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afghanistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained. “We did not target populated areas, we did not target civilians, we targeted their hideouts.” “The world knows that there is a conglomerate of international terrorism in Afghanistan, where ISIS, Al Qaeda and the Taliban are active. They are all under Kabul’s umbrella,” he added. “Who will believe Muttaqi? The Indians might, but they also know that these people are not controlled by anyone.” When asked if Tehreek-i-Taliban chief Noor Wali Mehsud was in Afghan territory, Asif replied: “Those we targeted, we targeted in their territory. When I went two-and-a-half, three years ago, they said they would relocate these people. He wasn’t on the moon; he was in Afghanistan.” “The offer was there. I think there needs to be honesty in diplomacy — it’s not there 100 per cent of the time, but if there is some, it would improve the matter and pave the way to resolution,” he added. Afghan attacks on border At least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side late on Saturday night. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), in a statement, said overnight skirmishes between the two sides, began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. “During overnight skirmishes, 23 brave sons of Pakistan embraced shahadat (martyrdom) while defending the territorial integrity of our beloved country against this outrageous action, while 29 soldiers [were] injured.“ “According to credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment, more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher,” the ISPR statement said. Afghanistan claims it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. Providing further details, the ISPR said 21 hostile positions on the Afghan side of the border were also briefly physically captured and multiple terrorist training camps, used to plan and facilitate attacks against Pakistan, were rendered inoperative. “The infra-structural damages to Taliban posts, camps, headquarters and support networks of terrorists are extensive, all along the border and range from tactical to operational depth.”. “The armed forces of Pakistan remain ever ready to protect the territorial integrity, life and property of the people of Pakistan. Our resolve to defend Pakistan’s territorial integrity and to defeat those who threaten our security is unwavering.”",

      "summary_en": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that as of today, there are “no ties” between Islamabad and Kabul in the fallout of Afghanistan’s unprovoked attack on the Pak-Afghan border over the weekend. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” Asif said on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’. “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today.” Asif said hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities. “We cannot lower our guard,” warned the defence minister. When asked if Islamabad will negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afghanistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained. “We did not target populated areas, we did not target civilians, we targeted their hideouts.” “The world knows that there is a conglomerate of international terrorism in Afghanistan, where ISIS, Al Qaeda and the Taliban are active. They are all under Kabul’s umbrella,” he added. “Who will believe Muttaqi? The Indians might, but they also know that these people are not controlled by anyone.” When asked if Tehreek-i-Taliban chief Noor Wali Mehsud was in Afghan territory, Asif replied: “Those we targeted, we targeted in their territory. When I went two-and-a-half, three years ago, they said they would relocate these people. He wasn’t on the moon; he was in Afghanistan.” “The offer was there. I think there needs to be honesty in diplomacy — it’s not there 100 per cent of the time, but if there is some, it would improve the matter and pave the way to resolution,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump especially thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and “my favourite” Field Marshal Asim Munir on Monday for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza, among many other world leaders. Trump was addressing a ceremony following the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas at the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit in Egypt. He also invited PM Shehbaz to deliver a special address at the ceremony. Taking the podium, PM Shehbaz thanked Trump and the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for their efforts in securing the peace deal. “Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace [and] who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity.” ’’I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team. And today again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East.“ PM Shehbaz said he wanted to salute Trump for his “exemplary [and] visionary leadership”. View this post on Instagram “You are the man this world needed the most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything [and] went out of the way to stop seven and today eight wars,” he added. The premier also thanked the Qatari emir for his efforts in securing peace in Gaza and the wider region, along with the efforts of the Turkish, Saudi and Emirati leadership. “Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, had he not intervened with his wonderful team during those four days, the war could’ve escalated to a level and who would’ve lived to tell what happened.” “Similarly, here in this part of the world in the Middle East, Mr president, your valuable contribution along with President Sisi, I think history will remember in golden words.” Retaking the podium, Trump quipped: “Wow! I didn’t expect that. Let’s go home, there’s nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered, thank you very much.” PM meets other leaders PM Shehbaz earlier reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for peace in the region and solidarity with the people of Palestine as he met world leaders in Egypt. Two years of Israeli bombardment in the Palestinian enclave have claimed more than 67,000 lives, with the continuing to rise as more bodies are recovered. Last month, US President Trump had mediated a truce with the help of eight Muslim nations between Hamas and Israel and paved the way for the end of genocide in Gaza through a 20-point plan . Last week, Hamas and Israel had signed an agreement to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of Trump’s initiative to end the conflict. Yesterday, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said that the summit was the result of the diplomatic efforts that began on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th Session in New York last month. PM Shehbaz arrived in Egypt earlier today to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. The premier arrived at the Congress Centre to participate in the summit and was received upon arrival by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. The prime minister met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in Gaza. The meeting marked a rare moment of convergence between the two Caucasus nations and underscored the broader international commitment to de-escalation in the Middle East. The prime minister also held bilateral discussions with prominent global leaders, including King Abdullah II of Jordan, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres, President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. The premier also met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who thanked Pakistan for its “unwavering political and diplomatic support’’. Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the Gaza ceasefire, and PM Shehbaz lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Palestinian people. During these meetings, PM Shehbaz emphasised the urgent need for coordinated international efforts to restore peace in the region. He highlighted Pakistans consistent stance on the Palestinian issue, reaffirming Islamabads unwavering diplomatic and moral support for the Palestinian people. “Our position is rooted in justice and humanity,” he said. “Pakistan will continue to stand by the Palestinian cause and support all peaceful initiatives aimed at ending violence and ensuring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.” The meetings also included discussions on broader regional stability, strengthening multilateral cooperation, and promoting dialogue to resolve long-standing conflicts. He later met Trump, who also arrived in Egypt to attend the signing ceremony and met world leaders as he welcomed them. View this post on Instagram Earlier, PM Shehbaz hailed the peace plan a “crucial step towards lasting peace in the Middle East”. “Grateful to our co-hosts, President El Sisi and President Trump. We would not have seen this moment without President Trump’s outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment,” PM Shehbaz said on X. “It took his single-minded pursuit of peace to end the needless killing and destruction,” he said. PM Shehbaz added that the ceremony marked the “closing of a genocidal chapter, one that the international community must ensure is never repeated anywhere again”. He said the “brave and resilient” Palestinian people deserve to live in a free Palestine, “with pre 1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as their capital city”. Trump, along with Sisi, will chair the summit set to be attended by world leaders, including the head of the United Nations. The gathering in the Red Sea resort town will bring together “leaders from more than 20 countries”, Sisi’s office had said. It will seek “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security”. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and Pedro Sanchez of Spain will also attend the summit. French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, according to their offices. The European Council will be represented by its president, Antonio Costa, a spokesperson said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II is also expected to attend, according to state media. Israel and Hamas, however, will not attend the summit. “No Israeli official will attend,” Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told AFP yesterday. Similarly, Hamas confirmed it will not participate directly. Hossam Badran, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told AFP that the Palestinian group “will not be involved.” He noted that Hamas “acted principally through … Qatari and Egyptian mediators” during previous negotiations.",

Hossam Badran, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told AFP that the Palestinian group “will not be involved.” He noted that Hamas “acted principally through … Qatari and Egyptian mediators” during previous negotiations.",

      "summary": "United States President Donald Trump especially thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and “my favourite” Field Marshal Asim Munir on Monday for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza, among many other world leaders. Trump was addressing a ceremony following the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas at the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit in Egypt. He also invited PM Shehbaz to deliver a special address at the ceremony. Taking the podium, PM Shehbaz thanked Trump and the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for their efforts in securing the peace deal. “Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace [and] who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity.” ’’I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team. And today again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East.“ PM Shehbaz said he wanted to salute Trump for his “exemplary [and] visionary leadership”. View this post on Instagram “You are the man this world needed the most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything [and] went out of the way to stop seven and today eight wars,” he added. The premier also thanked the Qatari emir for his efforts in securing peace in Gaza and the wider region, along with the efforts of the Turkish, Saudi and Emirati leadership. “Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, had he not intervened with his wonderful team during those four days, the war could’ve escalated to a level and who would’ve lived to tell what happened.” “Similarly, here in this part of the world in the Middle East, Mr president, your valuable contribution along with President Sisi, I think history will remember in golden words.” Retaking the podium, Trump quipped: “Wow! I didn’t expect that. Let’s go home, there’s nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered, thank you very much.” PM meets other leaders PM Shehbaz earlier reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for peace in the region and solidarity with the people of Palestine as he met world leaders in Egypt. Two years of Israeli bombardment in the Palestinian enclave have claimed more than 67,000 lives, with the continuing to rise as more bodies are recovered. Last month, US President Trump had mediated a truce with the help of eight Muslim nations between Hamas and Israel and paved the way for the end of genocide in Gaza through a 20-point plan . Last week, Hamas and Israel had signed an agreement to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of Trump’s initiative to end the conflict. Yesterday, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said that the summit was the result of the diplomatic efforts that began on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th Session in New York last month. PM Shehbaz arrived in Egypt earlier today to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. The premier arrived at the Congress Centre to participate in the summit and was received upon arrival by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. The prime minister met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in Gaza. The meeting marked a rare moment of convergence between the two Caucasus nations and underscored the broader international commitment to de-escalation in the Middle East. The prime minister also held bilateral discussions with prominent global leaders, including King Abdullah II of Jordan, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres, President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. The premier also met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who thanked Pakistan for its “unwavering political and diplomatic support’’. Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the Gaza ceasefire, and PM Shehbaz lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Palestinian people. During these meetings, PM Shehbaz emphasised the urgent need for coordinated international efforts to restore peace in the region. He highlighted Pakistans consistent stance on the Palestinian issue, reaffirming Islamabads unwavering diplomatic and moral support for the Palestinian people. “Our position is rooted in justice and humanity,” he said. “Pakistan will continue to stand by the Palestinian cause and support all peaceful initiatives aimed at ending violence and ensuring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.” The meetings also included discussions on broader regional stability, strengthening multilateral cooperation, and promoting dialogue to resolve long-standing conflicts. He later met Trump, who also arrived in Egypt to attend the signing ceremony and met world leaders as he welcomed them. View this post on Instagram Earlier, PM Shehbaz hailed the peace plan a “crucial step towards lasting peace in the Middle East”. “Grateful to our co-hosts, President El Sisi and President Trump. We would not have seen this moment without President Trump’s outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment,” PM Shehbaz said on X. “It took his single-minded pursuit of peace to end the needless killing and destruction,” he said. PM Shehbaz added that the ceremony marked the “closing of a genocidal chapter, one that the international community must ensure is never repeated anywhere again”. He said the “brave and resilient” Palestinian people deserve to live in a free Palestine, “with pre 1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as their capital city”. Trump, along with Sisi, will chair the summit set to be attended by world leaders, including the head of the United Nations. The gathering in the Red Sea resort town will bring together “leaders from more than 20 countries”, Sisi’s office had said. It will seek “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security”. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and Pedro Sanchez of Spain will also attend the summit. French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, according to their offices. The European Council will be represented by its president, Antonio Costa, a spokesperson said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II is also expected to attend, according to state media. Israel and Hamas, however, will not attend the summit. “No Israeli official will attend,” Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told AFP yesterday. Similarly, Hamas confirmed it will not participate directly. Hossam Badran, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told AFP that the Palestinian group “will not be involved.” He noted that Hamas “acted principally through … Qatari and Egyptian mediators” during previous negotiations.",

      "title_orig": "PTI’s Sohail Afridi elected KP chief minister in session marred by opposition walkout",
      "summary_orig": "PTI MPA Sohail Afridi on Monday was elected the new chief executive of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during an assembly session marred by the opposition’s walkout and despite prevailing uncertainty regarding the resignation of outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur. KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, who pushed ahead with the election despite the opposition walkout, announced that the three opposition candidates — Maulana Lutfur Rehman of JUI-F, Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP — all received zero votes. Noting that three members of the assembly were out of the country, he announced that Afridi had won the election after securing 90 votes, prompting chants in favour of the PTI leader to ring out in the assembly hall. Afridi had needed to secure at least 73 votes in the 145-strong KP Assembly to win the election. Out of a total of 53 opposition members, 51 walked out of the assembly on the call of the opposition leader; the remaining two were not present for the session. Meanwhile, leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah said they did not accept Afridi as the new chief minister. “The PTI is interpreting the law as per their understanding, we are doing it according to our understanding. There are grey areas and now the court has to decide,” he told Dawn.com , adding that the opposition would knock on the doors of the courts. He further contended that there were now “two chief ministers” in the province as Gandapur’s resignation had not been accepted. It should be mentioned that while Gandapur has submitted two separate resignations to Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, both have been returned over “disparate signatures”. Kundi has summoned Gandapur on October 15 (Wednesday) to settle the matter. Speaker sends summary to governor Separately, Speaker Swati posted on X that he had “formally sent the summary to the KP governor for [the] oath-taking”. Have no greed for the seat, will vacate it if directed to do so: Afridi Before announcing the results, KP Assembly Speaker Swati, in a message to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said that “KP still holds the forces dear because soldiers are out there defending the province and continue to make sacrifices”. Despite that, institutions can not be allowed to run parliament, he said. “The parliament is the representative jirga of the province’s people,” he added. Afridi then proceeded to deliver an emphatic speech in which he expressed his admiration of and loyalty to party founder Imran Khan. Speaking in the assembly, Afridi said that he was grateful to Imran for choosing someone who was a mere worker, belonged to a middle-class family and did not have familial links to politics. “And neither Bhutto, Zardari nor Sharif are attached to my name,” he thundered. He further said that he belonged to the tribal districts and was proud of his background. He said that a particular mindset had prevailed about tribal districts and its people over the past 78 years. “This mindset dictates that the people of tribal areas are only there to die, that tribal areas should always be far behind.” He further said that Imran was aware of the deprivation faced by the tribal districts. “However many times I thank [Imran], it is not enough,” he said. He further said that the tribal districts were ecstatic over the decision to field him as the new chief minister, and were thanking Imran and the party. “As is the vision of my leader Imran, one does not become a leader by writing Sharif or Bhutto or Zardari with their name,” he said. Afridi also extended his gratitude to Gandapur, saying that no one in the party had ever hesitated when it came to making sacrifices. “Ali bhai , the grace with which you tendered your resignation … I laud you for that.” Calling himself a “champion of politics of protest”, he said that he had nothing to lose. “No cars, no bungalows, no riches and no greed for the seat. The day my leader tells me to vacate the seat, I will kick it to the side.” He also said that there were reports that Imran, who is currently incarcerated, was being shifted without consultation with his family and the party. “I make this announcement, that if he is shifted without consultation, we will jam the whole country.” During his speech, Afridi also stated that military operations were not the “solution to terrorism” and called on the federal government to engage in dialogue, and involve the people of the province and the government in devising a solution. He recalled that he and his fellow party members had been raising alarm over terrorism for a long time, but “no one paid us any attention”. “In fact, we were accused of lying,” he added. “And today, they are conducting operations,” he said. Questioning the efficacy of military operations, Afridi asked, “Despite 14,000 intelligence-based operations, why has there been no decrease in terrorism? “My people are still internally-displaced persons (IDPs), their homes have been uprooted and they are dying,” he said, noting that “it is clear that military operations are not the solution”. He stressed that any policy concerning counter terror measures and Afghanistan had to take the people of the province into account. “They are kicking out our Afghan brothers and sisters — people who have been here for 40-50 years,” he said while referring to the repatriation of Afghan refugees. He also vowed to speak to the Centre about the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), stating, “I will ask why people who are merely asking for their rights have been treated in such a way.” PTI congratulates Afridi Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan congratulated Afridi on winning the election. “I hope the next step of taking oath takes place and the transition is completed smoothly. I pay strong tribute to the outgoing CM Ali Amin Gandapur. And I congratulate Afridi for his election,” he said. PTI leader Omar Ayub also congratulated Afridi, saying: “Our struggle for ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi ’ shall continue as per the vision and instructions of PM Imran Khan. Gratitude to former CM Ali Amin Khan Gandapur sahib for his unflinching support and efforts to make the transfer of power smooth,” he said. PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser also extended his “heartfelt congratulations” to Afridi. “Today marks an important milestone in the political history of Pakistan. It is a testament to the fact that Imran Khan has provided an opportunity for hardworking, talented and ideological workers from the youth and middle class to reach positions of leadership,” Qaiser said. “Afridi started his political struggle with student politics and with continuous hard work, perseverance and the spirit of serving the people … His election undoubtedly reflects the vision of Imran Khan, who is keen to bring forward a new, courageous and people-oriented leadership,” he said, adding that he was confident new avenues of progress, prosperity and transparent governance would open under the leadership of Afridi. PTI MNA Junaid Akbar expressed gratitude that all members of the provincial assembly were “standing with Imran Khan” and were united. “Only one member is outside the country,” Akbar said. “I pay tribute to all the members of the provincial assembly who have kept Imran Khan, the workers and themselves in their hearts and have not succumbed to any pressure or greed,” he said. Opposition decries ‘unconstitutional procedure’; speaker pushes ahead Prior to the election, Leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah had spoken in the assembly and termed the election as “unconstitutional”. During his speech, he held up a copy of the Constitution and said: “According to this Constitution, the procedure is that first your resignation is accepted. Then the administration denotifies the cabinet.” He said the cabinet had not been denotified and Gandapur’s resignation had not been accepted by the governor. “In the presence of an existing chief minister, the election of a new chief minister is unconstitutional. So we will not become a part of this unconstitutional procedure,“ he asserted. He also questioned the need for making the issue controversial. “If you already have the numbers, then why not wait a few days and have it be done constitutionally?” He reiterated that the process was “unconstitutional” and said that the opposition was staging a walkout as “it did not want to be a part of this”. Following the walkout, KP Assembly Speaker Swati said that Gandapur had sent his resignation to the governor twice and also announced the same in his speech in the assembly. Swati said that while some people wished for Afridi to not become the new chief minister, the Constitution did not function according to people’s wishes. “The chief minister of a province is a constitutional office holder in terms of Article 130. Clause eight of this article provides for tendering of a resignation by the chief minister under his hand … I rule that an election for the post of chief minister of KP is being lawfully conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the rules of the assembly,” he said. Speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah addressed the controversy and said: “Our stance is, and we think it to be absolutely correct, that the speaker should not have called the provincial assembly session until the resignation was accepted.” He also criticised Afridi for his speech, saying it did not befit a chief minister or a provincial assembly. Criticising Afridi’s view on military operations, he said the PTI should act as a political party if it wanted the state and institutions to engage with it democratically and politically. Sanaullah questioned how could a provincial government function if it did not cooperate or work together with the federal government, saying Afridi’s speech was akin to “mutiny”. He added that the Centre would try to prevent the situation from deteriorating but if Afridi’s conduct “remains as per his speech, then I don’t think he can conduct himself as the head of a provincial government in accordance with the Constitution and law”. Gandapur gives ‘advance congratulations’ to Afridi At the outset of the session, Gandapur gave his “advance congratulations” to Afridi as the treasury benches thumped their desks. He assured them that the PTI’s fight for justice would continue under the leadership of party founder Imran Khan. He expressed pride at the fact that he had submitted his resignation on October 8 on the directives of Imran. He also called for allowing the democratic process to continue and to refrain from putting any obstacles in this regard. He further said that everything he had done as the provincial chief executive was a part of record and could be examined. “A government can only succeed, a province can only succeed if it is self sustainable. Unfortunately, when our government came into power, we only had enough money for salaries for 18 months. But I am proudly saying right now that we have Rs280 million in the treasury,” he said. He further said that his government provided more than what it allocated under the Annual Development Programme. He stated that under Imran’s vision, he had provided funds to all constituencies. “In the end, I would like to say that we have a movement, a struggle and that struggle is not limited to Imran Khan. The sacrifice that he is making right now, he is doing it for the good of the nation. We stand with him and will continue to do so,” he said. He also called for addressing the challenges the province was facing, saying that the law and order situation was more important than engaging in a war of words. “We have to move forward  and focus on these challenges,” he said. KP governor returns Gandapur’s resignation over ‘disparate’ signature Separately, the controversy around Gandapur’s resignation took another turn on Sunday night after Governor Kundi returned two separate letters submitted by the former over “disparate signatures” and summoned him on October 15 (Wednesday) to settle the matter. In a post on social media platform X, Kundi said that the chief minister’s resignation had been “returned with observation”. He also shared a letter addressed to Gandapur, wherein he stated that two resignation letters had been received by the Governor House on October 8 and October 11, both of which had “disparate and unalike signatures”. “Since I am out of city, and intend to return to Peshawar on the ever of October 15, therefore, you are advised to visit Governor House on October 15 at 3pm so that the authenticity of the alleged resignations could be verified and the matter is settled as per the mandate of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he said. Meanwhile, Gandapur responded to Kundi’s post on X and said: “Finally, the resignation submitted on October 8, previously denied by the Governor Office, also acknowledged.” He further stated that both resignations submitted by him bore his “authentic signatures”. On October 8, Gandapur said he had resigned from his role as the provincial chief executive, while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the CM’s role. The letter, shared by Gandapur on X, was typed on his official letterhead and signed at the bottom. However, this initial resignation letter had apparently gotten lost in red tape , with the Governor’s House denying having ever received it. On October 11, Kundi had stated that the Governor House had received a handwritten resignation letter from Gandapur. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he had added. A day earlier, a parliamentary delegation of PTI had met Kundi at his residence in Islamabad. The delegation included Asad Qaiser, Atif Khan, Junaid Akbar and others. PTI representatives had sought support from the PPP to ensure democratic values during the election for the chief minister. They said the PPP had always claimed that it gave value to the democratic norms. Kundi had stated that Gandapur’s resignation would be accepted as per constitutional requirements. He had also stressed the need for joint efforts to ensure peace and the public services in the province.",

      "summary_en": "PTI MPA Sohail Afridi on Monday was elected the new chief executive of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during an assembly session marred by the opposition’s walkout and despite prevailing uncertainty regarding the resignation of outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur. KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, who pushed ahead with the election despite the opposition walkout, announced that the three opposition candidates — Maulana Lutfur Rehman of JUI-F, Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP — all received zero votes. Noting that three members of the assembly were out of the country, he announced that Afridi had won the election after securing 90 votes, prompting chants in favour of the PTI leader to ring out in the assembly hall. Afridi had needed to secure at least 73 votes in the 145-strong KP Assembly to win the election. Out of a total of 53 opposition members, 51 walked out of the assembly on the call of the opposition leader; the remaining two were not present for the session. Meanwhile, leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah said they did not accept Afridi as the new chief minister. “The PTI is interpreting the law as per their understanding, we are doing it according to our understanding. There are grey areas and now the court has to decide,” he told Dawn.com , adding that the opposition would knock on the doors of the courts. He further contended that there were now “two chief ministers” in the province as Gandapur’s resignation had not been accepted. It should be mentioned that while Gandapur has submitted two separate resignations to Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, both have been returned over “disparate signatures”. Kundi has summoned Gandapur on October 15 (Wednesday) to settle the matter. Speaker sends summary to governor Separately, Speaker Swati posted on X that he had “formally sent the summary to the KP governor for [the] oath-taking”. Have no greed for the seat, will vacate it if directed to do so: Afridi Before announcing the results, KP Assembly Speaker Swati, in a message to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said that “KP still holds the forces dear because soldiers are out there defending the province and continue to make sacrifices”. Despite that, institutions can not be allowed to run parliament, he said. “The parliament is the representative jirga of the province’s people,” he added. Afridi then proceeded to deliver an emphatic speech in which he expressed his admiration of and loyalty to party founder Imran Khan. Speaking in the assembly, Afridi said that he was grateful to Imran for choosing someone who was a mere worker, belonged to a middle-class family and did not have familial links to politics. “And neither Bhutto, Zardari nor Sharif are attached to my name,” he thundered. He further said that he belonged to the tribal districts and was proud of his background. He said that a particular mindset had prevailed about tribal districts and its people over the past 78 years. “This mindset dictates that the people of tribal areas are only there to die, that tribal areas should always be far behind.” He further said that Imran was aware of the deprivation faced by the tribal districts. “However many times I thank [Imran], it is not enough,” he said. He further said that the tribal districts were ecstatic over the decision to field him as the new chief minister, and were thanking Imran and the party. “As is the vision of my leader Imran, one does not become a leader by writing Sharif or Bhutto or Zardari with their name,” he said. Afridi also extended his gratitude to Gandapur, saying that no one in the party had ever hesitated when it came to making sacrifices. “Ali bhai , the grace with which you tendered your resignation … I laud you for that.” Calling himself a “champion of politics of protest”, he said that he had nothing to lose. “No cars, no bungalows, no riches and no greed for the seat. The day my leader tells me to vacate the seat, I will kick it to the side.” He also said that there were reports that Imran, who is currently incarcerated, was being shifted without consultation with his family and the party. “I make this announcement, that if he is shifted without consultation, we will jam the whole country.” During his speech, Afridi also stated that military operations were not the “solution to terrorism” and called on the federal government to engage in dialogue, and involve the people of the province and the government in devising a solution. He recalled that he and his fellow party members had been raising alarm over terrorism for a long time, but “no one paid us any attention”. “In fact, we were accused of lying,” he added. “And today, they are conducting operations,” he said. Questioning the efficacy of military operations, Afridi asked, “Despite 14,000 intelligence-based operations, why has there been no decrease in terrorism? “My people are still internally-displaced persons (IDPs), their homes have been uprooted and they are dying,” he said, noting that “it is clear that military operations are not the solution”. He stressed that any policy concerning counter terror measures and Afghanistan had to take the people of the province into account. “They are kicking out our Afghan brothers and sisters — people who have been here for 40-50 years,” he said while referring to the repatriation of Afghan refugees. He also vowed to speak to the Centre about the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), stating, “I will ask why people who are merely asking for their rights have been treated in such a way.” PTI congratulates Afridi Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan congratulated Afridi on winning the election. “I hope the next step of taking oath takes place and the transition is completed smoothly. I pay strong tribute to the outgoing CM Ali Amin Gandapur. And I congratulate Afridi for his election,” he said. PTI leader Omar Ayub also congratulated Afridi, saying: “Our struggle for ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi ’ shall continue as per the vision and instructions of PM Imran Khan. Gratitude to former CM Ali Amin Khan Gandapur sahib for his unflinching support and efforts to make the transfer of power smooth,” he said. PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser also extended his “heartfelt congratulations” to Afridi. “Today marks an important milestone in the political history of Pakistan. It is a testament to the fact that Imran Khan has provided an opportunity for hardworking, talented and ideological workers from the youth and middle class to reach positions of leadership,” Qaiser said. “Afridi started his political struggle with student politics and with continuous hard work, perseverance and the spirit of serving the people … His election undoubtedly reflects the vision of Imran Khan, who is keen to bring forward a new, courageous and people-oriented leadership,” he said, adding that he was confident new avenues of progress, prosperity and transparent governance would open under the leadership of Afridi. PTI MNA Junaid Akbar expressed gratitude that all members of the provincial assembly were “standing with Imran Khan” and were united. “Only one member is outside the country,” Akbar said. “I pay tribute to all the members of the provincial assembly who have kept Imran Khan, the workers and themselves in their hearts and have not succumbed to any pressure or greed,” he said.

A Dawn.com correspondent reported that only the Faizabad Interchange remained closed while the rest of the intersections between Rawalpindi and Islamabad were open for traffic. He said that the situation was returning to normal and there was no serious reaction from the religious party, adding that overall traffic was thin on the major thoroughfares. Mobile data services, impacted since the start of the protest, were also restored in most areas of the twin cities, added the correspondent. Earlier, authorities had moved to close roads and motorways again in and around Lahore and Islamabad — which had started reopening on Sunday — after the operation, as panic spread among citizens about the potential outcome of the clash. Meanwhile, some schools in Islamabad also closed earlier than usual. The TLP, which began its protest march in Lahore on Friday, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. On Sunday, law enforcement agencies, including Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) and large contingents of police from five districts, were dispatched to Muridke and reportedly surrounded TLP protest camp, in what appeared to be preparations for a large-scale operation. Police action again TLP A senior police official, who wished to remain anonymous, confirmed to Dawn.com today that police action to disperse the protesters from Muridke started at 3am and lasted for six hours. Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that TLP chief Saad Rizvi had neither been arrested nor injured in this morning’s clash. Earlier, Punjab police spokesperson Mubashir Hussain said a police station house officer (SHO) was martyred during the clash and three TLP workers were killed. Separately, the Punjab police also posted on X about an SHO’s martyrdom in “firing by armed groups” in Sheikhupura — the district where Muridke is located. The police, however, did not name the TLP. The statement on X said Sheikhupura Factory Area Station House Officer (SHO) Shehzad Nawaz had lost his life in the line of duty while trying to maintain order and protecting peoples’ lives and properties. Hussain said 48 law enforcement personnel were injured in the clash, 17 of whom sustained bullet wounds, while eight citizens also suffered injuries. He further stated that a passerby was also killed in the incident. Punjab police later posted on X that the injured law enforcement personnel were being provided medical treatment . Hussain maintained that as law enforcement personnel moved to disperse the protesters, TLP members attacked them with stones, batons with nails lodged in them and “petrol bombs”. They later opened fire, he alleged, adding that lives were lost during the firing. “Law enforcement personnel had to initiate limited action in their defence,” Hussain said, further accusing the TLP protesters of setting 40 government and private vehicles on fire. He said police had also arrested several protesters. Authorities have been arresting TLP activists since their protest began on Friday last week. Meanwhile, Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran had told the media on Saturday that 112 police personnel had been injured until then since the start of the protest. Earlier today, videos allegedly showing clashes between the TLP and police, with images showing burnt vehicles and smoke filling the air, were circulating on social media. On Sunday, it was also reported that talks were ongoing between the government and the TLP. Rana Sanaullah rubbishes rumours of negotiations Speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said that as per his knowledge, there were no negotiations with the TLP though contact was made from both sides. He said the party was requested to call off the protest during the above contacts but it yielded no success and violence entered the fray. “There were no demands. They only wanted to do a long march, come to Islamabad and present themselves in front of a foreign embassy which was not acceptable for the government.” Karachi police resort to tear gas shelling, arrest five TLP workers Like other parts of the country, the TLP also demonstrated in certain areas of Karachi against police action on its party’s main protest in Muridke, with the Sindh Police resorting to tear gas shelling and arresting few of them. Police said the main protest demonstrations were held in North Karachi and New Karachi respectively. West-Zone Deputy Inspector General of Police Irfan Ali Baloch told Dawn.com that the TLP workers staged sit-in at two places at 4-K Chowrangi in North Karachi and Sindhi Hotel in New Karachi respectively. He said they allegedly blocked the main roads, causing disruption of the traffic. He said the TLP workers allegedly attacked the police with stones, causing injuries to two constables, when the cops attempted to disperse them. “The police resorted to tear gas shelling and arrested five of them,” he said, adding that all roads were cleared for traffic. Meanwhile, the Sindh Home Department issued a statement urging citizens in Karachi to “ignore rumours about chaos” in the metropolis. “Immediate action should be taken against those spreading rumours,” the statement read, quoting Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, who was speaking to the Karachi additional inspector general over the phone. “Those who violate the writ of law should be dealt with as per Section 144,” he added. According to the statement, Lanjar ordered that police personnel stationed across the city remain alert and that anti-riot squads remain on standby. “Police operations should be made more stringent at potentially sensitive areas and flashpoints,” the minister said. “Staff assigned to monitor the city should be kept on high alert and as soon as a crowd or disruptive activity is reported anywhere in the city, senior officers should be alerted immediately.” At least 100 TLP activists remanded for 11 days An anti-terrorism court sent more than 100 TLP activists on physical remand over charges of vandalism and assaulting police. The hearing, presided over by ATC judge Manzar Ali Gul, saw police presenting 100 activists before the court. They had been booked in multiple cases lodged at different police stations. Nawan Kot police station registered cases against 62 activists. ‘Treason and terrorism’ Commenting on the TLP protest during a press conference today, Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari said it was the government’s responsibility to protect the lives and properties of people. And the government could not evade this responsibility, she added. She further stated that “blocking roads and creating inconvenience for citizens, especially when peace has been restored in Gaza and people are happy there, trying to bring the country to a halt and taking the law into one’s hand is unacceptable”. Separately, a post on the Punjab government’s X account, referring to the TLP, said: “Attacking the state, firing at and inflicting violence on police, destroying properties and looting and plundering do not qualify as protest but open treason and terrorism. The armed mobs of the TLP are not above the law. When the state enforces its writ, these masked criminals stage a drama of playing the victims.” The post also had a video, which showed masked men causing harm to properties and engaging in violence. Lawyers’ bodies condemn ‘violence’ against TLP The Lahore Bar Association announced that it was going on a strike 11am onwards today and boycotting court proceedings over the arrests of and alleged firing at TLP workers. The bar association announced the strike in a press release, noting that the “unarmed” TLP leadership and protesters had sustained injuries in alleged firing by police and the Rangers in Muridke. Moreover, it said, TLP protesters were arrested in large numbers. Calling for legal action against those responsible, the lawyers’ body condemned these acts. Separately, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) also issued a condemnation in a press release, highlighting that every citizen had the right to protest. “The way peaceful citizens and [political] workers were being fired at and blood was being shed at the behest of the Pakistan government, it doesn’t suit a democratic country,” the LHCBA said, stressing that issues should be resolved through negotiations. The LHCBA also demanded action against those who “inflicted violence” on the protesters and called for the release of detained protesters. Road closures A Dawn.com correspondent in Islamabad reported the road blockades around Faizabad Interchange — the key intersection between Rawalpindi and Islamabad — had been removed. But most of the routes at the location were closed again after panic began spreading around 11am. For now, only the Islamabad Expressway is open at Faizabad, he said. The correspondent said mobile internet in the federal capital was working, but there were reports of service suspension and slow internet speed in some areas of Rawalpindi. The mobile internet service had been suspended in the twin cities ahead of the TLP protest on Friday but was later partially restored. He also reported that some schools in the capital had closed earlier than the usual time today. The school, he said, sent messages to parents about the development, citing a potential “law and order” situation. Ghulam Abbas, a resident of Islamabad’s Margalla Town, told Dawn.com he could feel the panic even when he dropped his children off at school at 9am. “And all of a sudden, we received messages from schools about the half-day timings. They said students should leave the school as early as possible, as the school would close early. “I had to rush to pick up my children … The panic also led to traffic congestion. I now hear that Faizabad is closed again. Luckily, I passed that route well in time.” Meanwhile, a Dawn.com correspondent in Lahore reported that authorities had closed M-2 Motorway, which connects Lahore to Islamabad, M-3 Motorway, which links Lahore to the Abdul Hakeem area in Khanewal and M-11 Motorway, which connects Sialkot to Lahore.",

      "title_orig": "Former Test batter Wazir Mohammad dies at 95",
      "summary_orig": "Former Pakistan Test batter Wazir Mohammad passed away on Monday at the age of 95, according to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). According to ESPNCricinfo , the right-hander was born in Junagadh in 1929, and his siblings included renowned cricketers Hanif, Mushtaq and Raees Mohammad. “One of the four Mohammad brothers to represent Pakistan in Test cricket, he featured in 20 matches for his country from 1952 to 1959,” the PCB wrote in a post on X, extending its condolences. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi expressed his condolences to Mohammad’s family in a statement, paying tribute to the batter’s services to Test cricket. “Wazir Mohammad was a good batsman and an extremely refined human being,” Naqvi was quoted as saying, offering prayers for the family. ‘A guiding light’ In Pakistan’s early days, a group of brothers used to play cricket in the compound of a temple at Karachi’s Haji Camp. All five of them, who had migrated to the city from Junagadh in India, were right-handed batters and each highly talented, but the eldest brother wished for one of them to be a left-hander. “One fine day, he told me, ‘We don’t have a left-hander in our family, why don’t you become one?’“ former Pakistan Test player Sadiq Mohammad narrated to Dawn.com about his brother Wazir on Monday. “And then I did,” continues Sadiq. “I used to get five chances while others got only one. ‘Bat left-handed hamesha (always),’ he would say.” The oldest member of Pakistan’s first-ever Test team, that was the level of respect Wazir demanded as not only a brother, but also later on in his short but celebrated cricket career. A lower-order batter himself, he went on to play 20 Tests for Pakistan between 1952-59. His 801 runs at a meagre average of 27.62 in Tests is a classic case of statistics being untruthful, with his 40.40 in 160 First Class matches fighting his case. One of the standout achievements of Wazir’s career, in fact, remains his four-hour-long unbeaten knock of 42 in the 1954 Oval Test, which became Pakistan’s maiden win in England. His century partnership with the country’s first Test captain, Abdul Hafeez Kardar, in 1956-57 got Pakistan their first win against Australia. Wazir was also the national side’s only century-maker in the 1957-58 win against the West Indies, Pakistan’s maiden against the then great side. “He scored that against a star-studded West Indies bowling attack featuring Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith,” Sadiq said. “He was such a strong personality and he had waited for the opportunity to save Pakistan. He was a very organised cricketer.” Sadiq added how Wazir’s immense knowledge of the laws of the game made him a trusted associate for Kardar. “Wazir bhai had a big impact [on Pakistan cricket] as he knew all laws of the game,” he said. “He guided Kardar on numerous occasions when the captain had any confusion about the rules.” As per ESPNCricinfo , in the Kingston Test of 1957-58, when Garry Sobers made the record score of 365, the crowd stormed the ground. A patch of the pitch was damaged to the extent that a crater developed. The West Indian declaration arrived at the same time, meaning Pakistan had an awkward 90 minutes to bat that day. Wazir told Kardar to tell the umpires that, as per the laws of the game, the wicket was not suitable for batting since the wear and tear was not due to natural reasons. The umpires initially showed reluctance to accept Pakistan’s viewpoint, but eventually, after consulting the rule book, they agreed. As an elder brother, Sadiq said, Wazir was a guiding light. “He used to calm us down, he taught us how, when and when not to take panga (fight) with opponent players. And if we did, he guided us [on] how to handle it.” Wazir also served as an advisor to the PCB after his retirement before moving to the United Kingdom. His cricketing aptitude and grip over the game’s laws may have been an effect of his disciplined lifestyle. “He was a very disciplined person; from his childhood till he fell ill recently, he used to sleep as early as nine in the night,” Sadiq said.",

      "summary_en": "Former Pakistan Test batter Wazir Mohammad passed away on Monday at the age of 95, according to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). According to ESPNCricinfo , the right-hander was born in Junagadh in 1929, and his siblings included renowned cricketers Hanif, Mushtaq and Raees Mohammad. “One of the four Mohammad brothers to represent Pakistan in Test cricket, he featured in 20 matches for his country from 1952 to 1959,” the PCB wrote in a post on X, extending its condolences. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi expressed his condolences to Mohammad’s family in a statement, paying tribute to the batter’s services to Test cricket. “Wazir Mohammad was a good batsman and an extremely refined human being,” Naqvi was quoted as saying, offering prayers for the family. ‘A guiding light’ In Pakistan’s early days, a group of brothers used to play cricket in the compound of a temple at Karachi’s Haji Camp. All five of them, who had migrated to the city from Junagadh in India, were right-handed batters and each highly talented, but the eldest brother wished for one of them to be a left-hander. “One fine day, he told me, ‘We don’t have a left-hander in our family, why don’t you become one?’“ former Pakistan Test player Sadiq Mohammad narrated to Dawn.com about his brother Wazir on Monday. “And then I did,” continues Sadiq. “I used to get five chances while others got only one. ‘Bat left-handed hamesha (always),’ he would say.” The oldest member of Pakistan’s first-ever Test team, that was the level of respect Wazir demanded as not only a brother, but also later on in his short but celebrated cricket career. A lower-order batter himself, he went on to play 20 Tests for Pakistan between 1952-59. His 801 runs at a meagre average of 27.62 in Tests is a classic case of statistics being untruthful, with his 40.40 in 160 First Class matches fighting his case. One of the standout achievements of Wazir’s career, in fact, remains his four-hour-long unbeaten knock of 42 in the 1954 Oval Test, which became Pakistan’s maiden win in England. His century partnership with the country’s first Test captain, Abdul Hafeez Kardar, in 1956-57 got Pakistan their first win against Australia. Wazir was also the national side’s only century-maker in the 1957-58 win against the West Indies, Pakistan’s maiden against the then great side. “He scored that against a star-studded West Indies bowling attack featuring Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith,” Sadiq said. “He was such a strong personality and he had waited for the opportunity to save Pakistan.

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump told the Israeli parliament on Monday that the ceasefire he helped broker in the Gaza conflict had ushered in the “historic dawn of a new Middle East”. “And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity,” he said. “This is not only the end of a war … This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East.“ Trump’s lightning visit to Israel came ahead of a summit in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh co-chaired by the American president, who has declared the conflict in Gaza “over”. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel is due to release nearly 2,000 Palestinians held in its jails. Addressing the Israeli parliament, Trump called the agreement that brought about a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the captives held by Hamas a triumph as he thanked mediators from the Arab and Muslim world. “Let me also convey my tremendous appreciation for all of the nations of the Arab and Muslim world that came together to press Hamas to set the hostages free and to send them home,” Trump said in remarks before the Israeli parliament. “We had a lot of help, we had a lot of help from a lot of people that you wouldn’t suspect, and I want to thank them very much for that. It’s an incredible triumph for Israel and the world to have all of these nations working together as partners in peace.“ The address to the Israeli parliament was briefly interrupted as two Israeli lawmakers were expelled. Ayman Odeh held a sign that read “Recognise Palestine”, while Ofer Cassif also attempted to raise a sign, leading to their removal, Times of Israel reported . “That was very efficient,” Trump quipped as the MPs were quickly taken out. The US president had paused as a Knesset staff member audibly ordered the expulsion of Cassif after an apparent protest. Trump hailed an end to a “painful nightmare” after two years of fighting in Gaza during his address. “From October 7 until this week, Israel has been a nation at war, enduring burdens that only a proud and faithful people could withstand,” he said. “For so many families across this land, it has been years since you’ve known a single day of true peace … The long and painful nightmare is finally over,” the US president added. “The forces of chaos that have plagued the region are totally defeated,” he said. Trump also said he wanted a peace deal with Iran, after the US joined Israel in striking the Islamic republic’s nuclear sites during a brief war earlier this year. “They got it from one side, from the other, and you know it would be great if we could make a peace deal with them,” Trump said of Iran. “Would you be happy with that? Wouldn’t it be nice, I think. Because I think they want to. “ Trump ‘greatest friend’ Israel has had in White House: Netanyahu Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel could pursue new “peace treaties” with Arab and Muslim countries in the Middle East and beyond. “Under your leadership, we can forge new peace treaties with Arab countries in the region and Muslim countries beyond the region,” Netanyahu said, adding that “no one wants peace more than the people of Israel”. He described Trump as the “greatest friend” Israel has ever had in the White House. “Donald Trump is the greatest friend that the state of Israel has ever had in the White House. No American president has ever done more for Israel,” Netanyahu said in parliament before Trump’s address to lawmakers. Israel has said it does not expect all of the dead hostages to be returned today. Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is also due to return the bodies of the 27 captives who died or were killed in detention, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in 2014 during a previous Gaza conflict. Among those Israel was due to release in exchange are 250 security detainees, while about 1,700 were detained by the Israeli army in Gaza during the conflict. ‘Nothing looks the same’ in flattened Gaza In Gaza, too, the ceasefire has brought relief, but with much of the territory flattened by fighting, the road to recovery remains long. “I returned to Sheikh Radwan with my heart trembling,” 38-year-old Fatima Salem told AFP after she returned to her neighbourhood in Gaza City. “My eyes kept searching for landmarks I had lost — nothing looked the same, even the neighbours’ houses were gone. “Despite the exhaustion and fear, I felt like I was coming back to my safe place. I missed the smell of my home, even if it’s now just rubble. We will pitch a tent next to it and wait for reconstruction.” Trump’s visit to the Middle East aims to celebrate his role in brokering last week’s ceasefire and hostage release deal — but comes at a precarious time as Israel and Hamas negotiate what comes next. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One at the start of the “very special” visit, Trump brushed off concerns about whether the ceasefire would endure. “I think it’s going to hold. I think people are tired of it. It’s been centuries,” he said of the fighting. “The war is over. Okay? You understand that?” the US president added. Final details Trump announced in late September a 20-point plan for Gaza, which helped bring about the ceasefire. Negotiators were still wrangling late on Sunday over the final arrangements for the exchanges, with two Hamas sources telling AFP the group was insisting that Israel include seven senior Palestinian leaders on the list of those to be released. Israel has previously rejected at least one of those names. After visiting Israel, Trump will head to Egypt, where he and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will co-host a summit of world leaders to back his plan to end the Gaza conflict and promote Middle East peace. While Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas is due at the summit, Netanyahu’s office said the Israeli premier will not attend due to the start of a religious holiday. In Egypt, Trump will be looking to resolve some of the huge uncertainty around the next phases of the peace plan, including Hamas’s refusal to disarm and Israel’s failure to pledge a full withdrawal from the devastated territory. Trump insisted he had “guarantees” from both sides and other key regional players about the initial phase of the deal, and the future stages. A new governing body for devastated Gaza — which Trump himself would head under his own plan — would be established “very quickly”, he added. Under the plan, as Israel conducts a partial withdrawal from Gaza, it will be replaced by a multi-national force coordinated by a US-led command centre in Israel. Hamas urged Trump and the mediators of the Gaza deal today to ensure Israel does not resume operations in Gaza. “We call on all mediators and international parties to continue monitoring Israel’s conduct and to ensure it does not resume its aggression against our people in Gaza,” Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 67,869 people. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands buried under the rubble.",

      "summary_en": "United States President Donald Trump told the Israeli parliament on Monday that the ceasefire he helped broker in the Gaza conflict had ushered in the “historic dawn of a new Middle East”. “And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity,” he said. “This is not only the end of a war … This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East.“ Trump’s lightning visit to Israel came ahead of a summit in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh co-chaired by the American president, who has declared the conflict in Gaza “over”. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel is due to release nearly 2,000 Palestinians held in its jails. Addressing the Israeli parliament, Trump called the agreement that brought about a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the captives held by Hamas a triumph as he thanked mediators from the Arab and Muslim world. “Let me also convey my tremendous appreciation for all of the nations of the Arab and Muslim world that came together to press Hamas to set the hostages free and to send them home,” Trump said in remarks before the Israeli parliament. “We had a lot of help, we had a lot of help from a lot of people that you wouldn’t suspect, and I want to thank them very much for that. It’s an incredible triumph for Israel and the world to have all of these nations working together as partners in peace.“ The address to the Israeli parliament was briefly interrupted as two Israeli lawmakers were expelled. Ayman Odeh held a sign that read “Recognise Palestine”, while Ofer Cassif also attempted to raise a sign, leading to their removal, Times of Israel reported . “That was very efficient,” Trump quipped as the MPs were quickly taken out. The US president had paused as a Knesset staff member audibly ordered the expulsion of Cassif after an apparent protest. Trump hailed an end to a “painful nightmare” after two years of fighting in Gaza during his address. “From October 7 until this week, Israel has been a nation at war, enduring burdens that only a proud and faithful people could withstand,” he said. “For so many families across this land, it has been years since you’ve known a single day of true peace … The long and painful nightmare is finally over,” the US president added. “The forces of chaos that have plagued the region are totally defeated,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "China is concerned about recent border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan and has asked the two countries to protect their nationals and investments in the region, Beijing’s foreign ministry said on Monday. Intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. In response to Islamabad’s repeated calls to bar terrorists from using its territory for cross-border attacks, Afghanistan denies the allegation of allowing terrorist outfits to use its soil. Meanwhile, China shares a border with Afghanistan and Pakistan in its western region and has sought to play a mediating role in calming hostilities between the two sides. “China is willing to continue to play a constructive role in improving and developing Pakistan-Afghanistan relations,” foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said during a regular press briefing. Beijing hopes that Kabul and Islamabad will “remain calm and restrained, and persist in properly resolving each other’s concerns through dialogue and consultation to avoid escalation of conflicts,” Lin said. In August, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended a meeting with Pakistani and Afghan counterparts in Kabul, calling for strengthening exchanges at all levels. In an informal trilateral meeting weeks earlier, hosted by Beijing, China said Kabul and Islamabad had agreed to upgrade their diplomatic ties.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Index plummeted by over 4,600 points on Monday due to continuing political uncertainty, the weekend conflict with Afghanistan and the ongoing crackdown on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The benchmark KSE-100 index opened at 163,098.19 points before dropping by 4,654.77 points, or 2.85 per cent, to close at 158,443.42. Of 482 active scrips, only 74 advanced , 375 declined while 33 remained unchanged. The PSX had experienced a sharp decline over the previous week as a combination of global and domestic uncertainties dented investor sentiment. Intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan that started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning cast a shadow over the bourse. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. Meanwhile, a crackdown against TLP protesters early Monday, who had been camped at Muridke after authorities blocked their route to Islamabad by digging up trenches, added more pressure. “The new week opened on a sour note amid weekend reports of retaliatory action along the Afghan border and Friday’s global equity declines; risk aversion deepened as government measures against TLP fueled rumours of broader unrest,” said Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities. He advised retail investors to stay focused on long-term investing with capital that matched their risk tolerance and liquidity needs, and to keep asset allocation disciplined. “While valuations are not excessive, prospective returns are likely to normalise; the outsized gains seen over the past two years are unlikely to be repeated over the next two,” Farooq said. Last week, the KSE-100 index fell by nearly 3.5pc, weighed down by concerns over the delayed staff-level agreement (SLA) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), geopolitical tensions in the region, and widespread profit-taking. Additionally, selling pressure in insurance stocks, which saw a net sell of $25 million, further dampened market sentiment. Geopolitical risks, particularly last week’s blast in Kabul, added to the unease, heightening fears of escalating tensions with Afghanistan. Major drag came from Engro Holdings, Systems Ltd, MCB Bank, Habib Bank and Engro Fertiliser, which collectively knocked 732 points off the index.",

      "title_orig": "Does KP have two chief ministers now? Legal experts weigh in",
      "summary_orig": "In a day of high political drama at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, PTI’s Sohail Afridi was elected the province’s new chief minister. However, his victory unfolded amid walkouts, protests, and a deepening constitutional crisis over whether the outgoing CM, Ali Amin Gandapur, had even truly vacated his seat. As chants of “Sohail Afridi zindabad ” echoed through the assembly hall, the opposition staged a walkout, declaring the entire process “unconstitutional.” Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, however, pressed ahead and ruled it lawful under Article 130, declaring Afridi’s election valid even as questions swirled over Gandapur’s disputed resignation, returned by Governor Faisal Karim Kundi for having “disparate signatures.” The episode has set off a flurry of debate: can a new chief minister be elected when the previous one still holds office? Lawyers have since weighed in, dissecting whether the assembly’s actions uphold or undermine the constitutional process. An attempt to thwart the will of the many “The opposition walkout means nothing; just as the governor pretending to become Sherlock Holmes about signatures matching is irrelevant,” remarked lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii. “The CM resigned — his resignation is effective immediately. The house has chosen a new leader.” In his view, the matter is straightforward: there is only one chief minister in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, “the one the majority of the members of the provincial assembly voted for today.” Any attempt to halt that process, he argued, “is a sorry and desperate game of the few attempting to thwart the will of the many.” As Jaferii pointed out, political actors often justify such manoeuvres by citing past precedent, but that, too, fails the constitutional test. “The excuse we are presented with is that it has happened before too,” he said. “No one even bothers to deny that it is as wrong now as it was then and that it is the constitutional order that pays the price.” While he argued that the assembly’s vote is decisive and the governor’s signature drama irrelevant, some lawyers see a clear breach of constitutional procedure. A constitutional anomaly unfolds Lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig termed the situation “a constitutional anomaly,” questioning both the governor’s delay and the speaker’s haste. “While the governor’s refusal to accept the chief minister’s resignation is inexplicable given that the former has publicly confirmed the same,” Baig noted, “the speaker’s decision to call a session to elect a new chief minister before the acceptance of CM Gandapur’s resignation is a constitutional anomaly.” Baig pointed out that the Constitution provides a clear timeline in certain situations, such as when a chief minister dissolves the assembly, the decision takes effect within 48 hours even if the governor does not act. “Interestingly, no similar provision exists in the event that the chief minister resigns,” he said. In Baig’s assessment, though, the speaker may have overstepped. “While the Assembly may have voted CM Gandapur out through a vote of no confidence or while the courts’ jurisdiction may have been invoked against the governor’s procrastination, the KP speaker’s decision is untenable.” History has little patience for delays “While there can’t be two CMs at once, the central principle is this: ceremonial bottlenecks cannot defeat the Assembly’s will,” said lawyer Ahmad Maudood Ausaf. “If a governor frustrates and tries to delay that process beyond reasonable verification, as has been the case here, by that point, a letter, another letter, a speech, and a tweet should have sufficed.” Ausaf added that “any court would view it as unconstitutional, especially since the courts — Punjab and Peshawar — have intervened before to prevent such artificial, managed, and unconstitutional manoeuvring.” In his view, a mere opposition walkout cannot invalidate a process where quorum is met and the assembly’s will is clear. “History, after all, has little patience for ceremonial delays,” he said. “It records only those who stood firm when others hid behind procedure.” A risk of constitutional overlap Lawyer Ayman Zafar argued that while the Constitution envisions “a single CM as the executive head of a province, the real dispute lies in interpretation.“ “The key question is whether the outgoing CM has been constitutionally removed before proceeding to elect a successor,” she said. “While the Constitution does not require the governor’s formal acceptance of a CM’s resignation, Article 133 allows the governor to request the CM to continue until a new one is appointed.” She cautioned that the governor’s inaction may, in effect, trigger Article 133 — allowing the incumbent to remain in office until a successor is chosen through a settled process. “Proceeding with the election of a new CM before the incumbent’s position is conclusively settled risks creating a constitutional overlap,” Zafar noted. “Even if quorum is technically met, the absence of procedural clarity may undermine the legitimacy of the outcome and invite judicial scrutiny.” But to others, the legality of Afridi’s election is beyond dispute. The democratic and constitutional process stands complete “There is no legal or constitutional provision requiring the governor of KP’s assent for the former Chief Minister’s resignation to become effective,” asserted lawyer Zainab Shahid. “As per Article 130(8), the only requirement is that the CM resigns ‘by writing under his hand addressed to the governor’. The former CM has done so twice.” Shahid termed the governor’s repeated rejection of Gandapur’s letters — first denying receipt, then objecting to mismatched signatures — “illegal attempts to delay the appointment of an ‘undesirable’ new Chief Ministerial nominee and obstruct a democratic vote.” “Once the former CM has resigned through multiple letters and publicly declared his resignation,” she said, “there is no bar on the KP Assembly from convening to elect a new CM.” With Afridi securing 90 out of 145 votes, Shahid argued that the democratic and constitutional process stands complete. “All state institutions and actors should accept this outcome as the rightful will of the people of KP,” she added, “instead of continuing to make a mockery of the Constitution.” Assembly move aims to fill, not split, CM office Lawyer Basil Nabi Malik offered a more nuanced interpretation rooted in Articles 130 and 133 of the Constitution. “Article 130 permits the CM to resign by submitting a resignation to the governor,” Malik explained. “Nowhere does the Constitution require the governor to exercise any form of discretion in accepting or rejecting the resignation. In fact, Article 130 does not give the governor any decision-making powers.” When read alongside Article 133 — which empowers the governor to ask the CM to continue until a successor is appointed — Malik said: “ a reasonable interpretation of the said provisions may be that upon submission of his resignation to the governor, the resignation would become effective, and thereafter, any refusal or avoidance of the governor to accept it would be considered as merely an invocation of Article 133, that is, the CM continues in office till a successor is appointed.“ “There is an alternative interpretation,” he noted, “regarding whether the Governor ‘asking’ for the CM’s continuation under Article 133 is binding or non-binding. However, interpreting Article 133 as non-binding may lead to a legal and political vacuum — which perhaps would not have been the legislature’s intent.” In that sense, Malik suggested, the assembly’s recent election “could be seen as an attempt to appoint a successor to the CM office as opposed to creating two parallel CM positions.”",

A constitutional anomaly unfolds Lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig termed the situation “a constitutional anomaly,” questioning both the governor’s delay and the speaker’s haste. “While the governor’s refusal to accept the chief minister’s resignation is inexplicable given that the former has publicly confirmed the same,” Baig noted, “the speaker’s decision to call a session to elect a new chief minister before the acceptance of CM Gandapur’s resignation is a constitutional anomaly.” Baig pointed out that the Constitution provides a clear timeline in certain situations, such as when a chief minister dissolves the assembly, the decision takes effect within 48 hours even if the governor does not act. “Interestingly, no similar provision exists in the event that the chief minister resigns,” he said. In Baig’s assessment, though, the speaker may have overstepped. “While the Assembly may have voted CM Gandapur out through a vote of no confidence or while the courts’ jurisdiction may have been invoked against the governor’s procrastination, the KP speaker’s decision is untenable.” History has little patience for delays “While there can’t be two CMs at once, the central principle is this: ceremonial bottlenecks cannot defeat the Assembly’s will,” said lawyer Ahmad Maudood Ausaf. “If a governor frustrates and tries to delay that process beyond reasonable verification, as has been the case here, by that point, a letter, another letter, a speech, and a tweet should have sufficed.” Ausaf added that “any court would view it as unconstitutional, especially since the courts — Punjab and Peshawar — have intervened before to prevent such artificial, managed, and unconstitutional manoeuvring.” In his view, a mere opposition walkout cannot invalidate a process where quorum is met and the assembly’s will is clear. “History, after all, has little patience for ceremonial delays,” he said. “It records only those who stood firm when others hid behind procedure.” A risk of constitutional overlap Lawyer Ayman Zafar argued that while the Constitution envisions “a single CM as the executive head of a province, the real dispute lies in interpretation.“ “The key question is whether the outgoing CM has been constitutionally removed before proceeding to elect a successor,” she said. “While the Constitution does not require the governor’s formal acceptance of a CM’s resignation, Article 133 allows the governor to request the CM to continue until a new one is appointed.” She cautioned that the governor’s inaction may, in effect, trigger Article 133 — allowing the incumbent to remain in office until a successor is chosen through a settled process. “Proceeding with the election of a new CM before the incumbent’s position is conclusively settled risks creating a constitutional overlap,” Zafar noted. “Even if quorum is technically met, the absence of procedural clarity may undermine the legitimacy of the outcome and invite judicial scrutiny.” But to others, the legality of Afridi’s election is beyond dispute. The democratic and constitutional process stands complete “There is no legal or constitutional provision requiring the governor of KP’s assent for the former Chief Minister’s resignation to become effective,” asserted lawyer Zainab Shahid. “As per Article 130(8), the only requirement is that the CM resigns ‘by writing under his hand addressed to the governor’. The former CM has done so twice.” Shahid termed the governor’s repeated rejection of Gandapur’s letters — first denying receipt, then objecting to mismatched signatures — “illegal attempts to delay the appointment of an ‘undesirable’ new Chief Ministerial nominee and obstruct a democratic vote.” “Once the former CM has resigned through multiple letters and publicly declared his resignation,” she said, “there is no bar on the KP Assembly from convening to elect a new CM.” With Afridi securing 90 out of 145 votes, Shahid argued that the democratic and constitutional process stands complete. “All state institutions and actors should accept this outcome as the rightful will of the people of KP,” she added, “instead of continuing to make a mockery of the Constitution.” Assembly move aims to fill, not split, CM office Lawyer Basil Nabi Malik offered a more nuanced interpretation rooted in Articles 130 and 133 of the Constitution. “Article 130 permits the CM to resign by submitting a resignation to the governor,” Malik explained. “Nowhere does the Constitution require the governor to exercise any form of discretion in accepting or rejecting the resignation. In fact, Article 130 does not give the governor any decision-making powers.” When read alongside Article 133 — which empowers the governor to ask the CM to continue until a successor is appointed — Malik said: “ a reasonable interpretation of the said provisions may be that upon submission of his resignation to the governor, the resignation would become effective, and thereafter, any refusal or avoidance of the governor to accept it would be considered as merely an invocation of Article 133, that is, the CM continues in office till a successor is appointed.“ “There is an alternative interpretation,” he noted, “regarding whether the Governor ‘asking’ for the CM’s continuation under Article 133 is binding or non-binding. However, interpreting Article 133 as non-binding may lead to a legal and political vacuum — which perhaps would not have been the legislature’s intent.” In that sense, Malik suggested, the assembly’s recent election “could be seen as an attempt to appoint a successor to the CM office as opposed to creating two parallel CM positions.”",

      "summary": "In a day of high political drama at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, PTI’s Sohail Afridi was elected the province’s new chief minister. However, his victory unfolded amid walkouts, protests, and a deepening constitutional crisis over whether the outgoing CM, Ali Amin Gandapur, had even truly vacated his seat. As chants of “Sohail Afridi zindabad ” echoed through the assembly hall, the opposition staged a walkout, declaring the entire process “unconstitutional.” Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, however, pressed ahead and ruled it lawful under Article 130, declaring Afridi’s election valid even as questions swirled over Gandapur’s disputed resignation, returned by Governor Faisal Karim Kundi for having “disparate signatures.” The episode has set off a flurry of debate: can a new chief minister be elected when the previous one still holds office? Lawyers have since weighed in, dissecting whether the assembly’s actions uphold or undermine the constitutional process. An attempt to thwart the will of the many “The opposition walkout means nothing; just as the governor pretending to become Sherlock Holmes about signatures matching is irrelevant,” remarked lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii. “The CM resigned — his resignation is effective immediately. The house has chosen a new leader.” In his view, the matter is straightforward: there is only one chief minister in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, “the one the majority of the members of the provincial assembly voted for today.” Any attempt to halt that process, he argued, “is a sorry and desperate game of the few attempting to thwart the will of the many.” As Jaferii pointed out, political actors often justify such manoeuvres by citing past precedent, but that, too, fails the constitutional test. “The excuse we are presented with is that it has happened before too,” he said. “No one even bothers to deny that it is as wrong now as it was then and that it is the constitutional order that pays the price.” While he argued that the assembly’s vote is decisive and the governor’s signature drama irrelevant, some lawyers see a clear breach of constitutional procedure.

The court declared that Section 21-F of the ATA explicitly excludes terrorists from eligibility for clemency or sentence reduction, leaving no room for interpretation or relaxation. A two-member bench comprising Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail and Justice Najamuddin Mengal announced the verdict while hearing several constitutional petitions filed in 2023 and 2024, dismissing all of them collectively. According to the judgement, the petitioners had argued that they were entitled to the president’s pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution and to general or special remission under the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978. However, the court held that the insertion of Section 21-F in 2001 was specifically intended to permanently exclude terrorism convicts from the scope of pardons. The bench noted that the amendment was a deliberate legislative act aimed at protecting public safety amid rising incidents of terrorism. The court emphasised that the Anti-Terrorism Act is a special law that takes precedence over general laws, including the Prisons Act of 1894. It further rejected the argument that denying remission to terrorism convicts violates Article 25 (Equality Before Law) of the Constitution, stating that terrorism convicts constitute a distinct legal class, and such classification is reasonable and constitutionally valid. Citing precedents from the Supreme Court cases of Sherwani, Government of Balochistan vs. Azizullah, and Dr Mubashir Hassan vs. Federation of Pakistan, the bench affirmed that reasonable classification is permissible under the Constitution. The court directed the Home Depar­t­ment, Inspector General of Prisons, and relevant superintendents to immediately revoke all illegal remissions granted contrary to the law and recalculate the sentences of affected inmates.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Monday appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan after border skirmishes between the two countries over the weekend, saying he was “good at making peace”. Intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. The US president, since returning to the White House for his second term in January, had repeatedly insisted in the run up to the Nobel peace prize that he deserved the award for his role in resolving eight conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated. The US president touched on the border hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan while speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel. Tel Aviv and Hamas are set to carry out a hostage-prisoner exchange as part of the first phase of the Gaza peace plan proposed by Trump. During the interaction with the media, a reporter stated that the US president was receiving credit from Democrats and Republicans for securing the peace deal in Gaza. “Where do you think it fits into your legacy?” the reporter asked. “This will be my eighth war that I’ve solved. And I hear now there’s a war going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan. I said, ‘I’ll have to wait till I get back’. I am doing another one’. Because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace and it is an honour to do it. I save millions of lives,” he said. Commenting on the Nobel peace prize being awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, he said: “In all fairness to the Nobel committee, it was for 2024 … But there are those that say you could make an exception cause a lot of things happened during 2025 that are done and completed and great. “But I did this not for Nobel, I did this for saving lives,” he said. “Think about India-Pakistan. Think about some of the wars that were going on for years. We had one going for 31 [years], one going for 32 [years] and one going for 37 years. And I got every one of those done, for the most part, within a day. It’s pretty good,” he said. He went on to say that he had settled “a few of the wars just based on tariffs”. “With India and Pakistan, I said if you guys want to fight a war and you have nuclear weapons, I’m going to put big tariffs on you both; like a 100 per cent, a 150pc and 200pc … I had that thing settled in 24 hours. If I didn’t have tariffs you could have never settled that war,” he said. Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the May conflict between India and Pakistan. The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Additional input from AFP and Reuters",
