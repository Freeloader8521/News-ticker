The Korean Railway Workers' Union announced it would launch the strike at 9 a.m. Tuesday if there is no change in the government's stance. The union shelved a planned strike last week after reaching a tentative deal on key issues with the government but claimed on Friday that the government has failed to keep its promise. One of the key points of contention is changing the current compensation system that caps performance bonuses at 80 percent of base pay. The union argued for performance bonuses to be set at 100 percent of base pay like other public institutions. \"The essence of the current situation is an issue of trust, not wages,\" the union said in a statement. \"How can rail workers trust the government and work when even the finance ministry does not keep its promise.\" Along with the strike, the union plans to hold rallies near the presidential office in central Seoul on Tuesday.",

      "title_orig": "India’s ‘unlawful use of force’ in Pakistan after Pahalgam attack violated rights to life, security: UN experts",
      "summary_orig": "United Nation (UN) experts have expressed concerns that India‘s “unlawful use of force“ on Pakistan’s territory in response to the April 22 Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir appears to have “violated the rights to life and security of person”, it emerged on Friday. This observation by UN special rapporteurs was made in a report dated October 16, which was made public on December 15. The report outlined India‘s military response to the Pahalgam attack, as well as New Delhi’s decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in “abeyance” following the incident. The five UN experts who compiled the report also observed that New Delhi’s actions that “may be taken to disrupt the flow of water to Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty” appeared to risk violating the rights to work and livelihood, an adequate standard of living — including the rights to water and food — a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and development. The attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22 resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”. A day after the attack, India decided to immediately hold the IWT in “abeyance”. For its part, Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war” , noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension. Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin. Roughly two weeks after the Pahalgam incident, India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, an act which led to the worst between the old foes in decades. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles , artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people , before agreeing to a ceasefire . UN special rapporteurs on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, on the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as an independent on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order discussed these events in detail in their October report. ‘Unlawful use of force’ The UN experts noted that while India maintained it had exercised its “right to respond and preempt, as well as deter … cross-border attacks” by lauching strikes in Pakistan, New Delhi “did not notify the UN Security Council that its operation was in the exercise to of the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, under the procedures required by that article“. They emphasised that Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law “prohibits India from the threat or use of armed force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Pakistan, whether such force is targeting state or non-state actors”. “We note further that under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and customary international law, India may only exercise the right of self-defence in foreign territory where it is necessary and proportionate in response to an armed attack committed by a foreign state, whether directly by state forces or where a state ‘sends’ non-state forces to attack,” they added. The experts further highlighted that Article 51 required “the victim state“ to report the armed attack to the Security Council. “There is no separate right to unilaterally use military force in foreign territory in order to counter terrorism.” The experts also said, “We are concerned that India has not disclosed credible evidence that the militants who committed the Pahalgam attack were sent to attack India by the Government of Pakistan.” Reiterating that India had not notified the Security Council of any claim of self-defence in carrying out strikes in Pakistan, they experts observed: “It appears that India has violated the prohibition on the use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and may itself have committed an armed attack on Pakistan, entitling Pakistan to exercise self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter, risking escalation that could pose grave danger to life in both states.” “The unlawful use of force would consequently constitute a violation of the right to life under Article 6 of the ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights),“ the experts said. They further noted that “the illegal use of force on foreign territory would also constitute a violation of the foreign state’s sovereignty and the duty of non-intervention in a foreign state”. ‘Abeyance’ of IWT Discussing the “abeyance” of IWT by India in a unilateral action, the UN experts highlighted its significance for Pakistan. They noted that rivers irrigate 18 million hectares of farmland in the country (about 80 percent of Pakistan’s arable land), particularly in the food bowl provinces of Punjab and Sindh, contributing 24 per cent of Pakistan’s gross domestic product. “The rivers are thus vital in providing food security and livelihoods within Pakistan’s population of 240 million people. Limited water storage in Pakistan means that it relies on the unimpeded flow of river water. “Any disruption of the flow of water under the Indus Waters Treaty (such as by filling large pondage pools and reservoirs, opening dam gates to flood downstream, or the mass release of sediment) could have serious impacts onistan, human rights in Pak including the right to work and livelihood, the right to an adequate standard of living (including the right to water and the right to food), the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and the right to development,” they said. The experts further stated that Pakistan was “already a water-stressed country and is one of the ten countries most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including water scarcity”. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also mentioned the findings of the report with regard to the IWT when addressing the diplomatic corps in Islamabad on Friday. More to follow",

      "summary_orig": "For decades, public mobilisation followed a predictable path in Pakistan: political parties issued calls, clerics announced processions, and unions organised marches. The police relied on this structure for years — negotiating with leaders, planning routes, and anticipating escalation based on past patterns. But crowds across the country no longer mobilise the way our institutions imagine them. That world is gone. Today’s crowd forms inside a smartphone long before it appears on the street. A short video, an edited clip, a voice note, or a rumour forwarded through WhatsApp can spark movement faster than any political directive. TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube have become Pakistan’s real mobilisation engines. Their algorithms reward emotionally charged content — anger, outrage, victimhood, religious sentiment — and rapidly push it to millions. When virality becomes a security threat Having commanded almost 11,861 public order operations in Lahore — including political protests, religious marches, Muharram and Ashura processions, and Independence Day crowds — one reality has become increasingly clear: the crowd forms digitally before it forms physically. By the time the first police unit arrives at a disturbance, the emotional ignition has already occurred online. This is not traditional mobilisation. This is algorithmic mobilisation. A telling example is the fabricated rape alert that circulated among students of the Punjab College for Women last year. It went instantly viral, triggering the mobilisation of thousands in major cities across the province. In another instance, in October 2025, a pro-Palestine protest near Lahore’s Press Club initially remained peaceful before turning violent following the spread of incendiary content and live clips online. What happened next was triggered by an algorithm-driven surge. A crowd of hundreds and thousands attempted to target a sensitive building, creating a high-risk security situation. The protest was brought under control through rapid containment, controlled use of force, leadership isolation and engagement with organisers. Subsequently, critical infrastructure was secured. Mobilisation, when it is religious, becomes even more rapid and volatile — a short sermon, a recycled clip, a video cunningly cropped to imply blasphemy. They travel at the speed of light. In several instances, painstaking negotiations built over days collapsed the moment such a clip began circulating, triggering spontaneous gatherings far beyond the anticipated scale. Muharram and other religious events now unfold alongside a parallel digital arena that is often more combustible than the physical procession itself. During a Chehlum procession in 2024, a brief sectarian altercation occurred at Pir Makki Cut after a small group violated pre-approved procession routes. An unauthorised crossing led to verbal provocation and a minor physical confrontation. However, context-stripped videos of the incident were rapidly amplified online, inflating the perceived threat far beyond the ground reality and creating the risk of wider mobilisation. The situation was ultimately contained through immediate physical separation, strict route enforcement, and negotiations with local Shia and Sunni elders, preventing an algorithm-driven digital escalation from translating into street-level disorder. And Independence Day in Lahore revealed a new phenomenon altogether: p erformative disorder . Large groups (mostly young) were not motivated by politics or grievance but by visibility. Their behaviour was shaped by the possibility of going viral. Livestreams encouraged risk-taking, aggression and harassment. Despite these shifts, Pakistan’s policing model remains rooted in assumptions that no longer hold. Managing viral mobilisation beyond force We still prepare for events by focusing on the number of participants, the political leadership involved, and the route. But algorithmic crowds do not follow leaders, do not mobilise gradually, and do not behave predictably. Their motivation is shaped less by ideology and more by emotion — and emotion today is engineered by digital platforms. Simply put, our public order challenges now begin online. If Pakistan is to manage these rapidly changing patterns of mobilisation, it must adopt a digital-first approach to public safety, which includes establishing specialised units dedicated to monitoring real-time digital sentiment, identifying viral triggers, and tracking the spread of provocative content. Safe City authorities, telecom regulators, and intelligence agencies must work together to create a unified operational picture that combines online signals with on-ground indicators. This shift is already occurring, but primarily through a law-and-order lens. Punjab is moving to legislate a dedicated Riot Management Unit (RMU) under the Police Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2025, aimed at responding to “unlawful” protests and mobs through specialised training and equipment. The proposed law would empower authorities to declare riot zones, cordon off areas, evacuate civilians, and provide legal cover to RMU personnel acting “in good faith”. It also seeks to hold protest organisers and instigators financially liable for damage to life and property, while expanding punitive reach through harsher penalties, including up to 10 years’ imprisonment and heavy fines for violence or vandalism during protests. Yet, enforcement alone cannot keep pace with digitally driven mobilisation. Equally important is the use of predictive analytics and heat maps — tools that can detect when online anger is clustering around specific locations, identities, or events. Standard operating procedures must be updated to treat digital triggers as early warning signals, not background noise. Public order units must be capable of responding within minutes, not hours, before misinformation hardens into mass mobilisation. This urgency exists within a broader security environment where the state is under constant pressure to demonstrate control. Evolving beyond batons Pakistan’s repeated calls for neighbouring countries to address cross-border terror concerns, alongside domestic incidents such as the killing of a key murder suspect during an Abbottabad operation, reflect an institutional climate where decisiveness is prioritised amid volatility. In such a setting, public order management risks becoming reactive and force-centric unless it is recalibrated for the digital age. None of this means restricting speech or policing dissent. It means recognising that public order today is shaped by forces operating far faster than conventional intelligence systems were designed to handle. When a video travels faster than verification, and outrage spreads faster than reason, policing must evolve beyond batons, barricades, and after-action reports. Pakistan is entering a period where crowds will form faster, disperse faster, and act more unpredictably than ever before. If institutions fail to adapt, the next major crisis will not begin with a political announcement or a religious sermon, but with a 12-second clip circulating on a platform engineered to reward emotion. To preserve public safety, the state must begin by accepting a simple truth: the crowd now begins in the feed, not on the street.",

      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday sounded the alarm over India’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab River, which have caused consternation among farmers in Punjab. He made the remarks while addressing an urgent media briefing for the diplomatic corps in Islamabad, a day after the Foreign Office said it had sought a clarification from India via a letter over the sudden variation in the Chenab River’s flow. At the beginning of his briefing, Dar said he wished to draw attention to a situation that threatened peace and stability in South Asia. “We witnessed in April this year India’s unilateral abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) … But what we are witnessing now is material breaches by India that strike at the heart of the IWT with escalating consequences for regional stability and sanctity of international law,” he said. “We have observed unusual, abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab River twice this year,” he said, adding that these were observed from April 30 to May 21 and from Dec 7 to Dec 15. “These variations in water flow are of extreme concern to Pakistan as they point to the unilateral release of water by India into the Chenab River. India has released this water without any prior notification or any data or information sharing with Pakistan as required under the treaty,” he said. “India’s manipulation of water has prompted our Indus water commissioner to write a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matter as provided in the IWT,” he said. He further said that India’s most recent action “clearly exemplifies the weaponisation of water to which Pakistan has been consistently drawing attention of the international community”. “India’s manipulation of water at a critical time of our agricultural cycle directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as the food and economic security of our citizens,” he said. Dar said that Pakistan expected India to respond to the queries raised by the country’s Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flows, and fulfil all its obligations in letter and spirit under the IWT provisions. “Recent violations of the treaty by India are just one example. India has consistently attempted to undermine the treaty in a systemic manner,” he said. The deputy prime minister said that India‘s construction of hydropower projects such as Kishanganga and Ratle involved design features that violated the treaty’s technical specifications. “India continues to build illegal dams in sheer disregard of the treaty obligations to impose fait accompli. With the building of dams, Indian capacity to store and manipulate water is also increasing which endangers Pakistan’s security, economy, and the livelihood of 240 million people,” he said. Dar said India had halted sharing information, hydrological data, and joint oversight required by the treaty, which had exposed Pakistan to floods and droughts. “Such illegal and irresponsible Indian conduct has all the potential to trigger a humanitarian crisis in Pakistan,“ he asserted, adding that ongoing water manipulation by India was in violation of international and humanitarian law. “If India is allowed to violate the treaty and obligations under the treaty with impunity, we are setting a very dangerous precedent,“ he said. Dar further said that India was also subverting the treaty’s dispute resolution mechanism by refusing to participate in the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) and neutral expert proceedings. “India is pursuing a deliberate strategy to sabotage a well-established arbitration process under the treaty provisions. Pakistan would like to reiterate that the IWT is a binding legal instrument that has made an invaluable contribution to the peace and stability of South Asia,” he said. He said that violating the treaty threatened the inviolability of international treaties and also posed serious threats to regional peace and security. He noted that PCA had recently reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute resolution mechanisms. In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. “These rulings leave no ambiguity that the IWT is alive and its provisions remain binding on the parties,” he said, calling on the international community to reject “Indian impunity“. He also talked about a report by UN rapporteurs, saying that they had also expressed concern regarding India’s actions in connection with the IWT. Dar noted that the report was made public on December 15. “As per the report, on June 21, India’s home minister declared that India would never restore the treaty and would instead divert to India’s Rajasthan via a new canal,” he said. He went on to say that the same report said that on April 21, Pakistan’s national security committee declared that any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water to Pakistan under the treaty will be considered as an act of war”. On the matter of holding the IWT in abeyance, Dar said that the report observed that the action risked affecting the “human rights of millions of people in Pakistan”. Dar once again called on the international community to take notice of India’s “continued disregard” of a bilateral treaty and counsel India to act “responsibly”. The minister also took note of “belligerent statements” from Indian leadership, which he said demonstrated India’s “intentions, designs to weaponise water aimed at inflicting harm to Pakistan and its people”. “We have repeatedly brought the situation to the attention of the UN Security Council (UNSC),” he said. He said that he had also written to the UN secretary general and the president of the UN General Assembly to play their “due role” in the matter. Dar once again reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes with India; however, he warned that Pakistan “will not compromise on the existential water rights of its people”. As the minister concluded his address, he urged the international community, particularly UNSC members, “to take immediate steps to address this situation”. He expressed optimism that the international community, in its capacity, will call on India to “restore the IWT in full, stop the weaponisation of water, uphold international law and treaty obligations and refrain from undermining the peace and stability of South Asia”. “Water is life, and it can not be weaponised,” Dar concluded. According to daily reports of the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the situation related to inflows and outflows at Marala headworks on the Chenab River was found to be alarming from Dec 9 to Dec 18. The inflows and outflows at Marala were monitored on the said dates with 10,100 and 3,800 cusecs on Dec 9, respectively, 6,900 and 1,500 cusecs on Dec 10. India had held the IWT in abeyance in April following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war” , noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.",

India has released this water without any prior notification or any data or information sharing with Pakistan as required under the treaty,” he said. “India’s manipulation of water has prompted our Indus water commissioner to write a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matter as provided in the IWT,” he said. He further said that India’s most recent action “clearly exemplifies the weaponisation of water to which Pakistan has been consistently drawing attention of the international community”. “India’s manipulation of water at a critical time of our agricultural cycle directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as the food and economic security of our citizens,” he said. Dar said that Pakistan expected India to respond to the queries raised by the country’s Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flows, and fulfil all its obligations in letter and spirit under the IWT provisions. “Recent violations of the treaty by India are just one example. India has consistently attempted to undermine the treaty in a systemic manner,” he said. The deputy prime minister said that India‘s construction of hydropower projects such as Kishanganga and Ratle involved design features that violated the treaty’s technical specifications. “India continues to build illegal dams in sheer disregard of the treaty obligations to impose fait accompli. With the building of dams, Indian capacity to store and manipulate water is also increasing which endangers Pakistan’s security, economy, and the livelihood of 240 million people,” he said. Dar said India had halted sharing information, hydrological data, and joint oversight required by the treaty, which had exposed Pakistan to floods and droughts. “Such illegal and irresponsible Indian conduct has all the potential to trigger a humanitarian crisis in Pakistan,“ he asserted, adding that ongoing water manipulation by India was in violation of international and humanitarian law. “If India is allowed to violate the treaty and obligations under the treaty with impunity, we are setting a very dangerous precedent,“ he said. Dar further said that India was also subverting the treaty’s dispute resolution mechanism by refusing to participate in the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) and neutral expert proceedings. “India is pursuing a deliberate strategy to sabotage a well-established arbitration process under the treaty provisions. Pakistan would like to reiterate that the IWT is a binding legal instrument that has made an invaluable contribution to the peace and stability of South Asia,” he said. He said that violating the treaty threatened the inviolability of international treaties and also posed serious threats to regional peace and security. He noted that PCA had recently reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute resolution mechanisms. In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. “These rulings leave no ambiguity that the IWT is alive and its provisions remain binding on the parties,” he said, calling on the international community to reject “Indian impunity“. He also talked about a report by UN rapporteurs, saying that they had also expressed concern regarding India’s actions in connection with the IWT. Dar noted that the report was made public on December 15. “As per the report, on June 21, India’s home minister declared that India would never restore the treaty and would instead divert to India’s Rajasthan via a new canal,” he said. He went on to say that the same report said that on April 21, Pakistan’s national security committee declared that any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water to Pakistan under the treaty will be considered as an act of war”. On the matter of holding the IWT in abeyance, Dar said that the report observed that the action risked affecting the “human rights of millions of people in Pakistan”. Dar once again called on the international community to take notice of India’s “continued disregard” of a bilateral treaty and counsel India to act “responsibly”. The minister also took note of “belligerent statements” from Indian leadership, which he said demonstrated India’s “intentions, designs to weaponise water aimed at inflicting harm to Pakistan and its people”. “We have repeatedly brought the situation to the attention of the UN Security Council (UNSC),” he said. He said that he had also written to the UN secretary general and the president of the UN General Assembly to play their “due role” in the matter. Dar once again reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes with India; however, he warned that Pakistan “will not compromise on the existential water rights of its people”. As the minister concluded his address, he urged the international community, particularly UNSC members, “to take immediate steps to address this situation”. He expressed optimism that the international community, in its capacity, will call on India to “restore the IWT in full, stop the weaponisation of water, uphold international law and treaty obligations and refrain from undermining the peace and stability of South Asia”. “Water is life, and it can not be weaponised,” Dar concluded. According to daily reports of the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the situation related to inflows and outflows at Marala headworks on the Chenab River was found to be alarming from Dec 9 to Dec 18. The inflows and outflows at Marala were monitored on the said dates with 10,100 and 3,800 cusecs on Dec 9, respectively, 6,900 and 1,500 cusecs on Dec 10. India had held the IWT in abeyance in April following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war” , noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.",

      "summary_orig": "Four terrorists were killed after they attacked the battalion headquarters of security forces in the Boya area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district on Friday, security sources said. The sources identified the terrorists as those belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij , a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. One of the “suicide bombers” among the terrorists rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a wall of the Boya fort on Friday morning, causing a blast, the sources said. The powerful blast was heard as far as Miranshah city, located nearly 25 kilometres away, local sources reported. Around four to five terrorists attempted to enter the fort after the blast, but the attempt was foiled due to timely action by security personnel, security sources said, adding that three terrorists were killed on the spot as a result of the action. The sources said there were reports that security personnel had encircled one of the remaining terrorists, and an operation was currently under way. According to them, only the outer wall of the battalion headquarters was partially damaged in the attack. Initially, police had reported that assailants managed to enter the premises and opened fire. In the ensuing exchange of fire, four militants were killed while four security personnel sustained injuries, police earlier said. Soon after the explosion, security forces cordoned off the area and launched a clearance operation. A heavy contingent of police and security personnel reached the site, while special teams of the bomb disposal squad were dispatched to examine the scene. Rescue 1122 and medical teams were also engaged in relief and rescue operations. Authorities said evidence was being collected from the site as investigations were under way Following the attack, security across the district was placed on high alert, and traffic on a key highway was temporarily suspended as a precautionary measure. The incident comes two months after four terrorists were killed after security forces foiled a suicide attack on a military camp in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali. State media reported at the time that one terrorist rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the wall of the security forces’ camp after which three more tried to enter it. Friday’s incident comes as a spate of terrorist attacks continues in Pakistan. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters.",

      "summary_orig": "Police and paramilitary troops fanned out across Dhaka and other cities in Bangladesh on Friday after violent protests overnight over the death of a popular youth leader, with concerns of further unrest ahead of national elections in which he was due to run. Streets were calm in the morning, but residents in the Muslim-majority South Asian nation said they were worried there could be fresh violence after Friday prayers later in the day. Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, was a spokesperson for the Inquilab Mancha, or Platform for Revolution, and participated in the student-led protests that overthrew the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last year. He was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last Friday while launching his campaign for the elections. Hadi was initially treated at a local hospital before being flown to Singapore for advanced medical care, where he died after spending six days on life support. Hadi was an outspoken critic of India, and Inquilab Mancha describes itself on its website as a revolutionary cultural platform inspired by the spirit of uprising. In Dhaka, videos circulating on social media showed mobs vandalising the offices of the country’s largest daily newspaper, Prothom Alo , as well as The Daily Star , on Thursday night. The demonstrations were marked by emotionally charged slogans invoking Hadi’s name, with protesters vowing to continue their movement and demanding swift justice. Several areas remained tense, with additional police and paramilitary forces deployed to prevent further violence. The fire service said the blaze at The Daily Star was under control. Troops were deployed to the scene, and firefighters rescued journalists trapped inside the building. Pressure on the government Bangladesh has been governed by an interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus since August 2024, after Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising. The government has been grappling with fresh protests over delayed reforms, and warnings of unrest by Hasina’s party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the vote. The elections are scheduled for February 12. In a televised address to the nation following Hadis death, Yunus said: “His passing represents an irreplaceable loss to the nation’s political and democratic sphere.” Urging citizens to remain calm, Yunus said the government was committed to ensuring a transparent investigation and bringing all those responsible to justice. He also appealed for restraint, warning that violence would only undermine the country’s path toward a credible election. The interim administration has declared Saturday a day of state mourning in honour of Hadi, with national flags to be flown at half-mast and special prayers planned across the country. The home of the country’s first president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of Hasina, was vandalised and set on fire once again, after having been attacked twice previously in February and August last year. New Age editor Nurul Kabir, who also heads the country’s Editors Council, was harassed by protesters outside The Daily Star building on Thursday night as they vandalised the premises, with videos showing him pushed into a crowd, verbally abused as an Awami League collaborator, and having his hair pulled. In Dhaka, the premises of the prominent Bengali cultural organisation Chhayanaut were vandalised and torched. In the northwestern district of Rajshahi, protesters demolished an Awami League party office using a bulldozer, while demonstrators blocked major highways in several other districts. Violence was also reported in a number of cities across Bangladesh, including the port city of Chittagong, where protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission and set fire to a house belonging to a former Awami League education minister. The unrest follows fresh anti-India protests earlier in the week, with ties between the neighbours deteriorating since Hasina fled to Delhi. On Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators under the banner July Oikya (July Unity) marched toward the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, chanting anti-India slogans, while also demanding the return of Hasina.",

      "summary_orig": "Faisal Karim Kundi • KP governor wants PTI founder to be shifted to prison in other city or province • Says PTI workers’ daily protests near jail ‘continuous source of inconvenience’ CHINIOT: Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Thursday demanded that the government shift incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan to a prison in another city or province, as party activists, due to their daily protests near Adiala jail, had become a continuous source of inconvenience. “Whenever any foreign dignitary arrives, PTI workers either threaten to shut down Islamabad and Peshawar or stage long protest processions in the federal capital,” he said while addressing a press co­­nference at Rajoa House in Chin­iot, where he had arrived to condo­­le with PPP Central Punjab Gen­e­ral Secretary Syed Hassan Murt­aza over the death of his father. He added that after Pakistan’s success in a clash with New Delhi in May, the country had earned respect within the global community. “Heads of state are visiting Pakistan to strengthen trade ties, but foreign dignitaries are forced to put up with protests by PTI workers,” he continued. “Even those who come from KP to Islamabad for shopping go to Adiala Jail to have their names registered on the list of those who hold press conferences outside the jail,” he added. “I therefore request the chief minister [Maryam Nawaz] to shift him to any other jail in Punjab or another province for the protection of other prisoners and to ease the lives of the people of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.” Mr Kundi maintained that the entire KP government, including its chief minister, visited Adiala jail instead of working for the betterment of the people of the province. “They stage ‘shows’ there and disturb the lives of people living in and travelling through the area,” he said. He complained that the Punjab government was not implementing the jail manual, and providing gym and other facilities to Mr Khan that were not available to any other prisoner in the country. Illegal Afghan immigrants He welcomed the KP government’s policy shift to send illegal Afghan immigrants and refugees back to their homeland. He said Pakistan hosted millions of Afghans during the war and now it was time for them to return. “Whenever there is a terrorist activity or an attack on a sensitive installation, Afghan terrorists are found to be involved,” he claimed. To a question about the ‘Minus Imran Khan’ formula, the KP governor said many PTI leaders themselves wanted to sideline him and keep him in prison so that their businesses could continue. On the 28th Amendment, he said the amendment was a reality; however, its contents had not been shared with the PPP leadership. “We supported the 26th and 27th Amendments and will support future ones if they are needed for the sake of the country,” he said. He said that the National Accountability Bureau had become a tool for “kidnap for ransom”, as it arrested corrupt individuals and allowed them to walk away scot-free after paying money through plea bargains. Mr Kundi claimed that most KP Assembly members were proclaimed offenders and wanted by Islamabad police. He questioned why the police were not arresting them. “The Islamabad police must arrest them when they roam the streets of Islamabad,” he said. He said PTI was moving ahead with “imported leaders” like Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas becau­­se the party lacked any person to run its parliamentary affairs.

The report, a regular feature, reiterates that Afghanistan remains a staging ground for some of the most lethal terrorist outfits in the world. Pakistan, which has been a victim of the TTP, based in Afghanistan, has known this painful reality for years. The report notes that over 20 international and regional terrorist organisations currently call Afghanistan home. These include IS-K, Al Qaeda, the TTP and ETIM, among others. With the exception of IS-K, these groups have good relations with the Afghan Taliban. Importantly, the report says that the Taliban’s claims that no militant groups are based on their soil are “not credible”. For Pakistan, the TTP — largely due to the permissive environment it enjoys under Afghan Taliban rule — poses a major security challenge. The UN document says that the terrorist group has conducted over 600 attacks against this country in the current year. Moreover, TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud is believed to spend time in Kabul, while other anti-Pakistan terrorists, such as Gul Bahadur, are also based in Afghanistan. The report highlights links between the TTP and Al Qaeda, as well as ETIM. Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan, said to be a front for TTP and Al Qaeda fighters, is amongst the other terrorist groups active next door. Meanwhile, another matter of grave concern is the presence of madressahs run by IS-K near the Pakistani border. The details mentioned in the UN report shatter any illusion that Taliban-run Afghanistan poses no threat to its neighbours. On the contrary, just as it used to be before the US-led invasion, Afghanistan has become a safe haven for extremely dangerous and violent militant outfits that threaten the region and the world. And while the report says that there are differences within the upper echelons of the Taliban leadership on how to deal with the TTP, Kabul’s rulers are unlikely to take action against the group, as the regime may actually “lack the ability to do so”. This should be a matter of great concern for the international community, particularly Afghanistan’s neighbours. Nearly all states bordering Afghanistan have experienced terrorist attacks carried out by groups based on Afghan soil, with Pakistan the hardest hit. The way forward does not seem to be clear-cut. More conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan will not solve the problem in the long run. Talks with the Kabul regime have also failed to provide meaningful outcomes. In such a situation, perhaps the least bad option is to reach out to the relatively ‘moderate’ elements within the Taliban set-up, and press upon them the need to stop terrorists from threatening Afghanistan’s neighbours.

      "summary_orig": "LITERATURE on teacher impact shows that good teaching provides a significant delta on student learning, compared to average or poor teaching. Simply put, teachers matter and good teaching is important for ensuring better learning outcomes. However, recruiting, motivating, and keeping good teachers gainfully and efficiently employed is not easy. In Pakistan, a couple of decades back, teacher recruitment was seen as having too much discretion with not enough reliance on rules. Allegations of corruption and nepotism in teacher recruitment were common. Many of these charges were based on facts. Two decades ago, reforms were introduced to move to more rules-based ( merit-based ) recruitment. This has definitely reduced the allegations, and litigation on recruitment issues has also decreased. But has it improved teacher and/or teaching quality? Has it improved student learning? And what unintended consequences has it led to? These are important follow-ups for completing the loop for feedback and continuous improvement. ‘Merit’-based recruitment might reduce corruption, but does it allow us to differentiate between good and bad teachers? If not, the reform might be of limited value. Many places worldwide have significant requirements for specific courses, diplomas and even degrees before a person can become a teacher. When we moved towards merit-based recruitment, provincial governments removed the requirements for education degrees before joining as a teacher. This has increased the pool of candidates for teaching (a physics graduate can come into teaching directly) but many of these applicants did not choose to be teachers and have no understanding of what teaching is: you can be good at physics but teach it badly. How has this impacted learning outcomes? Some jurisdictions even have teacher licensing. Teacher licensing has often been talked about in Pakistan but it was only recently that Sindh introduced it. But will licensing improve teaching and learning? We have 1.5 million or so teachers in Pakistan and still suffer a shortage. Will licensing help? Is it only for government schools or also private schools? Will teachers be required to have licences in low-fee private schools, where sometimes they teach Matriculation- or Intermediate-level students? Who will pay for the cost? Recruiting, motivating, and keeping good teachers efficiently employed is not easy. Once a teacher has been recruited, is she a teacher forever? Does she need any education, training or upgradation? Is there a role for continuous professional development and how is it to be structured? Punjab has some 450,000 teachers. How do you design effective professional development systems for such large numbers? Do we design devolved systems or centralised ones? How do we ensure quality and some level of uniformity across the system? We have had continuing professional development systems in place, but the general feeling is that they don’t seem to work and haven’t had the intended impact and definitely not the one needed. Once deployed, how do we keep teachers motivated to teach effectively for the entire length of their careers — 30-35 years? What are effective career paths for teachers? If a teacher is a good Grade 1 teacher today, how do we ensure that she will be a good, motivated and effective Grade 1 teacher in 10, 20 or 30 years from now? What should happen to her financial returns and other ‘incentives’ so that she is able to have a rewarding career in Grade 1? We do not have research on most of these important questions. Which means we do not have effective feedback loops on policies. Policies keep coming and getting implemented. But what consequences do they have? How can we improve if we don’t have effective feedback loops that research consequences and impact? What is heartening is that there is an increasing realisation — in government and academia and among development partners and research institutions — of the need to have these feedback loops and to do relevant policy research on important questions. Most education departments already have specific implementation and planning units to structure some of this work. Development partners have historically funded and encouraged some research, but this has recently become more structured and is being given due importance. Academic research output has also been steadily increasing in education in Pakistan. The most recent and current impetus has come from a very innovative research support programme funded by FCDO and called the Data and Research in Education-Research Consortium. DARE-RC has funded some 35 studies in the education sector, five to six of them on teacher issues. These studies are in collaboration with education departments. The programme is of medium term (it just closed the fourth round of call for proposals). The results of the studies will allow us to bring out relevant issues more clearly, and some of them will start answering some of the questions raised above. By focusing on local researchers, the programme is also developing the capacity for research in education in Pakistan and a community of practice in the area. The hope is that other programmes, following this one and funded by government and partners, will continue to build on this approach, so that we not only have answers to the questions but also the local capacity to do such work. We will always have more questions and we need communities and people who are able to answer them so that we can keep improving outcomes in education. Pakistan must have around 1.5-2m teachers today. With millions of children still out of school, and with most in-school children getting a poor quality of education across the country, we need more teachers — more motivated and committed teachers — and a lot more teacher training to ensure better content knowledge as well as a sound understanding of optimal pedagogical strategies. We also need much better policies for management and regulation of teaching, and effective feedback loops to ensure things keep improving. In this context, DARE-RC offers an interesting model for developing the capacity needed for such work. I hope education departments will not only look at the outcomes of the research studies being done under DARE-RC, but also at how the research capacity being built can be strengthened and deepened beyond the programme. This is important if we are to ensure our policies improve over time. Published in Dawn, December 19th, 2025",

Will teachers be required to have licences in low-fee private schools, where sometimes they teach Matriculation- or Intermediate-level students? Who will pay for the cost? Recruiting, motivating, and keeping good teachers efficiently employed is not easy. Once a teacher has been recruited, is she a teacher forever? Does she need any education, training or upgradation? Is there a role for continuous professional development and how is it to be structured? Punjab has some 450,000 teachers. How do you design effective professional development systems for such large numbers? Do we design devolved systems or centralised ones? How do we ensure quality and some level of uniformity across the system? We have had continuing professional development systems in place, but the general feeling is that they don’t seem to work and haven’t had the intended impact and definitely not the one needed. Once deployed, how do we keep teachers motivated to teach effectively for the entire length of their careers — 30-35 years? What are effective career paths for teachers? If a teacher is a good Grade 1 teacher today, how do we ensure that she will be a good, motivated and effective Grade 1 teacher in 10, 20 or 30 years from now? What should happen to her financial returns and other ‘incentives’ so that she is able to have a rewarding career in Grade 1? We do not have research on most of these important questions. Which means we do not have effective feedback loops on policies. Policies keep coming and getting implemented. But what consequences do they have? How can we improve if we don’t have effective feedback loops that research consequences and impact? What is heartening is that there is an increasing realisation — in government and academia and among development partners and research institutions — of the need to have these feedback loops and to do relevant policy research on important questions. Most education departments already have specific implementation and planning units to structure some of this work. Development partners have historically funded and encouraged some research, but this has recently become more structured and is being given due importance. Academic research output has also been steadily increasing in education in Pakistan. The most recent and current impetus has come from a very innovative research support programme funded by FCDO and called the Data and Research in Education-Research Consortium. DARE-RC has funded some 35 studies in the education sector, five to six of them on teacher issues. These studies are in collaboration with education departments. The programme is of medium term (it just closed the fourth round of call for proposals). The results of the studies will allow us to bring out relevant issues more clearly, and some of them will start answering some of the questions raised above. By focusing on local researchers, the programme is also developing the capacity for research in education in Pakistan and a community of practice in the area. The hope is that other programmes, following this one and funded by government and partners, will continue to build on this approach, so that we not only have answers to the questions but also the local capacity to do such work. We will always have more questions and we need communities and people who are able to answer them so that we can keep improving outcomes in education. Pakistan must have around 1.5-2m teachers today. With millions of children still out of school, and with most in-school children getting a poor quality of education across the country, we need more teachers — more motivated and committed teachers — and a lot more teacher training to ensure better content knowledge as well as a sound understanding of optimal pedagogical strategies. We also need much better policies for management and regulation of teaching, and effective feedback loops to ensure things keep improving. In this context, DARE-RC offers an interesting model for developing the capacity needed for such work. I hope education departments will not only look at the outcomes of the research studies being done under DARE-RC, but also at how the research capacity being built can be strengthened and deepened beyond the programme. This is important if we are to ensure our policies improve over time. Published in Dawn, December 19th, 2025",

      "summary": "LITERATURE on teacher impact shows that good teaching provides a significant delta on student learning, compared to average or poor teaching. Simply put, teachers matter and good teaching is important for ensuring better learning outcomes. However, recruiting, motivating, and keeping good teachers gainfully and efficiently employed is not easy. In Pakistan, a couple of decades back, teacher recruitment was seen as having too much discretion with not enough reliance on rules. Allegations of corruption and nepotism in teacher recruitment were common. Many of these charges were based on facts. Two decades ago, reforms were introduced to move to more rules-based ( merit-based ) recruitment. This has definitely reduced the allegations, and litigation on recruitment issues has also decreased. But has it improved teacher and/or teaching quality? Has it improved student learning? And what unintended consequences has it led to? These are important follow-ups for completing the loop for feedback and continuous improvement. ‘Merit’-based recruitment might reduce corruption, but does it allow us to differentiate between good and bad teachers? If not, the reform might be of limited value. Many places worldwide have significant requirements for specific courses, diplomas and even degrees before a person can become a teacher. When we moved towards merit-based recruitment, provincial governments removed the requirements for education degrees before joining as a teacher. This has increased the pool of candidates for teaching (a physics graduate can come into teaching directly) but many of these applicants did not choose to be teachers and have no understanding of what teaching is: you can be good at physics but teach it badly. How has this impacted learning outcomes? Some jurisdictions even have teacher licensing. Teacher licensing has often been talked about in Pakistan but it was only recently that Sindh introduced it. But will licensing improve teaching and learning? We have 1.5 million or so teachers in Pakistan and still suffer a shortage. Will licensing help? Is it only for government schools or also private schools? Will teachers be required to have licences in low-fee private schools, where sometimes they teach Matriculation- or Intermediate-level students? Who will pay for the cost?

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Former Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sohail Aman has described attacks on Pakistan in May this year as a strategic mistake by India. “They underestimated our military power and thought we will not react. They never expected a befitting response,” he said while speaking at a seminar here. The seminar was organised by an overseas Pakistanis group led by Barrister Shehzada Hayat, in collaboration with the Pakistan Ex-Servicemen Society (PESS), headed by Senator retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum to pay homage to Pakistan’s martyrs, express solidarity with the armed forces, and commemorate the 149th birth anniversary of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The former air chief said the telling response by Pakistan shattered the myth of “shining India”. He chided India for blaming Chinese help to Pakistan for its failure saying “If we have Chinese JF-17 aircraft, you also have Rafale jets. Overseas Pakistanis’ contribution to national economy praised He made it clear that Chinese pilots did not come to fight with India during the four-day tension between the two South Asian nuclear powers. Highlighting the importance of air power, he referred to founding father of Pakistan Quaid-i-Azam’s remarks that a nation without a strong air force is at the mercy of any aggressor. Air Marshal Aman said wars were not just about aircraft and tanks and stressed the key role of support assets. He stressed that air power and technology-driven capabilities have become central to modern national security. Emphasising institutional development, education, and indigenous capability, he underlined the importance of linking research, operations and innovation. He cautioned that Pakistan must prioritise its national interest and avoid involvement in others’ wars. He also stressed the need for embracing smaller provinces and honouring those who rendered sacrifices for the country. Federal Minister for Investment and Chairman of Board of Investment,Qaiser Sheikh, said the event reflected Pakistan’s core values of sacrifice, unity and resilience. He paid tribute to martyrs and lauded the armed forces for safeguarding the country’s sovereignty and stability. The minister emphasised the role of overseas Pakistanis as economic contributors and goodwill ambassadors, reaffirming the government’s commitment to improving investor confidence and promoting Pakistan as an attractive investment destination. Speaking on the occasion, Senator retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum highlighted the contributions of overseas Pakistanis to the country’s economy, calling them Pakistan’s ambassadors and an economic lifeline.

      "summary_orig": "Sultan Aziz Azzam, a spokesperson for Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), was arrested by Pakistani authorities this year, a recent report submitted to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has revealed. IS-K is a branch of the Islamic State terrorist organisation active in Central and South Asia, according to the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank. The UN’s 16th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team noted that IS-K’s ability to operate in the region had been degraded as a result of high-profile arrests by Pakistan, such as that of Azzam from the border region this May. The state-run Associated Press of Pakistan said that Azzam was arrested by intelligence agencies during an operation near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The APP report claimed that following his arrest, IS-K propaganda arms, such as the Al-Azaim Foundation, had suffered a major blow. “Overall, the capability of [IS-K] has been degraded as a result of counter-terrorism operations,” the UN report read. “Key [IS-K] commanders and ideologues have been neutralised, and the numbers of [IS-K] fighters have likely been reduced. Several plotted attacks have been disrupted.” It further noted that IS-K’s capability to operate freely on both sides of the border has been disrupted, but acknowledged that Kabul’s claims of no terrorist groups operating in or from their soil are “not credible”. “The Taliban contend that no terrorist groups operate in or from Afghanistan,” the report read. “Member state reporting, however, indicates that a range of terrorist groups still operate in the country, with varying degrees of autonomy and oversight from Taliban authorities.” It added: “In North Afghanistan and areas close to the Pakistani borders, [IS-K] is reported to have indoctrinated children in madressahs, establishing a suicide training course for minors around 14 years of age.” In a December 8 letter, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar Ahmed, requested that the report be brought to the attention of the UN Security Council (UNSC). Who is Azzam? The UNSC says that Azzam held the position of IS-K spokesperson since the group first established itself in Afghanistan in 2015. Islamabad-based platform The Khorasan Diary stated that he is the group’s second-in-command, while the European Council says he operated their media branch, Al-Azaim Media . Shan A Zain wrote for Jamestown Foundation’s Militant Leadership Monitor journal that Azzam was born in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province and, before becoming IS-K’s chief propagandist, worked for at least three local radio stations and wrote books and poetry. His major work, Travelers of the Maze , tells the purported stories of IS fighters living in the Spin Ghar mountains, according to Zain. Excerpts were shared over Telegram by would-be recruits. “Sultan Aziz Azzam has been credited with recruiting IS members to carry out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan,” Zain wrote. “He has written several books and articles narrating stories about [fighters] in order to inspire people to join IS ranks.” “As [IS-K’s] spokesperson, Azam has played an instrumental role in spreading ISIL’s violent … ideology, glorifying and justifying terrorist acts,” the UNSC’s website reads. “Building on his former experience as an Afghan journalist, his activity as [IS-K’s] spokesperson has increased [IS-K’s] visibility and influence among its followers.” Azzam claimed responsibility on behalf of IK-K for an August 26, 2021, suicide attack near Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul and circulated messages from the group following the assassination of three female journalists on March 2, 2021 and a prison attack in Jalalabad on August 3, 2020. Previous action against IS-K in Pakistan In June this year, then-United States Central Command (Centcom) commander Army General Michael Kurilla praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism, citing the nation’s struggle against IS-K among other actors. “Through a relationship we have with them and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals,” Kurilla said. “They have extradited back Jaffar, who was one of the key individuals behind the Abbey Gate bombing ,” he added, referring to IS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah, an Afghan national who was arrested by Pakistan earlier this year. In November, a key IS-K commander was killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak in a late-evening police operation, sources told Dawn. Sources said that acting on an intelligence tip-off, police raided a hideout in Ambari village in Karak district. An exchange of fire ensued, resulting in the death of Nisar Hakim, a key IS-K commander.",

      "summary_orig": "• 1,200 policemen, anti-riot personnel deployed; number of pickets increased • Party leaders return without visiting Imran after being barred by prison authorities RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: As the PTI staged two sit-ins outside the jail in as many weeks, the Punjab government has deployed more than 1,200 police officials, installed additional pickets, and deployed anti-riot police in the vicinity of Adiala jail, in an apparent bid to pre-empt such protests. Separately, the jail authorities also barred the PTI leaders, including KP’s former finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra, who had arrived in Rawalpindi to meet their incarcerated party chief, Imran Khan. According to the Islamabad High Court, Mr Khan can have two weekly meetings with his family and party leaders, but the authorities have routinely restricted such visits, much to the PTI’s chagrin. Last Tuesday, the PTI leaders staged a protest, which was dispersed by police with water cannons after midnight. In a seemingly pre-emptive measure that would dissuade protesters from congregating outside the prison, protective measures around the jail have now been strengthened. Besides more than 1200 police personnel, including the Elite Force and women police, four police squads have been put on standby for emergencies. The police will be equipped with rubber bullets, tear gas shells, and other anti-riot tools. Similarly, one police picket was established at the jail’s gate and the second was established at Gate 5, while two pickets were set up at the Gorakhpur Road and near the Shaighan Factory. The area was also inspected by the Special Branch personnel and the bomb disposal squad for security measures. In addition, traffic police wardens, remained on patrol in the area to keep the flow of traffic smooth during the proceedings of cases inside the jail. On Thursday, about 25 PTI supporters, including MPAs, visited the jail but returned empty-handed. PTI leaders return without meeting The PTI leaders, after spending a couple of hours outside the prison, returned after the jail administration did not allow them to meet Mr Khan. Talking to Dawn , Mr Jhagra said that the PTI leaders reached Adiala after 2pm and started waiting for permission to meet Imran Khan. He said the police told them they had no orders to allow them to enter the jail. “We waited there till 4:30pm and then decided to leave,” he said. PTI leaders, including Aftab Alam, Adnan Qadri, Pir Musavir Khan, Muhammad Israr, Liaqat Ali Khan, and Taimur Khan Jhagra, had come to meet Imran Khan but they were denied permission. This time, the PTI did not give the name of KP CM Sohail Afridi for the meeting. Speaking to media outside the prison, he warned the ‘powers that be’ to beware of the day when things would go out of the hands of the party and people would take things into their own hands and take to the streets. Mr Jhagra said that government functionaries were claiming, while giving interviews to foreign media, including Sky News , that 870 meetings with Mr Khan had been allowed. “However, the fact is that since October 2024, as many as 60 weeks have passed but not a single meeting between Imran Khan and his political friends has been allowed. Party leaders arrive here every week, but they are not allowed to meet Imran. On the other hand, during the last 60 weeks, Imran’s relatives have been allowed to meet him just once or twice,” he said. To a question, Mr Jhagra said the major issue was that only Imran Khan’s narrative had credibility while the hybrid system has no credibility. To another query, he said it was unfortunate that an ATA case was registered against peaceful protesters. “We have been trying to convince the global community that we are fighting a war against terrorism, but cases of terrorism are being registered against PTI workers. How can we convince the world that we are against terrorism,” he wondered. When asked why Sohail Afridi had not come, Mr Jhagra said that the KP CM has a double responsibility. “He is running the province, along with making efforts to secure the release of Imran Khan. He holds a cabinet meeting every week,” he said. To a question about why the PTI was not giving a call for street agitation, he said that it was also the responsibility of the party to protect the lives of workers and not expose them to bullets.

      "summary_orig": "As the Foreign Office sought clarification from India via a letter over a sudden variation in the Chenab River’s flow, the situation is badly affecting wheat and other crops being fed through the Marala-Ravi link and other canals in various parts of Punjab. “The situation is really disturbing as the Chenab River’s control from upstream (India) is being handled by the Indian authorities through various run-of-the-river hydropower projects,” a senior official of the Punjab Irrigation Department said while speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity. “When India releases the water from dams towards downstream (Pakistan) without informing us, the flow suddenly increases. Sometimes, they hold water for days, reducing flow massively,” he said. He continued, “Once the river inflows recorded at Marala reduced to 1,500 cusecs, leaving us with no option but to stop outflows.” “The situation is very serious and strange for us, as the growers, in several villages, couldn’t water wheat crops due to the lack of water flow they used to receive through various canals.” According to daily reports of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the situation related to inflows and outflows at Marala headworks was found to be alarming from December 9-18. The inflows and outflows at Marala were monitored on the said dates with 10,100 and 3,800 cusecs on December 9, respectively, 6,900 and 1,500 cusecs on December 10. No outflows were monitored from Dec. 11-17, with 3,700 cusecs of inflows on Dec. 11, 3,800 on Dec. 12, 3,000 on Dec. 13, 2,000 on Dec. 14, 2,000 on Dec. 15, 1,800 on Dec. 16 and 3,800 on Dec. 17. Ameer Langra, a local grower of Mauza Sahib Langra from Baqir Pur Union Council, Kabirwala, Khanewal, told Dawn , they face difficulty irrigating the wheat crop and have to purchase water from tube well owners when there is no water in designated channels. “Sometimes, we see a sudden rise in water courses, while other times the respective canals and water courses don’t receive a single drop of water,” he said, adding that a large number of growers weren’t able to water their crops fully. “It is affecting the main and other crops as well.” Langra told Dawn that his area was already facing water scarcity due to the closure of a large number of tube wells after the recent floods swept them away. “We appeal to the government to help us and ensure water availability to save our farming.” Pakistan Kissan Ittehad President Khalid Khokar, while speaking to Dawn, condemned the Indian government for water aggression and termed it a serious violation of the Indus Water Treaty. “Many cultivators have complained about variations in water levels in the river and its impact on the agricultural activities,” he said, requesting the government to take up the issue with India and international forums. FO seeks clarification from India Earlier today, in a weekly press briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi shared that a letter had been written to India seeking clarification about the “abrupt variation” in the flow of the Chenab River, noting the matter had been in the news in the past week. Several media outlets reported this week that India had released water into the Chenab River. “Pakistan views these variations with extreme concern and seriousness. They allude to unilateral release of water into the Chenab River by India, without any prior notification,” Andrabi said. “Our Indus water commissioner has written a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matters in accordance with the procedures enshrined in the Indus Waters Treaty,” he said. “Any manipulation of river flow by India, especially at a critical time of our agricultural cycle, directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as food and economic security of our citizens,” he said. “We call upon India to respond to the queries raised by the Pakistani Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flow and fulfil its obligations in letter and spirit under the Indus Water Treaty provisions,” he said. He further said that the Indus Waters Treaty was a “binding international agreement”, which had been “an instrument of peace and security and stability in the region”. Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin. Andrabi said that violating the treaty threatened the “inviolability of international treaties and compliance with international law” and also posed a serious threat to “regional peace, principles of good neighbourliness, and norms governing interstate relations”. “The international community must take notice of India’s continued disregard of a bilateral treaty, and counsel India to act responsibly and in accordance with international law and established norms as well as its own obligations,” Andrabi said. “Pakistan remains committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes and issues with India but will not compromise on the existential water rights of the people of our country,” he said. In April, India had held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war” , noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. The supplemental award was issued in a 2023 case that Pakistan brought to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty. Removal of Indian woman’s hijab During his press briefing, the FO spokesperson also talked about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar pulling down a female doctor’s hijab this week, a move which had invited criticism. Noting the incident, Andrabi said that the incident was followed by the “public mocking” of a minister from Uttar Pradesh. A minister from Uttar Pradesh had defended Kumar, before backtracking. “The forcible removal of the Muslim woman’s hijab by a senior political leader and subsequent public ridicule of this act are deeply disturbing and warrant strong condemnation,” he said. “The action risks normalising the humiliation of Muslim women in India. The conduct also demonstrates public disrespect of India’s religious minorities, particularly its Muslim citizens,” he said. “Such conduct reflects a broader and troubling pattern associated with Hindutva-inspired politics, namely the alarming rise of religious intolerance and Islamophobia,” he added. “We urge all responsible stakeholders and the Indian government to recognise the seriousness of this incident and to reaffirm their commitment to the protection of minority rights, respect for religious freedom, and the preservation of human dignity,” he said.",
