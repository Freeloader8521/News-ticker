      "summary_orig": "Mobile networks and the internet were restored across Afghanistan on Wednesday, 48 hours after the Taliban authorities shut down telecommunications. Confusion gripped the South Asian country on Monday night when mobile phone service and the internet went down without warning, freezing businesses and cutting Afghans off from the rest of the world. The massive blackout came weeks after the government began cutting high-speed internet connections to some provinces to prevent “immorality”, on the orders of shadowy supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada. AFP journalists reported on Wednesday that mobile phone signals and wifi had returned to provinces across the country, including Kandahar in the south, Khost in the east, central Ghazni, and Herat in the west. The Taliban government has yet to comment on the telecommunications shutdown. On Wednesday night, hundreds of Afghans poured onto the streets in the capital Kabul, spreading the word that the internet was back. “It’s like Eidul Azha; it’s like preparing to go for prayer,” said 26-year-old Sohrab Ahmadi, a delivery driver. “We are very happy from the bottom of our hearts.” After days of tension, Afghans celebrated by buying sweets and balloons, as drivers honked their horns, phones pressed to their ears. “The city is alive again,” Mohammad Tawab Farooqi, a restaurant manager in the city told AFP . Businesses, airports, banks closed It is the first time since the Taliban government won their insurgency in 2021 and imposed a strict version of Islamic law that communications have been cut in the country. Netblocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cybersecurity and internet governance, said the blackout “appears consistent with the intentional disconnection of service”. It said connectivity had slowed to one per cent of ordinary levels. A government official warned AFP minutes before the shutdown on Monday evening that the fibre optic network would be cut, affecting mobile phone services, “until further notice”. There were widespread closures of businesses, airports, and markets, while banks and post offices were unable to operate. Afghans were unable to contact each other in or out of the country, and many families stopped their children from going to school during the uncertainty. Those living in Herat and Kandahar travelled to border towns to catch signals from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan. The United Nations said on Tuesday the shutdown “left Afghanistan almost completely cut off from the outside world”, and called on authorities to restore access. Internet connections have been extremely slow or intermittent over the past weeks. On September 16, when the first internet services were first cut in northern provinces, Balkh provincial spokesman Attaullah Zaid said the ban had been ordered by the Taliban’s leader. “This measure was taken to prevent vice, and alternative options will be put in place across the country to meet connectivity needs,” he wrote on social media. “Recent studies in Afghanistan found that internet applications have badly affected the ongoing, economic, cultural and religious foundations of society,” he said.",

The spokesperson said that the “terrorists had previously been involved in attacking security forces and belonged to a banned terrorist outfit.” “The slain terrorists have not yet been identified,” the spokesperson said, adding that their “bodies have been transferred to a hospital for identification purposes.” “Further investigation into the matter is underway,” the statement said. The Inter-Services Public Relations confirmed that 10 terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij were killed in a separate statement. The development comes a day after 10 people, including four security personnel, were martyred in a suicide car blast near the headquarters of the Frontier Corps (FC) in Quetta. The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency , have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of “terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan ”. The state has designated Balochistan-based groups such as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own forces apprehended four [terrorists] trying to flee cowardly by disguising in women’s attire,” the ISPR said. “Weapons and ammunition was also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” it added. The ISPR further said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, adding that security forces were determined to wipeout the “menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice”. Meanwhile, security forces carried out an IBO in Balochistan’s Kech District, where a terrorist hideout was busted and three Indian sponsored terrorists belonging to Fitna al Hindustan were successfully neutralised, the ISPR said. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the [dead] khwarij and terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” the military media wing said in a statement. “[The] security forces of Pakistan are determined to eliminate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism and their facilitators to justice.” Earlier, the ISPR said that an IBO had been carried out in Quetta district, in which 10 terrorists were killed . Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti congratulated security personnel on the successful IBOs in the province today. “Security forces conducted two successful operations against terrorists operating under Indian patronage,” he said in a statement, adding that 13 terrorists had been killed. “Security forces thwarted the evil intentions of terrorists, [and] the sacrifices of the forces for establishing peace in Balochistan are unforgettable.” Bugti said that operations in Balochistan would continue “until the complete elimination of terrorists operating under Indian patronage”. Last week, security forces killed 17 “India-sponsored” terrorists during an IBO in Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Additional reporting by Abdullah Zehri",

      "summary_orig": "PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira on Wednesday defended the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) as a “tried and tested” method for providing flood relief, while criticising what he called the “harsh tone” adopted in recent exchanges between his party and its coalition partner, the PML-N. “In the past few days, such questions have been raised that now a dialogue has begun, which, in our understanding, is not appropriate. It is neither beneficial for politics, nor for democracy,” he said at a press conference in Lahore. “And this is our [PPP’s] view, not a suggestion to anyone,” he added. The PPP and PML-N continued to engage in a war of words over flood relief, as PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asserted that the BISP was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the recent floods in the country, while PML-N’s Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz accused his party of “politicising” the issue. Furthermore, the tensions between the ruling coalition partners on Tuesday flared in parliament as the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest CM Nawaz’s diatribe against their party. “This is the first time that we decided to help the government without taking ministries in the government … without sharing power in the executive,” Kaira said at the press conference. “We did this so that the government, with unity, could resolve the country’s problems, and we could support it,” he added. He continued that his party would support the federal government in every possible way. “[We have] supported it on every issue, when Pakistan was at war we supported it, in assemblies we supported it, we supported legislation, we did no favour; we do not keep count of favours. We did this thinking that we must find solutions to the country’s crises. Otherwise, there were formulas for power sharing, formulas for terms … many formulas were discussed.” However, he added that the purpose was not to give the federal government “a blank cheque that whatever it does, whatever the PML-N does, we will support it“. “If our opinion proved better, they would accept it; if their views proved better, we would accept it. Otherwise, we would come to a middle ground and find a compromise, that is the method. We have tried this so far and will continue to do so.” But he regretted that in the “last few days, a two-way dialogue began and on one side of that dialogue are some colleagues of the PPP and on the other side, the Punjab government”. He said the recent floods caused immense damage, people’s homes were looted, crops destroyed, and human lives as well as livestock were lost. “Wherever there was any mistake, or where we thought there might be a better way to do the work, we gave our suggestions; if our suggestions were not accepted, we criticised [the move]; if we were not heard, we protested — this is our democratic right. And this is also the way. “If you do not accept it, if you do not want to do that, then fine, but we will tell the people of Punjab, we too are Punjabis. We will tell the people of Punjab that in our view this crisis has both immediate and long-term solutions. We will present our ways based on our experience.” Criticising CM Maryam’s remarks, he said: “Now if we give our suggestions and you do not listen and if we criticise [you], you say that you will not allow anyone to speak … and that if a finger is raised here, you will break it and you will not spare them. “We only offered ways to deal with the floods, but in response, the Sindh government was targeted. Some objections were very painful. We were accused of an electricity subsidy [and] other matters.” We know the present government is not at fault, but there are certain objections. The PPP chairman said that on the devastation caused by the floods, people must be given immediate relief, and that can be done through the BISP. That is a tried and tested method we have, and the other thing is that [you] should declare an agricultural emergency.” He continued that the BISP has now become a subject of debate; some want money to be disbursed through it, others do not. “So the cash grant under BISP is for immediate relief; it provides initial relief. And this is not the first time we have done this in 2023, 2022, 2010, 2011; such amounts were used for the flood-affected people. You did not accept that idea, that’s okay. We only give you our opinion.”",

We will present our ways based on our experience.” Criticising CM Maryam’s remarks, he said: “Now if we give our suggestions and you do not listen and if we criticise [you], you say that you will not allow anyone to speak … and that if a finger is raised here, you will break it and you will not spare them. “We only offered ways to deal with the floods, but in response, the Sindh government was targeted. Some objections were very painful. We were accused of an electricity subsidy [and] other matters.” We know the present government is not at fault, but there are certain objections. The PPP chairman said that on the devastation caused by the floods, people must be given immediate relief, and that can be done through the BISP. That is a tried and tested method we have, and the other thing is that [you] should declare an agricultural emergency.” He continued that the BISP has now become a subject of debate; some want money to be disbursed through it, others do not. “So the cash grant under BISP is for immediate relief; it provides initial relief. And this is not the first time we have done this in 2023, 2022, 2010, 2011; such amounts were used for the flood-affected people. You did not accept that idea, that’s okay. We only give you our opinion.”",

In the event of an attack on Qatar, the United States will “take all lawful and appropriate measures — including diplomatic, economic, and, if necessary, military — to defend the interests of the United States and of the State of Qatar and to restore peace and stability,” the order said. The agreement comes after an Israeli strike on the key US regional ally on September 9, targeting officials from Hamas who were discussing a US peace proposal to end the conflict in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Qatar’s prime minister from the White House on Monday, apologising for strikes and promising not to do so again, the United States said. Netanyahu was in Washington to meet Trump, and had until then been defiant since ordering the September 9 strikes.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Asia Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday refuted claims by Indian media that he had apologised to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the trophy handover issue at Sunday’s Asia Cup final. The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from the ACC chief, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. Subsequently, Indian skipper Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup. Later, Indian media alleged that Naqvi had himself refused to hand the trophy over to the Indian team. Today, several Indian outlets, including IndiaToday , Financial Express and Hindustan Times , reported that Naqvi had now apologised to the BCCI, but that he still refused to hand them the trophy. Responding to an India Today post about their report on social media platform X, Naqvi stated, “Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so.” He called the claims “fabricated nonsense” and “cheap propaganda”, saying it was aimed at misleading Indian people. The PCB chairman slammed India for continuing to “drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game”. “As ACC chairman, I was ready to hand over the trophy that very day and I am still ready now,” he said. “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.” During the Asia Cup, Naqvi had previously expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” from the Indian side after Yadav seemingly politicised the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May. Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention . Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. The PCB had lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Yadav’s remarks, leading to him reportedly being fined 30 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct. Meanwhile, pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against India. Following the final, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on winning the match, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor. Naqvi had also responded to Modi’s post on X, saying: “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”. “Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he had said.",

      "summary_orig": "MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Tuesday witnessed an overwhelming shutter-down and wheeljam strike on the second consecutive day amid intermittent skirmishes between law enforcers and activists in the state capital Muzaffarabad. The atmosphere was highly charged following the death of one person and injuries to several others a day earlier. Although government offices remained open, attendance was thin for want of transport. Banks were also open but hardly saw any client. All private businesses and shops, including medical stores, remained closed. Even street vendors were nowhere to be seen. Angry youngsters, some carrying batons, blocked intercity roads in many areas of the state capital till afternoon by placing different obstacles and torching bushes. Nevertheless, some private vehicles and motorcycles were seen running through the roads sporadically, without facing serious resistance from the activists. On receiving information about blockades, police personnel swiftly rushed to clear the road obstacles. Skirmishes reported between activists of JKJAAC and law enforcers in Muzaffarabad; angry youngsters block inter-city roads in many areas According to witnesses, at several such places they lobbed tear gas shells to quell disturbance and also made arrests. In some areas, law enforcers were also pelted with stones from the mountain slopes, forced them to retreat to safety. On Tuesday, there were reports of minor casualties on both sides, but these could not be verified as government officials refrained from sharing anything with the media. Authentic figures of detainees could not be obtained either. This correspondent tried to reach out to a number of senior officials, but their staff said “they were busy in meetings and unable to take calls”. One senior police official did attend the call after several attempts, but declined to confirm or contradict the number of detainees. By the afternoon, thousands of people gathered at Muzaffarabad’s Lal Chowk where Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) leaders, including Shaukat Nawaz Mir, addressed them. “A state is like a mother, but unfortunately ours has turned out to be a witch that killed its own children,” fumed Mr Mir. On Monday, Muhammad Sudhir, a 30-year-old shopkeeper belonging to Neelum Valley, was killed in Muzaffarabad after sustaining gunshot wounds. The JKJAAC alleged the shots were fired by the participants of a government-backed rally, led by Raja Saqib Majeed of Muslim Conference. Late on Monday night, relatives and other activists had placed his body on the main artery in Chehla Bandi negibourhood to press the authorities for registration of an FIR against Mr Majeed and other accused. The body was removed only after their demands were met. “We have full recording evidence as to who fired upon peaceful protesters and at whose behest,” Mr Mir said. Reports from Rawalakot said that thousands of people had assembled at Tourism Chowk, but police avoided confronting them. According to local journalists, the participants might start a march on Wednesday either to some entry points or straight to Muzaffarabad. In Dadyal, where tensions had escalated immensely in a similar protest in May last year, thousands of people threw huge containers into the river from Palaak Bridge where they had been placed by the administration, apparently to block movement between Kotli and Mirpur district. Media affected Meanwhile, the absolute suspension of internet and mobile phone services since Sunday hit the journalist community hard as no local newspaper could be published for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. Many of those working for the national and international media, as well as some of the vloggers, had to travel to Garhi Habibullah in the neighbouring KP, from where they filed their stories and uploaded the stuff on Sunday and Monday. But on Tuesday it was learnt that internet services had also been snapped in Garhi Habibullah, forcing some of the journalists to travel up to Mansehra for filing reports.

      "title_orig": "Philippines quake death toll rises to 69, official says",
      "summary_orig": "The death toll from a 6.9-magnitude earthquake that hit the central Philippines has risen to 69, a disaster official said on Wednesday as the government mobilised agencies to search for survivors and restore power and water supplies. In Bogo city in the north of Cebu province, which was near the epicentre of the shallow quake that struck off the coast just before 10pm on Tuesday, the hospital has been “overwhelmed,” Civil Defence official Raffy Alejandro told reporters. The death toll of 69 was based on data from the Cebu provincial disaster office and was subject to validation, said Jane Abapo, an information officer at the regional Civil Defence office. Another official said more than 150 people were injured. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr assured survivors of swift assistance, saying cabinet secretaries were on the ground directing relief operations, as he expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones. Cebu, one of the Philippines’ most popular tourist destinations, is home to 3.4 million people. Despite the damage, Mactan-Cebu International Airport, the country’s second busiest gateway, remained operational. Another hard-hit town, San Remigio, was placed under a state of calamity to help the response and relief efforts. Vice Mayor Alfie Reynes appealed for food and water for evacuees, as well as heavy equipment to aid search and rescue workers. “It is raining heavily and there is no electricity, so we really need help, especially in the northern part because there’s a scarcity of water after supply lines were damaged by the earthquake,” Reynes told DZMM radio. In the nearby town of Pilar, resident Archel Coraza said most of his family were asleep when their house began to shake violently. “I woke them up and we all rushed outside into the street,” he told DZMM . Coraza, who lives close to the shoreline, said he saw seawater recede after the tremor. Local media posted videos of people rushing out of their homes as the ground shook and buildings collapsed, including a church that was more than 100 years old. Reynes said among the deceased were some people who had been playing basketball in a sports complex in San Remigio when it partially collapsed due to the quake. Earthquake monitoring agencies put the quake’s depth at around 10km and recorded multiple aftershocks, the strongest having a magnitude of 6. There was no tsunami threat following the quake.

      "summary_en": "The death toll from a 6.9-magnitude earthquake that hit the central Philippines has risen to 69, a disaster official said on Wednesday as the government mobilised agencies to search for survivors and restore power and water supplies. In Bogo city in the north of Cebu province, which was near the epicentre of the shallow quake that struck off the coast just before 10pm on Tuesday, the hospital has been “overwhelmed,” Civil Defence official Raffy Alejandro told reporters. The death toll of 69 was based on data from the Cebu provincial disaster office and was subject to validation, said Jane Abapo, an information officer at the regional Civil Defence office. Another official said more than 150 people were injured. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr assured survivors of swift assistance, saying cabinet secretaries were on the ground directing relief operations, as he expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones. Cebu, one of the Philippines’ most popular tourist destinations, is home to 3.4 million people. Despite the damage, Mactan-Cebu International Airport, the country’s second busiest gateway, remained operational. Another hard-hit town, San Remigio, was placed under a state of calamity to help the response and relief efforts. Vice Mayor Alfie Reynes appealed for food and water for evacuees, as well as heavy equipment to aid search and rescue workers. “It is raining heavily and there is no electricity, so we really need help, especially in the northern part because there’s a scarcity of water after supply lines were damaged by the earthquake,” Reynes told DZMM radio. In the nearby town of Pilar, resident Archel Coraza said most of his family were asleep when their house began to shake violently. “I woke them up and we all rushed outside into the street,” he told DZMM . Coraza, who lives close to the shoreline, said he saw seawater recede after the tremor. Local media posted videos of people rushing out of their homes as the ground shook and buildings collapsed, including a church that was more than 100 years old.

      "summary_orig": "• ‘This is not our document’, says Dar about White House plan; sticks to joint statement from Muslim bloc • Reveals Indonesia has committed 20,000 troops; Islamabad expected to make a decision soon • Axios claims Netanyahu negotiated changes to draft agreed between Trump, Muslim leaders • US president gives Hamas ‘three to four days’ to agree to deal; insiders say group will ‘likely reject’ proposal ISLAMABAD / WASHI­N­GTON: A day after US President Donald Trump unveiled his ambitious plan to end the war in Ga­za, signs have began to emerge that not everyone is happy with the draft made public by White House. This was evident from Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s presser on Tuesday, where he made it clear in so many words that the US peace plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included. The “document has been issued by the US”, he said, seemingly distancing Pakistani decision-makers from the plan, even though Trump has previously claimed that both PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir are behind it ‘100pc’. “This is not our document, which we sent to them. There are some key areas that we want covered… If they are not covered, they will be covered,” he said. Consider Trump’s anno­u­ncement of the 20-point plan as “an announcement from their side”, he said. Mr Dar, who is also the deputy prime minister, added that Pakistan owned the joint statement given on behalf of eight Muslim countries. “If there is a difference, we will go by this,” he said. In response to a question, the foreign minister said the plan put forward by Trump envisions an independent technocrat government of Pales­tinians, to be overseen by an international body — mostly comprised of Palestinians. He was also guarded about the possibility of sending troops to become part of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF). “On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies… there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan’s leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said. Mr Dar maintained that this would be a special force for Gaza alone, and the arrangement for its deployment would be documented at the UN Security Council. Road to deal During the presser, Mr Dar expounded on the diplomatic process that led to the finalisation of the pea­ce plan, saying that one of the main purposes of attending the UN General Assembly was to work with some “like-minded countries” on trying to end the misery in Gaza as a “member of the Muslim ummah”. Eight countries, including Pakistan, agreed to take up this matter very proactively with President Trump during the US visit, he said. Dar said a preparatory meeting was held before the Muslim leaders’ huddle with Trump. The meeting with Trump was meant to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid to the strip without any hurdles, stop the forced displacement of Pales­tinians and make arrangements for the return of those displaced from the Gaza, plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and stop Israel’s attempts to annex the West Bank, he said. “These objectives were conveyed to him (Trump), and he was asked to work with us on achieving them,” Dar said, adding that the US president then proposed that his team would devise a “workable solution” with the foreign ministers of the eight Muslim countries that participated in the meeting. He said it was decided that the details of meetings held in this regard would be “secret” and “classified”. After sharing further details of how the proposal for ending the Isr­aeli onslaught in Gaza was finalised, Dar said he had received messages from the Saudi foreign minister. “He told me that five countries had reached a consensus on joint statem­ent [regarding the Gaza plan] and that our agreement was needed on this matter as well, and that they had also reached out to Indonesia and the UAE. “I then consulted the foreign secretary and proposed some changes. I spoke to the Saudi foreign minister again … as I had some objections … He then send me a revised version … and the joint statement was released.” When asked to assure that “you still believe in the two-state solution”, he said there was no change in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine. “And I rather would say the seven other countries are also with us on this.” The repeated reference to the Mus­lim bloc’s joint statement is being seen as a ‘mild protestation’ over cha­nges to the terms of the deal, which were ostensibly carried out at Israeli PM Benjamin Netan­yahu’s request. Changes to the draft According to US news outlet Axios , the deal now before Hamas is significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention. The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process. Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”. Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported. According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios. Quoting a senior Arab official involved in the negotiations, the Axios report said that while Netanyahu had managed to change the text, it still has a lot of very positive elements for the Palestinians. Deadline for Hamas After Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas on Monday, President Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal, or meet “a very sad end”. Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said Israeli and Arab leaders had already endorsed the plan and that “were just waiting for Hamas” to make its decision. “Hamas is either going to be doing it or not, and if it’s not, it’s going to be a very sad end,” Trump said as he left the White House. Asked whether there was scope for further talks on the proposal, he replied: “Not much.” A source close to Hamas told Reu­t­ers the plan was “completely biased to Israel” and imposed “impossible conditions” that aimed to eliminate the group. Qatar’s foreign ministry has said Hamas is studying the White House proposal “responsibly”. However, a senior Hamas figure told the BBC that the group is likely to reject Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, saying it “serves Israel’s interests” and “ignores those of the Palestinian people”. The source said the group is unlikely to agree to disarming and handing over their weapons. Published in Dawn, October 1st, 2025",
