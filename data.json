      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Monday called Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Karachi for an urgent meeting as tensions continued to rise between the Sindh and Punjab governments, with the PPP staging a walkout from the National Assembly and Senate. The PPP and PML-N are coalition partners in the Centre. A post on X from the presidency said today that Zardari and Naqvi held a telephonic conversation related to the ongoing row between the Sindh and Punjab governments. “President Asif Ali Zardari spoke to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi over the phone to discuss the recent tensions between the Sindh and Punjab governments. The president has called the interior minister to Karachi for an urgent meeting in this regard,” the post said. The PPP and the PML-N’s Punjab leadership have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues ranging from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government. The war of words between the two sides initially kicked off over flood compensation but expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP lawmakers decided to stay away from parliamentary proceedings last week to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs subsequently met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces. However, she declared on Friday that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47. The now-shelved six-canal project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his elder brother and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on Saturday and discussed with him the ‘growing tensions’ between the PPP and PML-N, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers. Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon alleged a day ago that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government. Partners continue to trade barbs as PPP stages walkout from Senate, NA The coalition partners continued to trade barbs today as Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari vented that the province had always played the role of a “big brother” during any natural calamity. She said the Punjab cabinet expressed regret that when the province passed through the challenges of the recent floods, the moment was seized and used for the sake of politics and interests. “The chief minister said she was saddened and, in her own words: ‘It is difficult for me to forget this. I didn’t expect that Punjab would be treated this way.’” Bokhari also assailed Memon for his remarks and said a “planted campaign” was being run against CM Maryam. “Ask all these people doing press conferences what they have done for flood affectees,” she said, also taking a dig at Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab. The Punjab minister further said that she accepted Memon’s challenge to have a debate. Responding to her, PPP Senator Quratulain Marri said Bokhari had a “phobia” of Sindh. “PML-N’s declaration of war against Sindh is a dangerous precedent, the consequences of which will not be good for the country,” she said. Marri also reiterated Memon’s allegation that the Punjab government was actually targeting the PPP to weaken the Centre and PM Shehbaz. In a video message, PPP Senator and Senior Vice President Sherry Rehman said the party had said nothing to suggest that it was manipulating the issue of floods and aid for politics. “If we are demanding relief for the people of Punjab and someone feels bad about it, that’s strange; Punjab is not anyone’s personal estate.” Speaking in the Senate later, she said the PPP had great concerns and the federation was in “sheer need” of stability amid the devastation wrought by the floods. She said it was “clear” that the “war of words” between Punjab and Sindh was affecting the federal coalition, saying that the PPP strove to maintain unity during tough times but when “lines were crossed”, the “Punjab card” was used and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s run as foreign minister was criticised, then such statements and remarks crossed the bounds of criticism and decency. Rehman added that the PPP had never managed a coalition before in such a manner and said that apologising did not lead to a decline in self-respect and stature but only increased them. “If our leadership is not apologised to, then the PPP is the biggest party in the Senate, count the numbers, we are by far the biggest party in this House and don’t take our support for granted in the coalition benches. We don’t want to break anything, but don’t take our support for granted. That is very clear,” she announced before leading a walkout of PPP senators from the proceedings. Responding to her, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said everyone had a right to protest under a democratic system, but ebbs and peaks were also a part of it. Tarar said he tried his best in the National Assembly that the recent statements from both sides did not affect parliamentary functioning. He highlighted that PML-N Senator and PM aide Rana Sanaullah had assured the PPP in the Senate that water distribution from the Indus River would only be carried out under the Irsa pact. The law minister also appreciated that Rehman voiced her party’s grievances in a “very sophisticated” manner, adding that President Zardari and Nawaz were both leaders favouring “reconciliation”. Addressing the opposition, the law minister stressed that the ongoing tensions were an “ordinary change in temperatures”. At this point, Senate Deputy Chairman Syedaal Khan, who hails from the PML-N, called on his party’s Anusha Rehman and Khalil Tahir Sandhu, as well as on Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Amir Waliuddin Chishti to go and convince the PPP lawmakers to return to the Upper House. Meanwhile, PTI Senator Ali Zafar quipped that they were witnessing a “historic contest” between the coalition allies. “The contest is very interesting. It is about who served [the people] better during the floods.” The PTI senator said that “surely the PPP prepared and may have prevented Sindh from being flooded, but only in books, not in reality”. Noting the Punjab government’s assertions of providing ample rescue and relief services, Zafar claimed, “Surely they must have given the aid, but this is strange and perplexing aid because it did not reach the flood victims, but perhaps went into their pockets.” The PTI senator assailed both government parties for contesting over “who held more press conferences rather than who built more houses”. Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser welcomed the PPP’s “friendly fire” amid applause from the opposition. “I feel that if they are serious, they should come and present a vote of no confidence, we will side with them.” His suggestion came after PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said that it was hard for his party to continue to participate in proceedings until it was given assurances by Punjab or any other authority. Ashraf subsequently led a walkout of PPP lawmakers from the Lower House. PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro addressed Qaiser’s suggestion in an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’ and said a mere sentence could not do anything and “reliablility” needed to be considered. “I don’t know how reliable the PTI are, has he talked to his party founder?” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "American scientists Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi from Japan won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for work shedding light on how the immune system spares healthy cells, creating openings for possible new autoimmune disease and cancer treatments. This year’s prize relates to peripheral immune tolerance, or “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight all imaginable microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”, said Marie Wahren-Herlenius, a rheumatology professor at the Karolinska Institute. Sakaguchi told reporters outside his university laboratory that “I feel it is a tremendous honour”, Kyodo news agency reported. Regulatory T cells: the immune system’s ‘security guards’ The winners for medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute medical university and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2m), as well as a gold medal presented by Sweden’s king. Brunkow is senior programme manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, while Ramsdell is scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi is a professor at Osaka University in Japan. “Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example, for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement. The laureates identified so-called regulatory T cells, which act as the immune system’s security guards that keep immune cells from attacking our own body, it added. After announcing the winners, the institute’s Thomas Perlmann said specific therapies had yet to win market clearance, but more than 200 trials on humans involving regulatory T cells were ongoing. Among companies in the early race, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, which Ramsdell co-founded, is partly funded and supported by US drugmaker Regeneron to work on therapies against diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. Also targeting that condition, Quell Therapeutics has partnered with AstraZeneca.  Other biotech firms exploring the approach include Bayer’s BlueRock. Medicine the first prize of Nobel season The Nobel Prizes were established through the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite and a wealthy businessman. They have been awarded since 1901 for outstanding contributions in science, literature, and peace, with interruptions mainly during the World Wars. The economics prize was added later and is funded by Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank. Winners are selected by expert committees from various institutions. All prizes are awarded in Stockholm, except for the Peace Prize, which is presented in Oslo — a possible legacy of the political union between Sweden and Norway during Nobel’s lifetime. Past recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine include renowned scientists such as Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 award for discovering penicillin. In recent years, the prize has recognised major breakthroughs, including those that enabled the development of Covid-19 vaccines . Last year’s medicine prize was awarded to US scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNA and its key role in how multicellular organisms grow and live, helping explain how cells specialise into different types. Medicine, in accordance with tradition, kicks off the annual Nobels, arguably the most prestigious prizes in science, literature, peace and economics, with the remainder set to be announced over the coming days. More than a century after their inception, the Nobel Prizes remain steeped in tradition. The awards culminate in ceremonies attended by the royal families of Sweden and Norway, followed by lavish banquets held on December 10 — the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday termed his Malaysian counterpart’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”, which he said would further augment engagement in this sector between the countries. The PM’s remarks came in a post on X after he addressed a joint press conference alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya following bilateral talks between the two leaders. PM Shehbaz had also mentioned during the press conference that the Malaysian premier had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan. PM Shehbaz, who reached Malaysia yesterday on a state visit, further shared in his post that he had a “most productive exchange of views with my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya today”. “We held wide-ranging discussions on ways to further strengthen our historic partnership — focusing on trade and investment, climate, defence, education, and tourism.” The prime minister added that the two leaders also had an in-depth discussion on regional and global developments, including the situation in the Middle East and South Asia. Both prime ministers “reaffirmed our shared resolve to continue working together for the peace, progress, and prosperity of our peoples,” PM Shehbaz said. Mentioning a “gracious and impressive welcome ceremony at Perdana Putra”, he thanked the Malaysian PM for the “warm and generous hospitality extended to me and my delegation”. Moreover, he said: “We also reflected on Allama Iqbal’s philosophy that the strength of a nation and the destiny of its people lie in the awakening of the self. It is through faith, effort, and perseverance that people shape their destiny. “Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and I shared our deep admiration for Allama Iqbal, whose message of faith and self-renewal continues to inspire generations across the Muslim world.” PM Shehbaz concluded his post saying that he was “looking forward to continued Pakistan–Malaysia collaboration across all areas of mutual interest”. Pakistan presents ‘immense’ business opportunities: PM Separately, after addressing the Malaysia Business Forum alongside his Malaysian counterpart, PM Shehbaz said he “invited Malaysian companies to seize the immense opportunities Pakistan offers”. In a post on X, the prime minister termed Pakistan as a “nation with a skilled and youthful workforce , a rapidly expanding market, and an investor-friendly business environment”. “With our economic trajectory on the rise and reforms unlocking new sectors, Pakistan offers a highly promising investment destination in the region,” the premier asserted. Addressing the Pakistan–Malaysia Business and Investment Conference alongside his Malaysian counterpart, the premier said he had a very “constructive and productive” meeting earlier in the day with PM Ibrahim, “who is very keen” that bilateral business relations between the two countries should improve further. “This seminar is a testimony of our joint desire that this is an area where we must cooperate with each other.” “We have a youth bulge, which is a challenge and also a great opportunity, and both Malaysia and Pakistan wish to use this asset,” said the prime minister. He added that the youth can be provided training in information technology, artificial intelligence, vocational training and modern skills to transform the challenge into a “great opportunity”. Referring to the tourism potential of Pakistan, PM Shehbaz said this is another area in which both Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur can cooperate. He suggested that companies from both countries can hold discussions to promote tourism and this initiative has the potential to be a “game changer”. ‘Pakistan wants to join hands for mutually beneficial projects’ Earlier, PM Shehbaz said during the press conference with Ibrahim alongside him that Pakistan wanted to “join hands” with Malaysia for mutually beneficial projects which allowed for expertise from the two countries to come together. The prime minister began his media talk by thanking Ibrahim on behalf of the people of Pakistan for extending an exceptionally warm welcome to the visiting delegation, and called Malaysia a “second home”. “This is my first visit to your great country but believe me, ever since we arrived here last night, I [see] familiar faces — very cordial, very warm — as if we have known each other for ages and that stems from sincerity of purpose and very true friendship. It’s like a family reunion,” he said. “The way you are focused on building your great country into one of the most strong economies in the region and around the globe speaks volumes about your leadership skills, vision, and dynamism,” the premier said. PM Shehbaz said that he and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and they had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters during a meeting held prior to the joint presser. “I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations. “Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic and trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas. “Today, I want to make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said. The premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger,” he said. He noted that Ibrahim, in his remarks, had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism. “It will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come, it will increase and have a quantum jump,” he said. The premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script , which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development. “These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said. He further said that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”. “When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before,” he said. Talking about Pakistan’s youth and their potential, he said, “If we can really dedicate ourselves to injecting modern technology in their souls, they will be great hands, great builders of Pakistan. I have no doubt about it,” he said. He concluded his remarks by expressing the wish for Malaysia to continue prospering. Later, the two premiers also witnessed an exchange of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between Pakistan and Malaysia. PM Ibrahim ‘extremely appreciative’ of Pakistan’s stance on Palestine In his remarks, the Malaysian premier acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities. He said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan. He stated there was also an interest regarding importing meat and Malaysia would facilitate this, noting that Shehbaz had mentioned exports worth $200 million. Ibrahim humourously quipped that when he visited PM Shehbaz at his hotel at night, the latter “politely suggested” this but also “harassed”. “So I certainly welcome that and will discuss with my team,” he said. Calling PM Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). “Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said. Regarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism. He also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestine and Gaza issue. “We jointly look favourably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald Trump. Although Malaysia does express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave. “Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said. PM given guard of honour After the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.” “He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said. “The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said. PM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office. According to Radio Pakistan , Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier. Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement. “I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight. Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added. ‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’ The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact. “The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read. It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.” Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.",

PM given guard of honour After the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.” “He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said. “The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said. PM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office. According to Radio Pakistan , Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier. Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement. “I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight. Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added. ‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’ The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact. “The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read. It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.” Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistani-origin British lawmaker Shabana Mahmood has come under fire after announcing on Sunday that she would grant the police new powers to impose restrictions and conditions on repeat protests, amid a rise in pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the UK. UK police would be given greater powers to restrict protests as Mahmood said repeated large-scale pro-Palestinian demonstrations had caused “considerable fear” for the Jewish community. The government initiative follows last week’s deadly knife and car-ramming attack on a synagogue in the northwestern city of Manchester. “The strengthening of the legislation that I am going to bring about is based on the ability of the police to place conditions and restrictions on protests,” she said in a video posted on her X account. “What I will be making explicit is that cumulative disruption … the frequency of particular protests in particular places is in and of itself a reason for police to restrict or place conditions.” In an interview with the BBC , she further maintained that the move was not about a ban but about “restrictions and conditions”, such as relocating a demonstration and changing the time of protests. “What I will make clear in the law is [that] cumulative disruption is in and of itself a reason to place restrictions,” Mahmood said. “There would be protests related to the conflict in the Middle East that would now come into the purview of these changes, as well as other protests.” When asked about the “dark step” of restricting the fundamental right to protest, the home secretary said, “I don’t think it’s offensive to ask people to show a little humanity towards a community that has suffered such a terrible tragedy … I think just because you have a freedom, it doesn’t mean you have to use it at every moment of every day.” View this post on Instagram This move garnered significant backlash from political figures, human rights groups, and other public figures across Britain. Lawmaker Zarah Sultana wrote in a post on X that the home secretary aimed to ban pro-Palestinian protests, adding that Mahmood was “not content with locking up pensioners and priests for opposing the ban on Palestine Action”. “She’s (Mahmood) violating our civil liberties and the right to protest — all while supporting the flow of arms to the apartheid genocidal state of Israel,” Sultana wrote. “I hope the ministerial car was worth throwing Palestinians under the bus.” In an interview with Sky News , UK Green Party leader Zach Polanski called Mahmood “deeply irresponsible” to conflate protests against the Gaza crisis and “weaponising” against the Manchester synagogue attack. “Democratic nonviolent protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, and I think it’s worrying when governments are increasingly trying to crush down dissent and using what is a brutal attack … to point at a protest and say people don’t have a right to speak out about a genocide,” Polanski said. British actor and comedian Tez Ilyas posted a photo of Mahmood from 2014, showing her at a protest with a pro-Palestinian picket sign. “Shabana Mahmood, before she was given access to the corridors of power,” he wrote in the caption.",

      "summary_orig": "Australian police charged a 60-year-old man on Monday after he allegedly opened fire on a busy Sydney street, wounding 16 people in a chaotic attack. Police were called on Sunday evening to Croydon Park, in the city’s Inner West, where the alleged gunman was firing from his property, randomly targeting passing cars and police. A large contingent of police swarmed the area and locked down the street, before entering the property above a business and arresting a 60-year-old man. A rifle and ammunition were allegedly seized from the scene, New South Wales Police said. Office worker Joe Azar said he was working across the road when he heard what he thought were fireworks or rocks being thrown at the windows. “Some guy’s windshield blew up, then the bus stop glass shattered,” Azar told The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. “The surreal feeling kicked in like, ‘Oh, this is what’s happening’,” he said. “It was frantic. It all happened so quick, so I couldn’t comprehend what was going on,” he added. Police had initially said up to a hundred bullets were fired and 20 people were wounded. But on Monday, New South Wales Police Acting Superintendent Stephen Parry revised the number of shots to around 50 and the toll of wounded to 16. “In my 35 years in the police, there’s been very few incidents of this nature where somebody is randomly targeting people in the street,” he added. The accused shooter was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries to the area around his eyes sustained during his arrest. The suspect was charged with 25 offences, including 18 counts of shooting with intent to murder, firing a weapon in a public place, and possessing an unregistered firearm and ammunition, the police said. He was refused bail and is due to appear at court on Tuesday. A police investigation is ongoing. One man self-presented to hospital with a gunshot wound following the incident, but would likely survive, police said. The remaining people were treated by ambulance staff for minor injuries, including shattered glass as bullets hit their car windows. ‘Something out of a movie’ The gunman’s motive was unclear but there were “no known links to terrorism activity or any gang activity”, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told local radio station 2GB . One witness who gave his name as Tadgh told the national broadcaster ABC he had been watching rugby when he first heard the gunshots. “It was very loud and ‘bang, bang, bang’ and flash-bangs and sparks and smoke and the whole works. It was something out of a movie, really,” he said. Mass shootings are relatively rare in Australia. A ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons has been in place since 1996, when a lone gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania. In August, alleged gunman Dezi Freeman went on the run in the bush after being accused of killing two police officers. He remains at large. And in 2022, six people including two police officers were killed in a shooting near the small Queensland town of Wieambilla.",

      "summary_orig": "The president said an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fight planned at the White House will take place on Donald Trump’s 80th birthday, despite the much-hyped event previously being announced for July 4. “On June 14 next year, we’re going to have a big UFC fight at the White House — right at the White House, on the grounds of the White House,” Trump told a crowd of Navy sailors at the huge naval base Norfolk in Virginia. He did not mention that June 14 is his birthday or that next year will be his 80th. This year, on Trump’s 79th birthday, he held a military parade to commemorate the founding of the US Army. In August, UFC boss Dana White said the mixed martial arts bout at the White House would be held on July 4 next year, the day the United States marks the 250th anniversary of its founding. Trump has been a regular guest at the often-bloody UFC contests , where fighters punch, kick, and grapple with their opponent in a no-holds-barred battle to submission or knockout. Bringing the brutal combat sport to the centre of US political power will mark a historic first. At a press conference shared on UFC’s YouTube channel, White said that early next year, “we’ll start looking at building the White House card, which I will right now tell you will be the greatest fight card ever assembled in the history of this company.” UFC is the largest and most successful organisation in the burgeoning world of MMA, a blend of martial arts disciplines like jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, boxing, and wrestling. Bouts take place in an eight-sided ring — dubbed “The Octagon” —bounded by a chainlink fence. With few exceptions — such as eye-gouging — male and female fighters are allowed to employ almost any technique to attack their opponent. The sport’s popularity with young men — a key demographic in the 2024 US election — and Trump’s long association with the UFC have made the president a regular fixture at some of its more high-profile events, where he is greeted like a rock star. Its brutal nature and high injury rate mean the sport is controversial, with doctors decrying the potential for brain damage amongst fighters who are repeatedly hit in the head, though it has gained increasing mainstream acceptance in recent years.",

      "summary_en": "The president said an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fight planned at the White House will take place on Donald Trump’s 80th birthday, despite the much-hyped event previously being announced for July 4. “On June 14 next year, we’re going to have a big UFC fight at the White House — right at the White House, on the grounds of the White House,” Trump told a crowd of Navy sailors at the huge naval base Norfolk in Virginia. He did not mention that June 14 is his birthday or that next year will be his 80th. This year, on Trump’s 79th birthday, he held a military parade to commemorate the founding of the US Army. In August, UFC boss Dana White said the mixed martial arts bout at the White House would be held on July 4 next year, the day the United States marks the 250th anniversary of its founding. Trump has been a regular guest at the often-bloody UFC contests , where fighters punch, kick, and grapple with their opponent in a no-holds-barred battle to submission or knockout. Bringing the brutal combat sport to the centre of US political power will mark a historic first. At a press conference shared on UFC’s YouTube channel, White said that early next year, “we’ll start looking at building the White House card, which I will right now tell you will be the greatest fight card ever assembled in the history of this company.” UFC is the largest and most successful organisation in the burgeoning world of MMA, a blend of martial arts disciplines like jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, boxing, and wrestling. Bouts take place in an eight-sided ring — dubbed “The Octagon” —bounded by a chainlink fence. With few exceptions — such as eye-gouging — male and female fighters are allowed to employ almost any technique to attack their opponent. The sport’s popularity with young men — a key demographic in the 2024 US election — and Trump’s long association with the UFC have made the president a regular fixture at some of its more high-profile events, where he is greeted like a rock star. Its brutal nature and high injury rate mean the sport is controversial, with doctors decrying the potential for brain damage amongst fighters who are repeatedly hit in the head, though it has gained increasing mainstream acceptance in recent years.",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office said on Monday it was making efforts for the safe evacuation of former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Muhstaq Ahmad Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, and hoped that the process could be “successfully concluded within the next couple of days”. Mushtaq led the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF). The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it and detained the activists on board. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, through its embassy in Amman, is working tirelessly to secure the safe evacuation of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan,” the FO said in a statement. “With the invaluable assistance of the Jordanian government, we are hopeful that the process can be successfully concluded within the next couple of days,” the FO said. The statement also expressed deep gratitude to the “brotherly” government of Jordan for “their exemplary cooperation and generous support”. Last week, Pakistan and several other countries condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the GSF. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for the release of those detained by Israel. “We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release,“ he said in a post on X on Thursday. In a later post, he commended the “dignified participation” of Pakistani activists, including Mushtaq, in the humanitarian mission. “The government of Pakistan … strongly demands the return of its citizens, praying and striving for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the homeland,” he added. On Friday, he assured JI chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman during a telephone conversation that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including Mushtaq. The PM told Naeem that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had been assigned to lead these efforts and coordinate with friendly countries and international organisations. Subsequently, the FO assured in a statement yesterday that it was actively engaged with international partners to ensure the “safety and prompt repatriation of its citizens” who were detained following the interception of the GSF by Israeli forces. Particularly mentioning Mushtaq, the FO said it had been confirmed through the “diplomatic channels of a friendly European country” that Mushtaq was in the custody of Israeli forces, “safe and in good health”. “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis,” the FO added. Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir noted in a post on X today that the activists detained during the Israeli raid were receiving a hero’s welcome upon their return home. “God willing, [former] senator Mushtaq will also return to a hero’s welcome,” he added. Israel had previously blocked attempts to bring aid to Gaza as well. In June, the aid vessel Madleen , carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces.",

      "summary_orig": "A cop was martyred while a Frontier Constabulary (FC) official was injured when a police checkpoint came under attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district, police said on Monday. Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have witnessed terrorist attacks , particularly targeting police personnel. Speaking to Dawn.com , Kohat District Police Officer (DPO) Dr Zahidullah Khan said that a “large number of miscreants” had attacked a checkpoint in Kohat’s Darra Adamkhel from “multiple sides” at 1am. He said that an exchange of fire then took place between the police and the unidentified assailants, which claimed the life of one cop and left an FC official injured. He said that the exchange of fire went on for two-and-a-half hours. “The unidentified assailants aimed to capture the checkpoint, but their attempt was thwarted,” he said, adding that a search operation was currently underway. “Three improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have been recovered so far during the clearance operation,” the DPO said. Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the attack and paid tribute to the martyred cop. In a statement, he also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured. “The sacrifices of the police in the war against terrorism will not go in vain,” he added. The attack comes a day after a soldier was martyred and another injured when unidentified assailants opened fire on them near KP’s Bannu district. On Sept 1, a police constable embra­ced martyrdom and ano­t­her sustained serious injuries in an attack on a police post in Mir Ali. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies. According to a Dawn report , KP remained the most affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.",

      "summary_orig": "GILGIT: A judge of the Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Court survived a brazen gun attack in Gilgit on Sunday morning, police said. The incident came the same day as a separate attack on a religious leader left at least five people injured. According to police, Judge Malik Inayatur Rehman and his security staff came under fire from unidentified assailants near Khari City Hospital. The judge’s vehicle was hit by at least 12 bullets, but all occupants survived the ambush. Law enforcement agencies reached the site soon afterwards and cordoned off the area for investigation. Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan took notice of the attack and directed the home secretary, inspector general of police, and other law enforcement authorities to tighten security across the city. He instructed them that those involved in the attack be dealt with “iron hands” and brought to justice. The chief minister also urged citizens to remain peaceful and united to foil the designs of elements seeking to disturb the region’s peace. GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah also condem­ned the attack and called for a transparent investigation. Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate, Deputy Speaker Sadia Danish, Opposition Lea­der Kazim Mesum, lawyers’ representatives, and civil society members also denounced the incident. Religious leader attacked Earlier in the day, a religious leader from the proscribed Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) was also targeted near the Central Police Office (CPO). Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed, who is the emir of the group’s GB and Kohistan chapter was travelling along with police guards and a driver when the convoy came under fire. According to a GB government statement, Maul­ana Nisar, his driver, and three police personnel assigned to his security sustained injuries. Police officials said the guards retaliated immediately, injuring some of the attackers, who managed to escape with the help of accomplices. CCTV footage showed the assailants fleeing in a Suzuki vehicle they allegedly snatched at gunpoint after their own vehicles became inoperative. The injured were shifted to a hospital for medical treatment, where their condition was reported to be stable. Police launched an investigation and took into custody two vehicles used in the attack along with other evidence. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Gilgit Ishaq Hussain said the district police had been placed on high alert following recent security concerns. He added that comprehensive operations were underway to apprehend those involved in the attack. Protests erupt Following the incidents, protests erupted across the region. Demonstrators blocked main roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Gilgit–Shandur Road, and Baltistan Road, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits. Shops and markets in Gilgit remained closed in protest. Protest demonstrations were reported from Gilgit, Diamer, Nagar, Skardu, Astore, Ghizer, Ghanche, and Shigar, where people from all walks of life participated. Religious leaders from all sects condemned the attacks, describing them as a conspiracy to sabotage peace in the region. Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engineer Amir Muqam, also condemned the assassination attempt on Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed and ordered a high-level investigation. In a statement issued during his official visit abroad, Mr Muqam said he had contacted the GB chief minister, chief secretary, and inspector general of police, seeking a detailed report. He said Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed was a respected religious scholar and that the attack was not only on an individual but “an assault on the peace and stability of the entire region.” The minister directed authorities to use all available resources to ensure the swift arrest of the attackers. “Those involved in this heinous crime will not escape justice,” he said. Chief Minister Gulbar Khan reiterated that no conspiracy against the peace of Gilgit-Baltistan would be allowed to succeed. He ordered the IG and law enforcement agencies to conduct a transparent investigation and immediately arrest the culprits. Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Speaker Nazir Ahm­ed Advocate, Deputy Spe­a­ker Sadia Danish, Oppo­sition Leader Kazim Mes­um, cabinet ministers, reli­g­ious leaders from var­ious sects, and civil society activists all condem­ned the incidents and dem­anded a fair and tran­s­parent investigation.

Police launched an investigation and took into custody two vehicles used in the attack along with other evidence. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Gilgit Ishaq Hussain said the district police had been placed on high alert following recent security concerns. He added that comprehensive operations were underway to apprehend those involved in the attack. Protests erupt Following the incidents, protests erupted across the region. Demonstrators blocked main roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Gilgit–Shandur Road, and Baltistan Road, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits. Shops and markets in Gilgit remained closed in protest. Protest demonstrations were reported from Gilgit, Diamer, Nagar, Skardu, Astore, Ghizer, Ghanche, and Shigar, where people from all walks of life participated. Religious leaders from all sects condemned the attacks, describing them as a conspiracy to sabotage peace in the region. Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engineer Amir Muqam, also condemned the assassination attempt on Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed and ordered a high-level investigation. In a statement issued during his official visit abroad, Mr Muqam said he had contacted the GB chief minister, chief secretary, and inspector general of police, seeking a detailed report. He said Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed was a respected religious scholar and that the attack was not only on an individual but “an assault on the peace and stability of the entire region.” The minister directed authorities to use all available resources to ensure the swift arrest of the attackers. “Those involved in this heinous crime will not escape justice,” he said. Chief Minister Gulbar Khan reiterated that no conspiracy against the peace of Gilgit-Baltistan would be allowed to succeed. He ordered the IG and law enforcement agencies to conduct a transparent investigation and immediately arrest the culprits. Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Speaker Nazir Ahm­ed Advocate, Deputy Spe­a­ker Sadia Danish, Oppo­sition Leader Kazim Mes­um, cabinet ministers, reli­g­ious leaders from var­ious sects, and civil society activists all condem­ned the incidents and dem­anded a fair and tran­s­parent investigation.
