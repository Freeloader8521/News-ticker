The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) held a meeting to discuss the development plan of the system, named Block-I, with major defense firm LIG Nex1. Under the project, DAPA seeks to develop large aircraft capable of disabling and disturbing an opponent's air defense network and electronic command systems through jamming attacks.

The envisioned aircraft is expected to be a \"game changer\" in future electronic warfare by increasing the survivability of aerial assets and enhancing interoperability during joint operations. DAPA said it plans to push for the development of an advanced Block-II system following the launch of the first version.",

      "summary_orig": "President Lee Jae Myung on Tuesday instructed authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into a civilian accused of flying a drone into North Korea, calling it an unacceptable act that requires stern measures. Lee made the remarks during a Cabinet meeting, as the civilian was questioned by a joint military-police investigation team last Friday over the alleged drone incursion. \"It is unacceptable to send drones to the North for unlawful purposes or for a civilian to infiltrate drones into North Korean territory,\" he said. North Korea claimed early this month that South Korea infringed on its sovereignty with drone incursions in September last year and on Jan. 4. The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un demanded Seoul admit to and apologize for the incident. South Korea's military has denied such claims, saying the drones in question were not models operated by the military. Lee said it was unimaginable that a civilian alone could have sent the drone to gather intelligence from the North, noting speculations that state institutions could have been involved in the case.",

Union officials say about 50 positions — mostly software developers — have been affected by AI-driven restructuring over the past three years, and they worry that another 10 percent of roughly 550 jobs could be at risk as the technology is rolled out more aggressively. “For example, in one technical support division that handles phone and email queries from customers using Microsoft products, workers have been told to help train an AI agent that will automatically suggest solutions to problems,” Kwak Chang-yong, secretary-general of the union, told The Korea Times. “It naturally prompts a question, ‘What will happen to me when I complete the traini",

      "title_orig": "PTI-nominated MWM chief Raja Nasir Abbas appointed Senate opposition leader after months-long delay",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was appointed as the opposition leader in the Senate on Tuesday. “In pursuance of sub-rule (3) of Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, the chairman Senate has been pleased to declare Senator Raja Nasir Abbas as leader of the opposition in the Senate, with immediate effect,” said a notification issued by the Senate Secretariat. Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani also announced Abbas’ appointment as the opposition leader during Tuesday’s session in the House. As the proceedings began, he said: “I want to give a ruling. Before proceeding further, I consider it necessary to place on record the legal and procedural background relating to the declaration of the leader of the opposition in the Senate. “Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012 mandates that the chairman Senate should declare as leader of the opposition the member who commands the support of the majority of the members in opposition. “Following the disqualification of former senator Syed Shibli Faraz by the Election Commission of Pakistan vide notification dated August 5, 2025 and the consequential notification of the Senate Secretariat dated August 8, 2025, the office of the leader of the opposition stood vacated. “The said notifications were challenged before the honourable Peshawar High Court, which issued restraining orders prohibiting further action in the matter. In view of the pendency of judicial proceedings, the matter remained under consideration of the Senate Secretariat for legal examination and procedural guidance, in accordance with the established parliamentary practice and constitutional discipline so as to ensure that no step was taken which might conflict with or render infructuous the proceedings before the honourable court.” Gilani explained that the “earlier deferment [of the appointment] was therefore procedural, occasioned by institutional prudence, due deference to judicial authority and rule of law”. He further stated: “There being no legal bar, I now proceed in accordance with Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012 and hereby declare Senator Raja Nasir Abbas as the leader of the opposition in the Senate …” At this point, Gilani was interrupted by the thumping of desks and slogans in favour of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, who nominated Abbas for the opposition leader’s post. Meanwhile, Gilani continued: “… Having secured the support of 22 members out of 32 members on the opposition benches. The secretary is directed to issue a formal notification accordingly right now.” He then requested parliamentary leaders in the House to “assist the opposition leader on his seat”, following which Abbas rose and changed his seat amid applause, shaking hands with several senators on his way. Later, before giving the floor to Senator Abbas, Gilani congratulated him for becoming the opposition leader. Abbas’ maiden address as opposition leader In his maiden address in the House as the opposition leader, Abbas credited Imran for “making me a senator”. He asserted that he was “his (Imran) loyal companion, will never compromise on principles” and never violate his oath taken as a senator. Abbas also expressed his commitment to making all-possible efforts and playing his role to ensure the security, betterment and national interest of the country. He thanked treasury members for showing him respect and welcoming him. “It was a good gesture,” he said, adding that “we will try that this Senate play a role in addressing the difficulties of the people” and that legislation benefits the people. The opposition leader then went on to elaborate on the significance of the Constitution, highlighting that it was a social contract with the people and represented people’s views and expectations. “Laws are made in light of the Constitution, and under those laws, institutions and pillars of the state are established .” He added that under the Constitution, it had been established that the three pillars of the state — ostensibly a reference to the legislature, judiciary and executive — would not interfere in each other’s affairs. “The Constitution is sacred,” he remarked, adding that when laws are not respected, society “becomes a jungle”. Abbas continued: “Presently, Pakistan is facing various difficulties. One among them is lawlessness.” The senator said it was the government’s and the rulers’ job to ensure law and justice, adding that people also had a role to play in this regard. But, he continued, people no longer “trust our system as there is no law and justice. Look at what has become of the judiciary. People are losing confidence in Parliament and they no longer trust the executive as well. The people of Pakistan do not trust this system”. Abbas stressed that whenever a government loses the trust of the people, it loses its “soft and national power” as well. “And national power or soft power is not acquired through bullets, tanks or jets. […] That is why it is impossible to keep people united when there is no rule of law, justice and supremacy of the Constitution.” He went on to say that the consequences of injustice were visible in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Is it not injustice to displace people just to find a few terrorists? Had you taken the people’s help, the terrorists might not have been able to enter that region. How can you eradicate terrorism and restore peace without the support of the local people? How will there be peace if people do not get justice?” This part of Abbas’ speech seemed to be a reference to the displacement of residents from KP’s Tirah for a military operation against terrorists. The opposition leader also emphasised that it was the House’s responsibility to stand up for ensuring justice. He also stressed the need for ending the political crisis in the country, adding that economic difficulties and law and order problems also could not be resolved until the political crisis was brought to an end. The senator said the political crisis originated from what happened on February 8, 2024 — the day when general elections, which the opposition alleges were rigged, were held in the country. He also alleged that members of opposition alliance Teh­reek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pak­istan were subjected to violence when they recently visited Punjab. “What law is this? Did we have weapons? We were peaceful,” he said, adding, “Why is this happening? Why is there lawlessness? Will we be able to run the system by suppressing, pressuring and harassing people? […] Let people speak. […] If people protest within the limits of the law and Constitution, it makes the country more powerful.” He then said that the only solution to the ongoing political crisis was to release Imran from jail, claiming that progress on cases against Imran had been stalled. “The country cannot progress if you keep a popular leader in jail,” he asserted, claiming that he had the support of 90 per cent people in the country. He further called for the Senate to speak up for the release of “political prisoners”. “We want these innocent people to be released from jail so that political instability in Pakistan ends.” Moreover, he said under the Constitution, only those had the right to rule the country who were voted into power by the people, not those who were rejected by the people. “Today, Imran Khan is a popular leader. The presence of a popular is necessary today for nation-building,” he said, adding that he could sacrifice his life for the country but would also impede any efforts to harm the country. The senator then mentioned that ruling the country was only politicians’ job, recalling that some from the establishment had said that they had nothing to do with politics. “Can we swear about this on the Holy Quran?” he questioned, adding that “we all will salute” the army if it operated within its domain. Addressing treasury members, particularly PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah, he said let’s steer the country towards a better political situation. “May no one have to face the injustice that Imran Khan is facing. The case against you was unjust, and you know who is behind those cases. When will we stop them? […] Politicians have built this country with the support of the people. Under the Constitution and law, only politicians have the right to run this country,” he said. He stressed the importance of collective wisdom in Parliament and called for progress on cases against Imran. Moreover, he said Pakistan should take a stand against US President Donald Trump over his threats to Iran. “We should call a session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation […] we should call a session of neighbouring and other countries and decide that no one will be allowed to attack any country in this region.” Months-long delay The opposition leader’s slot in the Senate had been lying vacant since August 2025, following the disqualification of the then-opposition leader, PTI’s Shibli Faraz. At the same time, PTI’s Omar Ayub, who was the opposition leader in the National Assembly (NA) back then, was also disqualified. The two were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) after their convictions in cases rela­ted to the May 9, 2023, riots. The PTI had then nominated in October last year Abbas as its candidate for the opposition leader’s position in the Senate and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai to fill the NA slot. Abbas’ appointment today comes less than a week after Achakzai was appointed the opposition leader in the NA after a months-long delay. On Monday, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar said Gilani had informed him that Abbas would be notified as the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament by Tuesday (today). Zafar had also submitted a letter to the Senate chairperson, seeking the appointment of Abbas. In a post on X, Zafar had said that he also had a meeting with the Senate chairman regarding the appointment of the opposition leader. Additional reporting by Iftikhar Khan",

Abbas’ appointment today comes less than a week after Achakzai was appointed the opposition leader in the NA after a months-long delay. On Monday, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar said Gilani had informed him that Abbas would be notified as the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament by Tuesday (today). Zafar had also submitted a letter to the Senate chairperson, seeking the appointment of Abbas. In a post on X, Zafar had said that he also had a meeting with the Senate chairman regarding the appointment of the opposition leader. Additional reporting by Iftikhar Khan",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was appointed as the opposition leader in the Senate on Tuesday. “In pursuance of sub-rule (3) of Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, the chairman Senate has been pleased to declare Senator Raja Nasir Abbas as leader of the opposition in the Senate, with immediate effect,” said a notification issued by the Senate Secretariat. Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani also announced Abbas’ appointment as the opposition leader during Tuesday’s session in the House. As the proceedings began, he said: “I want to give a ruling. Before proceeding further, I consider it necessary to place on record the legal and procedural background relating to the declaration of the leader of the opposition in the Senate. “Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012 mandates that the chairman Senate should declare as leader of the opposition the member who commands the support of the majority of the members in opposition. “Following the disqualification of former senator Syed Shibli Faraz by the Election Commission of Pakistan vide notification dated August 5, 2025 and the consequential notification of the Senate Secretariat dated August 8, 2025, the office of the leader of the opposition stood vacated. “The said notifications were challenged before the honourable Peshawar High Court, which issued restraining orders prohibiting further action in the matter. In view of the pendency of judicial proceedings, the matter remained under consideration of the Senate Secretariat for legal examination and procedural guidance, in accordance with the established parliamentary practice and constitutional discipline so as to ensure that no step was taken which might conflict with or render infructuous the proceedings before the honourable court.” Gilani explained that the “earlier deferment [of the appointment] was therefore procedural, occasioned by institutional prudence, due deference to judicial authority and rule of law”. He further stated: “There being no legal bar, I now proceed in accordance with Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012 and hereby declare Senator Raja Nasir Abbas as the leader of the opposition in the Senate …” At this point, Gilani was interrupted by the thumping of desks and slogans in favour of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, who nominated Abbas for the opposition leader’s post. Meanwhile, Gilani continued: “… Having secured the support of 22 members out of 32 members on the opposition benches. The secretary is directed to issue a formal notification accordingly right now.” He then requested parliamentary leaders in the House to “assist the opposition leader on his seat”, following which Abbas rose and changed his seat amid applause, shaking hands with several senators on his way. Later, before giving the floor to Senator Abbas, Gilani congratulated him for becoming the opposition leader. Abbas’ maiden address as opposition leader In his maiden address in the House as the opposition leader, Abbas credited Imran for “making me a senator”. He asserted that he was “his (Imran) loyal companion, will never compromise on principles” and never violate his oath taken as a senator. Abbas also expressed his commitment to making all-possible efforts and playing his role to ensure the security, betterment and national interest of the country. He thanked treasury members for showing him respect and welcoming him. “It was a good gesture,” he said, adding that “we will try that this Senate play a role in addressing the difficulties of the people” and that legislation benefits the people. The opposition leader then went on to elaborate on the significance of the Constitution, highlighting that it was a social contract with the people and represented people’s views and expectations. “Laws are made in light of the Constitution, and under those laws, institutions and pillars of the state are established .” He added that under the Constitution, it had been established that the three pillars of the state — ostensibly a reference to the legislature, judiciary and executive — would not interfere in each other’s affairs. “The Constitution is sacred,” he remarked, adding that when laws are not respected, society “becomes a jungle”. Abbas continued: “Presently, Pakistan is facing various difficulties. One among them is lawlessness.” The senator said it was the government’s and the rulers’ job to ensure law and justice, adding that people also had a role to play in this regard. But, he continued, people no longer “trust our system as there is no law and justice. Look at what has become of the judiciary. People are losing confidence in Parliament and they no longer trust the executive as well. The people of Pakistan do not trust this system”. Abbas stressed that whenever a government loses the trust of the people, it loses its “soft and national power” as well. “And national power or soft power is not acquired through bullets, tanks or jets. […] That is why it is impossible to keep people united when there is no rule of law, justice and supremacy of the Constitution.” He went on to say that the consequences of injustice were visible in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Is it not injustice to displace people just to find a few terrorists? Had you taken the people’s help, the terrorists might not have been able to enter that region. How can you eradicate terrorism and restore peace without the support of the local people? How will there be peace if people do not get justice?” This part of Abbas’ speech seemed to be a reference to the displacement of residents from KP’s Tirah for a military operation against terrorists. The opposition leader also emphasised that it was the House’s responsibility to stand up for ensuring justice. He also stressed the need for ending the political crisis in the country, adding that economic difficulties and law and order problems also could not be resolved until the political crisis was brought to an end. The senator said the political crisis originated from what happened on February 8, 2024 — the day when general elections, which the opposition alleges were rigged, were held in the country. He also alleged that members of opposition alliance Teh­reek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pak­istan were subjected to violence when they recently visited Punjab. “What law is this? Did we have weapons? We were peaceful,” he said, adding, “Why is this happening? Why is there lawlessness? Will we be able to run the system by suppressing, pressuring and harassing people? […] Let people speak. […] If people protest within the limits of the law and Constitution, it makes the country more powerful.” He then said that the only solution to the ongoing political crisis was to release Imran from jail, claiming that progress on cases against Imran had been stalled. “The country cannot progress if you keep a popular leader in jail,” he asserted, claiming that he had the support of 90 per cent people in the country. He further called for the Senate to speak up for the release of “political prisoners”. “We want these innocent people to be released from jail so that political instability in Pakistan ends.” Moreover, he said under the Constitution, only those had the right to rule the country who were voted into power by the people, not those who were rejected by the people. “Today, Imran Khan is a popular leader. The presence of a popular is necessary today for nation-building,” he said, adding that he could sacrifice his life for the country but would also impede any efforts to harm the country. The senator then mentioned that ruling the country was only politicians’ job, recalling that some from the establishment had said that they had nothing to do with politics. “Can we swear about this on the Holy Quran?” he questioned, adding that “we all will salute” the army if it operated within its domain. Addressing treasury members, particularly PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah, he said let’s steer the country towards a better political situation. “May no one have to face the injustice that Imran Khan is facing. The case against you was unjust, and you know who is behind those cases. When will we stop them? […] Politicians have built this country with the support of the people. Under the Constitution and law, only politicians have the right to run this country,” he said. He stressed the importance of collective wisdom in Parliament and called for progress on cases against Imran. Moreover, he said Pakistan should take a stand against US President Donald Trump over his threats to Iran. “We should call a session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation […] we should call a session of neighbouring and other countries and decide that no one will be allowed to attack any country in this region.” Months-long delay The opposition leader’s slot in the Senate had been lying vacant since August 2025, following the disqualification of the then-opposition leader, PTI’s Shibli Faraz. At the same time, PTI’s Omar Ayub, who was the opposition leader in the National Assembly (NA) back then, was also disqualified. The two were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) after their convictions in cases rela­ted to the May 9, 2023, riots. The PTI had then nominated in October last year Abbas as its candidate for the opposition leader’s position in the Senate and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai to fill the NA slot. Abbas’ appointment today comes less than a week after Achakzai was appointed the opposition leader in the NA after a months-long delay. On Monday, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar said Gilani had informed him that Abbas would be notified as the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament by Tuesday (today). Zafar had also submitted a letter to the Senate chairperson, seeking the appointment of Abbas. In a post on X, Zafar had said that he also had a meeting with the Senate chairman regarding the appointment of the opposition leader. Additional reporting by Iftikhar Khan",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said Pakistan was “forced” to halt all trade with Afghanistan due to Kabul’s inaction against terrorists operating from its soil. The Pak-Afghan border has been closed for trade since mid-October 2025, when border clashes erupted . Successive rounds of talks on counter-terrorism mechanisms failed to produce a workable solution despite mediation by Turkiye and Qatar . “There is a complete blockade of Pak-Afghan trade. It should not have been there, but they forced us,” the premier said while addressing a national workshop event in Islamabad. “This time, it must be decided whether Afghanistan wants to live peacefully or not […] They are our brothers and sisters. If the interim Afghan government does not have an interest in this (peace with Pakistan), they should at least have mercy on its people and not oppress them.” “Rest assured, we will keep trying our best,” the prime minister added. While trade data shows that the border closure has hit Afghanistan far harder than Pakistan, exporters and the business community have raised concerns over the losses being faced by them. “It is our neighbouring country, we have to live forever […] what is good for Afghanistan is good for Pakistan, and vice versa,” the prime minister remarked. He called it unfortunate that the past and the incumbent Afghan governments “did not cherish the hospitality” offered by Pakistan. The premier added that while international aid was received for the four million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, the country also had to use its own resources. He further said that Pakistan did no favour to the Afghan people but fulfilled its responsibilities. “But the way they are paying us back is very upsetting,” the prime minister added. PM Shehbaz noted that the 2020 Doha Accords were “very clear” in stating that Afghanistan will rein in terrorist activity in the country and will not allow any terrorist to operate from their territory. Recalling ministers’ various meetings held with Afghan leaders, the premier lamented, “But they did not adhere to a single one of our recommendations.” Recalling the Pak-Afghan border clashes of October 2025 and the subsequent rounds of talks that failed, he said, “Nothing came of it. We had only one demand that you commit to rein in all terrorist outfits and proxies, whether it is the TTP, BLA, or the resources provided to them by India’s support.” “Unfortunately, they did not make any serious commitment,” he added. ‘Terrorism resurged after 2018’ In his address, the premier also spoke at length about Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the surge in terrorism. Calling the province a “beautiful region” of Pakistan, he praised its people, saying they “never hesitate to sacrifice their lives for their country”. “Whatever happened as a result of the Afghan war is before you,” the premier said, noting that Pakistan welcomed refugees from across the border and allowed them to live here “like a family”. “[But] what did Pakistan get in return?” asked the prime minister. He recalled that “thousands of innocent Pakistanis” lost their lives to terrorism, and that “political forces sympathetic to KP” made sacrifices. “By 2018, terrorism had been completely eradicated, and everyone knew this was achieved through great sacrifices,” PM Shehbaz said. He pointed out that in the wake of the 2014 Army Public School attack, the armed forces and the government decided that there would be “no good or bad Taliban”. “Today, there is no such distinction,” the premier asserted. “But after 2018, what was the reason that this menace resurged?” he asked, adding that “we all know the answer very well”. “Numerous terrorists were released from Swat, and thousands of people were brought from Afghanistan to live in Pakistan. This was the main reason terrorism resurged in the country,” PM Shehbaz said. “Today, terrorism has once again dealt a major blow to Pakistan’s development and prosperity, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as in other areas.” “Every day, there is a terrorist incident somewhere,” he added. While hailing the fact that there could be “no greater sacrifice” than that made by soldiers, he regretted that hatred was being spread on social media and that an “evil attempt is being made to defame the martyrs”. “They spew venom against Pakistan in chorus with the country’s enemies across the border,” the prime minister said, adding that the nation would continue its fight against terrorism until it is completely eradicated. Centre’s ties with KP During his address, the prime minister was also asked about the “disengaged” youth of KP and the Centre’s steps to include them in the national discourse. “There is a cold war ongoing between the federal government and the KP government. This statement does not align with the facts,” he said. The premier said he had spoken by phone with KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on the day he was elected and had offered him his “full support” for the development and prosperity of the province. “He thanked me. [But] after that, he did not contact me again,” PM Shehbaz noted, recalling that he had again invited the KP CM to work together during his address in Chitral later. He affirmed that the Centre was engaged with the youth, pointing out multiple steps being taken by the IT ministry to upskill the youth. “Pakistan will only develop when all four provinces have an equal part in it,” the prime minister said during his address. “Without going into any political argument, I want to say that if you compare KP’s journey of prosperity and development over the past 10 years with that of Sindh, Punjab or Balochistan, the truth will become clear,” he remarked. Noting that resources were allocated to the provinces under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, the premier lamented that corresponding development could not be seen “in some places, including KP”. “What the reason for that is remains another painful question that we must reflect on and answer.”",

      "title_orig": "‘Content to die’: Afghanistan’s hunger crisis worsened by winter, aid cuts",
      "summary_orig": "In the dull glow of a single bulb lighting their tent on the outskirts of Kabul, Samiullah and his wife Bibi Rehana sit down to dry bread and tea, their only meal of the day, accompanied by their five children and three-month-old grandchild. “We have reached a point where we are content with death,” said 55-year-old Samiullah, whose family, including two older sons aged 18 and 20 and their wives, is among the millions deported by neighbouring countries in the past year. “Day by day, things are getting worse,” he added, after their return to a war-torn nation where the United Nations’ World Food Programme estimates 17 million battle acute hunger after massive cuts in international aid. “Whatever happens to us has happened, but at least our children’s lives should be better.” He was one of the returned Afghans speaking before protests in Iran sparked a massive crackdown by the government. Samiullah said his family went virtually overnight from its modest home in Iran to their makeshift tent, partially propped up by rocks and rubble, after a raid by Iranian authorities led to their arrests and then deportation. They salvaged a few belongings but were not able to carry out all their savings, which would have carried them through the winter, Samiullah added. Reuters was unable to reach authorities in Iran for comment. “Migrants who are newly returning to the country receive assistance as much as possible,” said Afghan administration spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in areas from transport to housing, healthcare and food. It was impossible to eradicate poverty quickly in a country that suffered 40 years of conflict and the loss of all its revenue and resources, he added in a statement, despite an extensive rebuilding effort. “Economic programmes take time and do not have an immediate impact on people’s lives.” The WFP says Iran and Pakistan have expelled more than 2.5m Afghans in massive repatriation programs. Tehran ramped up deportations last year amid a flurry of accusations that they were spying for Israel. Authorities blamed the expulsions on concerns about security and resources. Islamabad accelerated deportations amid accusations that the Taliban was harbouring militants responsible for cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations Afghanistan has denied. No income, no aid As winter spreads across Afghanistan’s arid landscape, work opportunities have dried up, while the wave of returning Afghans has swelled the population by a tenth, said John Aylieff, the WFP’s country director. “Many of these Afghans were working in Iran and Pakistan and they were sending back remittances,” he told Reuters , adding that 3m more people now face acute hunger. “Those remittances were a lifeline for Afghanistan.” Cuts to global programmes since United States President Donald Trump returned to the White House have sapped the resources of organisations such as the WFP, while other donor countries have also scaled back, putting millions at risk worldwide. “Last year was the biggest malnutrition surge ever recorded in Afghanistan and sadly the prediction is that it’s going to get worse,” added Aylieff, estimating that 200,000 more children would suffer acute malnutrition in 2026. At the WFP’s aid distribution site in Bamiyan, about 180km from Kabul, the capital, there are stacks of rice bags and jugs of palm oil, while wheelbarrows trundle in more food, but it is still too little for the long queues of people. “I am forced to manage the winter with these supplies; sometimes we eat, sometimes we don’t,” said Zahra Ahmadi, 50, a widowed mother of eight daughters, as she received aid for the first time. ‘Life never remains the same’ At the Qasaba Clinic in the capital, mothers soothed their children during the wait for medicine and supplements. “Compared to the time when there were no migrants, the number of our patients has now doubled,” said Dr. Rabia Rahimi Yadgari. The clinic treats about 30 cases of malnutrition each day but the supplements are not sufficient to sustain the families, who previously relied on WFP aid and hospital support, she said. Laila, 30, said her son, Abdul Rahman, showed signs of recovery after taking the supplements. “But after some time, he loses the weight again,” she said. After the Taliban takeover, she said, “My husband lost his (government) job, and gradually our economic situation collapsed. Life never remains the same.” The United States led a hasty withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in July 2021, after 20 years of war against the Taliban, opening the doors for the Islamists to take control of Kabul. As dusk gathers and the temperature falls, Samiullah brings in firewood and Bibi Rehama lights a stove for warmth. “At night, when it gets very cold, my children say, ‘Father, I’m cold, I’m freezing.’ I hold them in my arms and say, ‘It’s OK.’ What choice do we have?” Samiullah said. “(When) I worked in Iran, at least I could provide a full meal. Here, there is neither work nor livelihood.”",

The clinic treats about 30 cases of malnutrition each day but the supplements are not sufficient to sustain the families, who previously relied on WFP aid and hospital support, she said. Laila, 30, said her son, Abdul Rahman, showed signs of recovery after taking the supplements. “But after some time, he loses the weight again,” she said. After the Taliban takeover, she said, “My husband lost his (government) job, and gradually our economic situation collapsed. Life never remains the same.” The United States led a hasty withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in July 2021, after 20 years of war against the Taliban, opening the doors for the Islamists to take control of Kabul. As dusk gathers and the temperature falls, Samiullah brings in firewood and Bibi Rehama lights a stove for warmth. “At night, when it gets very cold, my children say, ‘Father, I’m cold, I’m freezing.’ I hold them in my arms and say, ‘It’s OK.’ What choice do we have?” Samiullah said. “(When) I worked in Iran, at least I could provide a full meal. Here, there is neither work nor livelihood.”",

      "summary": "In the dull glow of a single bulb lighting their tent on the outskirts of Kabul, Samiullah and his wife Bibi Rehana sit down to dry bread and tea, their only meal of the day, accompanied by their five children and three-month-old grandchild. “We have reached a point where we are content with death,” said 55-year-old Samiullah, whose family, including two older sons aged 18 and 20 and their wives, is among the millions deported by neighbouring countries in the past year. “Day by day, things are getting worse,” he added, after their return to a war-torn nation where the United Nations’ World Food Programme estimates 17 million battle acute hunger after massive cuts in international aid. “Whatever happens to us has happened, but at least our children’s lives should be better.” He was one of the returned Afghans speaking before protests in Iran sparked a massive crackdown by the government. Samiullah said his family went virtually overnight from its modest home in Iran to their makeshift tent, partially propped up by rocks and rubble, after a raid by Iranian authorities led to their arrests and then deportation. They salvaged a few belongings but were not able to carry out all their savings, which would have carried them through the winter, Samiullah added. Reuters was unable to reach authorities in Iran for comment. “Migrants who are newly returning to the country receive assistance as much as possible,” said Afghan administration spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in areas from transport to housing, healthcare and food. It was impossible to eradicate poverty quickly in a country that suffered 40 years of conflict and the loss of all its revenue and resources, he added in a statement, despite an extensive rebuilding effort. “Economic programmes take time and do not have an immediate impact on people’s lives.” The WFP says Iran and Pakistan have expelled more than 2.5m Afghans in massive repatriation programs. Tehran ramped up deportations last year amid a flurry of accusations that they were spying for Israel. Authorities blamed the expulsions on concerns about security and resources. Islamabad accelerated deportations amid accusations that the Taliban was harbouring militants responsible for cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations Afghanistan has denied. No income, no aid As winter spreads across Afghanistan’s arid landscape, work opportunities have dried up, while the wave of returning Afghans has swelled the population by a tenth, said John Aylieff, the WFP’s country director. “Many of these Afghans were working in Iran and Pakistan and they were sending back remittances,” he told Reuters , adding that 3m more people now face acute hunger. “Those remittances were a lifeline for Afghanistan.” Cuts to global programmes since United States President Donald Trump returned to the White House have sapped the resources of organisations such as the WFP, while other donor countries have also scaled back, putting millions at risk worldwide. “Last year was the biggest malnutrition surge ever recorded in Afghanistan and sadly the prediction is that it’s going to get worse,” added Aylieff, estimating that 200,000 more children would suffer acute malnutrition in 2026.

      "title_orig": "Australia set to pass tougher laws on guns, hate crimes after Bondi shooting",
      "summary_orig": "Australia’s lower house of parliament has passed new laws for a national gun buyback, tighter background checks for gun licences and a crackdown on hate crimes, in response to the country’s worst mass shooting in decades at a Jewish festival last month. Two bills for stricter gun control and anti-hate measures passed on Tuesday by the House of Representatives in a special parliament session will now go to the upper house Senate for debate. The gun control laws are expected to pass with the support of the Greens party despite opposition from the conservative Liberal-National coalition. The anti-hate laws are likely to pass with support from the Liberal party. Introducing the gun reforms, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said individuals with “hate in their hearts and guns in their hands”, carried out the December 14 attack at Bondi Beach that killed 15 people. “The tragic events at Bondi demand a comprehensive response from government,” Burke added. “As a government, we must do everything we can to counter both the motivation and the method.” Parliament recalled early for special session Prime Minister Anthony Albanese recalled parliament early from its summer break for this week’s special two-day session to toughen curbs after the shooting shocked the nation and prompted calls for more action on gun control and antisemitism. The proposed gun control measures enable the largest national buyback scheme since a similar campaign after a 1996 massacre in Tasmania’s Port Arthur, in which a lone gunman killed 35 people. They also toughen background checks for firearm licences issued by Australian states, making use of information from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Australia had a record 4.1 million firearms last year, the government said on Sunday, with more than 1.1 million of those in New South Wales, its most populous state and the site of the Bondi attack. “The sheer number of firearms currently circulating within the Australian community is unsustainable,” Burke said. The bill passed by a vote of 96 to 45 without the support of the coalition. “This bill reveals the contempt the government has for the million gun owners of Australia,” said Shadow Attorney-General Andrew Wallace of the Liberals. “The prime minister has failed to recognise that guns are tools of trade for so many Australians.” Hate crime penalties stepped up A second bill steps up penalties for hate crimes, such as jail terms up to 12 years when a religious official or preacher is involved, and allows bans on groups deemed to spread hate. The bill, which also provides new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate, passed the lower house 116 to 7, with support from Liberal party lawmakers while the National party, their coalition partners, abstained. “This bill targets those that support violence, in particular violence targeted at a person because of their immutable attributes,” said Attorney-General Michelle Rowland. Such conduct was not only criminal but sowed the seed of extremism leading to terrorism, she added. Police say the alleged Bondi gunmen were inspired by the Islamic State militant group. The measures were originally planned for a single bill, but backlash from both the coalition and the Greens forced the government to split the package and drop provisions for an offence of racial vilification. In its own reforms, New South Wales limits individuals to possession of four guns, and beefs up the power of police to curb protests during designated terrorist attacks. State police have extended by two weeks in some areas protest curbs enforced in Sydney late in December. While they do not ban protests outright, critics say they are undemocratic.",

The animal was spotted in the area about two months back after its long disappearance for more than 10 years. The deputy ranger of wildlife department, Shafiq Ahmed, and regional programme manager of Snow Leopard Foundation, Jamigh Sherazi, told Dawn that after receiving a report about spotting of the snow leopard carcass, they reached the spot along with a team. They said the carcass was frozen, which meant that the animal had died many hours before their arrival. They said the cause of death of the wild cat would be ascertained only after the postmortem was carried out in the veterinary hospital, where the body was being shifted. Earlier, the leopard was spotted in Wakht, Munoor and Beghusht villages, which attacked the goats of the local people. The people had also been voicing concern about their losses. The area has recently received snowfall forcing the animal to come to lower altitude areas in search of food and that was how it came in close conflict with the local population, an official said. An environmentalist requesting not to be named told Dawn that the death of the wild cat might not be natural. Published in Dawn, January 20th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Alarm bells were rung in the Senate on Monday over the recently launched military operation in the Tirah area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Khyber tribal district. Speaking on a point of public importance, ANP chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan accused the federal government of being in a “deep slumber” over the ongoing operation in KP, leaving the people helpless and clueless. He said such “processes” had been carried out in the past in KP with all stakeholders on board. “But this time, the Centre is sleeping, whereas the provincial government is unbothered about what is going on,” he added. “The federal government is behaving as if KP is out of its jurisdiction, and the provincial government is headed by one who is openly talking against the system and is not ready to accept any operation,” he contended. “Please leave aside day-to-day things and talk about this operation, as the KP government is not even bothered to arrange tents for the displaced people,” he said. Senator Palwasha asks for her privilege motion against Aleem Khan to be taken up Speaking on the subject, PTI Senator Noorul Haq Qadri maintained that Tirah was being set on fire and people in large numbers were being displaced on a massive scale in the name of an operation. “The law requires that the provincial government should be taken on board,” he said, claiming that no consultation had been made in the process. PML-N Senator Abid Sher Ali, in his maiden speech in the House, said he failed to understand whether the ANP chief was speaking in support of the operation or against it. He questioned the performance of the PTI-led government in KP, noting that the party had failed to ensure peace in the province despite being in power for a third consecutive term. Mr Ali also criticised the KP chief minister for his recent controversial statements on terrorism. He demanded that the KP government should provide details of the funds it had received from the Centre to eradicate terrorism. Privilege motion Meanwhile, PPP Senator Palwasha Khan asked the chair to take up her privilege motion against Federal Communications Minister Aleem Khan over an alleged “personal attack” on her during a standing committee meeting. Speaking in the House, Senator Palwasha said it was her right to ask a question and the minister had no right to react in such a manner. PPP parliamentary leader in the Senate, Senator Sherry Rehman, supported the views expressed by her party colleague and said what had happened was something that should enrage everyone. She disclosed that she had contacted Aleem Khan and asked him to directly apologise to Senator Palwasha, adding that the minister told her he would return from Umrah on Jan 25. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said all members sitting on both sides of the aisle were equally honourable and noted that such an incident should not have taken place. Senator Samina Mumtaz Zahri said one must not get away by merely tendering an apology. She warned that if it were allowed, it could happen to someone else tomorrow. “Will an apology cover up the insult?” she asked. Published in Dawn, January 20th, 2026",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: Alarm bells were rung in the Senate on Monday over the recently launched military operation in the Tirah area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Khyber tribal district. Speaking on a point of public importance, ANP chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan accused the federal government of being in a “deep slumber” over the ongoing operation in KP, leaving the people helpless and clueless. He said such “processes” had been carried out in the past in KP with all stakeholders on board. “But this time, the Centre is sleeping, whereas the provincial government is unbothered about what is going on,” he added. “The federal government is behaving as if KP is out of its jurisdiction, and the provincial government is headed by one who is openly talking against the system and is not ready to accept any operation,” he contended. “Please leave aside day-to-day things and talk about this operation, as the KP government is not even bothered to arrange tents for the displaced people,” he said. Senator Palwasha asks for her privilege motion against Aleem Khan to be taken up Speaking on the subject, PTI Senator Noorul Haq Qadri maintained that Tirah was being set on fire and people in large numbers were being displaced on a massive scale in the name of an operation. “The law requires that the provincial government should be taken on board,” he said, claiming that no consultation had been made in the process. PML-N Senator Abid Sher Ali, in his maiden speech in the House, said he failed to understand whether the ANP chief was speaking in support of the operation or against it. He questioned the performance of the PTI-led government in KP, noting that the party had failed to ensure peace in the province despite being in power for a third consecutive term. Mr Ali also criticised the KP chief minister for his recent controversial statements on terrorism. He demanded that the KP government should provide details of the funds it had received from the Centre to eradicate terrorism. Privilege motion Meanwhile, PPP Senator Palwasha Khan asked the chair to take up her privilege motion against Federal Communications Minister Aleem Khan over an alleged “personal attack” on her during a standing committee meeting. Speaking in the House, Senator Palwasha said it was her right to ask a question and the minister had no right to react in such a manner. PPP parliamentary leader in the Senate, Senator Sherry Rehman, supported the views expressed by her party colleague and said what had happened was something that should enrage everyone. She disclosed that she had contacted Aleem Khan and asked him to directly apologise to Senator Palwasha, adding that the minister told her he would return from Umrah on Jan 25. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said all members sitting on both sides of the aisle were equally honourable and noted that such an incident should not have taken place. Senator Samina Mumtaz Zahri said one must not get away by merely tendering an apology. She warned that if it were allowed, it could happen to someone else tomorrow. “Will an apology cover up the insult?” she asked. Published in Dawn, January 20th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Davos disinvites FM Araghchi over ‘tragic’ crackdown • UN condemns use of executions as ‘a tool of state intimidation’ TEHRAN: Internet access in Iran will “gradually” return to normal this week, a senior official said on Monday, as the government faces international fallout from an 11-day communications blackout imposed during deadly anti-government protests. The announcement came the same day organisers of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, confirmed the Iranian foreign minister would not attend the summit because it would not be “right” following the recent crackdown. Simultaneously, the United Nations issued a report condemning Tehran for using executions as a “tool of state intimidation”. “The internet will gradually return to normal operations this week,” Hossein Afshin, Iran’s vice president for science, technology and the knowledge economy, said on Monday on state television. The government imposed a nationwide communications blackout earlier this month amid huge demonstrations triggered by anger over economic hardship. Limited internet access briefly returned on Sunday for some foreign websites such as Google, but opening links from search results remained impossible as of Monday. The shutdown began on Jan 8. Norway-based Iran Human Rights said it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces, confirming cases through sources within the Islamic Republic’s health and medical system, witnesses and independent sources. The NGO warned the true toll is likely far higher. The media cannot independently confirm the figure, and Iranian officials have not provided an exact death toll. ‘Not right’ Iran’s foreign minister will not be attending the Davos su­­mmit in Switzerland this we­­ek, the organisers said, stressing it would not be “right” after the recent deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran. Abbas Araghchi had been scheduled to speak on Tuesday during the annual gathering of the global elite at the upscale Swiss ski resort town. But activists have been calling on the World Economic Forum organisers to disinvite him amid what rights groups have called a “massacre” in his country. “The Iranian Foreign Minister will not be attending Davos,” the World Economic Forum said on X. “Although he was invited last fall, the tragic loss of lives of civilians in Iran over the past few weeks means that it is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” it added. ‘Intimidation tool’ Iran appears to be using executions “as a tool of state intimidation”, the United Nations said on Monday, as it denounced a jump in capital punishment globally in 2025. The Islamic republic reportedly executed 1,500 people last year, UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. “The scale and pace of executions suggest a systematic use of capital punishment as a tool of state intimidation, with disproportionate impact on ethnic minorities and migrants,” he warned. The spike in executions in Iran — which according to rights groups is the world’s most prolific executioner after China — had contributed to “an alarming increase” in the use of capital punishment worldwide last year, Turk said. While the overall global trend continues to move towards universal abolition of the death penalty, Iran and a handful of other states such as Saudi Arabia and the United States saw executions surge. “Many of those executions were “for offences not meeting the ‘most serious crimes’ threshold required under international law,” Turk said, also criticising “the continued execution of people convicted of crimes committed as children, as well as persistent secrecy around executions”.

      "summary_orig": "An explosion tore through a Chinese-run restaurant in a hotel in a heavily guarded part of Afghanistan’s capital on Monday, killing a Chinese national and six Afghans and injuring several others, including a child, officials said. The restaurant was in the commercial Shahr-i-Naw neighbourhood of Kabul that includes office buildings, shopping complexes and embassies, police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said. The district is considered one of the safest in the city. The Chinese noodle restaurant was jointly run by a Chinese Muslim, Abdul Majid, his wife, and an Afghan partner, Abdul Jabbar Mahmood, and served the Chinese Muslim community, Zadran said. One Chinese national, identified as Ayub, and six Afghans were killed in the blast, which occurred near the kitchen, while several others were injured, Zadran added. Videos shared on social media showed debris scattered on the street outside and smoke spewing from a large hole torn into the front of the restaurant building. “So far, we have received 20 people at our hospital,” Dejan Panic, humanitarian group EMERGENCYs Country Director in Afghanistan, said in a statement. “Among the wounded are four women and a child … Unfortunately, seven people were already dead on arrival.” There was no immediate word on the cause of the explosion. Authorities said they were investigating. In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the bombing and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The president conveyed sincere sympathy with the injured and their families and prayed for their early recovery,” the statement read. “He paid tribute to the spirit of Chinese citizens who have continued to work for the development of Afghanistan despite rising insecurity and serious risks to their lives.” According to the statement, the president noted the Afghan Taliban regime’s failure to honour commitments made under the Doha Agreement, particularly the obligation to prevent the use of Afghan soil for acts of terrorism. “He recalled that Pakistan has repeatedly stressed that no terrorist groups should be allowed safe havens in Afghanistan and that regional peace and security must be upheld,” the statement said. The statement noted that other countries neighbouring Afghanistan, including Tajikistan, were recently affected by terrorists operating from Afghan soil. “The president further stated that the failure to establish a broad-based and inclusive government by the Taliban is contrary to the Doha Agreement,” the statement added. “He emphasised that full implementation of the agreement, in letter and spirit, along with concrete steps to end cross-border terrorism, remains essential.” The Taliban took control of war-torn Afghanistan in 2021 and said it would restore security, but bomb attacks have continued, many of them claimed by the local arm of the militant Islamic State group.",

      "summary_en": "An explosion tore through a Chinese-run restaurant in a hotel in a heavily guarded part of Afghanistan’s capital on Monday, killing a Chinese national and six Afghans and injuring several others, including a child, officials said. The restaurant was in the commercial Shahr-i-Naw neighbourhood of Kabul that includes office buildings, shopping complexes and embassies, police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said. The district is considered one of the safest in the city. The Chinese noodle restaurant was jointly run by a Chinese Muslim, Abdul Majid, his wife, and an Afghan partner, Abdul Jabbar Mahmood, and served the Chinese Muslim community, Zadran said. One Chinese national, identified as Ayub, and six Afghans were killed in the blast, which occurred near the kitchen, while several others were injured, Zadran added. Videos shared on social media showed debris scattered on the street outside and smoke spewing from a large hole torn into the front of the restaurant building. “So far, we have received 20 people at our hospital,” Dejan Panic, humanitarian group EMERGENCYs Country Director in Afghanistan, said in a statement. “Among the wounded are four women and a child … Unfortunately, seven people were already dead on arrival.” There was no immediate word on the cause of the explosion.
