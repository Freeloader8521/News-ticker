Clean water is a privilege in the country of 1.4 billion people, where researchers say 70 per cent of the groundwater is contaminated.

      "summary_orig": "Iranian army chief Amir Hatami on Saturday warned the United States and Israel against an attack, saying his country’s forces were on high alert following Washington’s heavy military deployments in the Gulf. He also insisted the Islamic republic’s nuclear expertise could not be eliminated, after Trump said he expected Tehran to seek a deal to avoid US strikes. “If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region, and the security of the Zionist regime (Israel),” Hatami said, according to the official IRNA news agency. He noted that Iran’s armed forces were “at full defensive and military readiness”. Washington sent a naval strike group to the Middle East led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, with Trump threatening to intervene militarily after a deadly crackdown by Iranian authorities on two weeks of anti-government protests. The deployment has raised fears of a possible direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies — notably Israel — in the event of an attack. On Friday, Trump said he predicted that Iran would seek to negotiate a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face American military action. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that Tehran was ready for nuclear talks, but its missiles and defence “will never be negotiated”. ‘Cannot be eliminated’ The US carried out strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites in June when it briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against its regional foe. Israeli attacks also hit military sites across the country and killed senior officers and top nuclear scientists. But Hatami on Saturday insisted that Iran’s nuclear technology “cannot be eliminated, even if scientists and sons of this nation are martyred”. On Friday, US Central Command (Centcom) said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would conduct “a two-day live-fire naval exercise” in the Strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies. In a statement , Centcom warned the IRGC against “any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces”. The United States designated the IRGC a terrorist organisation in 2019, a move the European Union followed on Thursday. The EU decision drew angry reactions from Tehran, which vowed to reciprocate. Deadly crackdown Nationwide protests against the rising cost of living erupted in Iran on December 28, before turning into a broader anti-government movement that peaked on January 8 and 9. Iranian authorities have said the protests began peacefully before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, blaming the United States and Israel for fomenting the unrest. The official death toll from the authorities stands at 3,117. The protests have since subsided . On Saturday, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian urged his government to heed public grievances after the demonstrations. “We must work with the people and for the people and serve the people as much as possible,” Pezeshkian said in a speech broadcast on state TV. “If we act justly, the people will see it and will accept it, and under such conditions, no power can cripple a government, a society, or a nation that acts justly, fairly, and on the basis of rights.” On Saturday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei visited the shrine of Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, in southern Tehran. In a video carried by his official website, Khamenei offered prayers at the shrine on the occasion of 10-day celebrations marking the 47th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

On Saturday, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian urged his government to heed public grievances after the demonstrations. “We must work with the people and for the people and serve the people as much as possible,” Pezeshkian said in a speech broadcast on state TV. “If we act justly, the people will see it and will accept it, and under such conditions, no power can cripple a government, a society, or a nation that acts justly, fairly, and on the basis of rights.” On Saturday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei visited the shrine of Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, in southern Tehran. In a video carried by his official website, Khamenei offered prayers at the shrine on the occasion of 10-day celebrations marking the 47th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

      "summary": "Iranian army chief Amir Hatami on Saturday warned the United States and Israel against an attack, saying his country’s forces were on high alert following Washington’s heavy military deployments in the Gulf. He also insisted the Islamic republic’s nuclear expertise could not be eliminated, after Trump said he expected Tehran to seek a deal to avoid US strikes. “If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region, and the security of the Zionist regime (Israel),” Hatami said, according to the official IRNA news agency. He noted that Iran’s armed forces were “at full defensive and military readiness”. Washington sent a naval strike group to the Middle East led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, with Trump threatening to intervene militarily after a deadly crackdown by Iranian authorities on two weeks of anti-government protests. The deployment has raised fears of a possible direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies — notably Israel — in the event of an attack. On Friday, Trump said he predicted that Iran would seek to negotiate a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face American military action. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that Tehran was ready for nuclear talks, but its missiles and defence “will never be negotiated”. ‘Cannot be eliminated’ The US carried out strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites in June when it briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against its regional foe. Israeli attacks also hit military sites across the country and killed senior officers and top nuclear scientists. But Hatami on Saturday insisted that Iran’s nuclear technology “cannot be eliminated, even if scientists and sons of this nation are martyred”. On Friday, US Central Command (Centcom) said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would conduct “a two-day live-fire naval exercise” in the Strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies. In a statement , Centcom warned the IRGC against “any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces”. The United States designated the IRGC a terrorist organisation in 2019, a move the European Union followed on Thursday. The EU decision drew angry reactions from Tehran, which vowed to reciprocate. Deadly crackdown Nationwide protests against the rising cost of living erupted in Iran on December 28, before turning into a broader anti-government movement that peaked on January 8 and 9. Iranian authorities have said the protests began peacefully before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, blaming the United States and Israel for fomenting the unrest. The official death toll from the authorities stands at 3,117. The protests have since subsided . On Saturday, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian urged his government to heed public grievances after the demonstrations. “We must work with the people and for the people and serve the people as much as possible,” Pezeshkian said in a speech broadcast on state TV. “If we act justly, the people will see it and will accept it, and under such conditions, no power can cripple a government, a society, or a nation that acts justly, fairly, and on the basis of rights.” On Saturday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei visited the shrine of Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, in southern Tehran.

      "summary_orig": "The executive director of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, revealed early on Saturday that the eye procedure of incarcerated former premier Imran Khan was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention. The video statement by the hospital’s head comes after the PTI approached the Supreme Court on Friday, seeking its assistance in arranging a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians, with the help of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP). Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had earlier confirmed that Imran underwent a “20-minute” medical procedure for an eye ailment on the night of January 24 at Pims in Islamabad. “It (the procedure) was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes. During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions and follow-up advice and documents,” said Sikander. The doctor said the former premier, aged 74, complained of “reduced vision in his right eye”, adding that a “qualified ophthalmologist” from the hospital conducted a “complete eye assessment at Adiala jail”. Sikander elaborated that the doctor dispatched to the prison conducted “strict lab examination, [ocular] endoscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, essential laboratory tests and OCT of the retina”. He added that based on the initial assessment, the diagnosis of right central vein occlusion was made and a hospital-based treatment was recommended. “Accordingly, Mr Niazi was brought to Pims on the night of last Saturday, Sunday for the advised procedure.” The head of the hospital said Imran, after arrival at Pims, was “explained in full” about the procedure. “Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure. The procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocol and monitoring,” said Dr Sikander. Imran’s eye condition and ‘secret transfer’ to Pims On January 28, the PTI had raised concerns about Imran’s health, saying it had learned through credible reports that he had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye, which could cause permanent eyesight damage if not treated promptly. The party had alleged that the jail administration was insisting that the treatment be provided inside the prison, contrary to a medical expert’s advice to take him to a hospital. The next day, a report , quoting a senior doctor at Pims, said Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on the night of January 24 for a medical procedure, which was “completed when the time reached in the A.M.”. The doctor said there was “extraordinary movement” on Saturday night, and the operation theatres and the anaesthesia room were cordoned off ahead of Imran’s arrival at Pims. On Thursday, the information minister confirmed that the PTI founder underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment at Pims on the night of January 24. He said it was a “20-minute” procedure and that the ex-premier was “absolutely healthy”. Subsequently, the PTI condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians. The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also termed Imran’s transfer to the hospital without the knowledge of his family and personal physicians a “criminal negligence”. Imran’s sister, Noreen Niazi, who had earlier raised doubts about his brother’s ailment, reiterated concerns that his family and lawyers were not being kept informed and demanded that his medical reports be made public. Then on Friday, the PTI staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court, following which it said the ex-premier’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.",

Sikander elaborated that the doctor dispatched to the prison conducted “strict lab examination, [ocular] endoscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, essential laboratory tests and OCT of the retina”. He added that based on the initial assessment, the diagnosis of right central vein occlusion was made and a hospital-based treatment was recommended. “Accordingly, Mr Niazi was brought to Pims on the night of last Saturday, Sunday for the advised procedure.” The head of the hospital said Imran, after arrival at Pims, was “explained in full” about the procedure. “Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure. The procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocol and monitoring,” said Dr Sikander. Imran’s eye condition and ‘secret transfer’ to Pims On January 28, the PTI had raised concerns about Imran’s health, saying it had learned through credible reports that he had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye, which could cause permanent eyesight damage if not treated promptly. The party had alleged that the jail administration was insisting that the treatment be provided inside the prison, contrary to a medical expert’s advice to take him to a hospital. The next day, a report , quoting a senior doctor at Pims, said Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on the night of January 24 for a medical procedure, which was “completed when the time reached in the A.M.”. The doctor said there was “extraordinary movement” on Saturday night, and the operation theatres and the anaesthesia room were cordoned off ahead of Imran’s arrival at Pims. On Thursday, the information minister confirmed that the PTI founder underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment at Pims on the night of January 24. He said it was a “20-minute” procedure and that the ex-premier was “absolutely healthy”. Subsequently, the PTI condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians. The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also termed Imran’s transfer to the hospital without the knowledge of his family and personal physicians a “criminal negligence”. Imran’s sister, Noreen Niazi, who had earlier raised doubts about his brother’s ailment, reiterated concerns that his family and lawyers were not being kept informed and demanded that his medical reports be made public. Then on Friday, the PTI staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court, following which it said the ex-premier’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States on Friday approved multibillion-dollar weapons sales to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, at a point of high tensions with Iran. The State Department said it green-lighted a $3.8-billion sale of 30 Apache attack helicopters to Israel, which has agreed to a fragile ceasefire in Gaza. “The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability,” the State Department said in a statement. “This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” it said. Also in the package was a $1.8 billion sale of joint light tactical vehicles. The United States sends billions of dollars worth of military supplies per year to Israel, largely in aid rather than sales. Israel and Hamas reached a US-backed ceasefire in October that largely paused two years of war. Tensions are high elsewhere in the region as the United States deploys a major military contingent in waters near Iran. The State Department also approved a $9-billion sale to Saudi Arabia for 730 Patriot missiles, which are used to defend against incoming attacks. Israel last year carried out a major bombing campaign against nuclear and other military sites in Iran. Iran has faced growing pressure after major protests against the clerical state, which has responded by killing thousands of protesters. Saudi Arabia has voiced caution about an attack on Iran as Gulf monarchies fear instability that could jeopardise their reputation as business havens. The Trump administration has said that the Gaza ceasefire is now in its second phase, with a focus on disarming Hamas. Earlier in November, US President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia was being designated as a “ major, non-Nato ally ”. The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. The White House also announced the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the Kingdom, however, the jets will be less advanced than those operated by Israel, in line with a US law that guarantees Israel’s military edge in the region.",

The United States sends billions of dollars worth of military supplies per year to Israel, largely in aid rather than sales. Israel and Hamas reached a US-backed ceasefire in October that largely paused two years of war. Tensions are high elsewhere in the region as the United States deploys a major military contingent in waters near Iran. The State Department also approved a $9-billion sale to Saudi Arabia for 730 Patriot missiles, which are used to defend against incoming attacks. Israel last year carried out a major bombing campaign against nuclear and other military sites in Iran. Iran has faced growing pressure after major protests against the clerical state, which has responded by killing thousands of protesters. Saudi Arabia has voiced caution about an attack on Iran as Gulf monarchies fear instability that could jeopardise their reputation as business havens. The Trump administration has said that the Gaza ceasefire is now in its second phase, with a focus on disarming Hamas. Earlier in November, US President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia was being designated as a “ major, non-Nato ally ”. The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. The White House also announced the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the Kingdom, however, the jets will be less advanced than those operated by Israel, in line with a US law that guarantees Israel’s military edge in the region.",

ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric emphasised that while recent prisoner exchanges allowed families to mourn or reunite, the civilian population remains in a desperate struggle for survival against harsh winter conditions and devastated infrastructure in the besieged territory. “States must harness the momentum generated by the first phase of the agreement between Israel and Hamas to urgently improve the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza,” Spoljaric said.

She explicitly called on Israel to ease its blockade on so-called “dual-use” materials — such as water pipes and generators — which remain essential for restoring basic services. “Many people in Gaza are still living in the rubble without basic services, struggling to stay warm amid harsh winter conditions,” Spoljaric said. Rafah partial reopening Following months of pleading from humanitarian organisations and Palestinians, Israel announced on Friday that it would reopen the Rafah crossing on the southern border with Egypt this Sunday on Feb 1. The crossing, a vital lifeline for aid, has been shuttered by Israeli forces since they seized control of the area.

Turkish President Re­cep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan led regional efforts to de-escalate tensions that have soared since the US moved military assets to the Middle East following a deadly crackdown on protests in Iran. While the Pentagon said the military remained ready, Trump lowered the temperature late on Thursday, stating he hoped to avoid conflict and that talks were possible. Speaking during a visit to Turkiye, Iranian For­eign Minister Abbas Araghchi welcomed the potential for dialogue but drew a hard line regarding national defence. “I want to state firmly that Iran’s defensive and missile capabilities will never be subject to negotiation,” Araghchi said, adding that his country had no current plans to meet US officials. Araghchi emphasised that Tehran was “ready to begin negotiations if they take place on an equal footing, based on mutual interests and mutual respect.” Erdogan spoke by ph­one with Iranian President Masoud Pezes­hkian on Friday, telling his counterpart that Turkiye was “ready to assume a facilitating role between Iran and the United States to de-escalate the tensions”. Standing alongside Araghchi at a press conference in Istanbul, Fidan said restarting talks over Iran’s nuclear program was “vital for reducing regional tensions”. He urged Washington to “act with common sense” and resist pressure from Israel, which he said was pushing for a US attack. Fidan also noted he had held discussions with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and would keep lines open to prevent Iran’s isolation. Despite the diplomatic overtures, significant hurdles remain. The Axios reported on Monday that US officials said any deal must include a cap on Tehran’s long-range missile stockpile, the removal of enriched uranium, and a ban on independent enrichment. Meanwhile, international pressure on Tehran continues to mount. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the BBC on Friday that preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons was “hugely important.” While stopping short of explicitly supporting a US strike, Starmer condemned the “grotesque” repression of demonstrators. The European Union also urged against military action but condemned the crackdown by designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a “terrorist organisation”. Tehran quickly criticised the move. Iran’s judiciary chief called the designation “hostile”, warning that Europe “will suffer the consequences of their foolish act”. Araghchi echoed the sentiment in Istanbul, labelling the designation a mistake and describing Europe as a “continent in decline”. While diplomatic channels remain active, military readiness continues. Israel’s Ynet news website reported Friday that a US Navy destroyer had docked at the Israeli port of Eilat. Araghchi told reporters that while Iran has “never sought war,” it remains prepared for any scenario. “Iran has no problem with negotiations, but negotiations cannot take place under the shadow of threats,” Araghchi said. “They must certainly set aside their threats and change their approach toward a fair and equitable negotiation, as Mr Trump himself said in his post.” Pezeshkian, in a call with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, reinforced that success depended on the “abandonment of belligerent and threatening actions,” warning that any aggression against Iran would “receive an immediate and firm response”. Tensions initially spiked following protests that erupted in late December over economic grievances. The demonstrations faced a severe crackdown that peaked on Jan 8 and Jan 9. Iran has accused the United States and Israel of fuelling a “terrorist operation” that transformed peaceful rallies into “riots”. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) confirmed 6,479 people were killed in the demonstrations, including 6,092 protesters and 118 children. Internet restrictions imposed in early January continue to hinder information access. While rights groups estimate the toll is in the tens of thousands, Iranian authorities have acknowledged more than 3,000 deaths, claiming the majority were security forces or bystanders killed by rioters.

      "summary_orig": "After staging a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad, the PTI said on Friday that the family of incarcerated premier Imran Khan would be provided a copy of his medical report. PTI’s Salman Akram Raja made the remarks while speaking to the media outside the SC building, where the party, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, staged a day-long sit-in in an effort to facilitate a meeting between Imran and his personal physicians. The development comes a day after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed that Imran underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment last week at a hospital in Islamabad. According to the minister, the former premier was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24. Speaking outside the SC premises on Friday evening, Raja said, “As you know, we have been outside the SC building all day.” Afridi and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas were also present alongside Raja. He said PTI lawmakers were also present at the sit-in, adding that a similar sit-in was staged outside Adiala jail on Thursday night that lasted till 3am on Friday. “There is nothing more important for us than Imran Khan sahib’s health,” he said. He added that the reports that had emerged about the ex-premier’s health were “unsatisfactory”. He said that Imran was taken to a hospital, without the family’s knowledge. “And then lies are told. For five days, they say that no such incident has happened,” he said. Raja said that he had held conversations with the chief justice of Pakistan, his staff and the attorney general for Pakistan all day. However, he said that whatever was “achieved” after their day-long efforts was “unsatisfactory”. “It has been said that Imran Khan sahib’s medical reports — what happened in Pims hospital, the diagnosis in jail before that — that report will be given to Imran Khan sahib in a sealed envelope. And a copy of that report will be given to family, meaning his sisters, today,” he said. He said that this would now show what the doctors had diagnosed Imran with and what medical procedure was carried out. “When this report comes in front of us, then the family will decide whether the medical treatment being provided is satisfactory or not,” he said. He said that the decisions about further treatment would also be made by the family. However, he said that the “real matter” was that Imran was wrongly arrested, calling for him to be released. He said that the party would continue to protest for Imran’s visitation rights. He said that to decide the future course of strategy, the party’s political committee would meet later in the day. He said that the political party would also speak to the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai, respectively. “So with their consultation, the PTI’s political party will decide the future course of action. We do not accept this current situation. Reciving the medical report is necessary,” he said. However, no future course of action as such emerged after the PTI’s political party met with the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leadership. In a video statement released after the meeting, Achakzai said that the opposition considered reports about Imran’s health a “diversion” from the nationwide protest announced for Feb 8. “I can say for certain that Imran Khan’s health is not as bad as it is being portrayed. Propaganda is being carried out,” he said. He called on the TTAP parties and the PTI to not back away from their “mission”, calling on the nation to participate in the Feb 8 protest. PTI camps outside SC Earlier in the day, PTI workers and lawmakers had camped outside the apex court. The KP chief minister had reached the SC in the morning, after a sit-in outside Adiala jail, which had continued into the early hours of Friday. He had left for a short period of time to offer Friday prayer at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, before returning to the SC premises. Later, Senate opposition leader Abbas also joined the sit-in. Speaking to the media during the day, Afridi said, “The whole nation is concerned about the health of the country’s most popular leader, Imran Khan.” He had stated that he would try to arrange a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians with the help of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP). The KP chief executive said the party would announce its future course of action if its attempts to arrange a meeting with Imran did not bear fruit. He had also lamented that while the courts were issuing decisions on petitions, “we are not getting justice”. “Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi’s cases have not been listed for one year. If the cases are listed today and we are provided justice, Khan sahib and Bushra Bibi, along with other leaders, will be released from prison within half an hour,” he claimed. “We were left with no option, so we opted for the only one available,” he added. In response to a question on concluding the protest outside Adiala jail, where the KP chief minister, along with other lawmakers and party workers, had camped, he said, “I have come here.” PTI leaders meet AGP Following their arrival at the SC, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and party leader and lawmaker Sardar Latif Khosa had met the registrar of the apex court and the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP). During the meeting, Raja and Khosa had expressed the party’s concern regarding Imran’s eye ailment and requested that the medical report of the doctor who treated the former premier be provided. Addressing the media outside, Khosa said he reminded the registrar and the attorney general of Pakistan that the CJP should promote good practices before he retired as “this (Imran’s case) is not only a human rights issue, but he (Imran) is also being deprived of his basic rights.” “He (CJP) has taken an oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of the basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said. Khosa claimed that the procedure of retina rupture did not last “20-minutes” as shared by the information minister, but “it is 2.5 hours”. He said Imran’s health was PTI’s “red line” and any matter related to his health “will not be tolerated at any cost”. “This is his legal and constitutional right,” added Khosa. “I told the registrar to share our concerns with the CJP,” he said. Khosa also said that Imran was being deprived of his basic rights. “He (CJP) has taken oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said. ‘Secrecy is cancer to democracy’ PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan and party leader Babar Awan also addressed the media on Friday at KP House, saying that the “one-point agenda” for the press conference was Imran’s health. Referring to the former prime minister’s brief stay at Islamabad’s Pims hospital , he said, “Secrecy is cancer to democracy. His (Imran Khan’s) family is worried due to his health.” Gohar demanded that doctors from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be allowed to examine the former prime minister. “Dr Faisal and Dr Asim should be allowed to meet Khan sahib .” The party chairman added that neither the party nor Imran’s family was informed about his health or treatment. Awan, addressing the media, said if the report regarding Imran’s health is not made public, “it will have grave consequences” and added that the party and its supporters were anxious regarding the former premier’s health.

      "title_en": "After day-long sit-in outside SC, PTI says Imran’s family to be provided ex-premier’s medical report",
      "summary_en": "After staging a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad, the PTI said on Friday that the family of incarcerated premier Imran Khan would be provided a copy of his medical report. PTI’s Salman Akram Raja made the remarks while speaking to the media outside the SC building, where the party, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, staged a day-long sit-in in an effort to facilitate a meeting between Imran and his personal physicians. The development comes a day after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed that Imran underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment last week at a hospital in Islamabad. According to the minister, the former premier was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24. Speaking outside the SC premises on Friday evening, Raja said, “As you know, we have been outside the SC building all day.” Afridi and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas were also present alongside Raja. He said PTI lawmakers were also present at the sit-in, adding that a similar sit-in was staged outside Adiala jail on Thursday night that lasted till 3am on Friday. “There is nothing more important for us than Imran Khan sahib’s health,” he said. He added that the reports that had emerged about the ex-premier’s health were “unsatisfactory”. He said that Imran was taken to a hospital, without the family’s knowledge. “And then lies are told. For five days, they say that no such incident has happened,” he said. Raja said that he had held conversations with the chief justice of Pakistan, his staff and the attorney general for Pakistan all day. However, he said that whatever was “achieved” after their day-long efforts was “unsatisfactory”. “It has been said that Imran Khan sahib’s medical reports — what happened in Pims hospital, the diagnosis in jail before that — that report will be given to Imran Khan sahib in a sealed envelope. And a copy of that report will be given to family, meaning his sisters, today,” he said. He said that this would now show what the doctors had diagnosed Imran with and what medical procedure was carried out. “When this report comes in front of us, then the family will decide whether the medical treatment being provided is satisfactory or not,” he said. He said that the decisions about further treatment would also be made by the family. However, he said that the “real matter” was that Imran was wrongly arrested, calling for him to be released. He said that the party would continue to protest for Imran’s visitation rights. He said that to decide the future course of strategy, the party’s political committee would meet later in the day. He said that the political party would also speak to the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai, respectively. “So with their consultation, the PTI’s political party will decide the future course of action. We do not accept this current situation. Reciving the medical report is necessary,” he said. However, no future course of action as such emerged after the PTI’s political party met with the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leadership. In a video statement released after the meeting, Achakzai said that the opposition considered reports about Imran’s health a “diversion” from the nationwide protest announced for Feb 8. “I can say for certain that Imran Khan’s health is not as bad as it is being portrayed. Propaganda is being carried out,” he said. He called on the TTAP parties and the PTI to not back away from their “mission”, calling on the nation to participate in the Feb 8 protest. PTI camps outside SC Earlier in the day, PTI workers and lawmakers had camped outside the apex court. The KP chief minister had reached the SC in the morning, after a sit-in outside Adiala jail, which had continued into the early hours of Friday. He had left for a short period of time to offer Friday prayer at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, before returning to the SC premises. Later, Senate opposition leader Abbas also joined the sit-in. Speaking to the media during the day, Afridi said, “The whole nation is concerned about the health of the country’s most popular leader, Imran Khan.” He had stated that he would try to arrange a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians with the help of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP). The KP chief executive said the party would announce its future course of action if its attempts to arrange a meeting with Imran did not bear fruit. He had also lamented that while the courts were issuing decisions on petitions, “we are not getting justice”. “Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi’s cases have not been listed for one year. If the cases are listed today and we are provided justice, Khan sahib and Bushra Bibi, along with other leaders, will be released from prison within half an hour,” he claimed. “We were left with no option, so we opted for the only one available,” he added. In response to a question on concluding the protest outside Adiala jail, where the KP chief minister, along with other lawmakers and party workers, had camped, he said, “I have come here.” PTI leaders meet AGP Following their arrival at the SC, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and party leader and lawmaker Sardar Latif Khosa had met the registrar of the apex court and the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP).
