      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said on Friday that, on the directives of the provincial government, an operation was launched against riverine bandits last month. Speaking at a press conference at the Central Police Office, the provincial police chief said since the launch of the operation, 113 encounters had taken place with criminals in which 27 kidnappers were gunned down, 82 others were injured, and 77 were arrested. Flanked by Sindh Additional Inspector General of Police Iqbal Dara, Odho said 123 bandits had also surrendered before law enforcers as part of the government’s policy. “These were not ordinary criminals,” he said. He further said that 15 people who had been kidnapped had been recovered safely. He lamented that some of the citizens rescued were in the custody of the bandits for up to three years. Way forward In an oblique reference to past operations against riverine bandits that failed to deliver desirable results, Odho said a comprehensive plan had been chalked out in which socio-economic aspects were also included as part of the government’s policy. He vowed to continue the operation until the “total annihilation” of crime in riverine areas. The Sindh police chief said the riverine areas where military-grade weapons were available would be de-weaponised. He said that under the plan, tribal feuds — which had remained nurseries for bandits in terms of provision of manpower and weapons — would be ended. He said that these tribal feuds were the outcome of “egos, attempts to occupy government lands and petty issues”. Some tribal chiefs had cooperated with the law enforcers for eliminating the criminals, he noted, adding that those who refused to do so would be taken to task. He further said that there would be “permanent presence” of police to prevent the reemergence of the criminals. He declared that a “riverine police unit” would be set up for this purpose. He claimed that recently hard-to-reach areas like Bagarji and Ranwati had been cleared of bandits, adding that notorious gangs were eliminated. He further said that there would be a “socio-economic development plan” for riverine areas. He hoped that with the completion of the Ghotki-Kandhkot bridge on the Indus River, law enforcers would get easy access to riverine areas. He hoped that this proposed bridge would help to eliminate criminals. Odho also said that roads, dispensaries and schools would be set up in these areas. For this purpose, certain non-governmental organisations in Karachi had pledged to help set up educational institutes in the riverine areas, he said. He said that with the help of oil and gas companies, socio-economic uplift projects were launched in Ghotki district in 2003. He noted that these projects benefited local communities and helped in eliminating criminals, particularly from the Chachar community. The police chief said that the riverine area was spread over 450 kilometres in the province. He said that out of this, 50-60km was where bandits had established their hideouts. The police faced two challenges there, he said. “The presence of a significant quantity of water with fertile lands and islands, and the area’s proximity to border areas of other provinces like Punjab,” Odho added. Referring to his recent talk with the newly-appointed Punjab police chief, who also belongs to Nawabshah, Odho said, the two had decided to further strengthen cooperation and joint operations in bordering areas. “An air surveillance unit would also be set up for surveillance of the areas with the help of drones,” he added. In response to a question about the alleged political patronisation of the bandits in areas, Odho said that certain individuals may support criminals due to caste, kinship, or land disputes in their individual capacity. However, he said that the government had given law enforcers a free hand, adding that they were not facing any pressure. Odho said that with the launch of recent operations in Balochistan and the “improvement of the situation in the province”, he hoped that the “flow of sophisticated weapons” to riverine areas would end. “The leakages in de-weaponising the areas will be addressed with the help of the federal government,” he said. The Sindh IG said around 150,000 people were living in riverine areas, adding that the Sindh government had decided to “rehabilitate them”. He further said that if needed, they would be provided state land to sustain their livelihoods. Crime in Karachi During the press talk, the Sindh police chief said that another major challenge for the law enforcers was street crime in Karachi. He said that there was a time when organised crime and terrorism prevailed in the metropolis, saying that there were “no-go areas” and police did not even “dare to go there”. “Peace was restored in the provincial capital following the sacrifices of over 1,100 police officials,” he said. He noted that crime had not been eliminated from Karachi, but said that the “numbers have declined”. He vowed to further improve the situation in the metropolis.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: At least 31 people were killed and another 169 injured in a suicide bombing at an imambargah during Friday prayers in Islamabad, according to authorities. The explosion occurred at Imambargah Khadijah-tul-Kubra in the Tarlai area of the federal capital. Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris, and panicked worshippers. Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the imambargah as people called for help. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif suggested India’s and Afghanistan’s involvement in the attack, stating in a post on social media platform X that “it has been proved the terrorist involved in the attack travelled to and from Afghanistan. The collusion between India and Afghanistan is being revealed.” The defence minister said that security guards at the site of the incident had “challenged” the attacker, and in response, he opened fire. “He then blew himself up, standing in the last row of worshippers.” Asif said that the state would respond to this “cruelty with full force”. “After a humiliating defeat, India is fighting a war through its proxies. It doesn’t have the courage to fight directly now,” he added. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry later said while speaking to the media in Islamabad that while the attacker was not an Afghan, the authorities had been able to determine through forensic tests the number of times he had travelled to Afghanistan. Earlier, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that “India is behind” the incident. Speaking to the media at Polyclinic Hospital in Islamabad, he expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from Pakistan. The minister further said that Pakistan had always promoted peace and wanted peace in the region. But, he added, Pakistan’s neighbours had been involved in terror activities in the country. In this connection, the minister particularly mentioned India, saying that it was involved in “terrorism activities in Balochistan, Fata and in the incident that took place in Islamabad today”. “We have exposed them to the world,” he said, adding that the nation was united against such “cowardly acts and enemies”. “The fight against them (terrorists) will continue until they are eliminated,” he expressed resolve. The minister said injured and the dead had been taken to Pims and Polyclinic Hospital, and emergencies had been declared in hospitals across Islamabad. According to Islamabad Capital Territory Police Spokesperson Taqi Jawad, the cousin of Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi was among the deceased while another of his relatives had been injured. Meanwhile, the district administration spokesperson said the site of the blast was completely sealed off by security personnel, and added that assistant commissioners were assigned to oversee the treatment of the injured at various hospitals. Police and Rescue 1122 personnel reached the site of the incident and initiated rescue operations soon after the blast. Security personnel stand guard outside an imambargah following an explosion, in Islamabad on February 6, 2026. —AFP Pindi police on high alert; Punjab CM dispatches ambulances In view of the prevailing security situation, Rawalpindi police were placed on high-alert, according to a statement by the police spokesperson. “Security duties are being checked and [officials are being] briefed at imambargahs, mosques and other places across the city,” the statement read. According to the statement, the police officials held meetings with the administrators and the guardians of the religious places and informed them about security standard operating procedures and the measures taken in this regard. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in a post on X, said the provincial government had dispatched 25 ambulances to Islamabad. She added that all hospitals across Rawalpindi district had been placed on high alert with “surgical teams, anesthetists, orthopedic and neurosurgical specialists on standby”. “Blood banks are fully staffed, and operation theatres are fully equipped to ensure prompt and effective medical care for the injured.” Maryam added that the commissioner and deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi were also instructed to extend every possible assistance. The attack comes as Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev is currently visiting Pakistan. President, PM condemn blast Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari extended condolences to the victims who lost their lives in the blast, according to a statement issued by the PPP on X. He expressed grief over the incident, saying, “Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity”. The president prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to them. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the blast, according to a statement. He expressed grief over the deaths in the blast and expressed sympathy with the bereaved. In a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the prime minister directed him to complete the investigation of the incident and immediately identify the people responsible for it. He directed that “the injured be provided best medical facilities and the health minister will monitor” the situation, the statement quoted him as saying. “No one will be allowed to disseminate chaos and unrest in the country,” he said. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also condemned the “cowardly suicide attack on innocent worshippers during Friday prayers at a Shia imambargah in Islamabad, killing dozens”. “Targeting places of worship and civilians is a heinous crime against humanity and a blatant violation of Islamic principles,” he said. Dar further said, “Pakistan stands united against terrorism in all its forms. This barbarity will not intimidate us and extremists will be brought to full account.” Today’s incident comes less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast. This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters. Additional input from Mohammad Asghar.",

      "summary_orig": "At least 31 people were killed and another 169 were injured when an explosion ripped through an imambargah in Islamabad’s Tarlai area during Friday prayers. Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris and panicked worshippers. The attack was widely condemned by political leaders and foreign diplomats, who labelled the incident “abhorrent” and “a direct attack on humanity, religion and social values”. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal strongly condemned the “cowardly” attack, writing on X that his heart went out to the victims’ families. “Pakistan stands united against terrorism — we will bring the perpetrators to justice,” he added. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry strongly condemned the attack in a post on X, expressing grief over the loss of lives in the “cowardly act”. He extended condolences to the bereaved families and prayed for the recovery of the injured. “Such acts of terrorism cannot dampen the morale of the nation. The need of the hour is that we all stand united for peace, tolerance, and stability, and express solidarity with law enforcement agencies,” the minister stressed. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed deep sadness over the incident, extending “prayers for the swift recovery of the injured, and may Allah grant patience and strength to all those affected”. In a separate statement, she said that 25 ambulances were dispatched to Islamabad to respond to the incident. “All hospitals across Rawalpindi District have been placed on high alert, with surgical teams, anaesthetists [and] orthopaedic and neurosurgical specialists on standby,” the chief minister stated. She added that blood banks and operating theatres were fully equipped to ensure effective medical care for the injured, while local government officials were directed to extend “every possible assistance”. Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the bombing, noting that the people of his province are “not unfamiliar with this grief [and] know how deep the wound of terrorism is”. “I offer my heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and pray for the swift recovery of the injured,” he added. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari strongly condemned the blast and called targeting citizens in a mosque “an attack on humanity, religion, and the national conscience”, according to a statement from the PPP. “No religion or ideology permits the murder of innocent people,” he was quoted as saying. Bilawal demanded that an immediate and transparent investigation of the incident be conducted, and the “perpetrators and their facilitators [be] brought to justice”. He added that effective measures must be put in place to protect places of worship and stressed that the nation must stand united against “hatred, extremism, and terrorism”. In a statement from its central information department, the PTI strongly condemned the “horrific suicide bombing” in Islamabad. “Targeting a place of worship is an extremely cowardly and inhumane act, which reflects the savagery of the terrorists and is a reprehensible conspiracy to harm peace in Pakistan,” the statement read. “[The] Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf fully condemns terrorism and all elements behind it, and demands that the terrorists involved in this heinous crime and their facilitators be brought to immediate justice.” Additionally, the party extended its prayers to those killed in the blast and demanded that the relevant authorities provide the best medical care to the injured immediately. “To eradicate this growing scourge of terrorism, the entire nation must stand united so that peace, tolerance, and stability in Pakistan can be ensured,” the PTI said. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan strongly condemned the blast in a post on X, extending his condolences to the victims and their families. “Now is the time for every terrorist, wherever they may be, to meet their end in the depths of hell — I am hopeful that, God willing, with the cooperation of us all, our provincial and national institutions will succeed in this war,” he stated. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman termed the attack “regrettable and condemnable”, calling the perpetrators “enemies of humanity and deserving no leniency”, according to a statement from his party. “After Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, now even in Islamabad, terrorist activities are continuing relentlessly,” he said. “No part of the country is safe from terrorists.” Fazl noted that institutions’ “pride in their performance” had come into question amid these circumstances. “The nation cannot be reassured by relying on rulers’ visits and statements of condemnation after major tragedies,” Fazl was quoted as saying. “If institutions remain free from political interference, they should focus on peace, security and [the] protection of the people’s lives and property.” He also observed that national and international elements inciting sectarianism “cannot be overlooked”. “Despite the presence of dozens of intelligence agencies, Islamabad was stained with blood during broad daylight. The attack is a failure of the agencies,” Fazl added. The JUI-F chief questioned when state institutions would address the public’s issues and whether a system would be implemented for “protecting the future of the people and coming generations”. Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the incident. “Such an incident of terrorism in the federal capital is not just a proof of the grave failure to protect human lives, but it also is a big question mark on the performance of the administration and law enforcement agencies,” he said in a post on X. Abbas strongly condemned the attack and extended condolences to the families of the deceased. “Targeting places of worship is a direct attack on humanity, religion and social values, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” he said. He also appealed to the youth in Islamabad to donate blood at hospitals and “play their part in saving precious lives”. The Tehreek Tahahfuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance shared Senator Abbas’s post, reiterating his request to the youth of Islamabad to donate blood. “Step forward at this delicate moment, demonstrating the essence of humanity,” the TTAP urged. “At this time, there is an urgent need for blood in various hospitals of Islamabad for the injured worshippers. “Therefore, all of you participate actively in this noble cause and play your role in saving precious lives.” PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser deemed the attack “cowardly and inhumane” in a post on X, stating that targeting a place of worship “reflects the worst form of enmity toward humanity and a cowardly mindset”. “A suicide attack at a place of worship is not only an assault on fundamental human values but also an open crime against humanity,” Qaiser said. PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram condemned the attack and deemed it not just an act of terror, but rather “an attack on our shared humanity, our religion, and the conscience of Pakistan itself”. “No belief, no grievance, no ideology can ever justify the murder of innocent Muslims, especially within a sacred place meant for prayer, dignity, and peace,” he said in a post on X. Expressing solidarity with the victims and those affected, Akram said that Pakistan belongs to every one of its citizens and stressed that those responsible must be brought to justice. “Sectarian violence is a deadly poison that fractures our society and empowers only those who wish to see our nation burn,” he asserted. “This is the moment to reject hatred without ambiguity, to defend every place of worship, and to stand united against extremism in all its forms.” Adding that terrorism has no religion, nor violence any justification, Akram urged the people of Pakistan to “choose peace, firmly, finally, and together”. National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq condemned the attack in a statement, stating that the “despicable act of the suicide attacker belonging to Fitna al Hindustan is a cowardly act”. Extending condolences to the victims, he added, “A terrorist attack on innocent and defenceless worshippers is a cowardly act, and no amount of condemnation is enough.” Sadiq called terrorists “enemies of humanity”, asserting that they have no connection with any religion. “Terrorists belonging to Fitna al Hindustan will never succeed in their filthy designs,” the statement read. “The cowardly actions of the terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan can never shake the resolve of the security forces and the nation in the fight against terrorism.” Deputy NA Speaker Ghulam Mustafa strongly condemned the attack and expressed “profound grief and sorrow”, according to a statement from the lower house of parliament. “The attack on innocent worshippers is a cowardly act,” Mustafa was quoted as saying. “This malicious act is a failed attempt to sabotage societal peace.” Noting that terrorists “have no connection to any religion or humanity”, the deputy speaker vowed that terrorists would never succeed in their goals and that “the terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan will not be allowed to harm Pakistan’s peace and stability”. “The entire nation stands united against terrorism. The terrorists’ cowardly actions cannot weaken the resolve of the nation and security forces,” Mustafa added. Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, called the bombing “the latest in a series of murderous terrorist attacks orchestrated by India”. “India’s terrorist proxies will neither slow down economic recovery, nor divide Pakistani hearts, nor undermine Pakistan’s growing diplomatic capital,” Zaidi said on social media platform X, praying for the victims’ families and vowing that “justice will be done”. US Charge d’Affaires Natalie Baker strongly condemned the bombing, as well as all acts of terrorism, in a statement. “On behalf of the United States, I offer our sincere condolences to those injured and to the families and loved ones of those killed by this attack,” she said. “Acts of terror and violence against civilians and places of worship are unacceptable,” it added. “The people of Pakistan deserve safety, dignity, and the ability to practice their faith without fear.” Baker was quoted as saying that Washington would continue supporting Pakistan’s efforts to advance peace and security and remained committed to their partnership. “We stand with Pakistan during this challenging moment.” In a statement, the Chinese Embassy said it was “deeply saddened” by the attack and expressed condolences and sympathies to the deceased and their families, wishing the injured a fast recovery. “We stand firmly with our Pakistani brothers and sisters in this difficult time,” it added. British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott took to X and extended her thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families. “Outraged and heartbroken by the horrific attack at Imambargah in Islamabad during Friday prayers,” she said. “Such violence is abhorrent. We stand with Pakistan.” The Turkish Embassy issued a statement condemning the bombing, calling it “abhorrent” and praying for the recovery of the injured. “We share the deep sorrow of the families who lost their loved ones and pray for Allah’s mercy upon the victims,” the statement read. “Turkiye stands firmly with our brother Pakistan. We remain fully committed to supporting Pakistan in its fight against all forms of terrorism.” Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the incident in a post on X on behalf of the government and the people of Iran. “On behalf of the government and the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I strongly condemn the hideous and awkward terrorist attack in Islamabad during the Friday prayers, which led to the martyrdom and injury of tens of innocent civilians.” “I extend my sincere and deepest condolences and sympathy to the government and the people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families,” he said. Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry strongly condemned “this heinous act of violence and terrorism, which targeted worshippers at a sacred place”. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, and we wish a swift recovery to those injured,” the ministry said in a statement. “Azerbaijan stands in solidarity with brotherly Pakistan and reaffirms its firm support for peace, stability, and the fight against all forms of terrorism.” The European Union expressed “deep shock” over the bombing and said it “strongly condemns all acts of terrorism and violent extremism”. “We stand with Pakistan and extend our condolences to the families of the victims and the injured,” the bloc affirmed in a statement. The French Embassy, in a statement, condemned the attack and extended condolences to the families of the deceased, also praying for a swift recovery for those injured. “We stand with Pakistan in opposing all forms of terrorism,” it read. German Ambassador to Pakistan Ina Lepel said that her country mourned the loss of life in today’s “horrible attack” and expressed hope that those responsible would be found and brought to justice. “Our thoughts are with the victims and their families,” she said in a post on X. The Dutch Embassy also issued a statement, condemning today’s bombing and extending their thoughts and prayers for the deceased, the injured and the victims’ families. “We recall the recent shocking terrorist attacks in Balochistan & stand against all forms of terrorism,” the statement read. Australian High Commissioner Timothy Kane said he was “shocked and saddened” by the bombing, conveying his thoughts to the victims, their families, and all those affected. “Australia stands and mourns with Pakistan at this difficult time,” he said.",

Extending condolences to the victims, he added, “A terrorist attack on innocent and defenceless worshippers is a cowardly act, and no amount of condemnation is enough.” Sadiq called terrorists “enemies of humanity”, asserting that they have no connection with any religion. “Terrorists belonging to Fitna al Hindustan will never succeed in their filthy designs,” the statement read. “The cowardly actions of the terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan can never shake the resolve of the security forces and the nation in the fight against terrorism.” Deputy NA Speaker Ghulam Mustafa strongly condemned the attack and expressed “profound grief and sorrow”, according to a statement from the lower house of parliament. “The attack on innocent worshippers is a cowardly act,” Mustafa was quoted as saying. “This malicious act is a failed attempt to sabotage societal peace.” Noting that terrorists “have no connection to any religion or humanity”, the deputy speaker vowed that terrorists would never succeed in their goals and that “the terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan will not be allowed to harm Pakistan’s peace and stability”. “The entire nation stands united against terrorism. The terrorists’ cowardly actions cannot weaken the resolve of the nation and security forces,” Mustafa added. Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, called the bombing “the latest in a series of murderous terrorist attacks orchestrated by India”. “India’s terrorist proxies will neither slow down economic recovery, nor divide Pakistani hearts, nor undermine Pakistan’s growing diplomatic capital,” Zaidi said on social media platform X, praying for the victims’ families and vowing that “justice will be done”. US Charge d’Affaires Natalie Baker strongly condemned the bombing, as well as all acts of terrorism, in a statement. “On behalf of the United States, I offer our sincere condolences to those injured and to the families and loved ones of those killed by this attack,” she said. “Acts of terror and violence against civilians and places of worship are unacceptable,” it added. “The people of Pakistan deserve safety, dignity, and the ability to practice their faith without fear.” Baker was quoted as saying that Washington would continue supporting Pakistan’s efforts to advance peace and security and remained committed to their partnership. “We stand with Pakistan during this challenging moment.” In a statement, the Chinese Embassy said it was “deeply saddened” by the attack and expressed condolences and sympathies to the deceased and their families, wishing the injured a fast recovery. “We stand firmly with our Pakistani brothers and sisters in this difficult time,” it added. British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott took to X and extended her thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families. “Outraged and heartbroken by the horrific attack at Imambargah in Islamabad during Friday prayers,” she said. “Such violence is abhorrent. We stand with Pakistan.” The Turkish Embassy issued a statement condemning the bombing, calling it “abhorrent” and praying for the recovery of the injured. “We share the deep sorrow of the families who lost their loved ones and pray for Allah’s mercy upon the victims,” the statement read. “Turkiye stands firmly with our brother Pakistan. We remain fully committed to supporting Pakistan in its fight against all forms of terrorism.” Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the incident in a post on X on behalf of the government and the people of Iran. “On behalf of the government and the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I strongly condemn the hideous and awkward terrorist attack in Islamabad during the Friday prayers, which led to the martyrdom and injury of tens of innocent civilians.” “I extend my sincere and deepest condolences and sympathy to the government and the people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families,” he said. Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry strongly condemned “this heinous act of violence and terrorism, which targeted worshippers at a sacred place”. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, and we wish a swift recovery to those injured,” the ministry said in a statement. “Azerbaijan stands in solidarity with brotherly Pakistan and reaffirms its firm support for peace, stability, and the fight against all forms of terrorism.” The European Union expressed “deep shock” over the bombing and said it “strongly condemns all acts of terrorism and violent extremism”. “We stand with Pakistan and extend our condolences to the families of the victims and the injured,” the bloc affirmed in a statement. The French Embassy, in a statement, condemned the attack and extended condolences to the families of the deceased, also praying for a swift recovery for those injured. “We stand with Pakistan in opposing all forms of terrorism,” it read. German Ambassador to Pakistan Ina Lepel said that her country mourned the loss of life in today’s “horrible attack” and expressed hope that those responsible would be found and brought to justice. “Our thoughts are with the victims and their families,” she said in a post on X. The Dutch Embassy also issued a statement, condemning today’s bombing and extending their thoughts and prayers for the deceased, the injured and the victims’ families. “We recall the recent shocking terrorist attacks in Balochistan & stand against all forms of terrorism,” the statement read. Australian High Commissioner Timothy Kane said he was “shocked and saddened” by the bombing, conveying his thoughts to the victims, their families, and all those affected. “Australia stands and mourns with Pakistan at this difficult time,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that ties between Pakistan and Uzbekistan from now onwards would be measured by trade flows, investment projects, industrial partnerships and people-to-people exchanges, Radio Pakistan reported. According to the report, he made the remarks while addressing the Pakistan-Uzbekistan Business Forum in Islamabad alongside Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who is in Islamabad on an official visit. In his remarks, the premier said that it was in this spirit that both countries had set an “ambitious yet easily achievable target of increasing our bilateral trade to $2 billion”, the report said. He said the two countries had also signed a protocol, which would lead to the constitution of a working group to draft a five-year roadmap in order to promote trade, investment, and joint collaboration in research and development, information technology and agriculture, it added. PM Shehbaz also said that tourism was another area in which both countries could benefit from each other’s experience. “He expressed the confidence that business-to-business memoranda of understanding worth $3.4bn are going to materialise,” the report said. The premier also stated that Pakistan considered Uzbekistan not only a partner but a gateway to Central Asia with great potential for joint ventures with Pakistani entrepreneurs, it added. Meanwhile, the visiting dignitary urged the business communities of both countries to come forward to tap the full trade potential between Pakistan and Uzbekistan. “He assured a ten-year tax exemption to Pakistani businesses in addition to all possible facilitation. The Uzbek president emphasised that both countries have a great trade potential in diverse areas,” the report said. ‘Pakistan committed to boosting ties with Uzbekistan in diverse fields’ Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari said that Pakistan was committed to elevating bilateral relations with Uzbekistan to “new heights” through closer cooperation in connectivity, trade and people-to-people contacts, according to a separate report by Radio Pakistan . According to the report, President Zardari met with Uzbekistan President Mirziyoyev and expressed the confidence that the visit would prove “productive and forward-looking”. “President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working closely with Uzbekistan to further strengthen cooperation in trade, connectivity, defence, security, culture and heritage,” Radio Pakistan said. He noted that direct air links between the two countries had brought the people of the two countries closer and underscored the importance of regional connectivity initiatives, including the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project, while highlighting the need to address remaining challenges through collective efforts, the national radio broadcaster said. During the meeting, President Zardari highlighted the “steady growth in bilateral trade in recent years and underscored the need to realise the true economic potential of the relationship, with the shared objective of expanding trade to two billion dollars as agreed by the two sides,” the report said. “He also stressed the importance of enhancing people-to-people contacts, tourism cooperation and cultural exchanges, drawing on the rich historical and spiritual links between the two nations,” it added. President Zardari also expressed the need to extend collaboration and facilitation between the financial institutions, including banks, to support trade and investment flows, it added. Radio Pakistan quoted Uzbek President Mirziyoyev as saying that the country attached great importance to strengthening friendship and the strategic partnership with Pakistan. “He noted with satisfaction the steady growth in bilateral contacts at various levels, including the expansion of trade, an increase in joint ventures, and the implementation of cooperation projects in priority sectors of the economy,” it said. It added that President Mirziyoyev directed his concerned minister to coordinate with the Pakistani counterpart in this regard. “The Uzbek president emphasised the need to further expand practical cooperation through closer political dialogue, stronger trade, economic and investment ties, and more active business exchanges,” the state-run broadcaster said. It stated that President Mirziyoyev invited his Pakistani counterpart to pay an official visit to Uzbekistan. “He said two additional direct flights would be added between the two countries, taking the total number of weekly flights to six, to further facilitate people-to-people contacts, tourism and business exchanges,” it added. During the meetings, the two presidents also discussed the regional situation, including matters affecting peace, stability and security, it said. Later, President Zardari conferred the Nishan-i-Pakistan on President Mirziyoyev in recognition of his contribution to strengthening Pakistan-Uzbekistan relations, the report added. Joint communique underscores commitment to connectivity, cooperation Separately, Pakistan and Uzbekistan underscored their commitment to further deepen bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in a joint declaration, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday. The joint declaration, signed by Mirziyoyev and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said that the leaders held comprehensive and in-depth discussions covering the full spectrum of bilateral relations between the two countries. “The two sides reaffirmed their strong resolve to comprehensively develop and strengthen cooperation in order to support each other’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, while advancing sustainable development aligned with the long-term national interests of the people of both states,” the declaration read. The two sides also exchanged views on key issues, such as regional peace and security, connectivity and trade, and expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation developed over the last 34 years, since the establishment of their diplomatic relations. The declaration noted that these relations were “firmly anchored in longstanding bonds of friendship, as well as deep historical, cultural and spiritual affinities between the two nations”. According to the joint statement, both nations underscored their commitment to deepen bilateral ties and elevate cooperation “to a qualitatively new level that advances the core interests of both nations”, it said. The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to the joint declaration signed after PM Shehbaz’s visit to Uzbekistan in February 2025, noting that the roadmap for the implementation of the decisions reached during that visit provided a blueprint for further deepening bilateral relations in multiple areas of cooperation. PM Shehbaz and President Mirziyoyev regarded the decision to establish a High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) during last year’s visit as a significant milestone. “This mechanism provides close guidance and monitoring of the top leadership on bilateral cooperation,” the declaration stated. They welcomed the inaugural meeting of the HLSCC during Mirziyoyev’s visit to Pakistan, wherein the two leaders “reached important decisions on furthering bilateral cooperation”. The leaders also commended the work of the Joint Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) on Trade-Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation between Uzbekistan and Pakistan in promoting trade and commerce between the two countries. “They noted with satisfaction the conduct of the 10th session of the IGC, held in Islamabad on Feb 2, and hoped to achieve the targets set therein in the stated timeframe,” the statement said. Further, they welcomed the signing of the framework agreement of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in July 2025, and noted the significance of connectivity as a means of regional integration, transit trade and socio-economic development in the region. The two sides reiterated their commitment to enhancing regional connectivity and acknowledged the importance of this cooperation in promoting efficient, reliable, and cost-effective transport links, thereby contributing to deeper economic integration and strengthened bilateral and regional trade relations, according to the declaration. To this end, they expressed their commitment to take measures necessary for the early operationalisation of an MoU on Multimodal Transport that was signed in September 2024. Pakistan also reaffirmed its readiness to provide access to its seaports for Uzbek transit cargo and to make available its road network of international standards to support Uzbek trade and transit requirements, the declaration said. The leaders acknowledged the fact that Uzbekistan was the first country in Central Asia with which Pakistan had signed a Transit Trade Agreement as well as a Preferential Trade Agreement. They welcomed the growing volume of trade and commerce between the two countries. They also reiterated their commitment towards achieving a $2 billion bilateral trade target by 2029. The sides agreed to establish a joint management of economic or industrial zones in each country in order to create favourable conditions for developing industrial cooperation between the two countries, aimed primarily at exporting finished products to third countries, the declaration added. “Noting the important role of interregional dialogue in promoting trade and economic cooperation, unlocking new opportunities and identifying new areas of growth for collaboration, the two leaders welcomed the signing of the framework agreement establishing the Inter-Regional Forum. The sides agreed to hold the first forum of regions of the two countries in the Republic of Uzbekistan in 2026 at mutually agreed dates,” it said. According to the statement, both leaders expressed their satisfaction on the progress made by both sides for completing phase-II of expansion of the PTA, signing the Bilateral Investment Treaty and agreeing to explore the possibility of signing an agreement on aligning SPS measures and mutual recognition of standards to help Joint Ventures in pharmaceuticals, textile, leather industries, agriculture, minerals and engineering goods, and enhancing e-commerce cooperation. They also emphasised the need to further diversify trade corridors between Uzbekistan and Pakistan to amend the existing Intergovernmental Agreement on Transit Trade for this purpose, it said. In addition, both countries expressed their readiness to maintain regular dialogue and build constructive cooperation in the area of security and defence. They expressed satisfaction at the level of defence cooperation, welcoming the recent engagements between the two sides in this regard, including the staff talks and high-level exchanges, the declaration said. “In order to further promote cooperation in this area, they agreed to continue mutual participation in joint military exercises and training, and to cooperate in the field of professional development, exchange of best practices and collaboration between military institutions of the two countries.” Additionally, they reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations (UN) Charter and its purposes and principles.

Further, the countries agreed to extend favourable consideration to each other’s upcoming candidatures for various positions within international organisations, particularly at the UN. Uzbekistan commended Pakistan on its contributions to advancing peace and security as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the term 2025-2026, and congratulated Pakistan on its successful presidency of the UNSC during June 2025. Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz congratulated the Uzbek president on the successful hosting of the 43rd session of the Unesco General Conference in Samarkand in 2025. The declaration added that Uzbekistan expressed “full support” for Pakistan to work as the rotating chairman of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) for 2026-2027. It also congratulated Pakistan on assuming the chairmanships of the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) of the SCO for the term 2025-2026, and the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) for the term 2026-2027. “In addition, the Pakistan side noted its regular participation in the meetings of working groups on Uzbekistan’s accession to the WTO (World Trade Organisation) and its support for Uzbekistan’s early accession to the organisation,” it said. Pakistan and Uzbekistan underlined the significance of peace and stability in Afghanistan as being “key to lasting regional peace, stability and prosperity in general and the successful implementation of the UAP Railway Project in particular”. “The two leaders called on Afghanistan to address the threats of terrorism, and to take immediate and concrete actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan, which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country,” the declaration said. They also reaffirmed the importance of their constructive roles in promoting peace, stability, and just resolution of global conflicts, including expressing their support for the people of Palestine and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The two sides underscored that the talks held during the visit and the bilateral documents signed will serve to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan, the statement added. According to the declaration, Mirziyoyev invited PM Shehbaz to visit Uzbekistan “at a convenient time in order to further develop comprehensive cooperation”. “Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif kindly accepted the invitation,” it said.",

It added that President Mirziyoyev directed his concerned minister to coordinate with the Pakistani counterpart in this regard. “The Uzbek president emphasised the need to further expand practical cooperation through closer political dialogue, stronger trade, economic and investment ties, and more active business exchanges,” the state-run broadcaster said. It stated that President Mirziyoyev invited his Pakistani counterpart to pay an official visit to Uzbekistan. “He said two additional direct flights would be added between the two countries, taking the total number of weekly flights to six, to further facilitate people-to-people contacts, tourism and business exchanges,” it added. During the meetings, the two presidents also discussed the regional situation, including matters affecting peace, stability and security, it said. Later, President Zardari conferred the Nishan-i-Pakistan on President Mirziyoyev in recognition of his contribution to strengthening Pakistan-Uzbekistan relations, the report added. Joint communique underscores commitment to connectivity, cooperation Separately, Pakistan and Uzbekistan underscored their commitment to further deepen bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in a joint declaration, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday. The joint declaration, signed by Mirziyoyev and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said that the leaders held comprehensive and in-depth discussions covering the full spectrum of bilateral relations between the two countries. “The two sides reaffirmed their strong resolve to comprehensively develop and strengthen cooperation in order to support each other’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, while advancing sustainable development aligned with the long-term national interests of the people of both states,” the declaration read. The two sides also exchanged views on key issues, such as regional peace and security, connectivity and trade, and expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation developed over the last 34 years, since the establishment of their diplomatic relations. The declaration noted that these relations were “firmly anchored in longstanding bonds of friendship, as well as deep historical, cultural and spiritual affinities between the two nations”. According to the joint statement, both nations underscored their commitment to deepen bilateral ties and elevate cooperation “to a qualitatively new level that advances the core interests of both nations”, it said. The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to the joint declaration signed after PM Shehbaz’s visit to Uzbekistan in February 2025, noting that the roadmap for the implementation of the decisions reached during that visit provided a blueprint for further deepening bilateral relations in multiple areas of cooperation. PM Shehbaz and President Mirziyoyev regarded the decision to establish a High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) during last year’s visit as a significant milestone. “This mechanism provides close guidance and monitoring of the top leadership on bilateral cooperation,” the declaration stated. They welcomed the inaugural meeting of the HLSCC during Mirziyoyev’s visit to Pakistan, wherein the two leaders “reached important decisions on furthering bilateral cooperation”. The leaders also commended the work of the Joint Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) on Trade-Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation between Uzbekistan and Pakistan in promoting trade and commerce between the two countries. “They noted with satisfaction the conduct of the 10th session of the IGC, held in Islamabad on Feb 2, and hoped to achieve the targets set therein in the stated timeframe,” the statement said. Further, they welcomed the signing of the framework agreement of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in July 2025, and noted the significance of connectivity as a means of regional integration, transit trade and socio-economic development in the region. The two sides reiterated their commitment to enhancing regional connectivity and acknowledged the importance of this cooperation in promoting efficient, reliable, and cost-effective transport links, thereby contributing to deeper economic integration and strengthened bilateral and regional trade relations, according to the declaration. To this end, they expressed their commitment to take measures necessary for the early operationalisation of an MoU on Multimodal Transport that was signed in September 2024. Pakistan also reaffirmed its readiness to provide access to its seaports for Uzbek transit cargo and to make available its road network of international standards to support Uzbek trade and transit requirements, the declaration said. The leaders acknowledged the fact that Uzbekistan was the first country in Central Asia with which Pakistan had signed a Transit Trade Agreement as well as a Preferential Trade Agreement. They welcomed the growing volume of trade and commerce between the two countries. They also reiterated their commitment towards achieving a $2 billion bilateral trade target by 2029. The sides agreed to establish a joint management of economic or industrial zones in each country in order to create favourable conditions for developing industrial cooperation between the two countries, aimed primarily at exporting finished products to third countries, the declaration added. “Noting the important role of interregional dialogue in promoting trade and economic cooperation, unlocking new opportunities and identifying new areas of growth for collaboration, the two leaders welcomed the signing of the framework agreement establishing the Inter-Regional Forum. The sides agreed to hold the first forum of regions of the two countries in the Republic of Uzbekistan in 2026 at mutually agreed dates,” it said. According to the statement, both leaders expressed their satisfaction on the progress made by both sides for completing phase-II of expansion of the PTA, signing the Bilateral Investment Treaty and agreeing to explore the possibility of signing an agreement on aligning SPS measures and mutual recognition of standards to help Joint Ventures in pharmaceuticals, textile, leather industries, agriculture, minerals and engineering goods, and enhancing e-commerce cooperation. They also emphasised the need to further diversify trade corridors between Uzbekistan and Pakistan to amend the existing Intergovernmental Agreement on Transit Trade for this purpose, it said. In addition, both countries expressed their readiness to maintain regular dialogue and build constructive cooperation in the area of security and defence. They expressed satisfaction at the level of defence cooperation, welcoming the recent engagements between the two sides in this regard, including the staff talks and high-level exchanges, the declaration said. “In order to further promote cooperation in this area, they agreed to continue mutual participation in joint military exercises and training, and to cooperate in the field of professional development, exchange of best practices and collaboration between military institutions of the two countries.” Additionally, they reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations (UN) Charter and its purposes and principles. They pledged to consider each other’s initiatives favourably at multilateral fora. “They underlined that sustained dialogue and peaceful engagement in accordance with the UN Charter, General Assembly and Security Council Resolutions remain essential for addressing longstanding issues and disputes, and advancing peace, stability and prosperity in South and Central Asia,” the declaration added. Further, the countries agreed to extend favourable consideration to each other’s upcoming candidatures for various positions within international organisations, particularly at the UN. Uzbekistan commended Pakistan on its contributions to advancing peace and security as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the term 2025-2026, and congratulated Pakistan on its successful presidency of the UNSC during June 2025. Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz congratulated the Uzbek president on the successful hosting of the 43rd session of the Unesco General Conference in Samarkand in 2025. The declaration added that Uzbekistan expressed “full support” for Pakistan to work as the rotating chairman of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) for 2026-2027. It also congratulated Pakistan on assuming the chairmanships of the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) of the SCO for the term 2025-2026, and the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) for the term 2026-2027. “In addition, the Pakistan side noted its regular participation in the meetings of working groups on Uzbekistan’s accession to the WTO (World Trade Organisation) and its support for Uzbekistan’s early accession to the organisation,” it said. Pakistan and Uzbekistan underlined the significance of peace and stability in Afghanistan as being “key to lasting regional peace, stability and prosperity in general and the successful implementation of the UAP Railway Project in particular”. “The two leaders called on Afghanistan to address the threats of terrorism, and to take immediate and concrete actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan, which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country,” the declaration said. They also reaffirmed the importance of their constructive roles in promoting peace, stability, and just resolution of global conflicts, including expressing their support for the people of Palestine and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The two sides underscored that the talks held during the visit and the bilateral documents signed will serve to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan, the statement added. According to the declaration, Mirziyoyev invited PM Shehbaz to visit Uzbekistan “at a convenient time in order to further develop comprehensive cooperation”. “Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif kindly accepted the invitation,” it said.",

      "title_orig": "Trump rejects Putin offer of one-year extension of New START deployment limits",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Thursday rejected an offer from his Russian counterpart to voluntarily extend the caps on strategic nuclear weapons deployments after the treaty that held them in check expired. “Rather than extend ‘New START … we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved and modernised Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. Arms control advocates warn that the expiration of the treaty will fuel an accelerated nuclear arms race, while US opponents say the pact constrained the US ability to deploy enough weapons to deter nuclear threats posed by both Russia and China. Trump’s post was in response to a proposal by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the sides to adhere for a year to the 2010 accord’s limit of 1,550 warheads on 700 delivery systems — missiles, aircraft and submarines. New START was the last in a series of arms control treaties between the world’s two largest nuclear weapons powers dating back more than half a century to the Cold War. It allowed for only a single extension, which Putin and former US President Joe Biden agreed to for five years in 2021. In his post, Trump called New START “a badly negotiated deal” that he said “is being grossly violated,” an apparent reference to Putin’s 2023 decision to halt on-site inspections and other measures designed to reassure each side that the other was complying with the treaty. Putin cited US support for Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion as the reason for his decision. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the US would continue talks with Russia. Both sides signals openness to talks Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was still ready to engage in dialogue with the US if Washington responded constructively to Putin’s proposal. “Listen, if there are any constructive replies, of course we will conduct a dialogue,” Peskov told reporters. The UN has urged both sides to restore the treaty. Besides setting numerical limits on weapons, New START included inspection regimes experts say served to build a level of trust and confidence between the nuclear adversaries, helping make the world safer. If nothing replaces the treaty, security analysts see a more dangerous environment with a higher risk of miscalculation. Forced to rely on worst-case assumptions about the other’s intentions, the US and Russia would see an incentive to increase their arsenals, especially as China plays catch-up with its own rapid nuclear build-up. Trump has said he wants to replace New START with a better deal, bringing in China. But Beijing has declined negotiations with Moscow and Washington. It has a fraction of their warhead numbers — an estimated 600, compared with around 4,000 each for Russia and the US Repeating that position on Thursday, China said the expiration of the treaty was regrettable, and urged the US to resume dialogue with Russia on “strategic stability.” Uncertainly over treaty expiry date There was confusion over the exact timing of the expiry, but Peskov said it would be at the end of Thursday. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Moscow’s assumption was that the treaty no longer applied and both sides were free to choose their next steps. It said Russia was prepared to take “decisive military-technical countermeasures to mitigate potential additional threats to national security” but was also open to diplomacy. That warning was in apparent response to the possibility that Trump could expand US nuclear deployments by reversing steps taken to comply with New START, including reloading warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched missiles from which they were removed. A bipartisan congressionally appointed commission in 2023 recommended that the US develop plans to reload some or all of its reserve warheads, saying the country should prepare to fight simultaneous wars with Russia and China. Ukraine, which has been at war with Russia since Moscow’s 2022 invasion, said the treaty’s expiry was a consequence of Russian efforts to achieve the “fragmentation of the global security architecture” and called it “another tool for nuclear blackmail to undermine international support for Ukraine.” Strategic nuclear weapons are the long-range systems that each side would use to strike the other’s capital, military and industrial centres in the event of a nuclear war. They differ from so-called tactical nuclear weapons that have a lower yield and are designed for limited strikes or battlefield use. If left unconstrained by any agreement, Russia and the US could each, within a couple of years, deploy hundreds more warheads, experts say. “Transparency and predictability are among the more intangible benefits of arms control and underpin deterrence and strategic stability,” said Karim Haggag, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.",

Besides setting numerical limits on weapons, New START included inspection regimes experts say served to build a level of trust and confidence between the nuclear adversaries, helping make the world safer. If nothing replaces the treaty, security analysts see a more dangerous environment with a higher risk of miscalculation. Forced to rely on worst-case assumptions about the other’s intentions, the US and Russia would see an incentive to increase their arsenals, especially as China plays catch-up with its own rapid nuclear build-up. Trump has said he wants to replace New START with a better deal, bringing in China. But Beijing has declined negotiations with Moscow and Washington. It has a fraction of their warhead numbers — an estimated 600, compared with around 4,000 each for Russia and the US Repeating that position on Thursday, China said the expiration of the treaty was regrettable, and urged the US to resume dialogue with Russia on “strategic stability.” Uncertainly over treaty expiry date There was confusion over the exact timing of the expiry, but Peskov said it would be at the end of Thursday. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Moscow’s assumption was that the treaty no longer applied and both sides were free to choose their next steps. It said Russia was prepared to take “decisive military-technical countermeasures to mitigate potential additional threats to national security” but was also open to diplomacy. That warning was in apparent response to the possibility that Trump could expand US nuclear deployments by reversing steps taken to comply with New START, including reloading warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched missiles from which they were removed. A bipartisan congressionally appointed commission in 2023 recommended that the US develop plans to reload some or all of its reserve warheads, saying the country should prepare to fight simultaneous wars with Russia and China. Ukraine, which has been at war with Russia since Moscow’s 2022 invasion, said the treaty’s expiry was a consequence of Russian efforts to achieve the “fragmentation of the global security architecture” and called it “another tool for nuclear blackmail to undermine international support for Ukraine.” Strategic nuclear weapons are the long-range systems that each side would use to strike the other’s capital, military and industrial centres in the event of a nuclear war. They differ from so-called tactical nuclear weapons that have a lower yield and are designed for limited strikes or battlefield use. If left unconstrained by any agreement, Russia and the US could each, within a couple of years, deploy hundreds more warheads, experts say. “Transparency and predictability are among the more intangible benefits of arms control and underpin deterrence and strategic stability,” said Karim Haggag, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.",
      "title": "Trump rejects Putin offer of one-year extension of New START deployment limits",
      "summary": "US President Donald Trump on Thursday rejected an offer from his Russian counterpart to voluntarily extend the caps on strategic nuclear weapons deployments after the treaty that held them in check expired. “Rather than extend ‘New START … we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved and modernised Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. Arms control advocates warn that the expiration of the treaty will fuel an accelerated nuclear arms race, while US opponents say the pact constrained the US ability to deploy enough weapons to deter nuclear threats posed by both Russia and China. Trump’s post was in response to a proposal by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the sides to adhere for a year to the 2010 accord’s limit of 1,550 warheads on 700 delivery systems — missiles, aircraft and submarines. New START was the last in a series of arms control treaties between the world’s two largest nuclear weapons powers dating back more than half a century to the Cold War. It allowed for only a single extension, which Putin and former US President Joe Biden agreed to for five years in 2021. In his post, Trump called New START “a badly negotiated deal” that he said “is being grossly violated,” an apparent reference to Putin’s 2023 decision to halt on-site inspections and other measures designed to reassure each side that the other was complying with the treaty. Putin cited US support for Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion as the reason for his decision. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the US would continue talks with Russia. Both sides signals openness to talks Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was still ready to engage in dialogue with the US if Washington responded constructively to Putin’s proposal. “Listen, if there are any constructive replies, of course we will conduct a dialogue,” Peskov told reporters.

      "title_orig": "Iran, US commence talks in Oman amid deep rifts and mounting war fears",
      "summary_orig": "Iran and the United States commenced high-stakes negotiations in Oman on Friday over Tehran’s nuclear programme, but a dispute over the agenda suggests progress will be hard won amid the threat of a regional Middle East war. While both sides have signaled readiness to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West, Washington wants the talks to cover Iran’s nuclear programme, its ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and its “treatment of their own people”, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday. Iran has said it wants Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss only nuclear issues in Muscat. Iran’s foreign minister called on Friday for “mutual respect” ahead of talks with the United States on the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme and other issues. “Iran enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year. We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X. “Commitments need to be honored. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric – they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement. “ Tehran said it will engage in the talks “with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue”. “We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Thursday. Tehran’s leadership remains deeply concerned that US President Donald Trump may still carry out his threats to strike Iran amid a buildup by the US Navy near Iran. The US naval buildup, which Trump has called a massive “armada” , has followed a bloody government crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran last month, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday told reporters that Trump was looking to determine whether a deal can be struck but also issued a warning. “While these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at his disposal, aside from diplomacy as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world,” she added. Trump has warned that “bad things“ would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of airstrikes. Iran has warned it would respond harshly to any military strike and has cautioned neighbouring countries hosting US bases that they could be in the firing line if they were involved in an attack. “It’s very difficult to see them conceding enough in talks tomorrow for the US credibly to be able to claim that it’s made a breakthrough. And this is where I think, military conflict is more likely than not,” Edmund Fitton-Brown, senior fellow at Washington-based think-tank FDD, said. Uranium enrichment Negotiators in Oman will have to navigate Iran’s red line on discussing its missile programme to reach a deal and avert future military action. Tehran has flatly ruled out talks on its “defence capabilities, including missiles and their range.” Hours before the talks, Iran’s state TV said that “one of the country’s most advanced long-range ballistic missile Khorramshahr 4” has been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guards’ vast underground missile complexes. However, Tehran is willing to show “flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution,” Iranian officials told Reuters last week. Iran also insists that its right to enrich uranium is not negotiable. Iran says its nuclear activities are meant for peaceful, not military purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons. In June, the US struck Iranian nuclear targets , joining in the final stages of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said its uranium enrichment work has stopped. Tehran’s influence throughout the region has been severely weakened by Israel’s attacks on its regional allies - known as the “Axis of Resistance” – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. US asks citizens to ‘leave Iran now’ Meanwhile, in a travel advisory issued by the US virtual embassy in Tehran dated February 6, US citizens residing in Iran were urged to “consider departing Iran by land to Armenia or Turkiye if safe to do so”. The advisory noted that “increased security measures, road closures, public transportation disruptions, and internet blockages” were going on in Iran. “The government of Iran continues to restrict access to mobile, landline, and national internet networks. Airlines continue to limit or cancel flights to and from Iran,” it added. The advisory outlined several actions for US citizens to take, including asking them to “leave Iran now”. “Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on US government help,” it said. In case they are unable to leave, the advisory advised US citizens to “find a secure location within your residence or another safe building. “Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items,” it added. “Avoid demonstrations, keep a low profile, and stay aware of your surroundings. “Monitor local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans,” it said.",

Iran’s foreign minister called on Friday for “mutual respect” ahead of talks with the United States on the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme and other issues. “Iran enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year. We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X. “Commitments need to be honored. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric – they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement. “ Tehran said it will engage in the talks “with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue”. “We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Thursday. Tehran’s leadership remains deeply concerned that US President Donald Trump may still carry out his threats to strike Iran amid a buildup by the US Navy near Iran. The US naval buildup, which Trump has called a massive “armada” , has followed a bloody government crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran last month, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday told reporters that Trump was looking to determine whether a deal can be struck but also issued a warning. “While these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at his disposal, aside from diplomacy as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world,” she added. Trump has warned that “bad things“ would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of airstrikes. Iran has warned it would respond harshly to any military strike and has cautioned neighbouring countries hosting US bases that they could be in the firing line if they were involved in an attack. “It’s very difficult to see them conceding enough in talks tomorrow for the US credibly to be able to claim that it’s made a breakthrough. And this is where I think, military conflict is more likely than not,” Edmund Fitton-Brown, senior fellow at Washington-based think-tank FDD, said. Uranium enrichment Negotiators in Oman will have to navigate Iran’s red line on discussing its missile programme to reach a deal and avert future military action. Tehran has flatly ruled out talks on its “defence capabilities, including missiles and their range.” Hours before the talks, Iran’s state TV said that “one of the country’s most advanced long-range ballistic missile Khorramshahr 4” has been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guards’ vast underground missile complexes. However, Tehran is willing to show “flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution,” Iranian officials told Reuters last week. Iran also insists that its right to enrich uranium is not negotiable. Iran says its nuclear activities are meant for peaceful, not military purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons. In June, the US struck Iranian nuclear targets , joining in the final stages of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said its uranium enrichment work has stopped. Tehran’s influence throughout the region has been severely weakened by Israel’s attacks on its regional allies - known as the “Axis of Resistance” – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. US asks citizens to ‘leave Iran now’ Meanwhile, in a travel advisory issued by the US virtual embassy in Tehran dated February 6, US citizens residing in Iran were urged to “consider departing Iran by land to Armenia or Turkiye if safe to do so”. The advisory noted that “increased security measures, road closures, public transportation disruptions, and internet blockages” were going on in Iran. “The government of Iran continues to restrict access to mobile, landline, and national internet networks. Airlines continue to limit or cancel flights to and from Iran,” it added. The advisory outlined several actions for US citizens to take, including asking them to “leave Iran now”. “Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on US government help,” it said. In case they are unable to leave, the advisory advised US citizens to “find a secure location within your residence or another safe building. “Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items,” it added. “Avoid demonstrations, keep a low profile, and stay aware of your surroundings. “Monitor local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans,” it said.",

In a post on X, the US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA) said it stood “steadfast with Pakistan” in the wake of the attacks, which it described as “horrific”. The bureau noted that the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) remains a designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO). In August last year, the US State Department added the BLA and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, to its FTO list, according to a press release .

Earlier on Thursday, security forces concluded “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The military’s media wing said the operation was launched following a spate of coordinated attacks across the province on January 31, which disrupted normal life in several areas. The ISPR said the intelligence-based operations targeted what it described as Indian-sponsored terrorist elements. According to the ISPR, 36 civilians, including women and children, were killed during the violence, while 22 security forces and law enforcement personnel also lost their lives. It added that a substantial cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered during the operations. The attacks have also drawn condemnation from the United Nations, with UN officials earlier expressing concern over the violence and stressing the need to hold those responsible accountable.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed 24 terrorists in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released on Friday. “On 4-5 February 2026, twenty four khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” said the statement from the military’s media wing. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Two intelligence-based operations were conducted in the province’s Orakzai and Khyber districts. During the operation conducted in Orakzai district, troops engaged the terrorists and killed 14. While in Khyber, during the conduct of another IBO, security forces killed 10 terrorists. “On reported presence of khwarij, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in Orakzai District. During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen khwarij were sent to hell,” said the ISPR, adding that “ten more khwarij were effectively neutralised” in Khyber. Following the engagements, security forces conducted sanitization operations in the areas “to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area”. The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism operation “under [the] vision [of] “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. Earlier in January, 11 terrorists were killed in two separate IBOs in KP. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.",

      "title_orig": "Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry assails proposed quarterly power tariff hike",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has protested against the proposed positive quarterly tariff adjustments (QTA) sought by power distribution companies (Discos), arguing that the claims are based on flawed data and that costs should, in fact, have declined. In a letter to Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Leghari and the chairman and members of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), FPCCI Research Team Head Rehan Javed said a select group of consumers was given a benefit of Rs1.53 billion under a cheaper incremental consumption package in December 2025, but this resulted in an additional burden of about Rs6.6bn on consumers nationwide. He said Discos were claiming a net national quarterly adjustment of Rs10.83bn for the second quarter of FY26 after accounting for capacity charges, transmission and use-of-system charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, the impact of transmission and distribution losses on fuel cost adjustment, and the incremental consumption package. Under Nepra’s uniform tariff mechanism, this amount would be socialised across about 28.75 billion units of national electricity sales for the quarter, translating into a system-wide impact of around 38 paise per unit. While Disco-wise adjustments ranged from a negative Rs5.1bn to a positive Rs5.6bn, these variations fully offset each other at the national level, leaving the consolidated per unit impact as the only outcome relevant for consumers. Mr Javed contended that a material portion of the quarterly adjustment did not stem from unavoidable cost variations but arose directly from the defective design of the incremental consumption package. He said the issue had been raised repeatedly in regulatory hearings, written submissions and stakeholder engagements, but continued implementation without correction raised serious concerns about policy responsiveness and governance. He said system data showed that national electricity demand had remained broadly flat at around 2,400-2,500 gigawatt hours per month from July 2025 onwards. Sales stood at about 2,439 GWh in Nov 2025 and 2,431 GWh in Dec 2025, confirming that no incremental demand had been generated. Despite this, around 600 GWh in Dec 2025 was billed at a discounted rate of Rs11.02 per unit below the normal tariff, using an outdated reference consumption of about 1,900 GWh from Dec 2023. As a result, base-load consumption was misclassified as incremental, and existing demand was merely repriced at a lower tariff, he said. While the reported benefit to selected industrial consumers, mainly in B3 and B4 categories, amounted to about Rs1.533bn, the resulting revenue shortfall was estimated at around Rs6.6bn. This shortfall neither reduced capacity payments nor increased system utilisation, nor did it generate additional energy sales, he said, adding that it would instead be passed on through quarterly adjustments and socialised across the entire consumer base, including those who received no benefit from the package. Mr Javed argued that had this Rs6.6bn revenue loss not occurred and the same energy been sold at the full tariff, the quarterly adjustment would have been lower by about 23 paise per unit. The Q2 adjustment of 38 paise per unit would then have fallen to roughly 15 paise per unit, demonstrating that more than half of the impact was policy-induced. Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026",

In a letter to Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Leghari and the chairman and members of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), FPCCI Research Team Head Rehan Javed said a select group of consumers was given a benefit of Rs1.53 billion under a cheaper incremental consumption package in December 2025, but this resulted in an additional burden of about Rs6.6bn on consumers nationwide. He said Discos were claiming a net national quarterly adjustment of Rs10.83bn for the second quarter of FY26 after accounting for capacity charges, transmission and use-of-system charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, the impact of transmission and distribution losses on fuel cost adjustment, and the incremental consumption package. Under Nepra’s uniform tariff mechanism, this amount would be socialised across about 28.75 billion units of national electricity sales for the quarter, translating into a system-wide impact of around 38 paise per unit. While Disco-wise adjustments ranged from a negative Rs5.1bn to a positive Rs5.6bn, these variations fully offset each other at the national level, leaving the consolidated per unit impact as the only outcome relevant for consumers. Mr Javed contended that a material portion of the quarterly adjustment did not stem from unavoidable cost variations but arose directly from the defective design of the incremental consumption package. He said the issue had been raised repeatedly in regulatory hearings, written submissions and stakeholder engagements, but continued implementation without correction raised serious concerns about policy responsiveness and governance. He said system data showed that national electricity demand had remained broadly flat at around 2,400-2,500 gigawatt hours per month from July 2025 onwards. Sales stood at about 2,439 GWh in Nov 2025 and 2,431 GWh in Dec 2025, confirming that no incremental demand had been generated. Despite this, around 600 GWh in Dec 2025 was billed at a discounted rate of Rs11.02 per unit below the normal tariff, using an outdated reference consumption of about 1,900 GWh from Dec 2023. As a result, base-load consumption was misclassified as incremental, and existing demand was merely repriced at a lower tariff, he said. While the reported benefit to selected industrial consumers, mainly in B3 and B4 categories, amounted to about Rs1.533bn, the resulting revenue shortfall was estimated at around Rs6.6bn. This shortfall neither reduced capacity payments nor increased system utilisation, nor did it generate additional energy sales, he said, adding that it would instead be passed on through quarterly adjustments and socialised across the entire consumer base, including those who received no benefit from the package. Mr Javed argued that had this Rs6.6bn revenue loss not occurred and the same energy been sold at the full tariff, the quarterly adjustment would have been lower by about 23 paise per unit. The Q2 adjustment of 38 paise per unit would then have fallen to roughly 15 paise per unit, demonstrating that more than half of the impact was policy-induced. Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: British police have charged three more men in an investigation into a series of violent incidents targeting Pakistani dissidents in the United Kingdom, according to a statement released by the Metropolitan Police on Wednesday night. The latest charges bring the total number of people arrested in connection with the investigation to seven. The charges relate to attacks on properties in Cambridge and Chesham in late December 2025 and form part of a wider counter-terrorism investigation being led by Counter Terrorism Policing London. Although the police statement did not name the victims, earlier reports indicate that the arrests are linked to attacks reported by former Imran Khan adviser Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber-blogger Adil Raja. Adil Raja’s home was targeted on December 24, 2025, while Shahzad Akbar’s residence was attacked on December 24 and 31, 2025, and again on January 10, 2026. Following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service, Asaf Afsar, 38, of Birmingham; Liam McGarry, 24, of Warwickshire; and Mark Regan, 52, also of Birmingham, were charged on February 4 with conspiracy to assault and to occasion bodily harm. Mr Afsar and Mr Regan face two counts each, linked to incidents in both Chesham and Cambridge on December 24, 2025. Mr McGarry was charged with one count relating to the Cambridge incident on the same date. All three men were in police custody and appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. The men were arrested a day earlier, on February 3, as part of what police described as an “ongoing investigation” into alleged coordinated attacks. Two other men, aged 55 and 30, were also arrested in Birmingham and London, respectively, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault and criminal damage. Both have since been released on bail until May while inquiries continue. Police said the arrests in the West Midlands and Warwickshire were carried out with support from local forces and Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. Officers also conducted five searches across the West Midlands, Warwickshire and London. The latest charges bring the total number of people charged in the investigation to seven. Four other men were previously charged and are due to appear at the Old Bailey on Feb 13. Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026",
