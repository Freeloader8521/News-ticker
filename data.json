      "summary_orig": "A high-level federal government delegation on Saturday signed an agreement with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) to end days of unrest in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying that “all issues have been resolved amicably”. The signing of the agreement comes after two rounds of talks between the high-level government delegation and the JAAC in as many days. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Since then, rival groups since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. A day earlier, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said it was “deeply alarmed“ by the ongoing violence in AJK, and condemned the “use of excessive force” and the communications blackout. In a post on social media platform X during the early hours of Saturday following day-long talks, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said — who was part of the government negotiating committee — said: “Our negotiation delegation has signed on a final agreement with the AJK Joint Action Committee. The protesters are returning to their homes. All roads have reopened.” “This is a victory of peace. Long live Azad Kashmir,” the minister added. Chaudhry also shared a copy of the pact on X, which listed 12 “decisions” taken and 13 “additional points”. Under the agreement, it was decided that first information reports (FIRs) would be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on the “incidents of violence and vandalism resulting into deaths of personnel belonging to LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and protestors”, with a judicial commission appointed where required. “Persons killed in the incidents of October 1 and 2, 2025 shall be compensated with monetary benefits equivalent to LEAs,” the pact read, adding that gunshot injuries would be compensated with Rs1 million per person, while a government job would be granted to one of the family members of each dead person within 20 days. Chaudhry, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, Interprovincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, former adviser to prime minister on Kashmir affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-AJK president Masood Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf were part of the government’s negotiating team. From the AJK government’s side, Education Minister Diwan Ali Chugtai and Local Government Minister Faisal Rathore took part in the talks, according to a copy of the signed pact shared by Chaudhry. Raja Amjad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir and Anjum Zaman Awan represented the JAAC. On September 25, a deadlock emerged between the AJK government and the JAAC over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir. Subsequently, a shutter-down strike had paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continued for the acceptance of its 38-point charter of demands . Conspiracies now stand buried as issues resolved amicably: PM Shehbaz Welcoming the agreement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement said “all conspiracies and rumours now stand buried and issues have been resolved amicably”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported . He appreciated the members of the federal government’s negotiation committee and the JAAC for signing the pact to “settle all issues”. Terming it an achievement for Pakistan and AJK, the premier said the “restoration of peace and normalcy is a good gesture”, the report added. PM Shehbaz asserted that the government “is ever ready to resolve issues of Kashmiri brethren as public interest and service are among our top priorities”. He appealed to Kashmiris not to pay heed to rumours, affirming that the government had “always protected” their rights and will also ensure them in the future. On Thursday, PM Shehbaz had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues. ‘Pakistan, AJK & democracy wins’: Ahsan Iqbal Iqbal also welcomed the development, writing on X: “Pakistan, AJK and democracy wins.” He stressed that the people of AJK had “always stood at the frontlines of Pakistan’s national cause, and their voice carries immense weight”. Noting that the nation “saw a difficult situation emerge due to legitimate public concerns”, the planning minister commended the “wisdom of local and national leadership and the spirit of dialogue that enabled us to resolve this stand-off peacefully, without violence, without division, and with mutual respect”. He highlighted that the resolution of the issue showed that “when the government listens, and when the people engage constructively, we can find solutions together”. “The Joint Action Committee raised voice of citizens, and the government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took these voices seriously. Instead of confrontation, we chose consultation. Instead of egos, we chose empathy. We commit to work together for good governance and development in AJK,” Iqbal added.",

      "title_orig": "Trump calls on Israel to ‘stop bombing Gaza’ after Hamas ‘conditionally’ agrees to peace plan",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said early on Saturday that Israel must stop bombing Gaza immediately and that he believes Hamas is ready for peace after an earlier statement by the Palestinian resistance group. Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict, including releasing hostages, but avoided addressing more vexing issues like disarmament and said it would seek further negotiations. Soon after, Trump posted Hamas’ response to his Truth Social account. Trump had earlier not specified whether the terms would be subject to negotiation, as Hamas is seeking. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for an “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli hostages following Hamas’ response. Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce offensive activity in Gaza. Notably, the resistance group did not say if it would agree to disarm and demilitarise Gaza — something Israel and the US want but Hamas has rejected before. It also did not agree to an Israeli withdrawal in stages, as opposed to the immediate, full withdrawal the group demands. A senior Hamas official told Al Jazeera that the group would not disarm before Israel’s occupation of the besieged enclave ends, comments that underscored the gap between the parties as the war approaches its two-year mark. Hamas seeks further negotiations In its statement, Hamas said it “appreciates the Arab, Islamic, and international efforts, as well as the efforts of US President Donald Trump, calling for an end to the war on the Gaza Strip, the exchange of prisoners, (and) the immediate entry of aid,” among other terms. It said it was announcing its “approval of releasing all occupation captives — both living and remains — according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump’s proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange.” But Hamas added: “In this context, the movement affirms its readiness to immediately enter, through the mediators, into negotiations to discuss the details.” The resistance group said it was ready “to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats) based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing.” Hamas has previously offered to release all hostages and to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to a different body. Earlier, Trump had given Hamas until 2200 GMT on Sunday (3am PKT on Monday) to accept his plan for peace in Gaza, warning the Palestinian resistance group faced “all hell” if it did not agree to the terms. The US leader set the deadline — which would fall at 1am on Monday in Gaza — after an official for Palestinian group told AFP earlier on Friday that the group still needed time to study the proposal to end nearly two years of devastating war in the Palestinian territory. “If this last chance agreement is not reached, all hell, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump had posted on his Truth Social platform. “Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.” The proposal , backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages within 72 hours, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. That would be followed by a post-war transitional authority headed by Trump himself. Hamas was not involved in the negotiations that led to the proposal, which calls on the resistance group to disarm, a demand it has previously rejected. “Hamas is still continuing consultations regarding Trump’s plan … and has informed mediators that the consultations are ongoing and need some time,” an official had said earlier on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter. On Tuesday, Trump gave Hamas “three or four days” to accept his plan, which has been welcomed by world powers, including Pakistan among Arab and Muslim nations. Mohammad Nazzal, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, had said in a statement on Friday that the “plan has points of concern, and we will announce our position on it soon”. ‘Places of death’ On the ground, Gaza’s civil defence agency — a rescue force operating under Hamas authority — reported heavy air bombardment and artillery shelling on Gaza City. It said Israeli strikes killed at least 11 people across the territory, including eight in Gaza City. AFP has contacted the Israeli military for comment. Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing swathes of the territory mean AFP cannot independently verify details or casualty figures provided by the Israeli military or the civil defence. Smoke rises from Gaza after an explosion, as seen from the Israeli side of the border on October 3. — Reuters The Israeli military is waging an air and ground offensive on the territory’s largest urban centre, from which hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee. The UN on Friday reiterated there was no safe place in Gaza and that Israel-designated zones in the south were “places of death”. “The notion of a safe zone in the south is farcical,” Unicef spokesman James Elder said from the Gaza Strip. Amnesty International condemned a “catastrophic wave of mass displacement” as Israel intensified its Gaza City offensive. The rights group said hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, many of whom had already been displaced multiple times, were being forced into “overcrowded enclaves in the south … that lack access to clean water, food, medical care, shelter and life-sustaining infrastructure”. As the war nears the two-year mark and the death toll continues to rise, protesters around the world have railed at Israel’s interception of a flotilla carrying pro-Palestinian activists and aid for Gaza. On Friday, the organisers of the Global Sumud Flotilla said its last remaining boat had been intercepted and Israel’s foreign ministry said it had deported four Italian participants. ‘Two opinions’ in Hamas As Hamas mulled Trump’s peace plan this week, a Palestinian source close to the group’s leadership told AFP on Wednesday that the Islamist movement wanted to amend some clauses, including the one on disarmament. Hamas leaders also want “international guarantees” for a full Israeli withdrawal and that no assassination attempts would be made inside or outside Gaza, the source added. Another source familiar with the negotiations told AFP that the group was split over Trump’s plan. Structurally, the group’s leadership is divided between officials based in the Gaza Strip and those abroad, particularly in Qatar. Much of Hamas’s leadership has also been wiped out in Israeli attacks throughout the conflict. The source told AFP that “the first [opinion] supports unconditional approval, as the priority is a ceasefire under Trump’s guarantees, with mediators ensuring Israel implements the plan”. “The second has serious reservations regarding key clauses… They favour conditional approval with clarifications reflecting Hamas’s and the resistance factions’ demands,” the source added. Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said “ultimately it’s not just about convincing Hamas leadership in Doha, but also the leadership in Gaza, as well as Hamas members and fighters in Gaza”. “Additionally, Hamas must then be able to convince other factions in Gaza,” he added. The conflict was triggered by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 66,288 Palestinians, according to health ministry figures in the Hamas-run territory that the United Nations considers reliable. Their data does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but indicates that more than half of the dead are women and children.",

It said it was announcing its “approval of releasing all occupation captives — both living and remains — according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump’s proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange.” But Hamas added: “In this context, the movement affirms its readiness to immediately enter, through the mediators, into negotiations to discuss the details.” The resistance group said it was ready “to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats) based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing.” Hamas has previously offered to release all hostages and to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to a different body. Earlier, Trump had given Hamas until 2200 GMT on Sunday (3am PKT on Monday) to accept his plan for peace in Gaza, warning the Palestinian resistance group faced “all hell” if it did not agree to the terms. The US leader set the deadline — which would fall at 1am on Monday in Gaza — after an official for Palestinian group told AFP earlier on Friday that the group still needed time to study the proposal to end nearly two years of devastating war in the Palestinian territory. “If this last chance agreement is not reached, all hell, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump had posted on his Truth Social platform. “Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.” The proposal , backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages within 72 hours, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. That would be followed by a post-war transitional authority headed by Trump himself. Hamas was not involved in the negotiations that led to the proposal, which calls on the resistance group to disarm, a demand it has previously rejected. “Hamas is still continuing consultations regarding Trump’s plan … and has informed mediators that the consultations are ongoing and need some time,” an official had said earlier on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter. On Tuesday, Trump gave Hamas “three or four days” to accept his plan, which has been welcomed by world powers, including Pakistan among Arab and Muslim nations. Mohammad Nazzal, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, had said in a statement on Friday that the “plan has points of concern, and we will announce our position on it soon”. ‘Places of death’ On the ground, Gaza’s civil defence agency — a rescue force operating under Hamas authority — reported heavy air bombardment and artillery shelling on Gaza City. It said Israeli strikes killed at least 11 people across the territory, including eight in Gaza City. AFP has contacted the Israeli military for comment. Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing swathes of the territory mean AFP cannot independently verify details or casualty figures provided by the Israeli military or the civil defence. Smoke rises from Gaza after an explosion, as seen from the Israeli side of the border on October 3. — Reuters The Israeli military is waging an air and ground offensive on the territory’s largest urban centre, from which hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee. The UN on Friday reiterated there was no safe place in Gaza and that Israel-designated zones in the south were “places of death”. “The notion of a safe zone in the south is farcical,” Unicef spokesman James Elder said from the Gaza Strip. Amnesty International condemned a “catastrophic wave of mass displacement” as Israel intensified its Gaza City offensive. The rights group said hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, many of whom had already been displaced multiple times, were being forced into “overcrowded enclaves in the south … that lack access to clean water, food, medical care, shelter and life-sustaining infrastructure”. As the war nears the two-year mark and the death toll continues to rise, protesters around the world have railed at Israel’s interception of a flotilla carrying pro-Palestinian activists and aid for Gaza. On Friday, the organisers of the Global Sumud Flotilla said its last remaining boat had been intercepted and Israel’s foreign ministry said it had deported four Italian participants. ‘Two opinions’ in Hamas As Hamas mulled Trump’s peace plan this week, a Palestinian source close to the group’s leadership told AFP on Wednesday that the Islamist movement wanted to amend some clauses, including the one on disarmament. Hamas leaders also want “international guarantees” for a full Israeli withdrawal and that no assassination attempts would be made inside or outside Gaza, the source added. Another source familiar with the negotiations told AFP that the group was split over Trump’s plan. Structurally, the group’s leadership is divided between officials based in the Gaza Strip and those abroad, particularly in Qatar. Much of Hamas’s leadership has also been wiped out in Israeli attacks throughout the conflict. The source told AFP that “the first [opinion] supports unconditional approval, as the priority is a ceasefire under Trump’s guarantees, with mediators ensuring Israel implements the plan”. “The second has serious reservations regarding key clauses… They favour conditional approval with clarifications reflecting Hamas’s and the resistance factions’ demands,” the source added. Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said “ultimately it’s not just about convincing Hamas leadership in Doha, but also the leadership in Gaza, as well as Hamas members and fighters in Gaza”. “Additionally, Hamas must then be able to convince other factions in Gaza,” he added. The conflict was triggered by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 66,288 Palestinians, according to health ministry figures in the Hamas-run territory that the United Nations considers reliable. Their data does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but indicates that more than half of the dead are women and children.",
      "title": "Trump calls on Israel to ‘stop bombing Gaza’ after Hamas ‘conditionally’ agrees to peace plan",
      "summary": "US President Donald Trump said early on Saturday that Israel must stop bombing Gaza immediately and that he believes Hamas is ready for peace after an earlier statement by the Palestinian resistance group. Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict, including releasing hostages, but avoided addressing more vexing issues like disarmament and said it would seek further negotiations. Soon after, Trump posted Hamas’ response to his Truth Social account. Trump had earlier not specified whether the terms would be subject to negotiation, as Hamas is seeking. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for an “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli hostages following Hamas’ response. Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce offensive activity in Gaza. Notably, the resistance group did not say if it would agree to disarm and demilitarise Gaza — something Israel and the US want but Hamas has rejected before. It also did not agree to an Israeli withdrawal in stages, as opposed to the immediate, full withdrawal the group demands. A senior Hamas official told Al Jazeera that the group would not disarm before Israel’s occupation of the besieged enclave ends, comments that underscored the gap between the parties as the war approaches its two-year mark.

Here are some of the main reactions from around the world: United States “Based on the statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting peace. Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the hostages out safely and quickly!” Trump posted on Truth Social. The US leader also said in a brief video message that “everybody will be treated fairly” in talks on the future of Gaza. Israel “In light of Hamas’s response, Israel is preparing for the immediate implementation of the first stage of the Trump plan for the release of all the hostages,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said. “We will continue to work in full cooperation with the President and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles set out by Israel, which align with President Trump’s vision,” the statement added. India “We welcome President Trump’s leadership as peace efforts in Gaza make decisive progress.

Egypt Egypt said it hoped “this positive development will lead all parties to rise to the level of responsibility by committing to implementing President Trump’s plan on the ground and end the war”.

We now have the opportunity to make decisive progress towards peace. France will play its full part in line with its efforts at the UN, alongside the US, Israelis and Palestinians, and all of its international partners,” he said, thanking Trump and his team for their “commitment to peace”.

      "summary_orig": "PAKISTAN had set Sept 1, 2025 , as the deadline for Afghan migrants to return to Afghanistan. This is the culmination of the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan that started in November 2023. Even those with proper documentation, such as Proof of Registration cards, or those born in Pakistan are not exempt. This misguided policy is wrong in every way. From a moral and religious point of view, loyalties to the notion of a nation state (a Western concept), do not eclipse our responsibilities towards fellow human beings, especially the ummah. The experience of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and his companions in Madina is a clear lesson on how refugees and settlers should be treated. Religious teachings do not approve of expelling a population in their time of need just because global funding for their upkeep has dried up. For a country that declares Islam as the state religion, this argument should suffice as to why deportation should not be considered. For those of a more liberal persuasion, the deportations violate international law under the principle of non-refoulement covered by the Refugees Convention. While Pakistan is not a signatory to the convention, it did vote in favour of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from where this law draws its inspiration. Many justifiably doubt whether an argument based on ethics, morality or human rights will prevail in Pakistan. So, let’s examine the strategic side of this policy. Two key reasons are cited in favour of deportation: first, that Afghan settlers pose a national security threat to Pakistan. Second, to a smaller extent, that they are a burden on the economy and the social services. In fact, the reality is that the large majority of militants fighting against the state are Pakistani citizens and the primary perpetrators of terrorist attacks in the country. This is further evidenced by the fact that terrorist attacks have increased rather than declined since the mass deportation of Afghans began in 2023. In 2023, there were 141 major incidents of terrorism; in 2024 there were 240, and so far in 2025 there have been 265 major attacks according to data from the South Asia Terrorism Portal. If this policy was to remove a supposed threat to national security, the trend should be the opposite, but clearly the Afghans living in Pakistan were not actually driving terrorism. As for the notion that Afghan refugees contribute to major crimes, the data does not support it. Admittedly, more analysis of this is needed, but a study in KP looking at prosecution and police data from 2014 to 2016, showed that only a little over one per cent of major crimes were committed by Afghans. This low number is in spite of the fact that systemic bias exists against Afghans and cases are registered against them based on their compromised standing in Pakistani society. This data is supported by many studies on the connection of immigrants and refugees to crime globally as well. Given the vulnerable societal position of immigrants and the greater consequences for them, including deportation, they have another reason to stay away from illegal activities. The reality is that this policy is short-sighted and is not grounded in coherent strategic objectives. Where the argument about the economic and social services burden is concerned, while it is true that refugees can put pressure on local communities, in the case of Afghans the case is a bit more complex. First, vast funds have been given to Pakistan to house these migrants, and many social service centres, including hospitals and schools, have been opened in the communities by donors to reduce this pressure where Afghans have settled. Second, many Afghans are now an integral part of the local economy where they reside, creating jobs and being contributors to it. Third, while the Afghans cannot use government service centres, such as hospitals and schools, in the private sector, many health and educational outlets depend heavily on the business that the migrants generate. The fact that the primary push for the expulsion of Afghan migrants has not come from the communities where they reside, but from elsewhere, shows that economic consequences for communities was not actually a major concern. Hence, a better analysis backed by data should be done rather than making policies based on negative assumptions and prejudice. Moreover, the reality is that the Afghan diaspora settled in Pakistan have historically formed an important lobby advocating for better Pak-Afghan relations back in their homeland. This group, and their relatives in Afghanistan, have an incentive to advocate for stability in Pakistan and increased trade and cooperation between both countries, since their livelihoods depend on a stable prosperous Pakistan. By expelling Afghans, Pakistan is losing important leverage vis-à-vis Afghanistan for future issues, as well as the significant goodwill they had built. The reality is that this policy is short-sighted and is not grounded in coherent strategic objectives. Mainstream Pakistan and the establishment have a vision of what it means to be ‘Pakistani’. Unfortunately, those crossing over from the western border do not conform to that image. Many of those being deported, or in the queue, were, in fact, born in Pakistan and have lived here all their lives. Interestingly, some families migrated to Pakistan as early as the late 1970s, just a few years after migrants from India were still moving to Pakistan. However, unlike Afghan migrants, the identity or loyalties of migrants from the eastern border have sensibly not been questioned by the state. Due to Pakistan’s weak implementation capacity and the policy’s unpopularity in many communities housing Afghan residents, numerous Afghans still reside in Pakistan even after the deadline date has passed. If for no other reason than because of strategic considerations, the government should reconsider this policy. As for mainstream Pakistan, it would greatly benefit from embracing the diversity within the country’s borders rather than fearing it.

For those of a more liberal persuasion, the deportations violate international law under the principle of non-refoulement covered by the Refugees Convention. While Pakistan is not a signatory to the convention, it did vote in favour of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from where this law draws its inspiration. Many justifiably doubt whether an argument based on ethics, morality or human rights will prevail in Pakistan. So, let’s examine the strategic side of this policy. Two key reasons are cited in favour of deportation: first, that Afghan settlers pose a national security threat to Pakistan. Second, to a smaller extent, that they are a burden on the economy and the social services. In fact, the reality is that the large majority of militants fighting against the state are Pakistani citizens and the primary perpetrators of terrorist attacks in the country. This is further evidenced by the fact that terrorist attacks have increased rather than declined since the mass deportation of Afghans began in 2023. In 2023, there were 141 major incidents of terrorism; in 2024 there were 240, and so far in 2025 there have been 265 major attacks according to data from the South Asia Terrorism Portal. If this policy was to remove a supposed threat to national security, the trend should be the opposite, but clearly the Afghans living in Pakistan were not actually driving terrorism. As for the notion that Afghan refugees contribute to major crimes, the data does not support it. Admittedly, more analysis of this is needed, but a study in KP looking at prosecution and police data from 2014 to 2016, showed that only a little over one per cent of major crimes were committed by Afghans. This low number is in spite of the fact that systemic bias exists against Afghans and cases are registered against them based on their compromised standing in Pakistani society. This data is supported by many studies on the connection of immigrants and refugees to crime globally as well. Given the vulnerable societal position of immigrants and the greater consequences for them, including deportation, they have another reason to stay away from illegal activities. The reality is that this policy is short-sighted and is not grounded in coherent strategic objectives. Where the argument about the economic and social services burden is concerned, while it is true that refugees can put pressure on local communities, in the case of Afghans the case is a bit more complex. First, vast funds have been given to Pakistan to house these migrants, and many social service centres, including hospitals and schools, have been opened in the communities by donors to reduce this pressure where Afghans have settled. Second, many Afghans are now an integral part of the local economy where they reside, creating jobs and being contributors to it. Third, while the Afghans cannot use government service centres, such as hospitals and schools, in the private sector, many health and educational outlets depend heavily on the business that the migrants generate. The fact that the primary push for the expulsion of Afghan migrants has not come from the communities where they reside, but from elsewhere, shows that economic consequences for communities was not actually a major concern. Hence, a better analysis backed by data should be done rather than making policies based on negative assumptions and prejudice. Moreover, the reality is that the Afghan diaspora settled in Pakistan have historically formed an important lobby advocating for better Pak-Afghan relations back in their homeland. This group, and their relatives in Afghanistan, have an incentive to advocate for stability in Pakistan and increased trade and cooperation between both countries, since their livelihoods depend on a stable prosperous Pakistan. By expelling Afghans, Pakistan is losing important leverage vis-à-vis Afghanistan for future issues, as well as the significant goodwill they had built. The reality is that this policy is short-sighted and is not grounded in coherent strategic objectives. Mainstream Pakistan and the establishment have a vision of what it means to be ‘Pakistani’. Unfortunately, those crossing over from the western border do not conform to that image. Many of those being deported, or in the queue, were, in fact, born in Pakistan and have lived here all their lives. Interestingly, some families migrated to Pakistan as early as the late 1970s, just a few years after migrants from India were still moving to Pakistan. However, unlike Afghan migrants, the identity or loyalties of migrants from the eastern border have sensibly not been questioned by the state. Due to Pakistan’s weak implementation capacity and the policy’s unpopularity in many communities housing Afghan residents, numerous Afghans still reside in Pakistan even after the deadline date has passed. If for no other reason than because of strategic considerations, the government should reconsider this policy. As for mainstream Pakistan, it would greatly benefit from embracing the diversity within the country’s borders rather than fearing it.

      "summary_orig": "• Maryam refuses to apologise, wants PPP to eat its words for ‘ridiculing’ Punjab in times of disaster • PPP leaders question her mandate, see no point in ‘continuing alliance’ LAHORE: As Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz declared on Friday that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst against it on flood and canal issues, the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47. “Maryam Nawaz will never apologise (to the PPP) for raising her voice for Punjab. Rather, those (PPP leaders) who ridiculed Punjab in times of disaster should apologise,” the Punjab CM said while addressing the inauguration ceremony of the e-bus project in Lahore. The war of words between the two sides, which began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as the Punjab chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP, the ruling party in Sindh, had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe. On Wednesday, PPP and PML-N leaders met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces and the PPP leadership. “I want to remind (President) Asif Zardari and (PPP Chairman) Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari that I was deeply hurt when they held three press conferences in a single day mocking Punjab and spreading lies during the flood crisis here,” Maryam said, adding that she had remained quiet about Bilawal’s remarks because she did not want to get into a fight, as she was serving the people of Punjab “24 hours a day and did not have the time”. She said Punjab wanted to build its own canals from its own resou­rces, but approval was denied at the CCI, and later protests were staged against Punjab. “If this isn’t provincialism, then what is?” she asked. The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. “That water is the right of Punjab’s farmers, but it was politicised. Let me make it very clear… Whenever Punjab is targeted, there will be a response and a strong one. Think 100 times before talking negatively about Punjab,” she said. Further targeting the PPP, she said when floods swept through Pun­jab, the people of one province (PPP in Sindh) not only wrongly criticised the PML-N government in Punjab, but also rubbed salt into the wounds. “If there is any issue in any province, do we level false allegations at press conferences? Do we spread lies? What we do is help them.” Giving an example of how she had offered help to her party’s arch-rival during floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ms Nawaz said: “I called KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and offered him Punjab’s assistance during the floods despite him being a political opponent.” BISP vs flood survivors data On the Benazir Income Support Pro­­gramme , she said she did not wa­­nt the data of poor people but only that of the people affected by floods. The Punjab CM also defended a controversial YouTuber who had made derogatory remarks about the people of Sindh over the canal issue . “When someone (the YouTuber) apologises, you forgive them, right? But these people (PPP leaders) made fun of him. Still, I remained silent. However, I will not let this happen to another person in Punjab,” the PML-N leader warned. False mandate, venomous speeches Responding to Maryam Nawaz’s diatribe, PPP leader Sassui Palijo said: “Maryam Nawaz does not have a public mandate; rather, she is doing politics on charity seats. Without winning even a single genuine seat, Maryam Nawaz has been given the entire province. The people didn’t even find her worthy of seven seats, yet she was gifted a whole province. Where was your honour when you accepted a province on a charity mandate?” Ms Palijo further said Maryam had no moral grounds to speak aga­inst smaller provinces, particularly Sindh. “Maryam’s domicile may be powerful, but in reality she is nothing more than a product of Form 47.” She said false mandates and venomous statements cannot alter reality. “If there is ever a transparent election, Maryam Nawaz will not even be visible in the country’s politics. Her speeches filled with ethnic prejudice and animosity against smaller provinces have become a habit. But politics rooted in hate and lies never lasts long,” the PPP leader said, adding that the people of Sindh would never allow anti-Sindh dams or canals to be built. Another PPP leader, Maula Bakh­­sh Chandio, said Maryam, after ousting her father Nawaz Sharif from politics, had now taken the driving seat and was targeting the PPP. “This alliance (of PML-N and PPP) cannot continue any more,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "• Foreign minister distances Islamabad from 20-point plan by White House; insists Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remains ‘unchanged’ • Says several states eyeing Saudi-style defence pacts; claims controversial ‘speechwriter’ was not part of ‘official UN team’ • Return of flotilla activists being negotiated through ‘European country’ in absence of ties with Tel Aviv ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the United States was now “the only hope” after the United Nations, European Union and Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) had failed to secure peace in Gaza. Making a policy statement in the National Assembly, Mr Dar again distanced the government from US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza “peace plan” , saying it differed from a draft jointly prepared by eight Muslim countries and shared with Washington. He said the prime minister’s initial statement welcoming the plan was issued while in transit, while he was “unaware of the changes”. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine is what was the policy of the Quaid-i-Azam. There was no change, there is no change and there will be no change in it,” he assured the House. Reiterating the country’s consistent and principled position, he said that the two-state solution was the only viable path to a just and lasting peace, through the establishment of a contiguous, independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Mr Dar also disclosed that several Arab and non-Arab countries had exp­ressed interest in concluding security agreements with Pakistan, along the lines of the recent ‘strategic mutual defence’ pact with Saudi Arabia . He cautioned, however, that decisions on such requests would “take some time”. He said several foreign ministers had raised the proposal with him on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He likened multiple countries signing bilateral pacts with Pakistan to the formation of an “eastern Nato”, without explaining how separate arrangements could evolve into a multilateral bloc. “It is my faith that Pakistan will one day lead the Islamic ummah,” he said. “Allah Almighty has made you a nuclear and missile power and now you are to become an economic power,” adding that this would require unity. He said talks on the Saudi agreement had been underway for about one and a half years, beginning during the PDM government. “We are fortunate to have been included among the defenders of Haramain Sharifain,” he remarked. He also read out the joint statement, issued alongside seven other Muslim countries following consultations in New York, which called for unrestricted humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of Palestinians, full Israeli withdrawal, reconstruction of Gaza and a credible path to a two-state peace with Gaza fully integrated with the West Bank. He said the focus would remain on these objectives, including holding Israel accountable, and noted that the Pales­tinian Authority had accepted the plan. Responding to opposition questions about British-Pakistani activist Shama Junejo’s presence at UN-related events in New York, Mr Dar clarified she was not part of the official government delegation. “Her involvement was confined to civil society interactions and did not reflect state policy,” he said. Flotilla Mr Dar also briefed the House on Pakistanis aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla seized by Israeli forces, condemning the interception as a violation of international maritime law and humanitarian principles. He said Islamabad was pursuing diplomatic channels, including through an “influential European country”, to secure their safe return. Israel on Friday deported four Italian activists, the first of hundreds detained from the aid flotilla, shortly after the interception of the group’s final boat brought an end to its mission. The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail last month, ferrying politicians and activists including former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg towards Gaza. The Israeli navy began intercepting the boats on Wednesday, and an Israeli official said the following day that boats with more than 400 people on board had been prevented from reaching the Palestinian territory. The military said on Friday that the navy had stopped all 42 of the fleet’s vessels “in an operation that lasted approximately 12 hours”, and transferred flotilla members to Israel’s Ashdod Port for processing by police. Israel’s foreign ministry said it deported four Italian activists who were aboard the flotilla, adding that “the rest are in the process of being deported”. Videos circulating on social media showed far-right Israeli Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir taunting activists from the Global Sumud Flotilla, as they were in Israeli custody. Videos showed him pointing at the detained activists, and calling them “terrorists.” The International Committee to Break the Siege on Gaza condemned his actions, saying that it was not surprising “for the criminals of genocide to send their minister swaggering before activists from 50 countries around the world, surrounded by his guards”. PM asked to apologise Earlier, PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser demanded that the prime minister apologise for “hurting public sentiments” on Palestine, saying no decision would be acceptable without the will of the Palestinian people. He said Haramain Sharifain were central to Pakistanis’ beliefs and that the nation would stand united for their defence. “If anyone dares to cast an evil eye towards the Haramain, the entire Pakistani nation will stand united in their defence,” he said. He criticised the government for failing to take parliament into confidence on key national decisions. The PTI leader stated that Mr Dar’s clarification regarding Shama Junejo had raised further questions. He said the foreign minister had admitted she was the prime minister’s speechwriter and therefore responsibility rested with the premier. Commenting on the recent “Trump peace deal”, Mr Qaiser said no Muslim leader had endorsed the agreement, yet Pakistan’s prime minister, “in a display of sycophancy”, acknowledged an incomplete agreement through a tweet. “If the deal was so good, why did the Palestinians reject it?” he asked. He noted that over 60,000 innocent Pale­stinians had been martyred in a brutal campaign of genocide, the likes of which the world had rarely witnessed. Mr Qaiser categorically stated that Pakistan’s 250 million people would never accept recognition of Israel. “Any peace accord is incomplete without the recognition of an independent Palestinian state, with Al-Quds as its capital,” he asserted.

      "summary_en": "• Foreign minister distances Islamabad from 20-point plan by White House; insists Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remains ‘unchanged’ • Says several states eyeing Saudi-style defence pacts; claims controversial ‘speechwriter’ was not part of ‘official UN team’ • Return of flotilla activists being negotiated through ‘European country’ in absence of ties with Tel Aviv ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the United States was now “the only hope” after the United Nations, European Union and Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) had failed to secure peace in Gaza. Making a policy statement in the National Assembly, Mr Dar again distanced the government from US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza “peace plan” , saying it differed from a draft jointly prepared by eight Muslim countries and shared with Washington. He said the prime minister’s initial statement welcoming the plan was issued while in transit, while he was “unaware of the changes”. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine is what was the policy of the Quaid-i-Azam. There was no change, there is no change and there will be no change in it,” he assured the House. Reiterating the country’s consistent and principled position, he said that the two-state solution was the only viable path to a just and lasting peace, through the establishment of a contiguous, independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Mr Dar also disclosed that several Arab and non-Arab countries had exp­ressed interest in concluding security agreements with Pakistan, along the lines of the recent ‘strategic mutual defence’ pact with Saudi Arabia . He cautioned, however, that decisions on such requests would “take some time”. He said several foreign ministers had raised the proposal with him on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He likened multiple countries signing bilateral pacts with Pakistan to the formation of an “eastern Nato”, without explaining how separate arrangements could evolve into a multilateral bloc. “It is my faith that Pakistan will one day lead the Islamic ummah,” he said. “Allah Almighty has made you a nuclear and missile power and now you are to become an economic power,” adding that this would require unity. He said talks on the Saudi agreement had been underway for about one and a half years, beginning during the PDM government. “We are fortunate to have been included among the defenders of Haramain Sharifain,” he remarked. He also read out the joint statement, issued alongside seven other Muslim countries following consultations in New York, which called for unrestricted humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of Palestinians, full Israeli withdrawal, reconstruction of Gaza and a credible path to a two-state peace with Gaza fully integrated with the West Bank. He said the focus would remain on these objectives, including holding Israel accountable, and noted that the Pales­tinian Authority had accepted the plan. Responding to opposition questions about British-Pakistani activist Shama Junejo’s presence at UN-related events in New York, Mr Dar clarified she was not part of the official government delegation. “Her involvement was confined to civil society interactions and did not reflect state policy,” he said. Flotilla Mr Dar also briefed the House on Pakistanis aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla seized by Israeli forces, condemning the interception as a violation of international maritime law and humanitarian principles. He said Islamabad was pursuing diplomatic channels, including through an “influential European country”, to secure their safe return. Israel on Friday deported four Italian activists, the first of hundreds detained from the aid flotilla, shortly after the interception of the group’s final boat brought an end to its mission. The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail last month, ferrying politicians and activists including former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg towards Gaza. The Israeli navy began intercepting the boats on Wednesday, and an Israeli official said the following day that boats with more than 400 people on board had been prevented from reaching the Palestinian territory. The military said on Friday that the navy had stopped all 42 of the fleet’s vessels “in an operation that lasted approximately 12 hours”, and transferred flotilla members to Israel’s Ashdod Port for processing by police. Israel’s foreign ministry said it deported four Italian activists who were aboard the flotilla, adding that “the rest are in the process of being deported”.

      "summary_orig": "Communal tensions continue to simmer in India’s Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra states as the ‘I love Muhammad’ row continues, reported Indian media on Friday. In UP’s Bareilly, Indian authorities deployed large contingents of security forces ahead of Friday prayers. Internet services have also been suspended till Saturday, 3 pm. Local administration claimed the move was due to recent communal tensions and in light of Dussehra and Durga Puja festivities over the weekend. Bareilly witnessed violent clashes last week, with over 2,000 protesters clashing with state police outside a mosque after Friday prayers. Local law enforcement arrested at least 81 people after the demonstration. The issue came to the forefront on September 9, when an FIR was filed against 24 individuals for allegedly putting up posters with ‘I love Muhammad’ during the Eid Miladun Nabi procession on September 4. Hindu groups and right-wing organisations in the region objected to the posters and called it a “deliberate provocation”. UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also warned of strict action against “rioters”. A day earlier, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi criticised the heavy-handed response from the state. “The laws are so designed that it is possible to shower praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but not on the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)”. “In this country, one can say ‘I love Modi’ but not ‘I love Muhammad’. Where are you taking this nation? If someone says ‘I love Modi’, and erect posters, everyone becomes happy. But if someone says ‘I love Mohammad’, then that is objected to,” added Owaisi. Jahanzaib Sirwal, a local BJP leader from Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), called for an impartial investigation to hold all wrongdoers accountable and not just one community. “What was a simple, heartfelt act of faith has been met with FIRs, detentions and inflammatory rhetoric, including Adityanath’s remarks about ‘denting-painting’ and teaching lessons to generations,” said the BJP leader. He added that such statements were divisive and also an “affront to the constitutional right under Article 25 to freely practice and profess one’s religion”. Expressing his displeasure, Sirwal also threatened to resign from the party over Adityanath’s “unacceptable” remarks and the “vindictive” attitude of the state police against the Muslim community. Separately, in Maharashtra’s Ahilyanagar, a demonstration by local Muslims, protesting against ‘I love Muhammad’ graffiti on the road, turned violent earlier this week after the protesters were baton-charged by local police. Law enforcement officials claimed the protesters blocked a vital thoroughfare in the city and pelted stones at police officials. Police arrested at least 30 people following the incident. Indian authorities have also demolished properties belonging to Muslims accused of rioting and disturbing law and order.",

      "summary_orig": "British police said on Friday they accidentally shot a victim who died in the attack on a synagogue in Manchester, as well as one of the survivors, as they attempted to stop an attacker who appeared to be wearing an explosive belt. In Thursday’s attack, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed after a British man of Syrian descent drove a car into pedestrians and then began stabbing people outside Manchester’s Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The attacker, shot dead by officers at the scene, was not carrying a firearm, said Greater Manchester Police chief constable Steve Watson, though one of those killed suffered a gunshot wound. “It follows, therefore, this injury may have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end,” Watson said in a statement. The attack comes as Israel has drawn widespread criticism over its ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has killed over 66,000 people since October 7, 2023. UK vows to crack down on antisemitism Watson said another worshipper is believed to have suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound, and that it is thought both victims were close together behind the synagogue door, as worshippers tried to prevent the attacker from gaining entry. The police complaints watchdog said it was carrying out an investigation into what happened. Police have named the attacker as Jihad al-Shamie, 35, and said they could find no records to show he had been referred to the government’s anti-radicalisation programme. In a statement on Facebook, Shamie’s family said they were in “profound shock” and wanted to distance themselves from what they called his “heinous act”. The British government vowed to redouble its efforts to tackle antisemitism as the Jewish community reeled from the attack. Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the site of the attack and spoke with police and ambulance workers, praising “the degree of professionalism and speed” they showed in their response. When Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy spoke at a vigil outside the synagogue on Friday, he was heckled by people who said “Jews don’t want to live here anymore” and urged him to stop the pro-Palestinian marches that have taken place in British cities regularly since the start of the genocide in Gaza. Britain, like other European countries and the United States, has recorded a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents in the nearly two years since the conflict began. A person holds flowers during a vigil organised by the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester and Region to honour the victims of the Manchester synagogue attack, in Manchester, the UK on October 3. — Reuters Last year was the second-worst on record for such incidents, surpassed only by 2023, according to the Community Security Trust, which provides security to Jewish organisations across Britain. It recorded more than 3,500 incidents in 2024. Many Jewish leaders noted that they were the only faith in Britain that routinely required security at its institutions. Islamophobic incidents in Britain have also increased since the start of the Gaza conflict. Last month, Starmer announced that Britain was recognising a Palestinian state in the hope of reviving peace for Palestinians and Israelis, a decision decried by Israel as a “huge reward to terrorism”. Pro-Palestinian protests Israel has accused Britain of allowing rampant antisemitism to spread through its cities and universities, and repeated that criticism after Thursday’s attack. Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer (C) and Britain’s Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood visit the Greater Manchester Police headquarters on October 3. —AFP Police, meanwhile, urged organisers of a planned protest in support of a banned pro-Palestinian group in London this weekend to cancel or postpone the event, saying it would divert police resources needed to protect fearful communities. Organisers said the protest, the latest in a series in which police have arrested more than 1,500 people, would go ahead, and that it was the police’s choice whether to make more arrests of people “peacefully holding signs”. Manchester, in northwestern England, is a highly diverse city home to the country’s largest Jewish community outside London. On Friday morning, there was a heavy police presence at the scene of the attack, with debris still lying in the street and bunches of flowers being left nearby.",

In a statement on Facebook, Shamie’s family said they were in “profound shock” and wanted to distance themselves from what they called his “heinous act”. The British government vowed to redouble its efforts to tackle antisemitism as the Jewish community reeled from the attack. Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the site of the attack and spoke with police and ambulance workers, praising “the degree of professionalism and speed” they showed in their response. When Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy spoke at a vigil outside the synagogue on Friday, he was heckled by people who said “Jews don’t want to live here anymore” and urged him to stop the pro-Palestinian marches that have taken place in British cities regularly since the start of the genocide in Gaza. Britain, like other European countries and the United States, has recorded a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents in the nearly two years since the conflict began. A person holds flowers during a vigil organised by the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester and Region to honour the victims of the Manchester synagogue attack, in Manchester, the UK on October 3. — Reuters Last year was the second-worst on record for such incidents, surpassed only by 2023, according to the Community Security Trust, which provides security to Jewish organisations across Britain. It recorded more than 3,500 incidents in 2024. Many Jewish leaders noted that they were the only faith in Britain that routinely required security at its institutions. Islamophobic incidents in Britain have also increased since the start of the Gaza conflict. Last month, Starmer announced that Britain was recognising a Palestinian state in the hope of reviving peace for Palestinians and Israelis, a decision decried by Israel as a “huge reward to terrorism”. Pro-Palestinian protests Israel has accused Britain of allowing rampant antisemitism to spread through its cities and universities, and repeated that criticism after Thursday’s attack. Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer (C) and Britain’s Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood visit the Greater Manchester Police headquarters on October 3. —AFP Police, meanwhile, urged organisers of a planned protest in support of a banned pro-Palestinian group in London this weekend to cancel or postpone the event, saying it would divert police resources needed to protect fearful communities. Organisers said the protest, the latest in a series in which police have arrested more than 1,500 people, would go ahead, and that it was the police’s choice whether to make more arrests of people “peacefully holding signs”. Manchester, in northwestern England, is a highly diverse city home to the country’s largest Jewish community outside London. On Friday morning, there was a heavy police presence at the scene of the attack, with debris still lying in the street and bunches of flowers being left nearby.",

      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudry on Friday apologised for the attack on journalists in Islamabad a day prior, assuring the media that steps will be taken to ensure such an incident does not reoccur. On Thursday, a raid was carried out by Islamabad police at the National Press Club (NPC), where several journalists were allegedly assaulted. Visuals aired on DawnNewsTV showed policemen armed with batons attacking journalists on the press club premises. Moreover, visuals shared on social media also showed police dragging journalists out of what appeared to be the cafeteria. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had ordered an inquiry into the incident. Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad today, Tallal said that he apologises for the incident on behalf of the government and that the information minister was on board regarding the matter. Condemning the incident, he reassured the media that steps will be taken so no one dares to “disrespect the press club” again. “I went to the press club immediately and asked for an unconditional apology,” Tallal said. “Whatever shortcomings there have been, we have apologised and action will be taken.” When it comes to freedom of speech, journalists, and the sanctity of the press club, Tallal reiterated that “there can be no compromise”. He added that the administration of the press club and other stakeholders will collectively make a decision and the corresponding action will be seen. Meanwhile, in a post on X, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui also condemned the incident, saying the decision to investigate it is a good step, but it should not be a mere formality. “The officials who are irresponsible and abusive should be identified and punished under the law,” Senator Siddiqui said. “While keeping the investigation process transparent, journalist organisations should also be involved.” He added that the sanctity of press clubs should not be violated. “No justification for violence against a journalist performing professional duties can be acceptable. A solid arrangement to permanently prevent such actions is very important,” he said. In May, Freedom Network’s annual Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom Report for 2025 said Pakistan’s media is “standing at a crossroad amid an existential threat and increased restrictive environment, deteriorating safety and job security, significant challenges to professional integrity of media and its practitioners”. Last year, Pakistan dropped two places in the World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, with the country ranking 152 out of 180 countries. Additional input by Irfan Sadozai.",

      "summary_orig": "A major customs fraud was uncovered at Karachi airport, where employees of a foreign ground-handling company and corrupt importers allegedly smuggled out high-value electronics without paying duties and taxes, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) said in a statement on Friday. “Acting on intelligence, authorities seized a consignment worth Rs103 million, including laptops, iPads, iPhones, MacBooks, PlayStations, and memory cards,” the statement said. According to FBR, five consignments by a company registered in Dubai were cleared using fake gate passes while being concealed from the Web-Based One Customs (WeBOC) system, resulting in an estimated duty and tax evasion of Rs384 million. “Two first information reports (FIRs) have been lodged, employees arrested, and further arrests are expected,” the statement said. It added that the operation reflected the FBR’s “commitment to safeguarding national revenue”, warning that negligent customs officials would not be spared. FBR has lately been intensifying its crackdown on tax evasion and smuggling, carrying out a series of operations at ports and airports across the country to safeguard national revenue. Last month, it emerged that the revenue watchdog launched a “Lifestyle Monitoring Cell” with 40 investigators to scan Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube for signs of tax evasion.",

      "summary_orig": "The UN Security Council (UNSC) Committee has temporarily lifted a travel ban on the Afghan Taliban foreign minister, which would allow him to visit India between October 9 and 16, India’s foreign ministry said on Friday. If confirmed, it would be the first visit to India by a senior leader of the Taliban-run Afghan administration since it seized power in 2021 after 20 years of US military presence. Delhi and Kabul have traditionally enjoyed close ties when the Islamist Taliban were not in power. Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is among Afghan Taliban members who are under UN sanctions, including a travel ban and asset freeze. Temporary exemptions are sometimes granted for diplomacy. The Afghan administration did not immediately respond to inquiries about Muttaqi’s travel plans. India’s foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters that New Delhi had already been speaking to the Afghan administration, and noted that it had provided support after an earthquake on August 31. He did not specifically confirm that the visit would take place. Indian and Afghan media have reported that Muttaqi will travel to Russia before visiting New Delhi. In Moscow, he is expected to discuss the situation in Afghanistan with representatives from Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Central Asian countries, the reports say. Hekmatullah Hekmat, an Afghan political analyst, said the visit to India was highly significant for the Taliban government: “Afghanistan is in dire need of establishing relations with regional countries, especially its neighbours. It needs to build political, economic, and trade ties and to gain recognition.” Only Russia has so far recognised the Taliban government. India closed its embassy in Kabul in 2021, but a year later opened a technical mission to coordinate humanitarian assistance.",

      "title_orig": "Indian air force chief repeats ‘implausible’ claims of downing 5 PAF jets",
      "summary_orig": "Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh on Friday claimed that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. “As far as air defence part is concerned, we have evidence of one long-range strike … along with that five fighters, high-tech fighters between F-16 and JF-17 class, our system tells us,” Singh told reporters at the Indian Air Force annual day press conference. However, he did not share the said evidence. The F-16 is a US-made fighter jet, while the JF-17 is of Chinese origin. Although Singh had previously too claimed without credible evidence that five Pakistani fighter jets and another military aircraft were shot down during the conflict, this is the first time New Delhi has mentioned the class of jets in public. He also refused to comment on Pakistan downing Indian jets in May. The first time the Indian air chief had claimed that Pakistan’s jets were downed during the four-day escalation, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had dismissed the “implausible” Indian assertions, offering instead to open both countries’ air fleets to independent verification. “The belated assertions made by the Indian Air Force chief regarding alleged destruction of Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor are as implausible as they are ill-timed,” Khawaja Asif had said in a sharply worded August statement. “It is also ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by the strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians.” He also said that India did not make any such claims for three months after the conflict ended, while Pakistan immediately presented deta­iled technical briefings to the international media, and independent obser­vers recorded widespread acknowledgement of the loss of multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafales, by sources ranging from world leaders, senior Indian politicians, to foreign intelligence assessments. Indian air chief’s latest claims of downing jets come a week after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during a United Nations General Assembly speech, said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “ seven of the Indian jets ” into scrap and dust. Earlier this week, United States President Donald Trump also described how he confronted both nations during an active war that saw “ seven aircraft shot down ” and tensions rapidly escalating between the two neighbours. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale . New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. The May fighting, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. Ties between the countries have downgraded since the attack, with the impact being felt in areas ranging from trade and travel to sports. India has also kept in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty — a move Pakistan termed an “act of war”.",
