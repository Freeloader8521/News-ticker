      "summary_orig": "South Korea's cybersecurity watchdog is facing a workforce shortage amid the soaring number of cyber threats reported by local businesses, a lawmaker said Sunday. Citing data submitted by the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), Rep. Kim Jang-kyom of the main opposition People Power Party said the watchdog received 1,887 reports of security breaches from South Korean companies in 2024, up 47 percent from a year earlier. During the January-August period of 2025, the number of breach reports stood at 1,501, the data showed. Despite the surge in cyberattacks reported by businesses, the number of response personnel came to just 132, up only nine from 2022. Over the same period, South Korea's budget for hacking and virus response systems rose 22 percent to 73.6 billion won ($52.4 million), according to the lawmaker. \"The fact that the number of investigators at KISA increased by a single digit over the years indicates the country lacks readiness against such threats,\" Kim said.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Sunday reacted to statements made by the Indian military and political leadership, terming them a “failed attempt” to restore their “lost reputation”. While he did not specify any particular statement that he was reacting to, his remarks follow recent aggressive comments from the Indian side, mentioning terrorism and warning of action. India has long accused Pakistan of cross-border terrorism, an allegation that Islamabad has repeatedly refuted and termed baseless . “The statements made by the Indian army and its political leadership are a failed attempt to restore its lost reputation,” Asif said on X. He also referred to a four-day escalation between India and Pakistan in May, during which Islamabad says it downed at least six Indian jets. Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the escalation,  and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”. “The way the public opinion in India turned against the government after the worst defeat in history, and the way [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and his group have lost their reputation, it is apparent from their statements that they [are feeling] the pressure,” Asif added. “This time, God willing, India will get buried under the rubble of its own jets,” the minister asserted. ‘Cataclysmic devastation’ Asif’s remarks come a day after the military warned that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and Pakistan would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) came in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in case of a fresh round of hostilities. “In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,” the ISPR said. Indian media outlet NDTV reported on Friday that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion. The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed , without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.” In response, the ISPR said in its statement that the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”. It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia. The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.” May conflict The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles , artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people , before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale . New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command , that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India. The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army. The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Security forces killed 14 terrorists of the Indian proxy group Fitna al-Hindustan in an operation conducted in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district on Saturday. The state designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Security officials said the forces launched the operation on the basis of intelligence reports about the presence of the group’s militants in the mountainous area of Zehri tehsil. According to the officials, the area was cordoned off before the action was launched. Heavy firing took place between the security forces and the terrorists, which continued for several hours. “As many as 14 terrorists were killed in the gun battle, while 20 others were injured,” the officials said, adding that a large quantity of arms, ammunition, and other equipment was seized from their possession. The Zehri operation, they added, was carried out days after security forces killed seven India-sponsored terrorists in an intelligence-based operation in Sherani district of Balochistan. They said several hideouts established by the militants in the mountainous terrain were destroyed during the operation. “Residents of the Zehri area praised the operation, acknowledging the efforts of the security forces in restoring peace and order to the region, which had been disturbed for a long time,” the officials said, adding that the terrorists had been harassing and blackmailing local residents. Officials reaffirmed that the security forces remain fully committed to elimina­ting the remaining milita­nts of Fitna al-Hindustan. On Oct 1, security forces had killed 13 other alleged terrorists in separate operations in Quetta and Kech districts of Makran. The operation in Aghbarg, on the outskirts of Quetta, was conducted a day after a car suicide attack on the headquarters of Frontier Corps (North) that claimed 10 lives, including four security personnel, and left 33 others injured. Security forces foiled the attackers’ attempt to enter the FC headquarters and killed all five terrorists. FIR registered Meanwhile, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Balochistan Police has registered an FIR against the terrorists involved in the car suicide attack outside the FC headquarters and has lau­nched an investigation. Official sources said the CTD has identified two terrorists who were killed by security forces as they attempted to enter the FC headquarters. According to CTD sources, one of the terrorists belonged to the Mazai Adha area of Qila Abdullah district, bordering Afghanistan, and was identified as Sharifullah. The other terrorist was a resident of Chagai district, but his name has not yet been established. Sources said CTD officials, along with other investigators, have been questioning Sharifullah’s family members. “The terrorist from Mazai Adha was also wanted by security forces in Karachi for his involvement in a previous terrorist attack there,” an official said. Investigators have also approached the family of the other terrorist from Chagai. Security officials said the CTD identified both terrorists with the help of Nadra’s fingerprint records. “The remains of the other terrorists killed in the gun battle with security forces have been sent to the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore for analysis,” the official added. Meanwhile, security forces have sealed the area where the FC headquarters is located. Buildings badly damaged by the powerful explosions have also been sealed, and no one is being allowed to enter to access their offices. The offices of Daily Mashriq and the private TV channel HUM were among those badly damaged and have been sealed by security forces. Heavy traffic congestion was reported on several key roads due to the closure of routes passing near the FC headquarters. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "ANKARA: A total of 137 activists detained by Israel for taking part in the flotilla seeking to deliver aid to Gaza arrived in Turkiye on Saturday after being deported, with two alleging that Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg was mistreated during her detention. Israel did not immediately comment on the latest allegation, but its foreign ministry earlier described reports that detainees had been mistreated as “complete lies”. The 137 activists who landed at Istanbul Airport included 36 Turkish nationals, as well as citizens from the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Morocco, Italy, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Switzerland, Tunisia and Jordan. Two of them, Hazwani Helmi, a Malaysian citizen, and Windfield Beaver, an American, said at the airport that they had witnessed Thunberg being mistreated, saying she was shoved and forced to wear an Israeli flag. “It was a disaster. They treated us like animals,” said Helmi, 28, adding that detainees were not provided with clean food or water and that medication and belongings were confiscated. Beaver, 43, said Thunberg was “treated terribly’’ and “used as propaganda”, describing how she was pushed into a room as Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir arrived. Israel has faced international condemnation after its military intercepted all of about 40 boats in the Gaza-bound aid flotilla and detained more than 450 activists. Its foreign ministry wrote on X that all detained activists were “safe and in good health”, adding it was keen to complete the remaining deportations “as quickly as possible”. Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said 26 Italians were on board the Turkish Airlines flight, with another 15 still held in Israel and set to be expelled over the next few days. “I have once again given instructions to the Italian embassy in Tel Aviv to ensure that the remaining compatriots are treated with respect for their rights,” Tajani wrote on X. A first group of Italians from the flotilla — four parliamentarians — arrived in Rome on Friday. “We were brutally stopped … brutally taken hostage,” said Benedetta Scuderi, one of the parliamentarians. ‘Zip-tied for five hours’ According to Adalah, an Israeli group offering legal assistance to flotilla members, some detainees were denied access to lawyers, water and medications. They were also “forced to kneel with their hands zip-tied for at least five hours, after some participants chanted ’Free Palestine’,” Adalah said. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Maleeha Lodhi Former ambassador of Pakistan to the US, UK and the UN The Pakistan-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) is emblematic of changing geostrategic dynamics and shifting alignments that are reshaping the regional landscape, and can contribute to the emergence of a new security architecture in the Middle East. It has been forged in the backdrop of unprecedented volatility and violence in the region, with Israel’s two-year genocidal war having claimed over 65,000 Palestinian lives and wrought massive devastation and an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Israel’s attack on Qatar [on September 9] shook the entire region. It was the sixth country to face Israeli military aggression but the first Gulf state, and also a non-Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) ally of the US. This intensified growing doubts about the value and reliability of the American defence umbrella with the US unable or unwilling to restrain an unbound Israel. The SMDA is a consequence of the eroding trust of regional states in an unpredictable US, whose blind support for Israel has heightened the security threat they face. Negotiations for the security agreement took place months before the strike on Qatar. But the timing of its signing suggests the attack on Qatar and Israel’s unchecked aggression hastened its finalisation, with Riyadh seeking to diversify its security partnerships and Pakistan expanding its options. Under the deal, both countries would consider an attack on one as “an aggression against both.” Details of the pact are not yet public, but it could shift the regional balance of power. It reflects a hedging strategy by Riyadh in turning to Pakistan for “joint deterrence against any aggression.” There has been much discussion about whether this has a nuclear dimension and involves extended deterrence. Pakistan has preferred to maintain strategic ambiguity, to give itself flexibility. Saudi officials, however, are cited as saying, “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.” Eos asked six foreign policy experts for their initial assessments of the recent Pak-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) and Pakistan’s potential role in US President Donald Trump’s proposed plan for Gaza. Their analyses of these developments are presented below… While the deal may bring Pakistan much-needed financial assistance to help its fragile economy, there are also real risks for Islamabad. The pact injects Pakistan into a volatile region and may involve commitments that may be difficult to fulfil if it is expected to become a net security provider to the region. These risks have to be mitigated if Pakistan is to avoid overextending itself, given its own internal and external security challenges. Other risks and challenges may also emerge if Pakistan is asked by Washington to be part of a mostly Muslim multinational security force envisaged for Gaza under US President Donald Trump’s ‘peace plan .’ Trump shared his Gaza proposals with Pakistan and seven other Muslim countries in a meeting in New York, but what was announced was different from what was agreed between them. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had intervened to change many elements of the plan. The announced plan is vague and has no timeline on withdrawal. It has no guarantee of a complete Israel pullout from Gaza. It also doesn’t guarantee a permanent ceasefire. It says nothing about a Palestinian state or two-state solution and only talks vaguely about a pathway to statehood after the Palestinian Authority has carried out major reforms. It seeks to install a transitional authority headed by Trump and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair . This has already provoked controversy and been likened to Iraqi-style direct occupation. Without a deal between Israel and Hamas, the plan can’t take off. The plan has also been framed without consulting the Palestinians. It advantages Israel, which is why many Palestinians see it as a document of surrender. And it is why Netanyahu said at the joint press conference that Israel’s war aims are achieved by the plan: for Hamas to be disarmed, Gaza demilitarised and no future Palestinian state to be established. Despite the cautious welcome the plan has received from across the world, doubts are intensifying whether it will lead to an agreement, be implementable and usher in lasting peace. In view of these uncertainties and the plan’s fundamental flaws, Pakistan must exercise caution and not rush in to offer troops for the stabilisation force without being sure it doesn’t get dragged into Middle East turmoil, or become an unwitting accessory to Israeli occupation of Palestine. The tragic truth is that the Trump plan reflects raw US power calculus. It seeks to bury the Palestinians’ rightful struggle for their stolen homeland. Mushahid Hussain Sayed Chairman of the Pakistan-China Institute and the Pakistan-Africa Institute for Development and Research (PAIDAR) The timing of the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) is important, as it was signed in the context of escalating Israeli aggression, with the most recent attack on Qatar, the sixth Muslim-majority nation to fall victim to Israel’s targeted strikes. The US has failed to protect its Muslim allies in the Gulf, although it has military bases in the area — as also evidenced by the 2019 Saudi oil facility attack. Pakistan’s ability to successfully defend itself and defeat Indian aggression in May 2025 has enhanced its regional image and military credibility. The agreement is a continuation of Pakistan’s history of providing security assistance, including the combat missions of Pakistan Air Force in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and the security services provided during the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. The SMDA is of much significance as it is the first defence pact between two brotherly Muslim countries. Therefore, it is a “plus” for Pakistan’s key role in Middle East security. It sees Pakistan return to the Middle East as a net security provider after almost five decades. The formalisation of the SMDA can be attributed to primarily two decision-makers: Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This historic defence agreement recalls the close camaraderie between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia since the Lahore Islamic Summit of 1974, which Saudi Arabia and Pakistan jointly hosted. The agreement has been welcomed all over the Muslim world, Egypt and Iran included, as a demonstration of Islamic solidarity, with the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian crediting it as a “step towards a comprehensive regional security system with the cooperation of Muslim states.” The SMDA enhances inter-Muslim military collaboration and weakens the Indo-Israeli military axis. It demolishes the Biden-Modi strategy of the India-Israel-Middle East Corridor (IMEC), which Biden and Modi announced during the G20 summit in Delhi in September 2023, thus burying the IMEC under the debris of the Gaza genocide and, now, the sands of Arabia. This agreement creates a new template of regional security, which combines the military power of Pakistan and the economic power of Saudi Arabia. It makes Pakistan a major Muslim middle power and its military capabilities and influence in diplomacy are now evident in the world’s most strategic region. This agreement is a recognition of the respect and credibility of the Pakistan military’s professionalism and prowess, and capability to deliver, both for the homeland, as well as regional friends. It shows that, in the changing geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, with declining Western credibility in the aftermath of Israel’s Gaza genocide, regional countries are now looking at new strategic security options within the Muslim world. Pakistan is also a frontline candidate for any serious initiative for sending peacekeeping forces into Gaza, after a potential ceasefire, as a major Muslim country that is also a member of the UN Security Council and a key, longstanding contributor to UN peacekeeping missions through the past several decades. But any country seeking a peacekeeping role in Gaza must meet the following criteria: 1) It should preferably be a non-Arab Muslim country; 2) It must enjoy credibility among Palestinians; and 3) It should have the confidence of the international community. Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry Former ambassador and foreign secretary of Pakistan, and current chairman of the Sanober Institute, Islamabad The signing of the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) on September 17, 2025 is an unprecedented upgrade in bilateral relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The two countries have always maintained cordial relations, including substantial defence and security cooperation dating back to the 1970s. Pursuant to a 1982 protocol, Pakistan’s forces have also engaged with the Saudis in training and advisory roles. What distinguishes the SMDA from all previous cooperative endeavours is the provision that foreign aggression against one will be treated as aggression against both. This provides formidable strategic depth to Pakistan against possible aggression from India, and to Saudi Arabia against potential aggression from Israel. The agreement, thus, is a win-win for both countries and for the region. Much of the details of the agreement are yet to be worked out. However, it appears that the agreement would be mainly operationalised in peace-time through sharing of intelligence and information, trainings and joint exercises, the exchange of expertise, boosting each other’s conventional defence capabilities, access to each other’s technological base, and possible cooperation in defence procurements and manufacturing. This multifaceted engagement would enhance the deterrence regime of both countries. Seen in this context, the SMDA can provide the much-needed stabilising effect for a region that has lately witnessed incessant violence and wars. The concern that the agreement might pitch Pakistan against Israel and Saudi Arabia against India is not valid, as the agreement is essentially defensive in nature. Likewise, any apprehensions about Pakistani nuclear weapons being transferred to Saudi Arabia are totally misplaced, as the primary motive for Pakistan’s nuclear capability is to deter India’s aggressive designs against Pakistan. The chatter of this agreement becoming a forebearer of a Muslim military bloc is also not realistic, given the diversity of the Muslim world. It is noteworthy that neither the US nor China have expressed any reservations on this agreement thus far. Iran has also welcomed the development, as it is likely to help bring in peace and stability to the region. On September 29, 2025, President Donald Trump announced his 20-point plan to secure an end to the war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in the past two years. The leadership of Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and the UAE, as well as Israel and the Palestinian Authority, have welcomed the plan as it would help end the war in Gaza. If a ceasefire comes into force, doors will open for unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to flow in and the reconstruction of Gaza. Israel has also committed to a phased withdrawal from Gaza. The plan does not envisage any role for Hamas in the future governance of Gaza, which will be the responsibility of a technocratic, apolitical committee made up of Palestinians and international experts to be overseen by a ‘Board of Peace’ led by Trump himself. It appears that, under the circumstances, the Trump peace plan is the best available option to prevent further bloodshed in Gaza. It meets a key demand of the Arab countries that the Palestinians would not be displaced from their lands and the West Bank would not be annexed. Israel would also have to give up its controversial intent to create a ‘Greater Israel’, at least for now. However, it is not yet clear whether the US and Israel would recognise the state of Palestine. Unless that happens, there might not be any forward movement towards expanding the Abraham Accords, a stated goal of the Trump administration. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has rightly remarked on X that the implementation of the two-state solution is “essential” to ensure lasting peace in the region. US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a press conference on September 29 discussing the Gaza ‘peace plan’ |  AFP Nasim Zehra Author and journalist Historically, Islamabad’s major partnerships, with the US, China and Saudi Arabia, began with security ties before economic or diplomatic links followed. That history came full circle when Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA). For Pakistan, this is a strategic leap. It reclaims the country’s earlier high-profile role in Middle Eastern security. Early signs are promising — Qatar, Egypt and Turkey are already exploring similar agreements with Islamabad. For Saudi Arabia, the benefits are equally clear. It diversifies security partnerships, no longer relying solely on the US. This time, Riyadh’s partner is a nuclear-armed Pakistan with proven strategic capabilities. Pakistan‘s comprehensive re-entry into the Middle East security zone is significant within the context of the changing global and regional environment — especially in the aftermath of the Middle East ‘peace plan’ proposed by US President Donald Trump. While there are questions about Pakistan contributing its forces to the international peacekeeping force given in the plan for Gaza, Pakistan is now finding a highchair for itself within the diplomatic realm at many important regional and international forums. While what policy Pakistan finally formulates on what is an already controversial ‘peace plan’ will be important for its credibility within the Muslim world, Pakistan has a place amongst the states engaged with Trump on the proposed plan. Hard power is central to global politics, and Pakistan has emerged as both militarily formidable and diplomatically credible. But the SMDA also raises pressing questions. One: will Pakistan provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella? Given Islamabad’s doctrine of ‘offensive defence’ and Israel’s repeated aggression, the answer is a likely yes. But for now, given strategic sensitivities, it is one that won’t get a clear answer from either party. Two: does this replace US-Saudi defence ties? No. It supplements them, giving Riyadh more options while retaining American backing. Three: could this be the seed of a regional military alliance with Pakistan at the core? Quite possibly. The region’s threat environment makes it more than likely. Four: did Washington approve? Both Riyadh and Islamabad seem to have kept Washington, Tehran and Beijing informed. Five: What will be China’s role? While not yet formalised, it will be hard to ignore. With deep ties to both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and China’s cutting-edge defence technology, Beijing is well-positioned to become a partner in this evolving security arrangement. As for the Gaza plan on the other hand, Palestinians, ceaselessly guillotined by Israel, are promised humanitarian aid and a battered semblance of statehood under the Trump plan. Crucially, this ‘state’ would not emerge under binding UN resolutions but only as Trump and Netanyahu dictate. The plan hands Israel veto power over every future step toward Palestinian statehood — rewarding Netanyahu while absolving him of responsibility for genocide and starvation. Despite Palestinian courage and self-belief, the absence of strong allies — hesitant Arab states, distant Muslim friends and China’s calculated reticence — enabled this outcome. Fear and pragmatism on one side, and Israel’s bullying on the other, underwritten by Washington, ensured that no alternative plan survived. All other ceasefire efforts were bullied out of the fray. Trump now brands his proposal an “eternal peace plan”, though, in reality, it reads as an eternal victory plan for Israel: entrenching Zionist ambitions, rejecting UN resolutions, disarming Hamas, legitimising indefinite Israel Defence Force (IDF) presence and staying silent on illegal settlements. It borders on a surrender document. Gaza itself is to be placed in the hands of Trump and former UK PM Tony Blair — the Iraq war criminal. Significantly, during the meeting with Trump in New York, Arab-Muslim leaders, though critical, could offer no alternative to Blair. The tragic truth is that the Trump plan reflects raw US power calculus. It seeks to bury the Palestinians’ rightful struggle for their stolen homeland. Yet, the Palestinians’ heroic resistance in the face of the genocidal onslaught in Gaza proves that the Palestinian spirit will endure — long after the games of statist politics fade and long after their enemies imagine they have silenced it. Zahid Hussain Author and journalist The latest 20-point Gaza plan is nothing more than a document of surrender for the Palestinian resistance against a brutal occupation. The Israeli genocidal war in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and has devastated the entire enclave. Given Israel’s bellicosity, the prospect of any ceasefire deal remains remote. The Israeli prime minister’s speech at the UN General Assembly session shows no flexibility in Tel Aviv’s hard-line position. Although Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, appears highly optimistic of a ceasefire deal, there is still no convergence of views over the long-term solution to the crisis that threatens the entire region. America’s plan for Palestine, which is said to be broadly supported by regional leaders, is similar to that of the plan for a Palestine state set out in the New York declaration endorsed by the UN general assembly a week earlier. It calls for an immediate ceasefire by Israeli forces, release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas and withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territory. It has also presented a plan for a future administration in Gaza, minus Hamas. The US plan was apparently presented during the meeting between President Trump and leaders of eight Muslim and Arab countries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th session, which envisages a two-state solution of the Palestinian crisis. The US plan was tacitly approved by the Muslim leaders, but it seems highly improbable that it will be implemented, as Israel has rejected the establishment of a Palestinian state and leaving its control over Gaza. The development of an International Stabilisation Force (for maintaining law and order, and for providing support to newly formed Palestinian police forces in Gaza) to be deployed in Gaza would comprise troops from various Muslim countries. According to some reports, the main bulk of the troops would come from Indonesia and Pakistan, the two largest Muslim-majority nations. It may be the reason for Trump’s adulation of Pakistan’s prime minister and army chief. It is evident that Pakistan was taken into confidence on the plan by Trump. Soon after Trump’s statement that he would not allow Israel’s annexation of the occupied West Bank, an Israeli ultra-right cabinet minister declared that the process of annexation will not be stopped. Israel’s military actions against other Arab countries have made peace extremely difficult. Meanwhile, the mutual defence treaty signed between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan last month reflects the changing security dynamics in the Middle East, caused by Israel’s military escalation that threatens regional security. Not only has the Zionist state continued its genocidal war in Gaza, but it has also launched military strikes in half-a-dozen Arab countries. The most recent air strike was in Qatar, which houses the largest US military base in the regional countries. Most Gulf and Arab countries have been depending on US security guarantees — America has 19 military bases in the region — but the unqualified support for Israeli aggression by the Trump administration has compelled these countries to think about an alternative defence arrangement. America’s refusal to condemn Israel for its unprovoked attack on one of the strongest US allies in the region has reinforced the sense of insecurity among these countries. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have a long history of defence cooperation that goes back to the 1960s. Pakistan has some 20,000 troops already based in the Kingdom, for internal and external security. Pakistan has also been providing training to Saudi military officers. The latest pact has formalised the security cooperation. The details of the agreement are not available, but the most significant clause is that an attack on any of the two countries would be considered aggression against both. The pact has cemented the existing defence cooperation between the two countries. However, it’s too early to say that other Gulf countries will join this treaty. Ejaz Haider Author and journalist The Pak-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) has no text that can be flyspecked and analysed. Most commentary has flowed from the joint statement, focusing on the qualifier “strategic” and the unambiguous declaration that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both [emphasis added].” The commentary has elicited two types of responses: hyperbole and scepticism. Hyperbole about how significant it is and how it changes the rules of the game in the region and beyond (a Bloomberg analysis called it “the first concrete indication of what a post-American world might look like”) and scepticism over what it means and how much it encompasses. I believe that the text might not be available anytime soon or, if and when it is made available, would contain only some general clauses. This is because the two sides could either want to keep certain specific provisions under wraps (I’ll just come to that) or use this more for the purpose of signalling and manipulating perceptions than identifying specific areas of cooperation. Some comments have likened it to Article 5 of the Nato charter. This is convenient but lazy. Article 5 is not wedded to automaticity. Also, the line about mutual defence is cloaked in greater certitude than Nato’s collective defence clause. Once again, we don’t have the fine print, but it would be safe to say that there’s more assuredness here in words than there’s likely to be in action. The term “strategic” combined with “joint deterrence” in the statement has brought into the picture “extended deterrence”, which is a technical term for a nuclear umbrella. This flies in the face of Pakistan’s traditional nuclear policy and needs to be clarified. The timing is important, coming as it did eight days after the illegal Zionist strike at a house in Doha and two days after the extraordinary joint session between the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The strike showed the hollowness of United States security guarantees to its Gulf partners, at least if such a strike were conducted by the Zionist entity, and the lacklustre response by the extraordinary session to the idea of a multilateral security arrangement. Saudi analysts say that Riyadh decided to expedite the formalisation of the agreement for these two reasons. While Riyadh has long sought external security guarantees, including from the US, the region has become more volatile and, at the very least, it would want to hedge its bets. From the US perspective, if such an agreement leads to burden-sharing and is not inimical to US interests, it might even be welcome. This brings us to another development, which increasingly seems to have some connection to the SMDA: US President Donald Trump’s so-called Gaza Plan. Among other provisions of the plan, which is largely unworkable, is a peacekeeping force drawn from Arab/Muslim countries. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stated on X that it is in line with Pakistan’s official policy. He is wrong. My suspicion is that meetings at the White House were about Pakistan’s acceptance of this plan, which again seeks to prescind the Palestinians. Interestingly, in 2020, Sharif had tweeted to say that Palestinians were right to tear up the then Trump plan. Pakistan’s endorsement of a plan rejected by Gazans lands us in a treacherous terrain that hasn’t been mapped out. One can go line by line to identify the perfidy built into the plan, but that is outside the scope of this brief. Corollary: the government must begin a debate in parliament on both the SMDA and the Trump plan, to rid the policy of its opacity and avoid leading the country into a morass. Or worse, by doing so, make Pakistan complicit in the US-Zionist genocide.

      "summary_en": "Maleeha Lodhi Former ambassador of Pakistan to the US, UK and the UN The Pakistan-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) is emblematic of changing geostrategic dynamics and shifting alignments that are reshaping the regional landscape, and can contribute to the emergence of a new security architecture in the Middle East. It has been forged in the backdrop of unprecedented volatility and violence in the region, with Israel’s two-year genocidal war having claimed over 65,000 Palestinian lives and wrought massive devastation and an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Israel’s attack on Qatar [on September 9] shook the entire region. It was the sixth country to face Israeli military aggression but the first Gulf state, and also a non-Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) ally of the US. This intensified growing doubts about the value and reliability of the American defence umbrella with the US unable or unwilling to restrain an unbound Israel. The SMDA is a consequence of the eroding trust of regional states in an unpredictable US, whose blind support for Israel has heightened the security threat they face. Negotiations for the security agreement took place months before the strike on Qatar. But the timing of its signing suggests the attack on Qatar and Israel’s unchecked aggression hastened its finalisation, with Riyadh seeking to diversify its security partnerships and Pakistan expanding its options. Under the deal, both countries would consider an attack on one as “an aggression against both.” Details of the pact are not yet public, but it could shift the regional balance of power. It reflects a hedging strategy by Riyadh in turning to Pakistan for “joint deterrence against any aggression.” There has been much discussion about whether this has a nuclear dimension and involves extended deterrence. Pakistan has preferred to maintain strategic ambiguity, to give itself flexibility. Saudi officials, however, are cited as saying, “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.” Eos asked six foreign policy experts for their initial assessments of the recent Pak-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) and Pakistan’s potential role in US President Donald Trump’s proposed plan for Gaza. Their analyses of these developments are presented below… While the deal may bring Pakistan much-needed financial assistance to help its fragile economy, there are also real risks for Islamabad. The pact injects Pakistan into a volatile region and may involve commitments that may be difficult to fulfil if it is expected to become a net security provider to the region. These risks have to be mitigated if Pakistan is to avoid overextending itself, given its own internal and external security challenges. Other risks and challenges may also emerge if Pakistan is asked by Washington to be part of a mostly Muslim multinational security force envisaged for Gaza under US President Donald Trump’s ‘peace plan .’ Trump shared his Gaza proposals with Pakistan and seven other Muslim countries in a meeting in New York, but what was announced was different from what was agreed between them. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had intervened to change many elements of the plan. The announced plan is vague and has no timeline on withdrawal. It has no guarantee of a complete Israel pullout from Gaza. It also doesn’t guarantee a permanent ceasefire. It says nothing about a Palestinian state or two-state solution and only talks vaguely about a pathway to statehood after the Palestinian Authority has carried out major reforms. It seeks to install a transitional authority headed by Trump and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair . This has already provoked controversy and been likened to Iraqi-style direct occupation. Without a deal between Israel and Hamas, the plan can’t take off. The plan has also been framed without consulting the Palestinians. It advantages Israel, which is why many Palestinians see it as a document of surrender. And it is why Netanyahu said at the joint press conference that Israel’s war aims are achieved by the plan: for Hamas to be disarmed, Gaza demilitarised and no future Palestinian state to be established. Despite the cautious welcome the plan has received from across the world, doubts are intensifying whether it will lead to an agreement, be implementable and usher in lasting peace. In view of these uncertainties and the plan’s fundamental flaws, Pakistan must exercise caution and not rush in to offer troops for the stabilisation force without being sure it doesn’t get dragged into Middle East turmoil, or become an unwitting accessory to Israeli occupation of Palestine. The tragic truth is that the Trump plan reflects raw US power calculus. It seeks to bury the Palestinians’ rightful struggle for their stolen homeland. Mushahid Hussain Sayed Chairman of the Pakistan-China Institute and the Pakistan-Africa Institute for Development and Research (PAIDAR) The timing of the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) is important, as it was signed in the context of escalating Israeli aggression, with the most recent attack on Qatar, the sixth Muslim-majority nation to fall victim to Israel’s targeted strikes. The US has failed to protect its Muslim allies in the Gulf, although it has military bases in the area — as also evidenced by the 2019 Saudi oil facility attack. Pakistan’s ability to successfully defend itself and defeat Indian aggression in May 2025 has enhanced its regional image and military credibility. The agreement is a continuation of Pakistan’s history of providing security assistance, including the combat missions of Pakistan Air Force in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and the security services provided during the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar.

Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have a long history of defence cooperation that goes back to the 1960s. Pakistan has some 20,000 troops already based in the Kingdom, for internal and external security. Pakistan has also been providing training to Saudi military officers. The latest pact has formalised the security cooperation. The details of the agreement are not available, but the most significant clause is that an attack on any of the two countries would be considered aggression against both. The pact has cemented the existing defence cooperation between the two countries. However, it’s too early to say that other Gulf countries will join this treaty. Ejaz Haider Author and journalist The Pak-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) has no text that can be flyspecked and analysed. Most commentary has flowed from the joint statement, focusing on the qualifier “strategic” and the unambiguous declaration that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both [emphasis added].” The commentary has elicited two types of responses: hyperbole and scepticism. Hyperbole about how significant it is and how it changes the rules of the game in the region and beyond (a Bloomberg analysis called it “the first concrete indication of what a post-American world might look like”) and scepticism over what it means and how much it encompasses. I believe that the text might not be available anytime soon or, if and when it is made available, would contain only some general clauses. This is because the two sides could either want to keep certain specific provisions under wraps (I’ll just come to that) or use this more for the purpose of signalling and manipulating perceptions than identifying specific areas of cooperation. Some comments have likened it to Article 5 of the Nato charter. This is convenient but lazy. Article 5 is not wedded to automaticity. Also, the line about mutual defence is cloaked in greater certitude than Nato’s collective defence clause. Once again, we don’t have the fine print, but it would be safe to say that there’s more assuredness here in words than there’s likely to be in action. The term “strategic” combined with “joint deterrence” in the statement has brought into the picture “extended deterrence”, which is a technical term for a nuclear umbrella. This flies in the face of Pakistan’s traditional nuclear policy and needs to be clarified. The timing is important, coming as it did eight days after the illegal Zionist strike at a house in Doha and two days after the extraordinary joint session between the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The strike showed the hollowness of United States security guarantees to its Gulf partners, at least if such a strike were conducted by the Zionist entity, and the lacklustre response by the extraordinary session to the idea of a multilateral security arrangement. Saudi analysts say that Riyadh decided to expedite the formalisation of the agreement for these two reasons. While Riyadh has long sought external security guarantees, including from the US, the region has become more volatile and, at the very least, it would want to hedge its bets. From the US perspective, if such an agreement leads to burden-sharing and is not inimical to US interests, it might even be welcome. This brings us to another development, which increasingly seems to have some connection to the SMDA: US President Donald Trump’s so-called Gaza Plan. Among other provisions of the plan, which is largely unworkable, is a peacekeeping force drawn from Arab/Muslim countries. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stated on X that it is in line with Pakistan’s official policy. He is wrong. My suspicion is that meetings at the White House were about Pakistan’s acceptance of this plan, which again seeks to prescind the Palestinians. Interestingly, in 2020, Sharif had tweeted to say that Palestinians were right to tear up the then Trump plan. Pakistan’s endorsement of a plan rejected by Gazans lands us in a treacherous terrain that hasn’t been mapped out. One can go line by line to identify the perfidy built into the plan, but that is outside the scope of this brief. Corollary: the government must begin a debate in parliament on both the SMDA and the Trump plan, to rid the policy of its opacity and avoid leading the country into a morass. Or worse, by doing so, make Pakistan complicit in the US-Zionist genocide.

      "title": "PAKISTANI DIPLOMACY’S MOMENT IN THE SUN?",
      "summary": "Maleeha Lodhi Former ambassador of Pakistan to the US, UK and the UN The Pakistan-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) is emblematic of changing geostrategic dynamics and shifting alignments that are reshaping the regional landscape, and can contribute to the emergence of a new security architecture in the Middle East. It has been forged in the backdrop of unprecedented volatility and violence in the region, with Israel’s two-year genocidal war having claimed over 65,000 Palestinian lives and wrought massive devastation and an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Israel’s attack on Qatar [on September 9] shook the entire region. It was the sixth country to face Israeli military aggression but the first Gulf state, and also a non-Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) ally of the US. This intensified growing doubts about the value and reliability of the American defence umbrella with the US unable or unwilling to restrain an unbound Israel. The SMDA is a consequence of the eroding trust of regional states in an unpredictable US, whose blind support for Israel has heightened the security threat they face. Negotiations for the security agreement took place months before the strike on Qatar. But the timing of its signing suggests the attack on Qatar and Israel’s unchecked aggression hastened its finalisation, with Riyadh seeking to diversify its security partnerships and Pakistan expanding its options. Under the deal, both countries would consider an attack on one as “an aggression against both.” Details of the pact are not yet public, but it could shift the regional balance of power. It reflects a hedging strategy by Riyadh in turning to Pakistan for “joint deterrence against any aggression.” There has been much discussion about whether this has a nuclear dimension and involves extended deterrence. Pakistan has preferred to maintain strategic ambiguity, to give itself flexibility. Saudi officials, however, are cited as saying, “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.” Eos asked six foreign policy experts for their initial assessments of the recent Pak-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) and Pakistan’s potential role in US President Donald Trump’s proposed plan for Gaza. Their analyses of these developments are presented below… While the deal may bring Pakistan much-needed financial assistance to help its fragile economy, there are also real risks for Islamabad. The pact injects Pakistan into a volatile region and may involve commitments that may be difficult to fulfil if it is expected to become a net security provider to the region. These risks have to be mitigated if Pakistan is to avoid overextending itself, given its own internal and external security challenges. Other risks and challenges may also emerge if Pakistan is asked by Washington to be part of a mostly Muslim multinational security force envisaged for Gaza under US President Donald Trump’s ‘peace plan .’ Trump shared his Gaza proposals with Pakistan and seven other Muslim countries in a meeting in New York, but what was announced was different from what was agreed between them. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had intervened to change many elements of the plan. The announced plan is vague and has no timeline on withdrawal. It has no guarantee of a complete Israel pullout from Gaza. It also doesn’t guarantee a permanent ceasefire. It says nothing about a Palestinian state or two-state solution and only talks vaguely about a pathway to statehood after the Palestinian Authority has carried out major reforms. It seeks to install a transitional authority headed by Trump and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair . This has already provoked controversy and been likened to Iraqi-style direct occupation. Without a deal between Israel and Hamas, the plan can’t take off. The plan has also been framed without consulting the Palestinians. It advantages Israel, which is why many Palestinians see it as a document of surrender. And it is why Netanyahu said at the joint press conference that Israel’s war aims are achieved by the plan: for Hamas to be disarmed, Gaza demilitarised and no future Palestinian state to be established. Despite the cautious welcome the plan has received from across the world, doubts are intensifying whether it will lead to an agreement, be implementable and usher in lasting peace. In view of these uncertainties and the plan’s fundamental flaws, Pakistan must exercise caution and not rush in to offer troops for the stabilisation force without being sure it doesn’t get dragged into Middle East turmoil, or become an unwitting accessory to Israeli occupation of Palestine. The tragic truth is that the Trump plan reflects raw US power calculus. It seeks to bury the Palestinians’ rightful struggle for their stolen homeland. Mushahid Hussain Sayed Chairman of the Pakistan-China Institute and the Pakistan-Africa Institute for Development and Research (PAIDAR) The timing of the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) is important, as it was signed in the context of escalating Israeli aggression, with the most recent attack on Qatar, the sixth Muslim-majority nation to fall victim to Israel’s targeted strikes. The US has failed to protect its Muslim allies in the Gulf, although it has military bases in the area — as also evidenced by the 2019 Saudi oil facility attack. Pakistan’s ability to successfully defend itself and defeat Indian aggression in May 2025 has enhanced its regional image and military credibility. The agreement is a continuation of Pakistan’s history of providing security assistance, including the combat missions of Pakistan Air Force in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and the security services provided during the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. The SMDA is of much significance as it is the first defence pact between two brotherly Muslim countries. Therefore, it is a “plus” for Pakistan’s key role in Middle East security. It sees Pakistan return to the Middle East as a net security provider after almost five decades. The formalisation of the SMDA can be attributed to primarily two decision-makers: Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This historic defence agreement recalls the close camaraderie between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia since the Lahore Islamic Summit of 1974, which Saudi Arabia and Pakistan jointly hosted. The agreement has been welcomed all over the Muslim world, Egypt and Iran included, as a demonstration of Islamic solidarity, with the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian crediting it as a “step towards a comprehensive regional security system with the cooperation of Muslim states.” The SMDA enhances inter-Muslim military collaboration and weakens the Indo-Israeli military axis. It demolishes the Biden-Modi strategy of the India-Israel-Middle East Corridor (IMEC), which Biden and Modi announced during the G20 summit in Delhi in September 2023, thus burying the IMEC under the debris of the Gaza genocide and, now, the sands of Arabia. This agreement creates a new template of regional security, which combines the military power of Pakistan and the economic power of Saudi Arabia. It makes Pakistan a major Muslim middle power and its military capabilities and influence in diplomacy are now evident in the world’s most strategic region. This agreement is a recognition of the respect and credibility of the Pakistan military’s professionalism and prowess, and capability to deliver, both for the homeland, as well as regional friends. It shows that, in the changing geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, with declining Western credibility in the aftermath of Israel’s Gaza genocide, regional countries are now looking at new strategic security options within the Muslim world. Pakistan is also a frontline candidate for any serious initiative for sending peacekeeping forces into Gaza, after a potential ceasefire, as a major Muslim country that is also a member of the UN Security Council and a key, longstanding contributor to UN peacekeeping missions through the past several decades. But any country seeking a peacekeeping role in Gaza must meet the following criteria: 1) It should preferably be a non-Arab Muslim country; 2) It must enjoy credibility among Palestinians; and 3) It should have the confidence of the international community. Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry Former ambassador and foreign secretary of Pakistan, and current chairman of the Sanober Institute, Islamabad The signing of the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) on September 17, 2025 is an unprecedented upgrade in bilateral relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The two countries have always maintained cordial relations, including substantial defence and security cooperation dating back to the 1970s. Pursuant to a 1982 protocol, Pakistan’s forces have also engaged with the Saudis in training and advisory roles. What distinguishes the SMDA from all previous cooperative endeavours is the provision that foreign aggression against one will be treated as aggression against both. This provides formidable strategic depth to Pakistan against possible aggression from India, and to Saudi Arabia against potential aggression from Israel. The agreement, thus, is a win-win for both countries and for the region. Much of the details of the agreement are yet to be worked out. However, it appears that the agreement would be mainly operationalised in peace-time through sharing of intelligence and information, trainings and joint exercises, the exchange of expertise, boosting each other’s conventional defence capabilities, access to each other’s technological base, and possible cooperation in defence procurements and manufacturing. This multifaceted engagement would enhance the deterrence regime of both countries. Seen in this context, the SMDA can provide the much-needed stabilising effect for a region that has lately witnessed incessant violence and wars. The concern that the agreement might pitch Pakistan against Israel and Saudi Arabia against India is not valid, as the agreement is essentially defensive in nature. Likewise, any apprehensions about Pakistani nuclear weapons being transferred to Saudi Arabia are totally misplaced, as the primary motive for Pakistan’s nuclear capability is to deter India’s aggressive designs against Pakistan. The chatter of this agreement becoming a forebearer of a Muslim military bloc is also not realistic, given the diversity of the Muslim world. It is noteworthy that neither the US nor China have expressed any reservations on this agreement thus far. Iran has also welcomed the development, as it is likely to help bring in peace and stability to the region. On September 29, 2025, President Donald Trump announced his 20-point plan to secure an end to the war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in the past two years. The leadership of Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and the UAE, as well as Israel and the Palestinian Authority, have welcomed the plan as it would help end the war in Gaza. If a ceasefire comes into force, doors will open for unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to flow in and the reconstruction of Gaza. Israel has also committed to a phased withdrawal from Gaza. The plan does not envisage any role for Hamas in the future governance of Gaza, which will be the responsibility of a technocratic, apolitical committee made up of Palestinians and international experts to be overseen by a ‘Board of Peace’ led by Trump himself. It appears that, under the circumstances, the Trump peace plan is the best available option to prevent further bloodshed in Gaza. It meets a key demand of the Arab countries that the Palestinians would not be displaced from their lands and the West Bank would not be annexed. Israel would also have to give up its controversial intent to create a ‘Greater Israel’, at least for now. However, it is not yet clear whether the US and Israel would recognise the state of Palestine. Unless that happens, there might not be any forward movement towards expanding the Abraham Accords, a stated goal of the Trump administration. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has rightly remarked on X that the implementation of the two-state solution is “essential” to ensure lasting peace in the region. US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a press conference on September 29 discussing the Gaza ‘peace plan’ |  AFP Nasim Zehra Author and journalist Historically, Islamabad’s major partnerships, with the US, China and Saudi Arabia, began with security ties before economic or diplomatic links followed. That history came full circle when Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA). For Pakistan, this is a strategic leap. It reclaims the country’s earlier high-profile role in Middle Eastern security. Early signs are promising — Qatar, Egypt and Turkey are already exploring similar agreements with Islamabad. For Saudi Arabia, the benefits are equally clear. It diversifies security partnerships, no longer relying solely on the US. This time, Riyadh’s partner is a nuclear-armed Pakistan with proven strategic capabilities. Pakistan‘s comprehensive re-entry into the Middle East security zone is significant within the context of the changing global and regional environment — especially in the aftermath of the Middle East ‘peace plan’ proposed by US President Donald Trump. While there are questions about Pakistan contributing its forces to the international peacekeeping force given in the plan for Gaza, Pakistan is now finding a highchair for itself within the diplomatic realm at many important regional and international forums. While what policy Pakistan finally formulates on what is an already controversial ‘peace plan’ will be important for its credibility within the Muslim world, Pakistan has a place amongst the states engaged with Trump on the proposed plan. Hard power is central to global politics, and Pakistan has emerged as both militarily formidable and diplomatically credible. But the SMDA also raises pressing questions. One: will Pakistan provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella? Given Islamabad’s doctrine of ‘offensive defence’ and Israel’s repeated aggression, the answer is a likely yes. But for now, given strategic sensitivities, it is one that won’t get a clear answer from either party. Two: does this replace US-Saudi defence ties? No. It supplements them, giving Riyadh more options while retaining American backing. Three: could this be the seed of a regional military alliance with Pakistan at the core? Quite possibly. The region’s threat environment makes it more than likely. Four: did Washington approve? Both Riyadh and Islamabad seem to have kept Washington, Tehran and Beijing informed. Five: What will be China’s role? While not yet formalised, it will be hard to ignore. With deep ties to both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and China’s cutting-edge defence technology, Beijing is well-positioned to become a partner in this evolving security arrangement. As for the Gaza plan on the other hand, Palestinians, ceaselessly guillotined by Israel, are promised humanitarian aid and a battered semblance of statehood under the Trump plan. Crucially, this ‘state’ would not emerge under binding UN resolutions but only as Trump and Netanyahu dictate. The plan hands Israel veto power over every future step toward Palestinian statehood — rewarding Netanyahu while absolving him of responsibility for genocide and starvation. Despite Palestinian courage and self-belief, the absence of strong allies — hesitant Arab states, distant Muslim friends and China’s calculated reticence — enabled this outcome. Fear and pragmatism on one side, and Israel’s bullying on the other, underwritten by Washington, ensured that no alternative plan survived. All other ceasefire efforts were bullied out of the fray. Trump now brands his proposal an “eternal peace plan”, though, in reality, it reads as an eternal victory plan for Israel: entrenching Zionist ambitions, rejecting UN resolutions, disarming Hamas, legitimising indefinite Israel Defence Force (IDF) presence and staying silent on illegal settlements. It borders on a surrender document. Gaza itself is to be placed in the hands of Trump and former UK PM Tony Blair — the Iraq war criminal. Significantly, during the meeting with Trump in New York, Arab-Muslim leaders, though critical, could offer no alternative to Blair. The tragic truth is that the Trump plan reflects raw US power calculus. It seeks to bury the Palestinians’ rightful struggle for their stolen homeland. Yet, the Palestinians’ heroic resistance in the face of the genocidal onslaught in Gaza proves that the Palestinian spirit will endure — long after the games of statist politics fade and long after their enemies imagine they have silenced it. Zahid Hussain Author and journalist The latest 20-point Gaza plan is nothing more than a document of surrender for the Palestinian resistance against a brutal occupation. The Israeli genocidal war in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and has devastated the entire enclave. Given Israel’s bellicosity, the prospect of any ceasefire deal remains remote. The Israeli prime minister’s speech at the UN General Assembly session shows no flexibility in Tel Aviv’s hard-line position. Although Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, appears highly optimistic of a ceasefire deal, there is still no convergence of views over the long-term solution to the crisis that threatens the entire region. America’s plan for Palestine, which is said to be broadly supported by regional leaders, is similar to that of the plan for a Palestine state set out in the New York declaration endorsed by the UN general assembly a week earlier. It calls for an immediate ceasefire by Israeli forces, release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas and withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territory. It has also presented a plan for a future administration in Gaza, minus Hamas. The US plan was apparently presented during the meeting between President Trump and leaders of eight Muslim and Arab countries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th session, which envisages a two-state solution of the Palestinian crisis. The US plan was tacitly approved by the Muslim leaders, but it seems highly improbable that it will be implemented, as Israel has rejected the establishment of a Palestinian state and leaving its control over Gaza. The development of an International Stabilisation Force (for maintaining law and order, and for providing support to newly formed Palestinian police forces in Gaza) to be deployed in Gaza would comprise troops from various Muslim countries. According to some reports, the main bulk of the troops would come from Indonesia and Pakistan, the two largest Muslim-majority nations. It may be the reason for Trump’s adulation of Pakistan’s prime minister and army chief. It is evident that Pakistan was taken into confidence on the plan by Trump. Soon after Trump’s statement that he would not allow Israel’s annexation of the occupied West Bank, an Israeli ultra-right cabinet minister declared that the process of annexation will not be stopped. Israel’s military actions against other Arab countries have made peace extremely difficult. Meanwhile, the mutual defence treaty signed between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan last month reflects the changing security dynamics in the Middle East, caused by Israel’s military escalation that threatens regional security. Not only has the Zionist state continued its genocidal war in Gaza, but it has also launched military strikes in half-a-dozen Arab countries. The most recent air strike was in Qatar, which houses the largest US military base in the regional countries. Most Gulf and Arab countries have been depending on US security guarantees — America has 19 military bases in the region — but the unqualified support for Israeli aggression by the Trump administration has compelled these countries to think about an alternative defence arrangement. America’s refusal to condemn Israel for its unprovoked attack on one of the strongest US allies in the region has reinforced the sense of insecurity among these countries.

The members of the committee will forward their suggestions for preparing a charter of demands against the police action on the press club, so that no such act takes place in future. Meanwhile, the acting president NPC said that they were discussing the situation with other press clubs and with their coordination a strategy will be devised. “The most important point is that we do not want any such action at any press club anywhere in the country,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "THERE is so much spin, so much deceit, so many lies that one can’t be blamed for not believing anyone — anyone in a position of power and authority — while the genocide continues in Gaza, with Israel enjoying the impunity it has had for as long as one can remember. Hamas may have accepted some of the terms set forth for a ceasefire but uncertainty remains regarding further developments. US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has called for an end to the Israeli bombing — just days ahead of the Nobel Peace Prize announcement. Rewind to a few days earlier when Trump announced the Gaza peace plan and said he’d agreed with eight leaders of the Muslim world. When he made public the details, murmurs of discontent started among some of these states that had agreed to the draft. The deceit was laid bare. Qatar and Pakistan said more or less publicly that this wasn’t really what was agreed to. And that they were unhappy with what was announced. However, it was also leaked to the media that Qatar would continue to insist in private to the US that some sections of the original draft be restored, while lauding it in public. (All eight governments endorsed the deal in a joint statement.) It then emerged that the agreed draft was ‘edited’, in effect mutilated, by Israel’s psychopathic prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, during the six hours he spent ‘negotiating’ with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — both seen as personal friends of Netanyahu and the apartheid state, and both of whom have often backtracked on their positions to harmonise it with Israel’s. Of the nearly 500 activists that set sail to deliver essential supplies to Gaza, only 30pc were Muslims. These changes were made with the twin purpose of enabling Netanyahu to claim victory at home in order to appease his far-right coalition partners, namely Ben Gvir and Smotrich — both evil incarnate like himself. At the same time, it was aimed at making it very difficult for Hamas to accept it because it excluded key Israeli Occupation Forces timelines for withdrawal, and dramatically cut the number of Palestinian hostages to be swapped for Israelis in Hamas captivity. It also excluded Palestinians from a top role in governance. Bizarrely, the great and the good of the Muslim world — those with trillions of dollars in their sovereign wealth funds invested in the US; a Nato member boasting immense military power; another with a military powerful enough to have retaken territory lost to the apartheid state; and a nuclear-armed ummah state — were so helpless that three of them — Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye — were said to have put pressure on Hamas to accept the plan. That may have been why Hamas conditionally accepted it — or perhaps it had reasons of its own. When the discontent among his key Gulf, Nato and newfound South Asian allies became apparent, it was leaked to the media that Trump was so unhappy with Netanyahu, as the negotiations proceeded, that he told him: “Take the deal or leave it. And if you leave it, we’ll walk away from you.” Now, in the AIPAC-bought controlled political space in the US and the AIPAC-steered decision-making, if anyone wants you or me to believe for a moment that a US president, who has received hundreds of millions of dollars from supporters of the apartheid state had the leeway to ‘walk away’ from Israel, then you’d believe and so would I that this columnist is wealthier than Elon Musk. This was one window to the world of lies we live in, and another is the one which tells us that Canada, France, Australia and the UK have ‘recognised the State of Palestine’. Their key Middle East ally Israel says there will never be a Palestinian state, so what they recognise is immaterial. These democratic Western powers have time and again called for an end to the Gaza genocide and have, of late, taken to calling it abhorrent and unconscionable, but will not impose sanctions to force Israel to alter its conduct. For, that would mean putting their money where their mouth is and hurting the apartheid state. These are the Western nations whose governments are still paying lip service to the Palestinian cause but whose people have taken to the streets in their millions to say enough is enough; they are calling for a boycott and blockade, of the apartheid state. From the UK to Spain, from Belgium to Italy to Germany where police brutality, reminiscent of the SS of an era long gone is trying hard but failing to suppress the protest — it seems that all, from the Greens to the conservatives, have decided that the Palestinians have to atone for the sins of Nazi Germany, Holocaust being the worst. Almost as if to say one genocide has to pay for another. Despite the fact that many governments in the Muslim world take unkindly to street protest, thousands of young Moroccans are out in the streets, battling the police to question their pro-Israel monarch’s polices. Turkiye has seen demonstrations too. But then there is the other view. The humanitarian flotilla, with nearly 500 activists from around the world trying to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza and deliver baby food, milk, diapers and women’s sanitary supplies and more, was intercepted by the apartheid state’s forces. Many of the activists were kidnapped by the Israeli Occupation Forces from beyond occupied Palestine’s territorial waters. Of these activists, a mere 30 per cent belong to Muslim countries. The rest belong to countries and societies and cultures that many among us in Muslim states feel so superior to. Tens of thousands are still pouring into the streets in Madrid, Rome, Brussels, Mexico City, Bogotá … the list is endless. Many of us in the Muslim world are like our governments — docile and scared and unwilling to annoy the US — while many people in the much-derided West have taken to the streets, challenging their governments to do more. Here is hoping their humanity triumphs, for there lies hope. The writer is a former editor of Dawn. abbas.nasir@hotmail.com Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "IT was clear that the government would eventually accept the demands of protesters in Azad Kashmir, and re-initiate talks with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) after the loss of lives and economic and infrastructural damage. It remains to be seen when and if the promises are fulfilled. Had the government made good progress on earlier demands, the region might have been spared the recent tumult. In fact, the pattern so far shows that the government, in other parts of the country too, engages in negotiations with protesters merely to pacify the immediate situation, rather than look for permanent solutions to honour its commitments. In some cases, voices of protest fall on deaf ears. For instance, just days before the JAAC protest, the families of Baloch missing persons once again ended their sit-in and returned from the federal capital. The peaceful families of the missing persons were not fortunate enough to receive even minimal attention from state institutions. One must move beyond dealing with such situations through force, temporary negotiations and eventual disregard for the demands once ‘normalcy’ is restored. This modus operandi is a relic of colonial times. Many Commonwealth states inherited this pattern, but Pakistan is among the few that appear to have stuck to the old line, without distinction or reform. Regrettably, this is the approach the government took when the JAAC launched its protest this time and earlier in Azad Kashmir. There have been many protest movements in the country, including the Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Action Committee, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement, the Haq Do Tehreek in Gwadar, the Sindhu Bachao Tehreek, and the Baloch Yakjehti Committee. Their demand has been simple: constitutional, economic and political rights, and most importantly, the right to live with dignity. What is common to all such rights movements is that they are essentially anti-elite and challenge entrenched political and economic privileges. The state, however, responds with force against dissent. The issue of elite capture has come to dominate rights struggles. Protest can also be seen from a global perspective and applied locally. What took place in Sri Lanka , Bangladesh and Nepal were anti-elite protests that were confronted by state repression. We have seen similar disaffection with elite privileges here as well, its most recent iteration being in AJK. Yet the authorities in Pakistan, like those in India, have an advantage: the country’s ethnic, racial and religious diversity ensures that movements in the peripheries seldom capture the attention of the mainstream public discourse. The state tends to exploits this by ensuring that such movements remain disconnected from one another and do not reach the heartlands or urban centres where public opinion truly matters. The recent incident at the National Press Club in Islamabad, where police brutally beat Kashmiri protesters, stormed the premises, and tortured journalists, is part of this same tactic: keeping rights movements, especially peripheral ones, away from the mainstream. The government and state elements not only deploys strong-armed measures but also manipulates narratives on both mainstream and social media. News is censored, and smear campaigns are launched against these movements, which are termed as foreign-funded conspiracies. Half-page advertisements in the national media and TV screenings by the information ministry have recently been ‘warning’ that a new war is being fought in our minds. They are, in fact, a reflection of the state’s own mindset regarding justifiable dissent, which it reframes by overplaying the theory of hybrid warfare. Dissenters are tagged as foreign agents and include NGOs, freelancers and media persons who ask critical questions. The public is warned not to share secret information with anyone. It is not certain what kind of sensitive information an ordinary citizen in the country can possess. However, the authorities insist it is a part of narrative warfare and try to create a barrier between areas where the protests take place and the rest of the country. The recent protests can be seen as a continuation of a rights struggle that began several years ago. The protests were directly linked to promises the state made to the protesters in 2023, pledges that have remained unfulfilled. Meanwhile, the wealthy elite continue to thrive, aligned with power centres in the mainland. Ordinary people believe that privilege and fortune come only through corruption and collusion with these elites, a conviction that fuels their grievances. The recent deadlock in talks between the government and JAAC, before resumption, centred on the issue of elite capture. Forced by the stalemate, the JAAC proceeded with its protest plan. At the core of JAAC’s 38-point charter was the elimination of elite privileges, especially the 13 reserved seats for Kashmiri refugees. The JAAC views these seats as a source of corruption and political manoeuvring, and thus playing a decisive part in forming governments in AJK. The comparison with the (former) Fata seats in Pakistan’s parliament is evoked aptly to voice concerns regarding horse-trading and government-making and unmaking at Islamabad’s whim. The government counters that abolishing these seats would weaken Pakistan’s Kashmir case, as India also reserves seats for AJK and GB. It argues that removing them would signal acceptance of India’s Aug 5, 2019, abrogation of Kashmir’s special status. The JAAC dismisses this claim. It insists that reserved seats have nothing to do with UN resolutions and do not affect Pakistan’s legal stance. Both AJK and GB want constitutional rights as citizens. Instead, critics assert, the state imposes taxes and removes subsidies but does not give them the constitutional cover that would allow citizens to benefit fully, without undermining UN resolutions. Most of the JAAC’s demands were essentially municipal-level issues, including health, education and sanitation. Yet Pakistan’s ruling elites, particularly in the provinces, have destroyed the local government system, retaining revenues for themselves and spending like monarchs.

It remains to be seen when and if the promises are fulfilled. Had the government made good progress on earlier demands, the region might have been spared the recent tumult. In fact, the pattern so far shows that the government, in other parts of the country too, engages in negotiations with protesters merely to pacify the immediate situation, rather than look for permanent solutions to honour its commitments. In some cases, voices of protest fall on deaf ears. For instance, just days before the JAAC protest, the families of Baloch missing persons once again ended their sit-in and returned from the federal capital. The peaceful families of the missing persons were not fortunate enough to receive even minimal attention from state institutions. One must move beyond dealing with such situations through force, temporary negotiations and eventual disregard for the demands once ‘normalcy’ is restored. This modus operandi is a relic of colonial times. Many Commonwealth states inherited this pattern, but Pakistan is among the few that appear to have stuck to the old line, without distinction or reform.

After nearly two years of relentless bombardment, the prospect of a truce — following Hamas’s conditional acceptance of US President Donald Trump’s peace plan , which includes releasing all hostages and handing Gaza’s administration to a technocratic Palestinian body, and Israel’s readiness to implement its first phase — offers a sliver of hope. For a population living amid mass displacement, collapsed infrastructure, and the loss of over 66,000 lives, even a pause in the violence carries meaning. Yet history teaches that such truces often collapse under Israel’s obstinacy. If this opening is to amount to more than a tactical lull, it must be anchored in lasting commitments. The Netanyahu government has already signalled it will calibrate operations rather than halt them outright. Reports from Gaza confirm bombardment continuing despite Mr Trump’s demand for Israel to “immediately stop bombing.” Mr Trump has also set Hamas a deadline, warning that if it fails to accept the deal by Sunday night, “all hell” will break out. Such ultimatums underscore both the fragility of the moment and the dangers of coercion in a process that should prioritise justice and peace. Israel is notorious for backtracking once international attention drifts. This time must be different. The guarantors of the truce — Washington, Arab capitals, and the UN — must ensure commitments are not quietly abandoned, and that violations invite consequences. Without sustained pressure, Tel Aviv has little incentive to comply beyond exchanging hostages for prisoners. Accountability cannot be sacrificed for expedience. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023 — figures the UN considers credible. That most of the dead are women and children underscores the monstrous scale of Israel’s actions. International law obliges states to investigate such crimes. If there is no accountability for the massacre of tens of thousands, peace will rest on sand, and impunity will pave the way for repetition. Equally central is Gaza’s future. The blockade that has strangled the Strip for nearly two decades must be permanently lifted. Aid convoys cannot replace the right of Palestinians to move freely, rebuild homes, and recover their economy. Without freedom of movement, Gaza remains an open-air prison. In the end, no ‘technocratic committee’ or transitional board will address the root cause. Only a two-state solution, long sabotaged by Israeli settlement expansion, can provide dignity and security. Yet Israel’s leadership has already said it does not accept Palestinian statehood, pledging to retain “security control” while denying Palestinians sovereignty. Unless Palestinians are granted the means to build a viable state, violence will recur. This fragile pause may offer a chance. But unless it is built on accountability, freedom, and self-determination, it will remain just that — a pause before the next round of devastation. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Just a day before leaving for Malaysia on a two-day official visit , Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his elder brother and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on Saturday and discussed with him the ‘ growing tensions ’ between the PPP and PML-N, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers. The meeting that took place at their Jati Umra residence covered governance issues, including the ongoing acrimony with the PPP-led Sindh government over flood and canal issues. “The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn. The source said PM Shehbaz wanted his elder brother to speak to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and convince her “to let go and reconcile with the PPP”. He said the premier “urged Nawaz Sharif to ask Maryam Nawaz to adopt a reconciliatory approach and end the ongoing acrimony with the PPP leadership over flood and canal issues. Shehbaz, Dar to leave for Malaysia today “Nawaz Sharif was also briefed on the PPP’s grievances over administrative and development-related matters, with both leaders agreeing that unity within the coalition was essential to sustain the government’s stability.” However, in its official statement, the PML-N said the prime minister briefed the party chief on his recent foreign visits and provided a detailed update on the situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including the outcome of successful negotiations with the protesters. The war of words between the two coalition partners began over flood compensation , expanded to water rights on the Indus River (six canals issue). Maryam Nawaz told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself, while the latter had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sessions to protest her diatribe and demanded apology from her. However, CM Maryam declared she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst over flood and canal issues. As the tensions escalated further, the PPP publicly repeated Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) allegations that Maryam Nawaz did not represent the people of Punjab stating that her government was a “by product of Form 47”. PPP’s central information secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan said Maryam Nawaz, who called those raising public issues ‘the enemies of Punjab’, was herself the real problem of Punjab. “The CM Punjab is demonstrating racist thinking to hide her failure to save the people from floodwaters,” he remarked. PM’s Malaysia visit Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz would leave for Malaysia for a two-day visit at the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim from Oct 5 to 7, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday. The FO said PM Shehbaz, Foreign Minister and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, federal ministers and senior government officials will depart for Malaysia on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” it added. A PML-N statement said Mr Ibrahim had also extended an invitation to party chief and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif to visit Malaysia, but he said he would consider the visit at a more suitable time.

      "summary_orig": "• US envoys leave for Cairo to work out arrangements for release of Israeli prisoners • Dozens arrested in London after protesting against ban on a pro-Palestinian group CAIRO: Over 60 people were killed in Gaza on Saturday as Israel went ahead with its bombardment in defiance of US President Donald Trump’s demand it stop bombing in response to a declaration by Hamas that it was ready to free prisoners under his plan to end the two-year-old conflict. According to witnesses on the ground, 11 people died in sporadic incidents, while 10 people, including children, were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli strike on a house in Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City. The attack damaged several other buildings nearby. The Gaza health ministry said in a morning update that Israeli fire had killed at least 66 Palestinians across the enclave over the past 24 hours. Despite the Israeli action, President Trump said “I appreciate Israel has temporarily stopped the bombing”, and he urged Hamas to move quickly on his plan “or else all bets will be off”. “I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST. Everyone will be treated fairly!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. Hamas had drawn a welcoming resp­onse from Trump on Friday by saying it accepted certain key parts of his 20-point peace proposal , including ending the conflict, Israel’s withdrawal and the rele­ase of prisoners, both Israeli and Palestinian. In Washington, a White House official said Trump was sending his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Egypt to finalise technical details regarding the release of Israeli prisoners and discuss a lasting “peace deal’. Egypt’s state-affiliated television channel Al QaheraNews said Palestinian and Israeli delegations would also be present for “indirect talks” on the Trump plan. Hamas’s response to the plan drew a chorus of optimistic statements by world leaders, who urged an end to the conflict. Another possible boost to hopes came with a supportive statement from the Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which is smaller than Hamas but seen as more hardline. The group, which also holds Israeli prisoners, endorsed Hamas’s response — a move that could help pave the way for the release of Israelis still held by both parties. ‘Immediate implementation’ Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli prisoners following Hamas’s response. Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce “offensive activity” in Gaza. Trump has invested significant political capital in efforts to end a conflict that has left Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage. Dozens held in London Police arrested an unspecified number of protesters for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group at a demonstration in London on Saturday which went ahead despite requests to call it off after a deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester two days ago. Two people were killed in the attack in the north-western English city on Thursday and police shot dead the suspect, a British man of Syrian descent. Organisers refused requests by police to call off Saturday’s demonstration, which had been announced before the Manchester attack, to protest the banning of pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws. Calling for calm on X, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “I urge anyone thinking about protesting this weekend to recognise and respect the grief of British Jews. “This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain. It is a time to stand together.” Police arrested protesters at Trafalgar Square, in central London, as they wrote slogans on placards declaring support for Palestine Action, which was proscribed in July after its members broke into an airbase and damaged military planes. Hundreds gathered for the protest, applauding and cheering those arrested as they were carried through the crowd by police without resisting. Onlookers chanted “shame on you” at officers. “I’m disgusted by the police actually, they shouldn’t be arresting non-violent protesters here,” said Angie Zelter. “We have a right to protest and Palestine Action is not a violent organisation, should never have been proscribed in the first place.” The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests, during which hundreds have been arrested for defying the ban which makes it an offence to show support for Palestine Action. Police said Saturday’s protests would draw resources away from security they have tightened around synagogues and mosques following the attack in Manchester. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The import of used cars in Pakistan is much higher than its regional peers and other countries. However, different countries have implemented various strategies to balance consumer demand, environmental concerns, and industrial priorities. Experiences from India, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines provide practical insights. Measures such as age limits, pre-export inspections, phased implementation, fiscal incentives, and administrative controls can guide Pakistan in maintaining quality, safeguarding the environment, and balancing consumer access with industrial protection. As per a report of the Institute of Cost and Management (ICMA), Pakistan’s average import of used cars per year stood at 34,000 units followed by 21,802 by Thailand, 532 by Vietnam and 235 units by India. Bangladesh permits the import of used cars under specific conditions to balance consumer demand with quality control and revenue generation. As of June 2025, vehicles must be no more than four years old, imported directly from the country of origin, and accompanied by a previous registration or de-registration certificate. The importation process involves customs duties, VAT, and mandatory inspections to ensure compliance with national standards. Neighbours curb influx of old vehicles through age caps and safety checks Sri Lanka lifted its five-year ban on private car and motorcycle imports in February 2025, allowing personal use vehicle imports under specific conditions. Individuals are permitted to import one vehicle per year, provided they use a registered vehicle importer. This phased reopening aims to stabilise the market and manage foreign exchange reserves while meeting consumer demand. India enforces stringent regulations on the importation of used vehicles to protect its domestic automotive industry and ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards. As of 2024, used vehicles must be under three years old, right-hand drive, and meet specific engine capacity restrictions. The import ­process involves extensive documentation, high import duties (up to 125pc for used cars), and mandatory compliance testing. Additionally, a minimum ­roadworthiness period of five years is required from the date of ­importation. Kenya has implemented a controlled liberalisation approach to used car imports, aiming to balance affordability with environmental and safety considerations. As of July 2025, only vehicles manufactured from July 2018 onward are eligible for import, effectively enforcing a rolling seven-year age limit. This policy is designed to improve air quality, reduce reliance on older vehicles, and support local vehicle assembly. Importers must comply with pre-export inspection requirements and domestic roadworthiness certification. South Africa restricts used car imports to protect its domestic automotive manufacturing sector. Importation is generally allowed only under specific circumstances, such as for returning nationals or immigrants with permanent residence status. These individuals may import one vehicle per family, subject to compliance with import duties and VAT. The importation process requires obtaining a permit and adhering to documentation requirements. Nigeria has tightened its used vehicle import regulations to reduce the influx of older, potentially polluting cars. As of May 2025, only vehicles manufactured in 2015 or later are eligible for import without facing punitive duties. Vehicles older than 10 years are either barred or subjected to heavy import penalties. The import process requires specific documentation, including a bill of lading, bill of entry, marine insurance, and evidence of VAT payment. In the Philippines, only qualified individuals may import used vehicles, and they must secure a Certificate of Authority to Import (CAI) from the Fair-Trade Enforcement Bureau (FTEB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) before the actual importation. Imported vehicles are subject to a 40pc customs duty, 10pc VAT, and an ad valorem tax ranging from 15pc to 100pc, depending on the vehicle’s piston displacement. In the early 1990s, commercial imports of cars were largely prohibited to protect local assemblers. This resulted in fewer cars in the market, higher prices, and limited options for buyers. In the early 2000s, growing demand for affordable cars led the government to allow imports under special schemes such as the Gift Scheme, Baggage Scheme, and Transfer of Residence Scheme, mainly for overseas Pakistanis. While these cars were meant for personal use, many entered the local market through dealers. Consumers gained more choice and prices dropped slightly, but local carmakers protested, saying these imports hurt their sales and investment. In 2,005, the government reduced duties, making it easier to import used cars. Consumers accessed small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars, and imports rose quickly. By 2,008, local carmakers lobbied for tighter restrictions, leading to increased duties and a lower age limit for imports. This reduced imports and strengthened local manufacturer protection. In 2012, the maximum age of imported used cars was cut from five years to three years, sharply reducing inflows. Simultaneously, the Automotive Development Policy (ADP) encouraged investment in local assembly. Some new entrants joined, but car prices remained high and choice limited. During 2012-2020s, ongoing push and pull consumers continued to complain about high prices, limited choice, and lower safety standards than regional peers. Industry groups warned that too many imports could reduce local investment, slow parts production, and increase pressure on foreign exchange. The government alternated between relaxing and restricting imports, creating a cycle of\npolicy shifts. In September 2025, the federal government had allowed commercial imports of used cars up to five years old. Duties will be reduced gradually. The policy aims to protect local manufacturers, offer consumers more affordable choices, and ensure imported cars meet safety and environmental standards. This is a key step toward a more balanced automotive market. Passenger vehicles under five years old can be imported commercially until June 30, 2026. A 40pc regulatory duty applies in the first year, reducing by 10pc each year until it reaches zero by FY30. This phased approach helps balance consumer benefits with protection for local manufacturers. All imported vehicles must meet safety and emission standards, ensuring that older, unsafe, or inefficient vehicles do not enter the market. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

As of July 2025, only vehicles manufactured from July 2018 onward are eligible for import, effectively enforcing a rolling seven-year age limit. This policy is designed to improve air quality, reduce reliance on older vehicles, and support local vehicle assembly. Importers must comply with pre-export inspection requirements and domestic roadworthiness certification. South Africa restricts used car imports to protect its domestic automotive manufacturing sector. Importation is generally allowed only under specific circumstances, such as for returning nationals or immigrants with permanent residence status. These individuals may import one vehicle per family, subject to compliance with import duties and VAT. The importation process requires obtaining a permit and adhering to documentation requirements. Nigeria has tightened its used vehicle import regulations to reduce the influx of older, potentially polluting cars. As of May 2025, only vehicles manufactured in 2015 or later are eligible for import without facing punitive duties. Vehicles older than 10 years are either barred or subjected to heavy import penalties. The import process requires specific documentation, including a bill of lading, bill of entry, marine insurance, and evidence of VAT payment. In the Philippines, only qualified individuals may import used vehicles, and they must secure a Certificate of Authority to Import (CAI) from the Fair-Trade Enforcement Bureau (FTEB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) before the actual importation. Imported vehicles are subject to a 40pc customs duty, 10pc VAT, and an ad valorem tax ranging from 15pc to 100pc, depending on the vehicle’s piston displacement. In the early 1990s, commercial imports of cars were largely prohibited to protect local assemblers. This resulted in fewer cars in the market, higher prices, and limited options for buyers. In the early 2000s, growing demand for affordable cars led the government to allow imports under special schemes such as the Gift Scheme, Baggage Scheme, and Transfer of Residence Scheme, mainly for overseas Pakistanis. While these cars were meant for personal use, many entered the local market through dealers. Consumers gained more choice and prices dropped slightly, but local carmakers protested, saying these imports hurt their sales and investment. In 2,005, the government reduced duties, making it easier to import used cars. Consumers accessed small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars, and imports rose quickly. By 2,008, local carmakers lobbied for tighter restrictions, leading to increased duties and a lower age limit for imports. This reduced imports and strengthened local manufacturer protection. In 2012, the maximum age of imported used cars was cut from five years to three years, sharply reducing inflows. Simultaneously, the Automotive Development Policy (ADP) encouraged investment in local assembly. Some new entrants joined, but car prices remained high and choice limited. During 2012-2020s, ongoing push and pull consumers continued to complain about high prices, limited choice, and lower safety standards than regional peers. Industry groups warned that too many imports could reduce local investment, slow parts production, and increase pressure on foreign exchange. The government alternated between relaxing and restricting imports, creating a cycle of\npolicy shifts. In September 2025, the federal government had allowed commercial imports of used cars up to five years old. Duties will be reduced gradually. The policy aims to protect local manufacturers, offer consumers more affordable choices, and ensure imported cars meet safety and environmental standards. This is a key step toward a more balanced automotive market. Passenger vehicles under five years old can be imported commercially until June 30, 2026. A 40pc regulatory duty applies in the first year, reducing by 10pc each year until it reaches zero by FY30. This phased approach helps balance consumer benefits with protection for local manufacturers. All imported vehicles must meet safety and emission standards, ensuring that older, unsafe, or inefficient vehicles do not enter the market. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
      "title": "Pakistan leads region in used car imports",
      "summary": "KARACHI: The import of used cars in Pakistan is much higher than its regional peers and other countries. However, different countries have implemented various strategies to balance consumer demand, environmental concerns, and industrial priorities. Experiences from India, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines provide practical insights. Measures such as age limits, pre-export inspections, phased implementation, fiscal incentives, and administrative controls can guide Pakistan in maintaining quality, safeguarding the environment, and balancing consumer access with industrial protection. As per a report of the Institute of Cost and Management (ICMA), Pakistan’s average import of used cars per year stood at 34,000 units followed by 21,802 by Thailand, 532 by Vietnam and 235 units by India. Bangladesh permits the import of used cars under specific conditions to balance consumer demand with quality control and revenue generation. As of June 2025, vehicles must be no more than four years old, imported directly from the country of origin, and accompanied by a previous registration or de-registration certificate. The importation process involves customs duties, VAT, and mandatory inspections to ensure compliance with national standards. Neighbours curb influx of old vehicles through age caps and safety checks Sri Lanka lifted its five-year ban on private car and motorcycle imports in February 2025, allowing personal use vehicle imports under specific conditions. Individuals are permitted to import one vehicle per year, provided they use a registered vehicle importer. This phased reopening aims to stabilise the market and manage foreign exchange reserves while meeting consumer demand. India enforces stringent regulations on the importation of used vehicles to protect its domestic automotive industry and ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards. As of 2024, used vehicles must be under three years old, right-hand drive, and meet specific engine capacity restrictions. The import ­process involves extensive documentation, high import duties (up to 125pc for used cars), and mandatory compliance testing. Additionally, a minimum ­roadworthiness period of five years is required from the date of ­importation.

In a statement , the FO said that a high-level delegation comprising the PM, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and other federal ministers and senior government officials will depart on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” the statement read. According to the FO, PM Shehbaz will hold bilateral talks with Malaysian PM Ibrahim and discuss key regional and global developments, as well as enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, the Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people ties. “The leaders are expected to witness the signing of Agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read. Earlier this month, Malaysian High Commissioner to Pakistan Dato’ Mohammad Azhar Mazlan said that there is a great deal of commonality and potential for bilateral exchanges between Kuala Lumpur and Islamabad. “Malaysia takes pride in its association with Pakistan since August 31, 1957, when we gained independence.

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country will “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) comes in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in such a case. “In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint.” Indian media outlet NDTV reported a day ago that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion. The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed , without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said : “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.” In its statement today, the ISPR said that this time, “we shall shatter the myth of geographic immunity, hitting the farthest reaches of the Indian territory. “As for the talk of erasing Pakistan from the map, India must know that if the situation comes, the erasure will be mutual.” It added that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”. The military’s media wing warned that the nation and military had the “capability and resolve to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy’s territory” in the face of unwarranted threats and reckless aggression. The ISPR further said the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”. It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia. “For decades, India has benefitted from playing the victim card and painting Pakistan in negative light, while stoking violence and perpetrating terrorism in South Asia and beyond.” The military’s media wing added that India’s narrative has been sufficiently debunked and “now the world recognises India as the true face of cross-border terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability”. “Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war.  However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.” The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale . New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command, that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India. The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army. The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.",

      "summary_en": "The Pakistan military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country will “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) comes in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in such a case. “In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint.” Indian media outlet NDTV reported a day ago that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion. The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed , without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said : “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.” In its statement today, the ISPR said that this time, “we shall shatter the myth of geographic immunity, hitting the farthest reaches of the Indian territory. “As for the talk of erasing Pakistan from the map, India must know that if the situation comes, the erasure will be mutual.” It added that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”. The military’s media wing warned that the nation and military had the “capability and resolve to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy’s territory” in the face of unwarranted threats and reckless aggression.

In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. The national carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”. The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.",

In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. The national carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”. The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.",
