      "title_orig": "Fawad claims efforts for release of political prisoners, including Imran, to bear fruit soon",
      "summary_orig": "Former minister Fawad Chaudhry claimed on Wednesday that the “impacts” of the efforts of a trio — comprising him and other ex-PTI leaders — for political stability in the country and the release of political prisoners, including PTI founder Imran Khan, would start bearing fruit in the next 10 to 15 days. Fawad, along with fellow former PTI leaders  Mehmood Moulvi and Imran Ismail, has been insisting on talks between the government and the PTI, in what they say is an effort to bring the political temperature down and pave the way for Imran’s release, who has been in jail since 2023. “I am very pleased that the efforts for political stability and to secure the release of political prisoners, including Imran, have resulted in significant initial successes, and their impact will start becoming evident in the next 10 to 15 days,” Fawad posted on social media platform X. He reiterated that himself, Moulvi and Ismail were making these efforts for “political stability in Pakistan”, expressing the optimism that differences and distances would soon diminish in the political landscape. “It is important to abate political hostilities for Pakistan’s political stability and […] long-term development,” Fawad said. The statement came hours after a late-night post on Imran’s X account quoted him as saying that he would “neither hold talks with the government nor with the establishment”. While it remains unclear that who runs Imran’s social media accounts with him being in jail, posts on his X accounts frequently carry statements that are described as his messages from jail. In the post, Imran said it was futile to hold talks and any decisions regarding negotiations would be taken by Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Raja Nasir Abbas, who are part of the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, along with the PTI. The post also quoted Imran as saying that he had complete trust in PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who has been criticised by Fawad in recent days. Political outreach campaign Fawad, Ismail and Moulvi’s recent activities came into the spotlight when they visited PTI’s Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a hospital in Lahore last week. The trio, however, was reported to have returned empty-handed, with Qureshi’s lawyer saying that had no political discussion with his client. Qureshi is among several PTI leaders who were sent to prison in cases pertaining to May 9, 2023 protest that erupted over Imran’s arrest the same day. A crackdown on the party was launched after the violent protests, during which several public properties and military installations were vandalised. The former foreign minister was shifted to the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute from jail for medical treatment, where the three former PTI leaders   visited him. “Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” Qureshi’s lawyer Rana Mudassar later said, adding that by the time he got back, the ex-PTI leaders had already gone. He said the visitors stayed only a little over 10 minutes and left without any political discussion with Qureshi. However, the former PTI leaders, particularly Fawad and Ismail, have been insisting that Qureshi had agreed with them that the stalemate in Pakistan’s politics must end. The also maintain that they met another jailed PYI leader Ejaz Chaudhry in this regard. After their visit to the hospital, Raja also reportedly called on Qureshi , with party leaders Shaukat Basra and Zaheer Babar in tow. On Sunday, Fawad had doubled down on his quest to revive the fortunes of the PTI, even as senior party leaders like Asad Qaiser maintained that both the party and its founder “will not compromise on their principles” even if they engage in a dialogue. He also claimed that most seasoned PTI politicians and more than 15 MPAs had approached him to express their agreement that a government-PTI engagement was “highly necessary”. He urged the government to take the first step towards de-escalation by offering relief to imprisoned senior PTI leaders. “If the government gives relief to the incarcerated Lahore and Gujranwala leaders, then these leaders could engage with the jailed Khan and lead a process of engagement,” he explained. “Imran Khan’s mandate is with the party leaders, who have been in jails for the past two years,” he acknowledged, referring to PTI leaders such as Qureshi and Dr Yasmin Rashid. He also shared the trio’s plans to approach the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman, as well as some senior ministers, and ask them to play a role in defusing political tensions. The ex-PTI leaders have also dispelled the impression that they were working on a ‘minus Imran formula’.",

      "summary_orig": "Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, capping a meteoric rise from a little-known state lawmaker to one of the country’s most visible Democratic figures. According to CBS , Mamdani received 1,035,645 votes (50.4 per cent) against 854,783 (41.6pc) for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and 146,127\t\n(7.1pc) for Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani will become the first Muslim mayor of the largest US city. He defeated Democratic former Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, who ran as an independent after losing the nomination to Mamdani in the primary election. The campaign served as an ideological and generational contest that could have national implications for the Democratic Party. Trump had made an eleventh-hour intervention in the race, calling Mamdani a “Jew hater“. Mamdani was born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin and has lived in the United States since he was seven, becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2018. “Hope is alive,” Mamdani declared in his victory speech. “We won because New Yorkers allowed themselves to hope that the impossible could be made possible. We won because we insisted that no longer would politics be something that is done to us. Now, it is something we do,” he said. View this post on Instagram He also quoted Jawaharlal Nehru, saying, “A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.” He also said that New York would no longer be a city where one can “traffic in Islamophobia and win an election”, adding that the city will be a light “in this moment of political darkness”. He also gave a message to the US president, who is also a New Yorker, saying, “Donald Trump, since I know you are watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!” Mamdani said he would put an end to “culture of corruption” that has allowed billionaires like Trump to “evade taxation and exploit tax breaks”. “We will stand alongside unions and expand labour protections because we know, just as Donald Trump does, that when working people have iron-clad rights, the bosses who seek to extort them become very small indeed,” he said. Promising to fight for all New Yorkers, Mamdani said his administration would represent “immigrants, members of the trans community, Black women fired by Trump from federal jobs, single mothers struggling with rising costs — anyone with their back against the wall”. He pledged a city hall “that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of anti-Semitism, where the more than one million Muslims know that they belong”. He concluded his speech by thanking New Yorkers, saying,“ This power is yours, This city belongs to you.“ His emphatic speech concluded with Bollywood song ‘Dhoom Machale’ blaring over the speakers. Congratulations for Mamdani Ex-president Bill Clinton congratulated Mamdani. “I’m wishing you success as you work to transform the passion of your campaign into building a better, fairer, more affordable New York,” he said. The former US First Lady and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that “more people voted in New York City’s election this year than they have in 50 years”. “Yes. We CAN create a government that represents working people and not the 1pc,” she said. US Senator Bernie Sanders said Mamdani had “pulled off one of the great political upsets in modern American history”. Former US president Barack Obama congratulated all the Democrat candidates who won on Tuesday, calling it a reminder that “when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win”. “We’ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter,” he said. Ghazala Hashmi becomes first Muslim woman to win statewide office in US Meanwhile, Ghazala Hashmi defeated Republican writer and conservative talk show host John Reid in the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race on Tuesday, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States Hashmi maintained a steady lead over Reid throughout the campaign, though polling tightened in the final days before election day. She secured 747,773 votes (53.8 per cent) against 659,421 (46.4pc) for her Republican rival. Earlier in June, Hashmi narrowly clinched the Democratic nomination, defeating former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and state Senator Aaron Rouse in a closely contested primary. A member of the party’s progressive wing, Hashmi enjoyed strong support from prominent figures such as Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, who backed her during the primary campaign. Born in Hyderabad, India, Hashmi moved to the United States in her youth and later earned a PhD in English from Emory University. She began her career in academia, teaching English for over two decades at community colleges in Virginia before entering politics. Her election to the state Senate in 2019 marked her as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Virginia legislature, a milestone she has now extended to statewide office. Democrats win Virginia, New Jersey governor races In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger easily won the election for governor, becoming the first woman elected to serve in that role, while Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States. And in New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race. Spanberger defeated Republican Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor’s race flipping control of the state and making her the first woman ever to serve as the state governor. A former congresswoman and CIA officer, Spanberger maintained a consistent lead over Earle-Sears through most of the campaign, buoyed by strong fundraising and strong support in the state’s suburban counties. Her victory gives Democrats a significant boost as they seek to regain political footing following their 2024 national election losses. Spanberger, 47, centered her campaign heavily on economic and affordability issues, as well as public safety and her support for abortion rights. Her campaign and allied groups attacked Earle-Sears over her conservative record on social issues and her loyalty to Trump. Earle-Sears, 61, struggled throughout much of the race to find a coherent message. “We sent a message to the world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,” Spanberger said in her victory speech. “We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.” “You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most  lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian,” she said. Separately, Democrat Sherrill won New Jersey’s election for governor. Sherrill, a US representative and former Navy pilot, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli and will succeed Democratic Governor Phil Murphy. It is the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected governors from the same party for three consecutive terms. The races offered the beleaguered Democratic Party a test of differing campaign playbooks a year ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress will be at stake. Since US President Donald Trump’s win last year, Democrats have found themselves locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find the best path out of the political wilderness. Reacting to Republican losses, Trump cited unspecified pollsters who attributed the loss to the ongoing government shutdown and Trump not leading the ballot. “‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",

Officials said nearly two dozen armed men, carrying heavy weapons, attacked the Khattan Police Station in Kachhi district. The station had been recently established in a building of the Livestock Department and handed to the police after the merger of levies personnel into police. The assailants entered the two-room police station, burning official records and furniture. They also took away two rifles, including an SMG and a G-3, along with a mobile phone and a private motorcycle before fleeing. “Owing to the large number of assailants, the former levies personnel, who were in a nearby private house, could not effectively respond,” a senior official said, adding that no loss of life or injury was reported. Local police and security forces reached the site soon after receiving information about the incident and launched a joint search operation to trace the attackers. The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Sibi Range is further investigating the case.

      "summary_orig": "Afghanistan is the heart of Asia — Allama Iqbal PAKISTAN was born into long-term hostility with its neighbour, India. Security was, accordingly, key to avoiding the peril of infant-nation mortality. Later, it needed to broaden its strategy to good governance including democracy, economic and human development, and rights protections. The Quaid departed before this essential transition could commence. The process has been aborted ever since despite fleeting periods of promise. The result has been the loss of the majority of Pakistan’s original population within its first 25 years, and no lessons learned during the next half century to ensure the viability of what was left of the country. Praetorian elite capture has been primarily responsible for this tragedy. Undoing it will need a ‘whole of the nation’ undertaking. What needs to be done in terms of policies and institution building over a whole range of national endeavours is largely known. But the likelihood of much of it happening appears non-existent today because of the perversity of the prevailing political and power structures. Moreover, this grim prospect is being progressively internalised by ruling elites and the middle class intelligentsia whose attitudes and choices determine the fate of nations. A refusal to accept these realities is itself a form of complicity. The only view that is worse is the assumption that the nation will somehow survive, despite its wretched condition, because its nuclear weapons status guarantees the rest of the world has a stake in its survival! This is the national context in which our Afgh­a­n­­istan policy should be considered. The Afghan people have a historical relationship with the people of Pakistan. Had the British adopted the Forw­ard Policy instead of Lawrence’s Non-interference Policy there may have been no Afghanistan today as the British and Russian Empires would have met along the Amu Darya instead of being separated by Afghanistan — which has since developed into a resilient nation. This is due to the wisdom and moderation of its rulers — with recent exceptions which have been the result of Russian and American invasions. Nevertheless, its ethnically diverse peoples have embraced their collective Afghan identity despite their rivalries. Pakistan got off to a poor start in its relations with Afghanistan because of reasons most supposedly educated and informed Pakistanis know little about. The British drew the Durand Line after the Second Afghan War lopping off sizeable portions of Afghan territory and incorporating them into British India while acknowledging Ka­­bul’s continued interest in its lost peoples. Af­­ghanistan never formally recognised the legitimacy of a border forcibly demarcated by imperial aggression. Instead of a Big Brother policy towards Afghanistan, Pakistan should consider a policy of Strategic Generosity. This led to its vote against the admission of Pakistan to the United Nations, which it quickly reversed after making its legally dubious but historically and politically understandable point. Afghanistan realised the Pakhtun of the NWFP and Balochistan, after a century of living with fellow Muslims under British rule, preferred to become part of Pakistan while simultaneously owning an indissoluble kinship with their Afghan brethren. Later, the so-called Pakhtunistan issue arose which Afghan governments exploited for domestic political purposes (and also to counter Pakistan’s transit trade leverage) just as successive governments in Pakistan have often used the internationally recognised Kashmir dispute for domestic political purposes. Nevertheless, two facts are incontrovertible: in practice, Kabul has treated the Durand Line as an international border, and during Pakistan’s several conflicts with India it has never had to worry about its western border. Moreover, Kabul has consistently acknowledged its debt to Pakistan for its critical assistance during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Even so, the Afghans pride themselves on resisting the mighty powers of the past and the present and, accordingly, resent Pakistan’s perceived attempts to impose ‘friendly governments’ in Kabul and control its foreign policy, especially towards India. They blame Pakistan for imposing Pakistan-based mujahideen and subsequently mediaeval Taliban rule in Afghanistan which has isolated it from the contemporary world, including Muslim countries. Both endeavours proved counterproductive for Pakistan but ruinous for Afghanistan. As a result, Pakistan has no friends in Afghanistan today. As for the TTP, the Afghans insist the overwhelming majority of its attacks originate from within Pakistan. Many in Pakistan concede there is a measure of truth in this allegation. Pakistan is, accordingly, following self-defeating Afghan and strategic policies. They are driving Afghanistan into the arms of India and setting up a dangerous ‘nutcracker’ (two-front) situation for itself just to distract domestic political attention from the grim state of affairs in the country. Despite Pakistan’s admirable performance in the recent conflict with India this situation is straining its domestic stability. Instead of a Big Brother policy towards Afghanistan it should consider a policy of Strategic Generosity much like the enlightened policy of Brazil towards its smaller neighbours — and indeed of China towards the Global South. In that case, the Durand Line would eventually evolve into a regular border that is fully recognised and respected by Afghanistan. Such a far-sighted policy could go a long way towards recouping the irreparable loss of East Pakistan by finessing the current strategy of India towards Pakistan, and conceivably embarking upon the historic task of laying the foundations for a possible confederation with Afghanis­tan that would comprise approximately 300 million people. Progress in this endeavour could facilitate far broader and deeper strategic cooperation with China, Iran and Central Asia and effectively counter India’s hegemonic ambitions. Countless challenges will lie in the path of such a historic endeavour that would answer to the vi­­sion of Allama Iqbal. But imagination, goodwill and persistence can render the seemingly impossible, possible. There is an affinity between the peo­ple of Afghanistan and Pakistan, which shou­­ld easily accommodate Pakhtun cross-border kinship. There is no room here for essential details. But if we truly rather than merely ritually believe in our future we should seriously explore such pos­­sibilities that are in fact survival imperatives.

Af­­ghanistan never formally recognised the legitimacy of a border forcibly demarcated by imperial aggression. Instead of a Big Brother policy towards Afghanistan, Pakistan should consider a policy of Strategic Generosity. This led to its vote against the admission of Pakistan to the United Nations, which it quickly reversed after making its legally dubious but historically and politically understandable point. Afghanistan realised the Pakhtun of the NWFP and Balochistan, after a century of living with fellow Muslims under British rule, preferred to become part of Pakistan while simultaneously owning an indissoluble kinship with their Afghan brethren. Later, the so-called Pakhtunistan issue arose which Afghan governments exploited for domestic political purposes (and also to counter Pakistan’s transit trade leverage) just as successive governments in Pakistan have often used the internationally recognised Kashmir dispute for domestic political purposes. Nevertheless, two facts are incontrovertible: in practice, Kabul has treated the Durand Line as an international border, and during Pakistan’s several conflicts with India it has never had to worry about its western border. Moreover, Kabul has consistently acknowledged its debt to Pakistan for its critical assistance during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Even so, the Afghans pride themselves on resisting the mighty powers of the past and the present and, accordingly, resent Pakistan’s perceived attempts to impose ‘friendly governments’ in Kabul and control its foreign policy, especially towards India. They blame Pakistan for imposing Pakistan-based mujahideen and subsequently mediaeval Taliban rule in Afghanistan which has isolated it from the contemporary world, including Muslim countries. Both endeavours proved counterproductive for Pakistan but ruinous for Afghanistan. As a result, Pakistan has no friends in Afghanistan today. As for the TTP, the Afghans insist the overwhelming majority of its attacks originate from within Pakistan. Many in Pakistan concede there is a measure of truth in this allegation. Pakistan is, accordingly, following self-defeating Afghan and strategic policies. They are driving Afghanistan into the arms of India and setting up a dangerous ‘nutcracker’ (two-front) situation for itself just to distract domestic political attention from the grim state of affairs in the country. Despite Pakistan’s admirable performance in the recent conflict with India this situation is straining its domestic stability. Instead of a Big Brother policy towards Afghanistan it should consider a policy of Strategic Generosity much like the enlightened policy of Brazil towards its smaller neighbours — and indeed of China towards the Global South. In that case, the Durand Line would eventually evolve into a regular border that is fully recognised and respected by Afghanistan. Such a far-sighted policy could go a long way towards recouping the irreparable loss of East Pakistan by finessing the current strategy of India towards Pakistan, and conceivably embarking upon the historic task of laying the foundations for a possible confederation with Afghanis­tan that would comprise approximately 300 million people. Progress in this endeavour could facilitate far broader and deeper strategic cooperation with China, Iran and Central Asia and effectively counter India’s hegemonic ambitions. Countless challenges will lie in the path of such a historic endeavour that would answer to the vi­­sion of Allama Iqbal. But imagination, goodwill and persistence can render the seemingly impossible, possible. There is an affinity between the peo­ple of Afghanistan and Pakistan, which shou­­ld easily accommodate Pakhtun cross-border kinship. There is no room here for essential details.

      "summary": "Afghanistan is the heart of Asia — Allama Iqbal PAKISTAN was born into long-term hostility with its neighbour, India. Security was, accordingly, key to avoiding the peril of infant-nation mortality. Later, it needed to broaden its strategy to good governance including democracy, economic and human development, and rights protections. The Quaid departed before this essential transition could commence. The process has been aborted ever since despite fleeting periods of promise. The result has been the loss of the majority of Pakistan’s original population within its first 25 years, and no lessons learned during the next half century to ensure the viability of what was left of the country. Praetorian elite capture has been primarily responsible for this tragedy. Undoing it will need a ‘whole of the nation’ undertaking. What needs to be done in terms of policies and institution building over a whole range of national endeavours is largely known. But the likelihood of much of it happening appears non-existent today because of the perversity of the prevailing political and power structures. Moreover, this grim prospect is being progressively internalised by ruling elites and the middle class intelligentsia whose attitudes and choices determine the fate of nations. A refusal to accept these realities is itself a form of complicity. The only view that is worse is the assumption that the nation will somehow survive, despite its wretched condition, because its nuclear weapons status guarantees the rest of the world has a stake in its survival! This is the national context in which our Afgh­a­n­­istan policy should be considered. The Afghan people have a historical relationship with the people of Pakistan. Had the British adopted the Forw­ard Policy instead of Lawrence’s Non-interference Policy there may have been no Afghanistan today as the British and Russian Empires would have met along the Amu Darya instead of being separated by Afghanistan — which has since developed into a resilient nation. This is due to the wisdom and moderation of its rulers — with recent exceptions which have been the result of Russian and American invasions. Nevertheless, its ethnically diverse peoples have embraced their collective Afghan identity despite their rivalries. Pakistan got off to a poor start in its relations with Afghanistan because of reasons most supposedly educated and informed Pakistanis know little about.

      "summary_orig": "• Insists proposed 27th Amendment to be tabled ‘soon’, won’t be rushed • Says bill may originate in Senate instead of NA • Stresses govt will consult allies as opposition warns of ‘constitutional crisis’ • PTI’s Ali Zafar brands move a ‘conspiracy’, claims devolution at risk • Upper house passes Asaan Karobar Bill, extends Virtual Assets Ordinance by 120 days ISLAMABAD: As the opposition in the Senate raised alarm over the proposed 27th constitutional amendment, Deputy Pri­me Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday confirmed the bill would be brought bef­o­re parliament “soon” but insisted it would not be rus­hed and denied “external hand” in the amendment. “We will try to present it in accordance with the Constitution. I assure this will not be put to a vote in a flash,” he told the upper house while responding to PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar. Mr Dar’s remarks came amid a sustained protest by opposition senators over the delay in appointing the leader of the opposition. He said that after the PPP, the government would take all allies on board, including the MQM, ANP, IPP and BAP. “A standard process is being followed,” he said. The deputy prime minister noted that such amen­dments typically originate in the National Assembly, but added that if senators wis­hed to see the draft fir­st, he could request that the bill be moved in the Senate. Brushing aside suggestions that the amendment was coming from “somewhere else”, he said it was being brought by the government. He also suppor­ted the opposition’s dem­a­­nd for the immediate app­o­­i­­n­tment of the opposition leader, but said the Se­n­ate chairman was supposed to satisfy himself on who commanded a majority. ‘Conspiracy against Constitution’ Earlier, PTI’s Ali Zafar termed the forthcoming 27th Amendment a “conspiracy against the Constitution”. He said key ministers in television appearances he had taken part in had claimed there was no such amendment in the works. “This only means either they were telling a lie or were unaware of it. In both cases, it means that someone else is drafting the 27th Amendment for them,” he said, warning that an imminent constitutional crisis had effectively been announced and must be taken up by the Senate. “Constitutions are not murdered by bullets, but by mala fide amendments made under the guise of reform,” Mr Zafar said. Calling the Constitution a sacred document, he recalled that on April 10, 1973, when the Consti­tut­ion was adopted, the then prime minister Zulfi­kar Ali Bhutto declared that it was “the Constitu­tion of the people of Pakis­tan, not of one man or one party”. He said dictators had distorted the 1973 document over the next 37 years, until parliament passed the 18th Amendment in April 2010, restoring the democratic spirit of the Constitution, reviving the parliamentary form of government, strengthening provincial autonomy and safeguarding the independence of the judiciary and the Election Commission. However, he warned that the proposed 27th Amendment threatened to undo those gains. The senator alleged it would undermine judicial independence through the creation of constitutional courts, tamper with presidential powers and appointments relating to the armed forces under Article 243, alter the provincial share in the NFC Award by removing the constitutional minimum, and give devolved functions such as education, health and population planning back under federal control. “All these proposals, as suggested in PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s own tweet, strike at the very foundations of our constitutional order, reversing the principles of provincial autonomy, parliamentary supremacy and judicial independence.” He expressed surprise that, instead of rejecting such proposals, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had outlined them, arguing they contradicted the spirit and legacy of the PPP, whose founders had given Pakistan the 1973 Constitution . “The question before us is not merely legal, it is moral,” he said. “Will the Peoples Party honour the word it gave to the people in 1973, or once again erase it in the name of expedience?” He reminded the Senate that JUI-F had previously opposed the creation of any constitutional court and said he hoped both JUI-F and Jamaat-i-Islami would stand with the PTI in opposing the 27th Amendment. The row over the opposition leader’s appointment surfaced at the outset of proceedings when PTI-backed Senator Azam Swati raised the matter. The protest over the issue later escalated as PTI senators gathered before the chair’s podium and tore up copies of the agenda. The house echoed with chants of “Go PM go.” Presiding officer Manzoor Kakar of BAP said the issue did not fall within his jurisdiction. He asked members to return to their seats and assured them of time to speak. Asaan Karobar Bill Separately, the House passed the Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025, which aims to streamline the regulatory framework for business, trade and investment by removing cumbersome procedures and outdated requirements. Already cleared by the National Assembly, the legislation provides for the establishment of a Pakistan Regulatory Registry and a Pakistan Business Portal to serve as a national one-window for government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits. The bill was moved by MNA Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, chairman of the Board of Investment. According to the statement of objects and reasons of the bill, “The modernised regulatory requirements will be integrated through a Pakistan Business Portal, which will serve as a National One-Window facility for the identification and issuance of all government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits.” The implementation of this initiative “will have several benefits for the economy, including increased investment, job creation and economic growth,” the statement said. “It will also help improve Pakistan’s competitiveness in the global market and attract foreign investors seeking a stable and predictable regulatory environment.” The Senate also extended the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025 , for another 120 days. The ordinance, in force since July 8, 2025, establishes a legal framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, including the creation of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA). The authority’s mandate includes licensing crypto-related entities, issuing and implementing regulations, investigating suspicious transactions, ensuring consumer protection and imposing penalties, suspensions or legal action against non-compliant companies.

The deputy prime minister noted that such amen­dments typically originate in the National Assembly, but added that if senators wis­hed to see the draft fir­st, he could request that the bill be moved in the Senate. Brushing aside suggestions that the amendment was coming from “somewhere else”, he said it was being brought by the government. He also suppor­ted the opposition’s dem­a­­nd for the immediate app­o­­i­­n­tment of the opposition leader, but said the Se­n­ate chairman was supposed to satisfy himself on who commanded a majority. ‘Conspiracy against Constitution’ Earlier, PTI’s Ali Zafar termed the forthcoming 27th Amendment a “conspiracy against the Constitution”. He said key ministers in television appearances he had taken part in had claimed there was no such amendment in the works. “This only means either they were telling a lie or were unaware of it. In both cases, it means that someone else is drafting the 27th Amendment for them,” he said, warning that an imminent constitutional crisis had effectively been announced and must be taken up by the Senate. “Constitutions are not murdered by bullets, but by mala fide amendments made under the guise of reform,” Mr Zafar said. Calling the Constitution a sacred document, he recalled that on April 10, 1973, when the Consti­tut­ion was adopted, the then prime minister Zulfi­kar Ali Bhutto declared that it was “the Constitu­tion of the people of Pakis­tan, not of one man or one party”. He said dictators had distorted the 1973 document over the next 37 years, until parliament passed the 18th Amendment in April 2010, restoring the democratic spirit of the Constitution, reviving the parliamentary form of government, strengthening provincial autonomy and safeguarding the independence of the judiciary and the Election Commission. However, he warned that the proposed 27th Amendment threatened to undo those gains. The senator alleged it would undermine judicial independence through the creation of constitutional courts, tamper with presidential powers and appointments relating to the armed forces under Article 243, alter the provincial share in the NFC Award by removing the constitutional minimum, and give devolved functions such as education, health and population planning back under federal control. “All these proposals, as suggested in PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s own tweet, strike at the very foundations of our constitutional order, reversing the principles of provincial autonomy, parliamentary supremacy and judicial independence.” He expressed surprise that, instead of rejecting such proposals, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had outlined them, arguing they contradicted the spirit and legacy of the PPP, whose founders had given Pakistan the 1973 Constitution . “The question before us is not merely legal, it is moral,” he said. “Will the Peoples Party honour the word it gave to the people in 1973, or once again erase it in the name of expedience?” He reminded the Senate that JUI-F had previously opposed the creation of any constitutional court and said he hoped both JUI-F and Jamaat-i-Islami would stand with the PTI in opposing the 27th Amendment. The row over the opposition leader’s appointment surfaced at the outset of proceedings when PTI-backed Senator Azam Swati raised the matter. The protest over the issue later escalated as PTI senators gathered before the chair’s podium and tore up copies of the agenda. The house echoed with chants of “Go PM go.” Presiding officer Manzoor Kakar of BAP said the issue did not fall within his jurisdiction. He asked members to return to their seats and assured them of time to speak. Asaan Karobar Bill Separately, the House passed the Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025, which aims to streamline the regulatory framework for business, trade and investment by removing cumbersome procedures and outdated requirements. Already cleared by the National Assembly, the legislation provides for the establishment of a Pakistan Regulatory Registry and a Pakistan Business Portal to serve as a national one-window for government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits. The bill was moved by MNA Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, chairman of the Board of Investment. According to the statement of objects and reasons of the bill, “The modernised regulatory requirements will be integrated through a Pakistan Business Portal, which will serve as a National One-Window facility for the identification and issuance of all government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits.” The implementation of this initiative “will have several benefits for the economy, including increased investment, job creation and economic growth,” the statement said. “It will also help improve Pakistan’s competitiveness in the global market and attract foreign investors seeking a stable and predictable regulatory environment.” The Senate also extended the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025 , for another 120 days. The ordinance, in force since July 8, 2025, establishes a legal framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, including the creation of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA). The authority’s mandate includes licensing crypto-related entities, issuing and implementing regulations, investigating suspicious transactions, ensuring consumer protection and imposing penalties, suspensions or legal action against non-compliant companies.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Navy is always prepared and ready against all threats in the region, Deputy Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz said on Tuesday . “We are always keeping an eye on whatever is happening around us. We are always monitoring what is happening. This is an ongoing thing, our monitoring and our readiness,” he told the media on the second day of the Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference 2025 (PIMEC-25) at the Expo Centre. He said that Pakistan would soon induct new submarines into its fleet, which will significantly contribute to national and maritime security. “Pakistan Navy’s  role in the region is to ensure maritime security and the free flow of  trade in the region. The new submarines will significantly contribute to  that in the coming days,” he said. Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz pins hopes on Gwadar port Talking about PIMEC, he termed it an effort to provide stimulus to Pakistan’s maritime sector and blue economy. The vice admiral said that there were some maritime industries that were “less visible and less known”. He also stressed the need for efficient port operations and hoped to see Gwadar Port fully functional soon. “Your turnaround port time, and the size of ships that can dock there, matters, like our deep water terminal in Karachi where we can dock big ships. Gwadar is at such a strategic location that it will help significantly in transshipment and seaborne trade. A fully functional Gwadar Port will present us with huge economic opportunities in the future,” he said. The Karachi Shipyard also has a huge presence at PIMEC-25. While speaking about it, the Vice Admiral reminded that it was built ages ago and, therefore, has a limit to the kind of ships being built there. “The world has moved on. Shipyards in the world today are huge. We are also trying to build a shipyard on those lines in Gwadar. We hope to progress there. There was also a discussion about building a shipyard in Port Qasim. So yes, I think we need to have more shipyards. And the sooner the better,” he said. Published in Dawn, November 5th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "After the bowlers had done their job, the batters came good for Pakistan — albeit an all too familiar late collapse — at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad on Tuesday. In the first international match at the venue in 17 years, Pakistan marked the start of Shaheen Shah Afridi’s era as One-day International captain with a two-wicket victory over South Africa to strike the opening blow in the three-match series. Shaheen had won the toss and elected to field with his side riding on inspired spells of bowling by pacer Naseem Shah and spinners Saim Ayub and Abrar Ahmed to bowl South Africa out for 263. South Africa had got off to the ideal start with half-centuries for debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius (57) and the returning Quinton de Kock (63) — the duo sharing a 98-run opening stand. But with the exception of skipper Matthew Breetzke (42) and Corbin Bosch (41) in the end, none of their batters could get going as Naseem (3-40), Saim (2-39) and Abrar (3-53) scythed through their line-up. Half-centuries by Salman Ali Agha (62) and Mohammad Rizwan (57) then steadied Pakistan midway through their chase after Fakhar Zaman and Saim had laid the platform with a solid 87-run opening partnership. Salman and Rizwan combined for another 91 after Pakistan had lost three quick wickets. Rizwan fell with Pakistan needing 68 more to win but Salman struck a breezy partnership with Hussain Talat and after the hosts had an all to familiar late collapse, Mohammad Nawaz and Shaheen  saw them through to a confidence-boosting victory. South Africa, meanwhile, will rue they were unable to capitalise on a storming start by Pretorius and De Kock. Pretorius and De Kock, playing his first ODI since returning from retirement after the ODI World Cup, laid into the Pakistan attack from the start as South Africa reached 94-0 by the end of the 15th over. Pakistan needed a breakthrough and it was provided by Saim as Pretorius’ slash found a diving Nawaz; the left-hander departing after having hit seven fours and a six in his 60-ball stay. De Kock, however, was proving a thorn for the hosts, dispatching anything loose to the fence and raised his half century with his fifth four — a sweep off Saim — in exactly 50 balls. Shaheen, however, brought back Naseem into the attack and after just three runs came off overs 23 and 24, the pacer struck when De Kock chopped him onto his stumps, having hit six fours and two sixes in his 72-ball knock. Pakistan got a foothold they wanted and one-drop Tony De Zorzi (18) departed in the next over, offering Saim a tame return. Breetzke and debutant Sinethemba Qeshile began the rebuilding job but just when the Proteas seemed to be gaining momentum, Nawaz struck to remove Qeshile (22) and Donovan Ferreira soon became Abrar’s first victim. Naseem cleaned up Breetzke off a no-ball but bounced back after that disappointment by getting George Linde caught behind two balls later.\nSouth Africa reached the 40-over mark at 211-6. The visitors were eyeing a closing flourish with Breetzke and Bosch but Pakistan hit back again when Abrar ended the former’s stay and then had Bjorn Fortuin lbw on the next ball. Bosch, however, got stuck in and took South Africa past 250 — muscling away Shaheen for consecutive boundaries in the 45th over and repeating the trick in the next over by Abrar — before seeing his stumps dismantled by a searing yorker by Shaheen in the penultimate over. Naseem picked up his third wicket in the last over when he cleaned up tailender Lizaad Williams. Saim and fellow opener Fakhar’s measured approach saw the side reach 53-0 in the first 10 overs. The duo stayed compact, avoiding any rash shots, but when opportunities came, they pounced on them. After the pair added 34 more to the partnership, Saim (39 off 42, four fours and six) was trapped leg-before by South African spinner Linde, who surprised the left-hander with a quicker one. Fakhar (45 off 57, four fours and two sixes) then holed Ferreira out to Fortuin in the deep before Fortuin struck gold with the ball, shooting in one to get Babar out lbw as Pakistan felt the heat at 106-3 by the end of the 20th over. The hosts reached 129-3 halfway through the innings before Salman, and Rizwan at the other end amped up the run-rate, the latter flourishing with a lofted cover drive and a sweep for fours as Pakistan crossed the 150-run mark in the 29th over. Boundaries, though, were at a premium after that – only three coming from overs 30 to 36; all of them from Rizwan’s bat. He raised his half century off 66 balls in the 37th over but fell soon after, having hit six fours in his 74-ball knock, finding Pretorius in the deep off Bosch. Hussain, though, got going with a cracking cover drive for four, which left Pakistan needing 58 off the last 10 overs. South Africa had restricted the boundaries in the next three overs but there was no stopping the singles as Hussain and Salman kept rotating the strike, chipping away at the total until the latter hoisted Ferreira down the ground for a sumptuous six to bring up his half-century off 56 balls. Hussain made 22 off 25 with two fours before falling in the 46th over and was soon followed by Hasan Nawaz, stumped off Linde, before Salman departed on the last ball of the 48th over when he skied Lungi Ngidi to Ferreira – having only got the fifth four of his 71-ball innings on the previous delivery. Nawaz, though, settled any nerves or creeping doubts when he launched Ferreira down the ground for six and despite him falling with the scores level, Pakistan got through with two balls to spare.",

      "title_orig": "Dick Cheney, former US vice president who pushed for Iraq war, dies at 84",
      "summary_orig": "Dick Cheney, a driving force behind the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, who was considered by presidential historians as one of the most powerful vice presidents in US history, has died at age 84, his family said in a statement on Tuesday. Cheney died on Monday night from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said. The Republican — a former Wyoming congressman and secretary of defence — was already a major Washington player when then-Texas governor George W Bush chose him to be his running mate in the 2000 presidential race that Bush went on to win. As vice president from 2001 to 2009, Cheney fought vigorously for an expansion of the power of the presidency, having felt that it had been eroding since the Watergate scandal that drove his one-time boss Richard Nixon from office. He also expanded the clout of the vice president’s office by putting together a national security team that often served as a power centre of its own within the administration. Cheney was a strong advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was among the most outspoken of Bush administration officials warning of the danger from Iraq’s alleged stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons were found. He clashed with several top Bush aides, including Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and defended “enhanced” interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects that included waterboarding and sleep deprivation. Others, including the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the UN special rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights, called these techniques “torture”. His daughter Liz Cheney also became an influential Republican lawmaker, serving in the House of Representatives but losing her seat after opposing Republican President Donald Trump and voting to impeach him in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters. Her father agreed with her and said he would vote for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in 2024. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” said the man who had long been a foe of the left. Cheney was troubled much of his life by heart problems, suffering the first of a number of heart attacks at age 37. He had a heart transplant in 2012. Taking on Iraq Cheney and then-defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who had been colleagues in the Nixon White House, were key voices pushing for the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. In the run-up to the war, Cheney suggested there might be links between Iraq and Al Qaeda and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. A commission on the 9/11 attacks later discredited this theory. Cheney predicted US forces would be “greeted as liberators” in Iraq and that the troop deployment — which would last around a decade — would “go relatively quickly … weeks rather than months”. Although no weapons of mass destruction were found, Cheney in later years insisted that the invasion was the right decision based on the intelligence at the time and the removal of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power. Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney (L) points out something to Texas Governor and Republican presidential candidate George W Bush during a campaign stop July 26, 2000 in Casper, Wyoming, the US. — Reuters/File More than a decade earlier, as defence secretary under President George HW Bush, Cheney had directed the US military operation to expel an Iraqi occupation army from Kuwait in the first Gulf War. He urged Bush senior to take an uncompromising line against Iraq after Saddam Hussein sent his troops to occupy Kuwait in August 1990. But at that point, Cheney did not support an invasion of Iraq, saying the United States would have to act alone and that the situation would become a quagmire. Because of Cheney’s long ties to the Bush family and experience in government, George W Bush chose him to head his vice presidential search in 2000. Bush then decided the man doing the search was the best candidate for the job. Upon his re-entry into politics, Cheney received a $35 million retirement package from oil services firm Halliburton, which he had run from 1995 to 2000. Halliburton became a leading government contractor during the Iraq War. Cheney’s oil industry links were a subject of frequent criticism by opponents of the war.

He himself was never drafted. According to his biographer, John Nichols, Cheney repeatedly applied for deferments and exemptions to avoid conscription. “Cheney reacted to the prospect of wearing his country’s uniform like a man with a deadly allergy to olive drab,” Nichols wrote in The Nation magazine in 2011.

      "summary_en": "Dick Cheney, a driving force behind the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, who was considered by presidential historians as one of the most powerful vice presidents in US history, has died at age 84, his family said in a statement on Tuesday. Cheney died on Monday night from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said. The Republican — a former Wyoming congressman and secretary of defence — was already a major Washington player when then-Texas governor George W Bush chose him to be his running mate in the 2000 presidential race that Bush went on to win. As vice president from 2001 to 2009, Cheney fought vigorously for an expansion of the power of the presidency, having felt that it had been eroding since the Watergate scandal that drove his one-time boss Richard Nixon from office. He also expanded the clout of the vice president’s office by putting together a national security team that often served as a power centre of its own within the administration. Cheney was a strong advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was among the most outspoken of Bush administration officials warning of the danger from Iraq’s alleged stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons were found. He clashed with several top Bush aides, including Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and defended “enhanced” interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects that included waterboarding and sleep deprivation. Others, including the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the UN special rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights, called these techniques “torture”. His daughter Liz Cheney also became an influential Republican lawmaker, serving in the House of Representatives but losing her seat after opposing Republican President Donald Trump and voting to impeach him in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters. Her father agreed with her and said he would vote for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in 2024. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” said the man who had long been a foe of the left. Cheney was troubled much of his life by heart problems, suffering the first of a number of heart attacks at age 37. He had a heart transplant in 2012. Taking on Iraq Cheney and then-defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who had been colleagues in the Nixon White House, were key voices pushing for the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. In the run-up to the war, Cheney suggested there might be links between Iraq and Al Qaeda and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. A commission on the 9/11 attacks later discredited this theory. Cheney predicted US forces would be “greeted as liberators” in Iraq and that the troop deployment — which would last around a decade — would “go relatively quickly … weeks rather than months”. Although no weapons of mass destruction were found, Cheney in later years insisted that the invasion was the right decision based on the intelligence at the time and the removal of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power. Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney (L) points out something to Texas Governor and Republican presidential candidate George W Bush during a campaign stop July 26, 2000 in Casper, Wyoming, the US. — Reuters/File More than a decade earlier, as defence secretary under President George HW Bush, Cheney had directed the US military operation to expel an Iraqi occupation army from Kuwait in the first Gulf War. He urged Bush senior to take an uncompromising line against Iraq after Saddam Hussein sent his troops to occupy Kuwait in August 1990. But at that point, Cheney did not support an invasion of Iraq, saying the United States would have to act alone and that the situation would become a quagmire.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf has been suspended for Pakistan’s first two ODI matches against South Africa on November 4 and 6 after the ICC sanctioned several Indian and Pakistani players on Tuesday for breaching the Code of Conduct during matches played at the Asia Cup. Haris and Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in September for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against arch-rivals India, ESPNCricinfo reported . “Rauf was seen responding to heckling from Indian fans by signalling 6-0 with his hands and making gestures depicting the downing of aircraft, in apparent reference to the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May this year,” the report read. “Farhan had celebrated his fifty by mimicking a gunshot.” In a press release today, ICC confirmed the outcomes of several Code of Conduct proceedings arising duirng the Asia Cup. “The hearings were conducted by members of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees following incidents in the matches between India and Pakistan on September 14, 21 and 28,” the press release said. During the Sept 14 India v Pakistan match, India’s Suryakumar Yadav “was found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which relates to conduct that brings the game into disrepute”. He was fined 30 per cent of his match fee and received two demerit points. The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its Sept 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”. Sahibzada was found guilty of the same offence and was issued an official warning, receiving one demerit point. Haris was also found guilty of the same offence and fined 30pc of his match fee, resulting in two demerit points. The hearing  was conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson. During the Sept 21 encounter between the neighbouring countries, India’s\nArshdeep Singh was found not guilty of an alleged breach of Article 2.6, “which pertains to using a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting, and therefore no sanction was imposed.” The hearing was conducted by ICC Match Referee Andy Pycroft. During the Asia Cup final on Sept 28, Jasprit Bumrah (India) accepted a charge under Article 2.21 for conduct that brings the game into disrepute and the proposed sanction of an official warning, which resulted in one demerit point, ICC said. “As he accepted the sanction, no formal hearing was required.” The ICC said that following a hearing conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson, Haris was again found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21. He was fined 30pc of his match fee and received two additional demerit points. “This takes Rauf’s total to four demerit points within a 24-month period, resulting in two suspension points under the ICC’s disciplinary framework. “In accordance with the Code, Rauf is therefore suspended for Pakistan’s ODI games against South Africa on Nov 4 and 6 2025,” ICC said.",

      "summary_en": "Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf has been suspended for Pakistan’s first two ODI matches against South Africa on November 4 and 6 after the ICC sanctioned several Indian and Pakistani players on Tuesday for breaching the Code of Conduct during matches played at the Asia Cup. Haris and Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in September for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against arch-rivals India, ESPNCricinfo reported . “Rauf was seen responding to heckling from Indian fans by signalling 6-0 with his hands and making gestures depicting the downing of aircraft, in apparent reference to the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May this year,” the report read. “Farhan had celebrated his fifty by mimicking a gunshot.” In a press release today, ICC confirmed the outcomes of several Code of Conduct proceedings arising duirng the Asia Cup. “The hearings were conducted by members of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees following incidents in the matches between India and Pakistan on September 14, 21 and 28,” the press release said. During the Sept 14 India v Pakistan match, India’s Suryakumar Yadav “was found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which relates to conduct that brings the game into disrepute”. He was fined 30 per cent of his match fee and received two demerit points. The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its Sept 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”. Sahibzada was found guilty of the same offence and was issued an official warning, receiving one demerit point. Haris was also found guilty of the same offence and fined 30pc of his match fee, resulting in two demerit points. The hearing  was conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson. During the Sept 21 encounter between the neighbouring countries, India’s\nArshdeep Singh was found not guilty of an alleged breach of Article 2.6, “which pertains to using a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting, and therefore no sanction was imposed.” The hearing was conducted by ICC Match Referee Andy Pycroft. During the Asia Cup final on Sept 28, Jasprit Bumrah (India) accepted a charge under Article 2.21 for conduct that brings the game into disrepute and the proposed sanction of an official warning, which resulted in one demerit point, ICC said. “As he accepted the sanction, no formal hearing was required.” The ICC said that following a hearing conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson, Haris was again found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21. He was fined 30pc of his match fee and received two additional demerit points. “This takes Rauf’s total to four demerit points within a 24-month period, resulting in two suspension points under the ICC’s disciplinary framework. “In accordance with the Code, Rauf is therefore suspended for Pakistan’s ODI games against South Africa on Nov 4 and 6 2025,” ICC said.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Tuesday said it has restored flight operations with some alternate arrangements after delays due to what it called a “strike” by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP). However, the SAEP stated there was no strike from their side and the engineers were only adhering to mandatory safety and certification protocols. PIA’s flight operations were disrupted across the country last night after the engineers’ group refused to issue clearances to aircraft, claiming that they could not compromise on travel safety. The PIA said in a statement today: “A de-recognised entity, SAEP, in order to pressurise the management, tried to halt the operations during late hours of yesterday (Monday) night with their nefarious design to sabotage the privatisation process.“ It asserted that the PIA’s management team, along with key officials of the engineering department, immediately responded to the situation. “By using alternative means and working tirelessly overnight and day, [the airline] restored the operations, thus mitigating the impact of already delayed flights for subsequent operations,” the statement added. The airline assured the public that “flight operations are being fully restored and customer convenience is our utmost priority and that our operations run smoothly”. According to the PIA, a total of seven flights — three from Islamabad, two from Karachi, and one each from Lahore and Sialkot — departed after delays ranging from four to 14 hours. Five flights were cancelled by readjusting the load, and alternates were offered to the passengers. A protest had been ongoing for the last two-and-a-half months, with the engineers fastening black ribbons around their arms while working. However, the situation escalated when the SAEP members discontinued issuing clearance to airplanes, disrupting the flight operations and leaving hundreds of passengers stranded at the Islamabad, Lahore and Kara­chi airports. SAEP president Abdullah Jadoon told Dawn that more than 570 aircraft engineers associated with the PIA were on strike and vowed to continue it until their demands were fulfilled. Earlier today, a senior SAEP member had denied that the society was staging a strike. They insisted that the engineers were only adhering to mandatory safety and certification protocols as per their responsibilities. “Unfortunately, instead of addressing long-pending professional and financial concerns, the PIA management has chosen to label lawful compliance as disruption, which is misleading,” the SAEP member said. A spokesperson for the PIA had said the SAEP had no legal status and alleged that the main aim of this movement was to sabotage PIA’s privatisation, which was in its final stages. Similar delays have occurred at nearly all major airports in the last two months due to engineers’ protests seeking a pay hike and other issues. Flights impacted According to the details provided by the PIA, flights that departed after the adjustment of revised slots/crew arrangement included the following: These images show the flight path and details for PK761, which departed from Karachi for Jeddah after a delay of 12 hours. — screengrab via flightradar24 Delayed departure: PK747 Lahore to Madina, with 316 passengers after 14 hours’ delay PK761 Karachi to Jeddah, with 160 passengers after 12 hours’ delay PK300 Karachi to Islamabad, with 139 passengers after 4 hours’ delay PK741 Islamabad to Madina, with 305 passengers after 6 hours’ delay PK233 Islamabad to Dubai, with 162 passengers after 9 hours’ delay PK245 Islamabad to Dammam, with 180 passengers after 7 hours’ delay PK755 Sialkot to Riyadh, with 142 passengers after 7 hours’ delay On-time: PK783 Karachi to Toronto with 104 passengers PK701 Islamabad to Manchester with 329 passengers Separately, five flights were cancelled by readjusting the load, and alternates were offered to the passengers.",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Assembly lawmakers affiliated with the opposition party PTI filed a petition in the Lahore High Court on Tuesday, seeking the declaration of several provisions related to the recently promulgated Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) 2025 as ultra vires to the Constitution. Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Muhammad Moeenuddin Riaz, Hafiz Farhat Abbas and Ali Imtiaz filed the petition against the legislation that was bulldozed through the assembly last month amid the opposition’s protest. The Punjab government has been named as a respondent in the plea, and Justice Sultan Tanvir will hear this petition, according to lawyer Abuzar Salman Niazi. The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn , says that Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act are “unconstitutional, unreasonable [and] illegitimate”. These provisions “brazenly and patently contravene” Articles 8 (laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights\nto be void), 9 (security of person), 17 (freedom of association), 32 (promotion of local government institutions) and 140-A (local government) of the Constitution, the petition further states. The petitioners contend that “a careful reading of the PLGA, 2025, makes it crystal clear that the same is a restrictive law aimed at curtailing and limiting the powers of elected representatives of the local governments”. “Furthermore, it also undermines the genuine political process as it limits political choices of the voters. It mandates elections on non-party basis, which [is] tantamount to violating the most basic political freedoms enunciated in the Constitution,” the petition reads. It says, “This newly elected law, which effectively introduced the systematic elimination of political choice, threatens the ideals of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam”. Moreover, the law also “violates the freedom of association and the right to life and dignity”, the petition says, adding, “Such a legal arrangement disenfranchises the people by censoring the spectrum of their choice. This will lead people to feel alienated and marginalised.” The petitioners have moved the court to declare Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act “ultra vires to the Constitution in terms of Article 8 […], being inconsistent with and in derogation of fundamental rights provided under Article 9 and 17 and also in direct conflict with Article 140-A of the Constitution”. The petitioners have also requested the court to suspend the operation of the above-mentioned sections of the PLGA, 2025, during the pendency of the plea. Legislation and election The legislation was bulldozed through the Punjab Assembly on October 13, following the Election Commission of Pakistan’s strong intervention and announcement that much-delayed local government elections in the province would be held under the PLGA 2022 in the last week of December. The ECP had rejected all excuses of the Punjab government in finalising and enacting the new PLGA and launched its delimitation process in the province from October 9. The ECP order, however, was reversed on Oct 21 in light of the new legislation after a request by the Punjab government, which was given more time to finalise the delimitation and demarcation rules. Later, the ECP said local government elections in Punjab would not be possible before the second quarter of next year, as it would not have all the prerequisites to hold the electoral exercise during the current year. PTI’s objections The treasury had steamrolled the PLGA bill through the Punjab Assembly amid strong protests and disruptions by the opposition. Subsequently, the PTI announced on November 2 that the legislation would be challenged in the LHC. PTI leaders have expressed strong reservations about the non-party-based, one-vote, multi-member union council model, saying that the non-party system would weaken the role of political parties and place administrative officers in control rather than elected local representatives, undermining local government powers. They say the centralisation of financial powers goes against the spirit of local autonomy, while the authority to appoint administrators for an indefinite period is unconstitutional. They have demanded the restoration of direct elections for union council chairmen, the establishment of a fixed five-year tenure and a clear election schedule for local governments and strict restrictions on executive interference and administrators’ powers.",

      "title": "‘Threatens the ideals of democracy’: PTI challenges Punjab’s new local government law in LHC",
      "summary": "Punjab Assembly lawmakers affiliated with the opposition party PTI filed a petition in the Lahore High Court on Tuesday, seeking the declaration of several provisions related to the recently promulgated Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) 2025 as ultra vires to the Constitution. Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Muhammad Moeenuddin Riaz, Hafiz Farhat Abbas and Ali Imtiaz filed the petition against the legislation that was bulldozed through the assembly last month amid the opposition’s protest. The Punjab government has been named as a respondent in the plea, and Justice Sultan Tanvir will hear this petition, according to lawyer Abuzar Salman Niazi. The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn , says that Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act are “unconstitutional, unreasonable [and] illegitimate”. These provisions “brazenly and patently contravene” Articles 8 (laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights\nto be void), 9 (security of person), 17 (freedom of association), 32 (promotion of local government institutions) and 140-A (local government) of the Constitution, the petition further states. The petitioners contend that “a careful reading of the PLGA, 2025, makes it crystal clear that the same is a restrictive law aimed at curtailing and limiting the powers of elected representatives of the local governments”. “Furthermore, it also undermines the genuine political process as it limits political choices of the voters. It mandates elections on non-party basis, which [is] tantamount to violating the most basic political freedoms enunciated in the Constitution,” the petition reads. It says, “This newly elected law, which effectively introduced the systematic elimination of political choice, threatens the ideals of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam”. Moreover, the law also “violates the freedom of association and the right to life and dignity”, the petition says, adding, “Such a legal arrangement disenfranchises the people by censoring the spectrum of their choice. This will lead people to feel alienated and marginalised.” The petitioners have moved the court to declare Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act “ultra vires to the Constitution in terms of Article 8 […], being inconsistent with and in derogation of fundamental rights provided under Article 9 and 17 and also in direct conflict with Article 140-A of the Constitution”. The petitioners have also requested the court to suspend the operation of the above-mentioned sections of the PLGA, 2025, during the pendency of the plea. Legislation and election The legislation was bulldozed through the Punjab Assembly on October 13, following the Election Commission of Pakistan’s strong intervention and announcement that much-delayed local government elections in the province would be held under the PLGA 2022 in the last week of December. The ECP had rejected all excuses of the Punjab government in finalising and enacting the new PLGA and launched its delimitation process in the province from October 9. The ECP order, however, was reversed on Oct 21 in light of the new legislation after a request by the Punjab government, which was given more time to finalise the delimitation and demarcation rules. Later, the ECP said local government elections in Punjab would not be possible before the second quarter of next year, as it would not have all the prerequisites to hold the electoral exercise during the current year. PTI’s objections The treasury had steamrolled the PLGA bill through the Punjab Assembly amid strong protests and disruptions by the opposition. Subsequently, the PTI announced on November 2 that the legislation would be challenged in the LHC. PTI leaders have expressed strong reservations about the non-party-based, one-vote, multi-member union council model, saying that the non-party system would weaken the role of political parties and place administrative officers in control rather than elected local representatives, undermining local government powers. They say the centralisation of financial powers goes against the spirit of local autonomy, while the authority to appoint administrators for an indefinite period is unconstitutional.

      "summary_orig": "Ticket holders and office bearers of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) from central Punjab and Lahore on Tuesday announced that they were severing ties with the now-banned organisation, stating that they were “standing with the state”. On Friday, all election ticket holders of the TLP from south Punjab announced that they had left the party, accusing it of pursuing an anti-state agenda that “aligns with the country’s enemies”. In a press conference at the Lahore Press Club today, multiple TLP ticket holders and office bearers announced their decision to step away from the religiopolitical group, with lawyer Usman Khizr Mangat saying that one can engage in politics within the state, but not against it. “Violence and mobs cannot create an impact by attacking the state,” he said. “Pakistan saw how these people carried out attacks. The government tried to start a dialogue, but the demands laid out were not accepted. “The state is like a mother, it tried to negotiate for six, seven days constantly with these people (the TLP) and outlined Pakistan’s situation and its standing in the international community.” Mangat noted that the unrest took place at a time when the country is “on red alert because of India in the east and Afghanistan in the northwest”. “You saw that buses were stolen, people were armed and school buses carrying girls were hijacked. What kind of politics is this?” he questioned. “Other parties protest under the Constitution and the law; they have the right to freedom of movement and freedom of speech, but you cannot exercise those rights at the cost of causing unrest within the state.” Mangat added that the TLP “always thought themselves above the Constitution, the law and the state”, adding that this attitude could not be tolerated in any case. “I, Barrister Usman Khizer Mangat, along with these ticket holders and officer bearers of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan, announce the end of our time with the TLP,” he stated. “I am here to show my solidarity with the state,” Mangat added. “I stand with my state under any circumstance; it is my state and my state has been established. If my politics compromises my state’s stability and security, it is better I do not engage in politics. “I am making it very clear that I am not under any pressure. With my free will, I am announcing that I am standing alongside the state.”",

The Wagah-Attari border — the only active land crossing between the two countries — was closed to general traffic following the conflict. Pilgrims queued up on the Indian side of the border on Tuesday morning, some carrying their luggage on their heads, as the Indian Border Security Force looked on.

They were received by Pakistani officials who presented them with flowers and showered them with rose petals. View this post on Instagram Indian media reported that around 1,700 were due to cross into Pakistan, although there was no immediate official confirmation from Indian authorities. The pilgrims will gather tomorrow at Nankana Sahib, Guru Nanak’s birthplace, about 80 kilometres west of Lahore by road, and later visit other sacred sites in Pakistan, including Kartarpur, where the guru is buried.

Indian newspapers reported Saturday that the government would allow “selected” groups to travel to Pakistan. The Kartarpur Corridor, a visa-free route that opened in 2019 that allows Indian Sikhs to visit the temple without crossing the main border, has remained closed since the conflict.

Sikhism is a monotheistic religion born in the 15th century in Punjab, a region spanning parts of what is now India and Pakistan. The frontier between the two countries was a colonial creation drawn at the violent end of British rule in 1947, which sliced the subcontinent into India and  Pakistan. While most Sikhs migrated to India during partition, some of their most revered places of worship ended up in Pakistan, including the shrines in Nankana Sahib and Kartarpur.

Indian Sikh pilgrims gesture upon their arrival in Pakistan after crossing the India-Pakistan Wagah border in Wagah on November 4, 2025, on the eve of celebrations marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism. — AFP/ Narinder Nanu Tensions remain high between Islamabad and New Delhi after the worst fighting since 1999 took place in May. The Wagah-Attari border — the only active land crossing between the two countries — was closed to general traffic following the conflict.

Indian Sikh pilgrims queue at the India-Pakistan Wagah border in Wagah on November 4, 2025, for their visit to Pakistan to pay their respects on the eve of celebrations marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism. — AFP/ Narinder Nanu AFP journalists on the Pakistani side of the Wagah-Attari border saw dozens of them entering Pakistan. They were received by Pakistani officials who presented them with flowers and showered them with rose petals. View this post on Instagram Indian media reported that around 1,700 were due to cross into Pakistan, although there was no immediate official confirmation from Indian authorities. The pilgrims will gather tomorrow at Nankana Sahib, Guru Nanak’s birthplace, about 80 kilometres west of Lahore by road, and later visit other sacred sites in Pakistan, including Kartarpur, where the guru is buried. An Indian Sikh pilgrim arrives in Pakistan after crossing the India-Pakistan Wagah border in Wagah on November 4, 2025, on the eve of celebrations marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism. — AFP/ Narinder Nanu Pakistan’s High Commission had said last week its decision was consistent with efforts to promote “inter-religious and inter-cultural harmony and understanding”. Indian newspapers reported Saturday that the government would allow “selected” groups to travel to Pakistan. The Kartarpur Corridor, a visa-free route that opened in 2019 that allows Indian Sikhs to visit the temple without crossing the main border, has remained closed since the conflict.

Sikhism is a monotheistic religion born in the 15th century in Punjab, a region spanning parts of what is now India and Pakistan. The frontier between the two countries was a colonial creation drawn at the violent end of British rule in 1947, which sliced the subcontinent into India and  Pakistan.
