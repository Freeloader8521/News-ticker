      "summary_orig": "MIRANSHAH: Security situation turned tense in the Mir Ali subdivision of North Waziristan on Thursday after an hour-long exchange of heavy fire between security forces and militants, leaving three security personnel and at least 20 civilians injured. According to security sources, Fitna al Khawarij militants attempted to attack a convoy on the main highway. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). According to local sources, the clashes erupted around noon in adjoining areas of Mir Ali. During the exchange, three security personnel sustained injuries, while mortar shells landed on residential houses in different localities of Hasokhel, Muski and Ippi areas, injuring 20 civilians, including women and children. Security forces cordoned off Mir Ali Bazaar and surrounding areas, while intermittent aerial firing was reported, triggering panic among residents. All commercial activities were suspended as people remained confined to their homes amid fear and uncertainty. Sources said the Bannu–Miranshah main road was completely closed for all kinds of traffic at the Khajori checkpost, resulting in long queues of vehicles and causing severe inconvenience to travelers. Meanwhile, a loud explosion was heard near the Muski area on Mir Ali–Khaisoor Road, while a security check post at the Hasokhel Bridge came under heavy weapon attack. Intense gunfire was exchanged between security forces and militants in the Muski area, leaving three security personnel injured, who were shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment. Medical Superintendent of Mir Ali DHQ Hospital, Dr Munir Aslam, said that 20 injured persons were brought to the hospital, seven of whom were referred to Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital in Bannu due to their critical condition, while treatment of the remaining injured is underway. Sources added that local residents, carrying white flags, continued to shift the injured to hospitals despite the difficult and dangerous situation. Reacting to the incident, Awami National Party North Waziristan President Malik Nisar Ali expressed grave concern, stating: “Unfortunately, a mortar shell also landed on my house, injuring three members of my family. Targeting innocent civilians, especially women and children, is deeply tragic and unacceptable.” He urged the authorities to ensure the protection of civilian population and take serious steps for lasting peace in the area. Following the incident, security forces launched a search operation in the area, while the situation remained tense till the filing of this report. Multiple incidents of terrorism and violence have been reported from Mir Ali lately. In October, four terrorists were killed by the security forces, foiling a suicide attack on a military camp in Mir Ali. Earlier this month, unidentified militants blew up a government primary school in Mir Ali, jeopardising the future of more than 600 school-going children. Days later, a government school in the same district with over 250 enrolled girls was destroyed with explosives.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed two major initiatives — a power transmission strengthening project and an accelerating state-owned enterprise (SOE) transformation programme — totalling $730 million that would relieve overloading of existing transmission lines and improve operational efficiency. At the beginning of this year, Pakistan and ADB signed an agreement to provide $200 million in support to the country’s ailing power distribution system through network improvement. In the recent agreement, the second power transmission strengthening project amounts to $330m, while the accelerating SOE transformation programme is worth $400m, according to a statement issued on Thursday. Ministry of Economic Affairs Secretary Muhammad Humair Karim appreciated the Manila-based lending agency’s role and its continued support in advancing critical infrastructure and governance reforms, the statement said. He highlighted that the transmission project would “enable reliable evacuation of 2,300 megawatt from upcoming hydropower projects, relieve overloading of existing transmission lines and enhance resilience under contingency conditions“. Karim added that the SOE transformation programme would improve “operational efficiency, particularly focusing on the National Highway Authority (NHA)”. The secretary emphasised that “both initiatives are transformative in nature as the transmission project will secure Pakistan’s energy future by strengthening the backbone of the national grid, whereas the SOE programme will enhance transparency, efficiency and sustainability of state-owned enterprises nationwide”. ADB Country Director Emma Fan appreciated Pakistan’s strong commitment to the initiatives, emphasising the significance of the transmission project in strengthening energy infrastructure. Fan highlighted that “the significance of the SOEs transformation programme comes at a critical time in Pakistan, and it will further strengthen the reform efforts” of Pakistan. Last month, ADB approved two loans totalling $330 million for Pakistan to build a transmission line from Islamabad to Faisalabad, the industrial hub of Punjab.",

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: Former special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Mirza Shahzad Akbar was attacked in the United Kingdom, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since April 2022, leaving him sustaining facial injuries, including “bruising and a fractured nose”, it emerged on Thursday. “I have been attacked and been in the hospital and with the police. Bruised and fractured [sic],” the ex-SAPM said in text messages after Dawn reached out to him, seeking confirmation of a post about the incident on PTI’s X account. The PTI’s post at 9:50pm PKT on Wednesday said Akbar was attacked at his house in Cambridge in the morning. “The attacker punched him repeatedly in the face, as a result of which his nose and jaw were fractured,” it said. “Local police have collected all details, and an investigation is underway,” the party said. Later, taking to the X platform, Akbar denounced the attack as “cowardly” and expressed “full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement” in ensuring justice. “Yesterday at approximately 8:08am, I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” he wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.” Akbar said he called the emergency services and was taken to the hospital, where he received medical treatment and was later discharged. “I sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose.” “The police have taken cognisance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he stated. He was also prevented from sharing further details on the advice of the authorities at this stage, including CCTV footage or photographs, saying he was not “at liberty”. “As doing so may compromise the ongoing investigation.” “I also urge the British government to ensure that England remains a safe place for everyone, including dissidents such as myself. I want to make one thing absolutely clear: if my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ are not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me.” He continued: “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out. I will continue to expose corruption, human rights violations, and the erosion of democratic norms in Pakistan.” He also clarified that any images circulating on social media purporting to show his injuries would be fake and AI-generated. Akbar, who was the accountability adviser in the PTI government, was previously also attacked in November 2023 at his home in Hertfordshire. The attacker, a masked individual, had thrown acidic liquid at Akbar, the former SAPM had shared in a post on X, adding that, “I will not be intimidated nor bow down to those who are doing this”. Akbar had linked the attack to the Al Qadir Trust case against PTI founder Imran Khan, alleging that security agencies were harassing him to give evidence against the ex-premier. Separately, he had told Dawn , “I have been sent messages in recent months by people who are clearly not happy with me. I’ve been told to mend my ways or else…” Akbar had initiated legal action against the government of Pakistan in a UK court in April 2024 over the acid attack. He told Dawn that he had also sent notices to the Pakistan High Commission in UK and other Pakistani officials. However, in May 2024, the Foreign Office had “categorically rejected” what it said were “preposterous” claims by Akbar about the alleged involvement of state officials in the 2023 acid attack on him. Meanwhile, Akbar has been declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court in a case pertaining to alleged controversial statements made on X. Subsequently, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott, handing over extradition papers for Akbar. While Pakistan does not have a formal extradition treaty with the UK, both countries do have an agreement in place whereby London can repatriate Pakistani nationals involved in crimes and violating immigration laws.",

      "summary_orig": "There have been multiple incidents of mobs vandalising Christmas decorations in India ahead of the festival, according to local media. The Indian Express has reported that a mob, armed with wooden sticks, vandalised Christmas decorations and installations at a mall in the Raipur city of India’s Chhattisgarh state. View this post on Instagram The report also mentioned that the incident took place on the same day when a Hindu organisation, Sarva Hindu Samaj, had called a Chhattisgarh bandh — a form of protest — against alleged religious conversions. According to The Hindu , the protest was also called following clashes over the “burial of a person from a converted family” in the Kanker district. The Indian Express carried an account of the incident as narrated by an employee of the mall, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Around 80-90 people barged in […] we were supporting the protest. For the last 16 years, since we began operations here, we have always supported bandh calls. But I have never seen such behaviour. The mob threatened us […] shouted at us. They indulged in violence,” the report quoted the employee as saying. Another employee, who also spoke anonymously to The Indian Express , said: “Some women were crying … they (the mob) were charging at all those who were trying to stop them. They kept saying we do not want to see Santa. People who had come to watch movies got scared.” Videos, that were said to be of the incident that took place at Magneto Mall, were also circulating on social media. Separately, The Hindu reported that members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad Bajrang Dal — which has been classified as a Hindu militant organisation by the US Central Intelligence Agency — vandalised a school, disrupting Christmas preparations, in the Nalbari district of Assam on Wednesday. The Hindu ’s report , citing police, said Bajrang Dal members also damaged festival items at shops in Assam. It further quoted an unidentified police official as saying that Bajrang Dal members also staged a protest against Christmas celebrations in Nalbari. “The activists entered the St Mary’s School of Panigaon village and vandalised the preparation of the Christmas Day programme. They burnt down the banner and posters of the celebration,” the official said, according to The Hindu . He was further quoted as saying that Bajrang Dal activists had raised the slogan of “Jai Shree Ram” and warned the administration against celebrating Christmas at the school. “They then went to various shops selling Christmas goods in Nalbari town and set fire to some items in front of the shops near the Jain Mandir in the town,” he said. The Hindu reported that Bajrang Dal members also burned goods at shops selling Christmas items. The report also carried a statement by Bajrang Dal Nalbari District Secretary Bhaskar Deka, who said while speaking to the media that “we don’t want Christian festivals here. Trade in any festival-related items of Indian origin. But we do not accept doing business with a festival of non-Indian origin.” An earlier report by the news website stated that Kerala’s Education Minister V. Sivankutty had “flagged incidents of school managements calling off Christmas celebrations under pressure, allegedly from Hindu far-right groups owing allegiance to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh”. The Hindu also reported that there was uproar on social media after videos of some individuals, reportedly belonging to Hindu right-wing groups, standing outside a church in Bareilly and reciting religious verses amid police presence before Christmas. “The group consisting of roughly 20-25 people also raised slogans of Jai Shree Ram ,” the report said.",

      "title_orig": "North Korea’s Kim visits nuclear subs as Putin hails ‘invincible’ bond",
      "summary_orig": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a nuclear submarine factory and received a message from Russia’s Vladimir Putin hailing the countries’ “invincible friendship”, Pyongyang’s state media said Thursday. North Korea and Russia have drawn closer since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, and Pyongyang has sent troops to fight for Russia. In return, Russia is sending North Korea financial aid, military technology and food and energy supplies, analysts say. The “heroic” efforts of North Korean soldiers in Russia’s Kursk region “clearly proved the invincible friendship” between Moscow and Pyongyang, Putin said in a message to Kim, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). Their work demonstrated the nations’ “militant fraternity”, Putin said in the message received by Pyongyang last week. The provisions of the “historic treaty” the two leaders signed last year, which includes a mutual defence clause, had been fulfilled “thanks to our joint efforts”, Putin wrote. South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have estimated that the North has sent thousands of soldiers to Russia, primarily to Kursk, along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems. Around 2,000 troops have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to South Korean estimates. North Korea acknowledged this month that its troops in Kursk had been assigned to clear mines and that some had died on deployment. KCNA reported Putin’s letter on the same day that it published details of Kim’s undated recent visit to a manufacturing base for nuclear-powered submarines. There, the North Korean leader vowed to counter the “threat” of South Korea producing its own such vessels. US President Donald Trump has given the green light for South Korea to build “nuclear-powered attack submarines”, though key details of the project remain uncertain. Photos published by KCNA showed Kim walking alongside a purportedly 8,700-tonne submarine at an indoor assembly site, surrounded by officials and his daughter Kim Ju Ae. In another image, Kim Jong Un smiles during an official briefing as Kim Ju Ae stands beside him. Pyongyang would view Seoul developing nuclear subs as “an offensive act severely violating its security and maritime sovereignty”, Kim Jong Un said, according to KCNA. It was therefore “indispensable” to “accelerate the radical development of the modernisation and nuclear weaponisation of the naval force”, he said. Kim clarified a naval reorganisation plan and learned about research into “new underwater secret weapons”, KCNA said, without giving details. Pyongyang’s defence ministry said it would consider “countermeasures” against US “nuclear muscle flexing”, a separate report said Thursday. Help from Russia? Only a handful of countries have nuclear-powered submarines, and the United States considers its technology among the most sensitive and tightly guarded military secrets. In the North’s first comments on the US-South Korea deal, a commentary piece by KCNA last month said the programme was a “dangerous attempt at confrontation” that could lead to a “nuclear domino phenomenon”. Hong Min, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP the submarine photos raise “considerable speculation” over whether Russia helped North Korea assemble a nuclear-powered submarine “within such a short time frame”. Kim also reportedly oversaw the test launch on Wednesday of “new-type high-altitude long-range anti-air missiles” over the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan.

      "summary_en": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a nuclear submarine factory and received a message from Russia’s Vladimir Putin hailing the countries’ “invincible friendship”, Pyongyang’s state media said Thursday. North Korea and Russia have drawn closer since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, and Pyongyang has sent troops to fight for Russia. In return, Russia is sending North Korea financial aid, military technology and food and energy supplies, analysts say. The “heroic” efforts of North Korean soldiers in Russia’s Kursk region “clearly proved the invincible friendship” between Moscow and Pyongyang, Putin said in a message to Kim, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). Their work demonstrated the nations’ “militant fraternity”, Putin said in the message received by Pyongyang last week. The provisions of the “historic treaty” the two leaders signed last year, which includes a mutual defence clause, had been fulfilled “thanks to our joint efforts”, Putin wrote. South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have estimated that the North has sent thousands of soldiers to Russia, primarily to Kursk, along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems. Around 2,000 troops have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to South Korean estimates. North Korea acknowledged this month that its troops in Kursk had been assigned to clear mines and that some had died on deployment. KCNA reported Putin’s letter on the same day that it published details of Kim’s undated recent visit to a manufacturing base for nuclear-powered submarines. There, the North Korean leader vowed to counter the “threat” of South Korea producing its own such vessels. US President Donald Trump has given the green light for South Korea to build “nuclear-powered attack submarines”, though key details of the project remain uncertain. Photos published by KCNA showed Kim walking alongside a purportedly 8,700-tonne submarine at an indoor assembly site, surrounded by officials and his daughter Kim Ju Ae. In another image, Kim Jong Un smiles during an official briefing as Kim Ju Ae stands beside him. Pyongyang would view Seoul developing nuclear subs as “an offensive act severely violating its security and maritime sovereignty”, Kim Jong Un said, according to KCNA. It was therefore “indispensable” to “accelerate the radical development of the modernisation and nuclear weaponisation of the naval force”, he said. Kim clarified a naval reorganisation plan and learned about research into “new underwater secret weapons”, KCNA said, without giving details. Pyongyang’s defence ministry said it would consider “countermeasures” against US “nuclear muscle flexing”, a separate report said Thursday. Help from Russia? Only a handful of countries have nuclear-powered submarines, and the United States considers its technology among the most sensitive and tightly guarded military secrets. In the North’s first comments on the US-South Korea deal, a commentary piece by KCNA last month said the programme was a “dangerous attempt at confrontation” that could lead to a “nuclear domino phenomenon”. Hong Min, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP the submarine photos raise “considerable speculation” over whether Russia helped North Korea assemble a nuclear-powered submarine “within such a short time frame”. Kim also reportedly oversaw the test launch on Wednesday of “new-type high-altitude long-range anti-air missiles” over the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan. The projectiles hit mock targets at an altitude of 200 kilometres (124 miles), KCNA said. That height, if correct, would be in space.

      "summary_orig": "Security forces neutralised 10 terrorists, including a high-value target, in separate intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district and Balochistan‘s Kalat district, the military’s media affairs wing said in separate statements on Thursday. On December 24, (yesterday) two khawarij were killed in an IBO in DI Khan‘s Kulachi area, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in Thursday’s statement, using the term designating members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location. Resultantly, two khawarij , including kharji ring leader Dilawar, were sent to hell,” the statement read. According to the ISPR, Dilawar was wanted by law enforcement agencies due to his involvement in terrorist activity and the government had put an Rs4 million bounty on him. The statement added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who remained actively involved in terrorist activities against the security forces and civilians. In a separate statement, the ISPR said security forces conducted an IBO in Kalat on December 24 (yesterday) on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan . The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. It said that during the operation, security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and, after an intense exchange of fire, eight Indian-sponsored terrorists were killed. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” ISPR said. It said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area, adding that the counterterrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out “foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. Earlier this month, 12 terrorists were killed during an IBO in Kalat. In March, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. In October, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged in the third quarter of 2025 due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.",

      "summary_orig": "Pope Leo decried conditions for Palestinians in Gaza in his Christmas sermon on Thursday, in an unusually direct appeal during what is normally a solemn, spiritual service on the day Christians across the globe celebrate the birth of Jesus. Leo, the first US pope, said the story of Jesus being born in a stable showed that God had “pitched his fragile tent” among the people of the world. “How, then, can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold?” he asked. Leo, celebrating his first Christmas after being elected in May by the world’s cardinals to succeed the late Pope Francis, has a more quiet, diplomatic style than his predecessor and usually refrains from making political references in his sermons. But the new pope has also lamented the conditions for Palestinians in Gaza several times recently and told journalists last month that the only solution in the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people must include a Palestinian state. Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October after two years of intense Israeli bombardment and military operations in the besieged enclave, but humanitarian agencies say there is still too little aid getting into Gaza, where nearly the entire population is homeless. In Thursday’s service with thousands in St. Peter’s Basilica, Leo also lamented conditions for the homeless across the globe and the destruction caused by the wars roiling the world. “Fragile is the flesh of defenseless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds,” said the pope. “Fragile are the minds and lives of young people forced to take up arms, who on the front lines feel the senselessness of what is asked of them and the falsehoods that fill the pompous speeches of those who send them to their deaths,” he said. Later on Thursday, the pope will deliver a twice-yearly “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message and blessing, which usually addresses global conflicts.",

      "summary_orig": "Fourteen countries including Britain, Canada, France and others have condemned the Israeli security cabinet’s approval of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank, prompting strong criticism from Tel Aviv. On Sunday, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that authorities had greenlit the settlements, saying the move was aimed at preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state. “On the ground, we are blocking the establishment of a Palestinian terror state,” said Smotrich, a vocal proponent of settlement expansion and a settler himself. Subsequently, fourteen countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Canada, issued a statement late on Wednesday urging Israel to reverse its decision. “We call on Israel to reverse this decision, as well as the expansion of settlements,” said a joint statement released by Britain, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Denmark, France, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain. Such unilateral actions, they said, “violate international law”, and risk undermining a fragile ceasefire in Gaza in force since October 10. They also reaffirmed their “unwavering commitment to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the two-state solution … where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side-by-side in peace and security”. “We recall that such unilateral actions, as part of a wider intensification of the settlement policies in the West Bank, not only violate international law but also risk fuelling instability,” the statement said. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rejected the statement by foreign countries in an X post late on Wednesday, saying the decision aimed to help address security threats faced by Israel. “Foreign governments will not restrict the right of Jews to live in the Land of Israel, and any such call is morally wrong and discriminatory against Jews,” Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said. “The cabinet decision to establish 11 new settlements and to formalise eight additional settlements is intended, among other things, to help address the security threats Israel is facing.” Since the start of Israel’s assault in Gaza in October 2023 following Hamas’s attack on Israel, calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state have multiplied, with several countries moving to formally recognise such a state. Among those countries were some of those that condemned the settlement expansion drive. Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents. Earlier this month, the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, all of which are illegal under international law, had reached its highest level since at least 2017. The latest approvals bring to 69 the total number of settlements approved over the past three years by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, one of the most right-wing in Israel’s history. The Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority has also condemned the latest approvals, accusing Israel of tightening its control over Palestinian land. It said the approvals were a continuation of “apartheid, settlement, and annexation policies that undermine the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people”.",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman returned to Dhaka on Thursday after nearly 17 years in exile, a homecoming the party hopes will energise supporters with Rahman poised to be the top contender for prime minister in the February 12 elections. Hundreds of thousands of supporters lined the route from the capital’s airport to the reception venue, waving party flags and carrying placards, banners, and flowers, while chanting slogans welcoming Rahman, as senior BNP leaders received him at the Dhaka airport under tight security. Rahman, 60, the son of ailing former prime minister Khaleda Zia, has lived in London since 2008 and led the BNP as acting chairman since 2018. Dressed in a light grey, finely checkered blazer over a crisp white shirt, Rahman exited the airport, removed his shoes to step barefoot onto Bangladeshi soil, and picked up a handful of earth in a symbolic gesture marking his return to the South Asian nation. He was seen standing beside the driver’s seat in a bus taking him to the reception venue, smiling and waving as crowds surged to catch a glimpse of their returning leader. He had been unable to return while facing multiple criminal cases at home. Rahman was convicted in absentia on charges that included money laundering and in a case linked to an alleged plot to assassinate former prime minister Sheikh Hasina but the rulings were overturned after Hasina was ousted last year in a student-led uprising, clearing the legal barriers to his return. His homecoming also carries personal urgency, with Khaleda Zia seriously ill for months. Party officials said Rahman would travel from the airport to a reception venue before visiting his mother. The political landscape has shifted sharply since Hasinas removal from power, ending decades in which she and Khaleda Zia largely alternated in office. A December survey by the US based International Republican Institute suggested the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats, with the Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race. Hasina’s Awami League party, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could disrupt the vote. Bangladesh is heading into the polls under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. While authorities have pledged a free and peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns, making Rahman‘s return a defining moment for the BNP and the country’s fragile political transition.",

      "summary_orig": "• Current trajectory serves no one’s interest, Pakistan tells Security Council • China, Russia slam US ‘bullying’ and ‘cowboy-like’ conduct • Caracas warns of self-defence against ‘oil grab’ • Islamabad seeks diplomatic approach to resolve Iran nuclear issue UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has called on all sides to exercise maximum restraint and de-escalate tensions, as the United States continued to interdict vessels off the coast of Venezuela, a situation that drew sharp condemnation from China and Russia at the UN Security Council. Pakistan’s deputy permanent representative to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon addressed the council during a meeting requested by Venezuela. He emphasised that the “current trajectory serves no one’s interest”. “In a world marred by polarisation with conflicts affecting the lives and livelihoods of millions around the globe, it is all but imperative to once again underscore the centrality and inviolability of the UN Charter and its core principles,” Mr Jadoon said. He specifically highlighted the prohibition on the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. “We firmly believe that the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of states, as enshrined in the UN Charter, are sacrosanct,” Mr Jadoon said. Reaffirming Pakistan’s position, he noted that while measures to counter transnational organised crime or narcotics trafficking are necessary, they must be cooperative and conform to international law. He urged engaged diplomacy to ensure the region remains a “Zone of Peace”. The sitting laid bare deep divisions between world powers. US Ambassador Mike Waltz asserted that sanctions would be enforced to the maximum extent to deprive Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of resources used to fund drug cartels. “The United States will do everything in our considerable power to protect our hemisphere, our borders and the American people,” Waltz said, claiming oil sales enable Maduro’s “narco-terrorist activities.” However, China and Russia slammed the US actions. Chinese envoy Sun Lei opposed “unilateralism and bullying”, demanding Washington heed the international community and uphold navigation safety. Venezuelan Ambassador Samuel Moncada rejected the US narrative, stating the threat is not drugs or security, but a desire for Venezuela’s oil and land. “The world knows that, if the scale of armed attacks continues, we will exercise, with all determination, our inalienable right to self-defence,” Moncada said. UN’s Assistant Secretary-General Mohamed Khaled Khiari noted that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stands ready to support diplomatic engagement, if requested by both parties. Council split on Iran Meanwhile, at another UN debate, Islamabad called for diplomatic engagement to resolve the Iran nuclear issue. “It is deeply regrettable that in recent months, divisions in the council and beyond have widened, taking us further away from the resolution of the issue,” Ambassador Jadoon told the 15-member council during a discussion on nuclear non-proliferation. He noted the situation has been complicated by unilateral actions and differing interpretations of the “snapback” mechanism. The council remains split over the legitimacy of holding meetings regarding the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement from which the US withdrew in 2018. Mr Jadoon cautioned that coercive measures would not bridge the gap and often hurt ordinary citizens. “We strongly believe that diplomacy and dialogue should be the guiding principles for the resolution of all outstanding issues concerning Iran’s nuclear program,” he said. He emphasised that the JCPOA framework could still prove useful if parties move forward with compromise. Mr Jadoon urged the restoration of trust in diplomatic engagement and stressed the critical role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in verifying compliance. The session marked the first meeting since France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the snapback mechanism to reimpose sanctions, citing Iran’s non-performance. Jay Dharmadhikari, France’s deputy permanent representative, warned that Iran’s lack of implementation constitutes a “grave threat”. He added that if brought to military enrichment levels, Iran’s stockpile would be sufficient “to produce 10 nuclear explosive devices”. Published in Dawn, December 25th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The Pakistani Consulate in Los Angeles issued a stern warning against a message circulating online and on messaging platforms that claims to be an “important notice” regarding Pakistan visas. Officials have confirmed that the message is false and is part of a pattern of phishing scams designed to collect sensitive personal and financial information from unsuspecting applicants. Upon accessing the consulate’s website, the following notice was displayed. A screenshot of a notice from the Pakistani Consulate in Los Angeles warning about unauthorised visa applications. — Screengrab A statement issued by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington stated: “The Consulate General disassociates itself from all such unauthorised individuals, agents, or entities and shall not be responsible for any loss, delay, misrepresentation, or other adverse consequences arising from engagement with them.” The fraudulent message falsely purports to come from the consulate and directs visa applicants to submit information through links that are not authorised by the government of Pakistan. Such scams are designed to harvest passport details, social security numbers, bank account information, and credit card data, which can later be used for identity theft, unauthorised transactions, financial fraud and other criminal activities. The consulate strongly reiterated that Pakistani visa applications must be submitted only through the official government online portal: https://visa.nadra.gov.pk . Visa applicants were urged to avoid intermediaries, agents, or unauthorised websites, regardless of claims of faster processing or special access. They were also advised to be cautious when sharing personal or financial information online, with the consulate adding that requests for social security numbers, bank details, or other identity-related data in relation to visa applications should be treated as red flags. The public was urged by the consulate to verify all information directly through official channels and to report any suspicious messages or websites to the relevant authorities. “This advisory is being issued in the public interest to protect applicants from scams that can have devastating financial and personal consequences,” officials said. Applicants looking for updated guidance and official visa information were instructed to visit the consulate’s website at https://pakconsulatela.org/visa-services . The warning comes amid a sharp rise in online fraud globally. According to the US Federal Trade Commission , consumers in the United States reported losing more than $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, a sharp increase over previous years, as scammers increasingly exploit phishing, identity theft, and impersonation tactics online. Data also show a significant rise in credit card fraud and identity theft, with hundreds of thousands of cases reported in 2025 alone, highlighting how criminals misuse personal and financial information once it is obtained. Cybersecurity researchers have documented an 18 per cent increase in phishing attacks in Pakistan during 2024, as criminals increasingly target individuals with deceptive links and spoofed communication. Courts in the United States and other countries have sentenced individuals involved in multi-million-dollar phishing and fraud schemes, where victims — often targeted through impersonation and phishing — were defrauded of large sums. Officials noted that victims of similar scams have, in some cases, lost their entire life savings, as stolen data is used to gain access to bank accounts, obtain fraudulent loans, or conduct unauthorised transfers.",

Officials noted that victims of similar scams have, in some cases, lost their entire life savings, as stolen data is used to gain access to bank accounts, obtain fraudulent loans, or conduct unauthorised transfers.",

      "summary_orig": "• Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar says TTAP has ‘conditionally resolved’ to take up govt offer • PTI spox puts the ball in Achakzai, Raja Nasir Abbas’ court; says Imran has barred party from entering any talks ISLAMABAD: A day after PM Shehbaz Sharif reiterated the government’s willingness to engage in a political dialogue, the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) exp­ressed its willingness to engage in such a process, albeit conditionally. At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. But if the spokesperson for the country’s main opposition party is to be believed, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is not interested in sitting across the table from the government. A meeting of opposition leaders was held on Wednesday, chaired by PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and attended by Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Sajid Tareen, Asad Qaiser, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, and Akhunzada Hussain Yousufzai, among others. Talking to Dawn , TTAP deputy chief Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that Wednesday’s huddle had resolved to hold talks with the government. Participants also agreed on the need for a new charter to address the country’s political and financial issues and the spiralling law and order situation, in order to give hope to the despondent masses. However, it was made clear that the dialogue process must have some clear goals. “The dialogue will be held for holding the transparent elections in future, appointment of chief elections commissioner with consensus, supremacy of the parliament, rule of law, assurance of human rights, and democratic and constitutional norms,” Mr Khokhar said. He said that Mr Achakzai has also held a meeting with Aleema Khan, Imran Khan’s sister, to discuss the proposal with her. It is worth mentioning that Mr Achakzai had previously assured National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq that all political parties would agree to restore the 1973 Constitution, he would be responsible for making sure that Imran Khan would sign on to the initiative. PTI stands firm But taking a diametrically opposite view, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram claimed that the party would steer clear of any negotiations with the federal government on the orders of Imran Khan himself. Speaking to ARY News a day earlier, Mr Akram – when asked if the PTI wants to negotiate with the government – categorically said that the party was “not interested”. “I met Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and he said that Imran instructed the party not to engage with the government in any way,“ he explained. However, in the same breath, he clarified that Mr Achakzai or Allama Raja Nasir have the authority to decide whether or not they want to talk. Mr Akram said that the two opposition alliance leaders would decide how to respond to the government’s invitation. He added that, while speaking with the TTAP, he noted that other “friends” within the alliance are in favour of talks. The party spokesperson also claimed that the same two men would also decide whether to call for a protest, or not. “Since Imran Khan instructed the PTI against starting talks, under the directions of Salman Akram Raja, we rejected the offer,” he said.

In February 2025, Ballon spoke before an American audience in a notable 60 Minutes interview, outlining her position on censorship succinctly: “Free speech needs boundaries.” In October 2024, she vowed to stop the “emotionalization of debates” by “regulating platforms”.

In addition to her running an official “trusted flagger” body under the DSA, she serves on Germany’s Advisory Council of the Digital Services Coordinator (DSC), which directly advises Germany’s DSC on the application and enforcement of the DSA. In February 2025, Ballon spoke before an American audience in a notable 60 Minutes interview, outlining her position on censorship succinctly: “Free speech needs boundaries.” In October 2024, she vowed to stop the “emotionalization of debates” by “regulating platforms”.

      "title": "UK politics: Government says it is ‘fully committed to free speech’ after campaigners’ US visa ban – as it happened",
      "summary": "Imran Ahmed and Clare Melford among five Europeans hit with visa bans over claims they wish to ‘suppress American viewpoints they oppose’ The Global Disinformation Index , which is run by Clare Melford, one of the two Britons on the list of five Europeans facing US visa restrictions because of their work to stop online disinformation and hate (see 9.28am ), has described the US state department’s decision as “immoral, unlawful and un-American”. In a reponse, a GDI spokesperson said: The visa sanctions … are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship. The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.
