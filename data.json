      "title_orig": "Terrorists receive ‘state patronage’ in Afghanistan: Sarfraz Bugti",
      "summary_orig": "Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Thursday that terrorists were receiving “state patronage” in Afghanistan, from where they launched attacks on Pakistan. His comments come against the backdrop of a tumultuous security situation in Balochistan, which has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces. Islamabad, for the last couple of years, has been insisting that terrorists use Afghan soil to lauch attacks across the country. Kabul, however, denies the allegations. Responding to a question during a press conference in Islamabad, CM Bugti reiterated the state’s narrative and said, “Terrorists were provided safe havens and places to run training camps in Afghanistan.” He highlighted that many among the recently killed terrorists were from Afghanistan. The CM called on the Taliban rulers in Afghanistan to abide by the Doha agreement, in which, he said Kabul had “committed not to let your soil be used against any country”. Bugti justifies 4G suspension Earlier in the press conference, he shared details of a intelligence-based operation conducted in Chagai yesterday, in which he two men were killed and another surrendered. He said one of the two killed “terrorists” was a lawyer by profession. He detailed that the lawyer was traced following some arrests over the killing of Pakistan Air Force men on May 8 in Dal Badin. “We observed him for two to three months, and yesterday surrounded his house. Then, through a loud speaker, we asked him to surrender, and as soon as we did that, firing started from their end.” A Federal Constabulary soldier was martyred, and retaliatory firing by security personnel led to a fire exchange which went on for two to three hours, he said, adding that eventually two of the “terrorists” were killed and their third companion surrendered. Answering a question, he said efforts were being made to gather terrorist organisations in Balochistan. He went on to say that this was “war” facilitated and funded by Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing. “They have foisted an intelligence-based war on us, and they are trying to bring together all those who want to destabilise Pakistan.” Bugti also touched upon the suspension of 4G mobile network services in Balochistan. “We faced criticism for suspending 4G services,” he said, clarifying that the authorities’ intention behind such moves was not to cause inconvenience for the people. “But, terrorists have started using means of communication that are beyond the capacity of our intelligence agencies,” he explained, adding that the suspension of mobile network services helped with tracking down and catching terrorists. In response to another questioned, he stressed the need to distinguish between the “youth” who had not taken up arms and those who had  taken up arms with the intention to break Pakistan. He questioned if an area was deprived of development and resources, should its people kill others. “How are you justifying violence on this basis? … We continue to link this violence to deprivation, unparalleled development, [violation of] human rights.” Balochistan, where violence has been a problem for long, continues to face neglect in terms of development and resource availability as well. Human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International, have also repeatedly called out the authorities over action against rights activists, notably Baloch Yakjehti Committee’s Mahrang Baloch. Mahrang has particularly raised voice over the issue of missing persons. Bugti also directed criticism toward her and said “there is a huge difference between self-disappearance and enforced disappearance”. “Unfortunately, you continue to buy the narrative being peddled out here, without thinking that the reality may be different from perception,” he continued. He also dispelled the impression that there “is a puppet government in Balochistan”. The CM also shared that the federal and Balochistan government had decided to carry out an exercise with the help of satellite images and would not get Pakistan’s poppy-free status get compromised. He was also asked about the reports of killing of a terrorist identified as Rehman Gul in Afghanistan, who is said to be the mastermind of the Jaffer Express attack . CM Bugti said these were unconfirmed reports. “It cannot be said that this is 100 per cent true. This is what we have been informed of from different sources … But I believe that this is a big success of ours, even if the reports are unconfirmed. Though, it seems they will be confirmed soon.”",

      "summary_orig": "A lady health worker, part of a vaccination team for the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) immunisation campaign for girls, was beaten up by local women in Mandi Bahauddin on Thursday, police said. Speaking to Dawn.com , Kuthiala Sheikhan Police Station House Officer (SHO) Sabir Hussain Sindhu said that the incident took place in Chak No 38. “LHW Ghulam Sughra was beaten up by local women while the vaccination campaign was being carried out at a school,” he said, adding that the health worker was also thrown to the ground during the assault. He said that a first information report (FIR) had been registered on the complaint of the health worker but no arrests have been made so far. The FIR of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , was registered at the Kuthiala Sheikhan Police Station under Sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code . In the FIR, Sughra stated that she was present along with the team at Chak No 38. The complainant said that the team was vaccinating children at an elementary school when they were attacked by a woman, identified as Parveen, along with 15 other women. “Parveen threw me to the ground and started punching me. The other women also started hitting me [and] they also swore at me,” she said. Vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities. The HPV vaccine, first launched in Pakistan in 2022, has now been rolled out nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. The immunisation campaign, which began on September 17, will conclude on September 27. The campaign is being implemented in three phases: Phase 1, running from 15–27 September 2025, covers Punjab, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Islamabad Capital Territory; Phase 2 will expand to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026; and Phase 3 will reach Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The goal is to vaccinate 90 per cent of girls aged 9–14 in Phase 1 regions by the end of 2025, and to sustain high coverage through routine immunisation in the coming years.",

      "summary_orig": "Indian police patrolled the northern city of Leh on Thursday, a day after protests demanding greater autonomy for India-held Ladakh turned deadly when security forces opened fire. At least five people were killed, 30 police officers were injured and several more protesters wounded. The city — usually bustling with tourists — appeared deserted, with most main roads blocked by coils of razor wire and guarded by police in riot gear, an AFP reporter said. Protests erupted on Wednesday, with crowds demanding greater autonomy in the sparsely populated, high-altitude desert region that is home to some 300,000 people and which borders China and Pakistan. India’s Ministry of Home Affairs said that an “unruly mob” had attacked police, reporting in a statement issued late on Wednesday that “more than 30” officers were injured. Protesters torched a police vehicle and the offices of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while officers fired tear gas and used batons to disperse crowds. “In self-defence, police had to resort to firing, in which unfortunately some casualties are reported,” the statement said. It did not give any details about deaths. However, a police officer told AFP that “five deaths were reported after the protests”. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to journalists. He said the “number of injured is in the dozens”. A police unit guarded the vandalised BJP office on Thursday, alongside the wreckage of a burned armoured vehicle. Around half of Ladakh’s residents are Muslim and about 40 per cent are Buddhist. It is classed as a “Union Territory” — meaning it elects lawmakers to India’s parliament but is governed directly by New Delhi. Wednesday’s demonstrations were organised in solidarity with prominent activist Sonam Wangchuk , who had been on hunger strike demanding either full federal statehood for Ladakh or constitutional protections for its tribal communities, land and fragile environment. New Delhi said the protesters were “instigated by his provocative speeches” and pointed out that efforts were continuing to discuss its governance. Modi’s government split Ladakh off from India-occupied Kashmir in 2019, imposing direct rule on both. New Delhi has yet to fulfil its promise to include Ladakh in the “Sixth Schedule” of India’s constitution, which allows people to make their own laws and policies. Omar Abdullah, chief minister of India-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, said people in Ladakh felt “betrayed and angry”. India’s army maintains a large presence in Ladakh, which includes disputed border areas with China. Troops from the two countries clashed there in 2020, killing at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.",

      "summary_orig": "A police constable was shot dead by unknown assailants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Thursday morning, police said. Bannu’s District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com that the incident occurred in the Bacha Khan Chowk area of the district’s Domel tehsil. “The police constable was on his way to arrive for duty when unknown armed motorcyclists opened fire on him,” Kulachi said. The DPO added that the constable, Qadus Khan, was critically injured and taken to the Khaleefa Gul Nawaz (KGN) hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. The spokesperson for the Bannu regional police, Khanzala Quraishi, told Dawn.com that the constable was the guard of the Wazir sub-divisional police officer. “After the incident, the station house officer of the Domel area went to the crime scene along with a team to investigate the incident,” Qureshi said. DPO Kulachi, meanwhile, said that an operation against the ‘terrorists’ was underway in various locations of the district to eliminate the threat from the area. He added that the funeral of the martyred police constable would be conducted later today. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies. Earlier this month, a police constable was martyred and ano­t­her seriously injured in a confrontation with three alleged terrorists at a police post in the Patesi Adda area of Mir Ali Tehsil, in the third attack on police personnel in the Bannu division that same week. Meanwhile, in August, at least three Frontier Corps personnel and two policemen were martyred in separate incidents in Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa’s Upper Dir, Kohat, and Mohmand districts.",

      "summary_orig": "Hundreds of thousands of people in southern China were clearing up Thursday after powerful Typhoon Ragasa crashed through Guangdong Province, ripping down trees, destroying fences and blasting signs off buildings. Ragasa churned into Guangdong, home to tens of millions of people, with winds up to 145 kilometres (90 miles) per hour, on Wednesday after sweeping past Hong Kong and killing at least 14 in Taiwan. AFP journalists at the impact point around the city of Yangjiang on Thursday saw fallen trees, while road signs and debris were strewn across the streets. A light rain and breeze still lingered as residents worked to clean up the damage; however, authorities have not reported any storm-related fatalities. On Hailing — an island administered by Yangjiang —relief workers attempted to clear a huge tree that had fallen across a wide road. Cars drove on muddy tracks to get around the wreckage as the team worked to saw off branches. A seafood restaurant had sustained heavy damage, its back roof completely collapsed, or in parts flown away entirely. “The winds were so strong, you could see it completely ripped everything apart,” said restaurant worker Lin Xiaobing, 50. “There’s no electricity (at home),” she said while helping clear up the mess inside the restaurant, where the floors were covered in water, mud, and debris. “Today, some homes still have electricity and others don’t.” The island is a popular holiday spot, and many locals rely on the tourism industry to make a living. “We can’t do business here during the National Day,” she said, referring to China’s annual holiday period centred on October 1 but that lasts until October 8. “We were planning to do some business this National Day to make up for it,” she added. “But now we may not be able to.” Taiwan fatalities Ragasa’s passage in Taiwan killed at least 14 and injured dozens more when a decades-old barrier lake burst in eastern Hualien county, according to regional officials who late Wednesday revised the death toll down from 17 after eliminating duplicate cases. Authorities initially said 152 people were unaccounted for, but later made contact with more than 100 of them and were still trying to confirm the actual number of missing. The storm made landfall in mainland China near Hailing Island on Wednesday evening. By that point, authorities across China had already ordered businesses and schools to shut down in at least 10 cities across the nation’s south, affecting tens of millions of people. Nearly 2.2 million people in Guangdong were relocated by Wednesday afternoon, but local officials later said several cities in the province started lifting restrictions on schools and businesses. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said Ragasa made its second landfall in Beihai, Guangxi, on Thursday morning as a tropical storm. Chinese authorities earmarked the equivalent of about $49.2 million to support rescue and relief work in regions hit by Typhoon Ragasa, Xinhua news agency said. Hong Kong battered Hong Kong authorities said 101 people were treated at public hospitals for injuries sustained during the typhoon as of Wednesday evening, with more than 900 people seeking refuge at 50 temporary shelters across the city. The Chinese finance hub recorded hundreds of fallen trees and flooding in multiple neighbourhoods. Many of the city’s tall buildings swayed and rattled in the harsh winds. About 1,000 flights were affected by Ragasa, the airport authority said Wednesday evening, adding that they expected to return to normal operations within the next two days. The top typhoon warning was downgraded in Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon after being in force for 10 hours, 40 minutes — the second-longest on the city’s record. Hong Kong’s weather service ranked the storm the strongest yet in the northwestern Pacific this year.",

      "summary_orig": "NEW DELHI: The Mum­b­ai police registered a case against 81-year-old business tycoon Nusli Nevil Wadia, the grandson of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah, and some of his family members among others for allegedly using forged and fabricated documents in their court proceedings against Ferani Hotels Pvt Ltd, news reports said. According to Hindustan Times , the FIR was registered following orders by the metropolitan magistrate court at Borivili, which directed the Bangur Nagar police to register an FIR against Nusli Wadia, Maureen Wadia, 78, Ness Wadia, 54, Jehangir Wadia, 52, H.J. Bamji, 75, K.F. Bharucha and R.E. Wandewala, 65, for alleged cheating and forgery. The case revolves around a 30-year-old development agreement between Wadia and Ferani Hotels on a plot of land in Malad, which Ferani Hotels was to develop with builder K. Raheja and pay Wadia 12pc of the gross sale proceeds. Disputes arose in 2008, leading to legal battles over Wadia’s share of sales and the management of the land. The case has involved allegations of mala fide, lack of authority, and commercial disputes, and has proceeded through various courts, including the Bombay high court and the Supreme Court. On Monday, the case was registered under Sections 3(5) (general explanations), 318(4) (cheating), 331(2) (punishment for house-trespass or house-breaking), 336(3) (forgery), 339 (possession of a document described in Section 337 or Section 338, knowing it to be forged and intending to use it as genuine), 340(2) (forged document or electronic record and using it as genuine), and 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. According to the FIR, Mahendra Chande, the chief executive officer of Ferani Hotels Private Limited and its group companies, complained to the police that the accused persons had allegedly forged documents and submitted them to the Bombay high court in 2010 in a commercial matter against them. Chande said he had lodged a complaint with the Bangur Nagar police station on March 15, and again with the Mumbai police commissioner on March 24, but the police did not register an FIR. Based on his complaint, the metropolitan magistrate court at Borivali on Sept 20 issued the order to the Bangur Nagar police station. “We are still verifying the complaint and will be able to comment on the matter only after scrutinising the bulky documents involved in the case,” said a police officer from Bangur Nagar police station. Despite text and WhatsApp messages, Nusli’s son, Ness Wadia, remained unavailable for comment, the paper said. Published in Dawn, September 25th, 2025",
