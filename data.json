      "summary_orig": "• Notes human rights are under a ‘full-scale attack’ worldwide • Highlights blatant violations in occupied Palestinian territory, warning that two-state solution is being undermined • UN rights chief Volker Turk says domination and supremacy are resurfacing globally GENEVA: The United Nations Secretary General on Monday called for a renewed international security architecture in response to a rapidly shifting global order. “We are living through a period of chaos and change…The international order that defined security relations for nearly eight decades is shifting rapidly,” said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. “Moving forward, we need to create a renewed international security architecture. This needs to be based on sober analysis of the international situation,” he added. “Human rights are under a full-scale attack around the world,” he told the opening of the UN Human Rights Council’s annual session in Geneva. “The rule of law is being outmuscled by the rule of force.” The UN secretary-general stressed that “this assault is not coming from the shadows, or by surprise. It is happening in plain sight — and often led by those who hold the greatest power”. He did not mention specific situations, although he did voice outrage at Russia’s war in Ukraine, where he said more than 15,000 civilians had been killed in four years of violence. “It is more than past time to end the bloodshed,” he said. Guterres also highlighted the “blatant violations of human rights, hum­an dignity and international law in the occupied Palestinian territory”. He charged that the trajectory in the conflict-torn territories under Israeli occupation was “stark, clear and purposeful: the two-state solution is being stripped away in broad daylight”. “The international community can­­not allow it to happen,” he insisted. Rights attacked ‘deliberately’ In his final in-person address to the UN’s top rights body, Guterres said the worst conflict-hit areas were not the only places where rights were eroding. “We are living in a world where mass suffering is excused away, where humans are used as bargaining chips, where international law is treated as a mere inconvenience.” UN rights chief Volker Turk echoed the concerns. In a “deeply worrying trend”, he warned that “domination and supre­macy are making a comeback”. “A fierce competition for power, control and resources is playing out on the world stage at a rate and intensity unseen for the past 80 years,” he warned. “The use of force to resolve disputes between and within countries is becoming normalised.” Turk highlighted how “the gears of global power are shifting”, calling for people to band together to protect rights and create “a strong counterbalance to the top-down, autocratic trends we see today”. Turk lambasted leaders, without naming them, who seem to believe “that they are above the law, and above the UN Charter”. “They claim exceptional status, exc­eptional danger or exceptional moral judgement to pursue their own agenda at any cost,” he said, poi­nting to how “some weaponise their economic leverage”.

      "summary_orig": "Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry briefed the Senate on Monday on recent strikes targeting terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan, pointing out that they were carried out following multiple attacks by militants in Pakistan and saying that Islamabad “cannot tolerate this anymore”. Pakistan carried out airstrikes on Afghanistan in a retaliatory operation late on Saturday night, targeting groups responsible for recent attacks in its territory. The strikes were conducted in retaliation for a series of suicide attacks in Islamabad , Bajaur , and Bannu that had claimed the lives of Pakistani security personnel and civilians. Mentioning these incidents, Chaudhry said they were “linked” to Afghanistan-based actors, adding that it was subsequently decided to give a “decisive response” to the neighbouring country. “As a result, our Air Force carried out strikes in three Afghan provinces, Paktika, Nangarhar and Khost on February 21,” he said, adding that there were reports of  the deaths of over 100 militants who “controlled terrorist networks” in the operation. He said the February 21 strikes were “precise” and “intelligence-based”. The minister insisted that they only targeted terrorists’ hideouts and training camps. He dispelled what he described as “false propaganda of civilians, mosques and seminaries getting hit” during the strikes. Chaudhry warned that if terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil continued, Pakistan reserved the right to carry out strikes in its defence. “We are not supposed to just attend funerals. The civilian leadership and armed forces are resolute that this cannot be tolerated anymore,” he asserted. He said, “Every drop of blood of our martyrs, be they from the security forces or civilians, will be avenged. Every corner of the country will be defended.”",

Opposing the resolution in the Sindh Assembly, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) had also declared it unconstitutional . On Monday, PPP’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, Sherry Rehman, denounced recent statements by certain federal ministers, ostensibly a reference to MQM-P’s Mustafa Kamal and Khaliq Maqbool Siddique. Rehman said that such reckless talk was not only unconstitutional but also a direct provocation to the unity of the federation. “Let me be clear: the PPP is the custodian of Sindh’s unity and no one will be allowed to undermine it,” she said. She said Sindh had always opened its arms to everyone, adding that the province’s resources had always been shared with the country since 1947. “To hear suggestions about dividing Karachi or Sindh is deeply alarming. This is not just an attack on a province, it is an attack on Pakistan itself,” she remarked. Rehman reminded the House that altering a province’s boundaries was a constitutional matter that required a two-thirds majority. “Those floating these ideas should first read the Constitution. Constitutional divisions require democratic majorities, not press conferences,” she remarked. Speaking about coalition partners, she said, “Our friends in MQM-P have always been part of the federal government. They have governed with every administration. May God grant them even more respect, but let no one confuse local political debates with a licence to redraw provincial maps.” She also stated that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had said that no one would be allowed to divide Pakistanis based on language or identity. “This party has shed blood, borne lashes, and endured imprisonment to uphold that principle,” she said. She further warned that Sindh had historically faced backdoor conspiracies. “Let me say it plainly: the majority in Sindh belongs to the PPP. If that bothers someone, what can we do? If they want a majority, then earn it the democratic way — face the people, earn their votes, and withstand the political struggle like PPP workers have always done,” she said. “From Shaheed Benazir Bhutto to President Asif Ali Zardari, our leadership has spent years behind bars for democracy. We have always put Pakistan before politics,” she said. “Anyone dreaming of dividing Sindh should abandon this dangerous fantasy. We know how to resist, we know how to oppose, and we will not tolerate any assault on Pakistan’s federal unity. This behaviour is unacceptable and will never be allowed to succeed,” she maintained. PPP Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi said that his party had always served the people without going into politics, whether or not people of any area voted for it. He pointed out that both MQM-P and Jamaat-i-Islami each had three leaders who served as Karachi mayor. “What had these six mayors given to Karachi? Nothing,” he said. He then said that the PPP’s mayorship of Karachi had delivered better results than MQM-P’s. He pointed out that an education conference was held at the Governor’s House, which was also attended by Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui. However, nothing about education was discussed, he lamented. Meanwhile, MQM-P Senator Khalida Ateeb opposed the resolution passed by the Sindh Assembly, terming it against the Constitution. Speaking on the floor of the Senate, she said the proposal to divide Sindh into rural and urban areas was initiated by the PPP-led Sindh government. She also questioned who introduced the quota system. She made it clear that the MQM-P never advocated for dividing Sindh but said there were calls for administrative units in all provinces across the country.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The government invited the opposition on Monday to hold talks and “strengthen and take forward” the Charter of Democracy — a 2006 document signed by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and late Benazir Bhutto, with the commitment to struggle against dictatorship. “Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the Charter of Democracy”, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said while addressing a Senate session in response to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas. Sanaullah said the government was willing to hold dialogue with the opposition, which would strengthen democracy, rather than opting for confrontation and deadlock. “We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks even when the PTI was in power. However, PTI founder Imran Khan was not ready to talk to politicians, he said, saying that his “stubbornness is a big hurdle” in the way of talks. Without naming anyone but seemingly referring to the establishment, Sanaullah went on to say that the opposition wanted talks with those who did not want to talk to it. He added that the government wanted the PTI to “become a part of Parliament by rejoining its standing committees”. The PTI had resigned from the standing committees in September last year. Sanaullah criticised the party on Monday for what he described as its “reluctance to become a part of the political process”. Continuing his rebuke of the opposition, the PM’s adviser stated: “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so.” But, he added, the government was ready to move forward in a democratic manner. He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations were held between political parties and not “through external forces”. On Imran’s health, he said the matter was before the court, and the government had implemented court directives regarding the PTI founder’s treatment. “On the PTI’s request, even an eye specialist was included in the medical board that examined Imran,” he highlighted. The incarcerated ex-prime minister’s health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January. Meanwhile, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game , with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran and not allowing his personal physicians to access him. The government denies these allegations. Speaking before Sanaullah, Opposition Leader Abbas criticised the authorities in connection with a recent days-long sit-in at the Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health. He claimed that “Parliament was shut down to block the entry and exit of parliamentarians who were staging a peaceful protest”. “Is this not an insult to Parliament?” he questioned. Abbas said the protesters’ only demand was Imran’s medical treatment should be carried out in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family. He neither wanted a release from jail, nor his family made any such demand, Abbas said, adding that the PTI founder only sought a fair trial for himself. Calling for the need to restore confidence on both sides, he urged the government not to transform this issue into a “full-blown crisis” and move forward. He also gave the assurance that the opposition would “never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government at the dictation of any dictator, despite the legitimacy of the [incumbent] government being questioned”. But, he stressed, the government should address and resolve the issue of Imran’s eye ailment and treatment. He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions. While Sanaullah was responding to Abbas’ allegation of “shutting down Parliament”, he said the opposition’s call to its workers to reach the protest venue prompted the police to “make security arrangements”.",

      "summary_orig": "Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Monday that Hamas may soon be given a deadline to lay down its weapons. “We estimate that in the coming days, Hamas will be given an ultimatum to disarm and completely demilitarise Gaza,” Smotrich said in an interview with public broadcaster Kan. Israel invaded the Gaza Strip in 2023 , in retaliation for Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack. Under the first phase of a US-sponsored ceasefire in Gaza intended to halt two years of Isreali onslaught in Gaza, the Israeli army withdrew to positions behind a so-called Yellow Line, but still controls over half of the territory. Both Hamas and Israel accuse each other of near-daily ceasefire violations, with the health ministry in Gaza reporting 615 people killed by Israeli forces since the truce started. The Israeli military says it has lost five of its soldiers during the same period. If Hamas does not comply with the Israeli ultimatum to disarm, the army “will have international legitimacy and American backing to do it itself, and the IDF (military) is already preparing for this and is making plans”, said the minister, who is a member of Israel’s security cabinet charged with approving large-scale military operations. The second ceasefire phase, which officially began last month, calls for a gradual withdrawal of the Israeli army and the disarmament of Hamas, which the militant group has vehemently opposed. “The (Israeli military) will definitely enter and occupy Gaza if Hamas does not disarm,” Smotrich said. Asked how the military would do this, he said, “There are two or three alternatives right now that we are examining”. The peace plan put forward by US President Donald Trump also calls for the establishment of a 20,000-strong peacekeeping force, called the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which several countries have committed troops. Asked how the Israeli army would operate against Hamas when foreign soldiers were deployed on the ground, Smotrich said the latter would “pull out very quickly and allow the (Israeli military) to enter. This is coordinated with the Americans.” “By the way, I don’t yet see them going in that fast,” he added of the ISF. A security source in Gaza, meanwhile, said on Monday that Israeli forces shelled Beit Lahia in the north. The source also said that Israeli tanks opened fire in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, where at least two air strikes were also conducted. Israel’s military said Monday that Israeli troops “eliminated” a fighter who had crossed the Yellow Line into Israeli-held territory the previous day.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reached Qatar on Monday night on a two-day official visit, state-run PTV News reported. He was received by Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Muhammad bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Aamer and other diplomatic staff at King Hammad International Airport, a post by PTV News on social media platform X said. The premier is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and his aide, Tariq Fatemi, according to the post. Earlier, the Foreign Office (FO) said the premier would meet the Qatari emir during the visit. The visit is being undertaken at the invitation of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the FO said in a press release . During his visit, PM Shehbaz will hold a bilateral meeting with Sheikh Tamim, “covering the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, including political engagement, economic collaboration, energy partnership, and people-to-people exchanges”, the FO added. “The two sides will also explore new avenues of cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, energy, infrastructure development, and manpower export.” The FO highlighted that both countries shared a “longstanding partnership characterised by mutual trust and close coordination at regional and international forums”. “The visit will also provide an opportunity for both leaderships to exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest, reaffirming their resolve to work closely for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” the statement added. “The visit reflects the deep-rooted fraternal ties between the two countries and underscores their shared commitment to further strengthening multifaceted cooperation,” the FO noted. Qatar and Pakistan share strong diplomatic ties, rooted in their shared faith and values. PM Shehbaz undertook two visits to Doha in September 2025 — one to express solidarity after Israeli attacks on the country and a second to attend a joint summit of the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). He had held meetings with the Qatari emir on both occasions, reaffirmed Pakistan’s “all-out support and solidarity” for the Gulf state.",

      "summary_orig": "Defending T20 World Cup champions India need “two big performances” to reach the semi-finals after Sunday’s huge defeat to South Africa, said their assistant coach. India came into the T20 World Cup as hot favourites on home soil but were thrashed by 76 runs in the Super Eights as 80,000 fans at the massive Narendra Modi stadium were stunned into silence. In their first chase of the tournament, India’s batting came up woefully short in the face of some disciplined South Africa bowling. India collapsed to 111 all out in 18.5 overs in response to South Africa’s 187-7 as their 12-match win streak in the T20 World Cup came to a crashing end. The magnitude of the defeat has left India with a desperate net run-rate of -3.8 and likely needing to win their last two Super Eight matches convincingly to make it to the semi-finals. Anything less and India will need to rely on a combination of other results going their way. “Very disappointed in the performance,” said Ryan ten Doeschate. “When you set out to win a World Cup, don’t expect someone to come and deliver it to you halfway through,” the assistant coach added. “We’ve messed up on a grand scale and now the onus is on this group of guys to turn it around and put in two solid performances.” India are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe in Super Eights, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals. India next face giant-killers Zimbabwe, who have already beaten Australia and Sri Lanka , on Thursday in Chennai. South Africa play the West Indies the same day in Ahmedabad where Aiden Markram’s side could put one foot firmly in the semi-finals with another win. ‘Cloak came off’ “Obviously, with the way the group goes, you need at least four points to get through now, and it’s going to need two big performances and a big bounce back from everyone,” said Ten Doeschate. India’s fragile batting was exposed against an in-form bowling attack led by left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 4-22 from 3.5 overs. Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 with his left-arm spin. India’s media tore into the team on Monday morning. “The night the cloak came off,” blazed a headline in The Indian Express newspaper. “Sloppy India reach point of no return,” said the Hindustan Times . India’s ultra-aggressive left-handed opening pair have failed to fire, leaving a shaky middle order to pick up the pieces. Ishan Kishan was out without scoring to Markram on Sunday, while the world’s top- ranked T20 batter Abhishek Sharma fell to Jansen for 15, his only runs of the tournament so far after three ducks. “It’s certainly not panic stations,” said Ten Doeschate, who hinted there could be discussions about India’s batting line-up. “If those guys (Ahbishek and Ishan) bat for six overs, the score is going to be 70-plus,” said Ten Doeschate. “So can we get them to temper the way they’re playing and be a little bit smarter? “Or do we just let them go on the way they are? “Or do we bring in a right-hander at the top and make a change somewhere in the middle?” Captain Suryakumar Yadav agreed India need to use their brains in the first six-over power play when only two fielders are allowed on the boundary. “Chasing 180-185, you can’t win the game in the power play, but you might lose it,” he said after his side stumbled to 31-3 after six overs, which became 43-4 a few balls later and then 51-5. “We lost too many wickets in the power play.” The 2024 champions also have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side have ever won the trophy on home soil.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump renewed his condemnation of the Supreme Court on Monday after it ruled against his sweeping tariff programme last week, vowing to turn to other tariff powers and licences but giving no details. “The court has also approved all other Tariffs, of which there are many, and they can all be used in a much more powerful and obnoxious way, with legal certainty, than the Tariffs as initially used,” he wrote in a social media post. Trump said on Saturday he would raise a temporary tariff from 10 per cent to 15 pc on US imports from all countries, the maximum level allowed under the law, a day after the court ruled that Trump had exceeded his presidential authority when he imposed an array of higher tariff rates under an economic emergency law. In his post on Monday, Trump also pointed to the potential use of licences to pressure countries, writing that “incomprehensibly, according to the ruling, (I) can’t charge them a Licence fee — BUT ALL LICENCES CHARGE FEES, why can’t the United States do so? You do a licence to get a fee! The opinion doesn’t explain that, but I know the answer!” Wall Street futures and the dollar dropped early on Monday amid confusion over the US trade policy, while oil prices initially fell over uncertainty for global growth and fuel demand over the latest tariff hike before being steadied by news of planned US-Iran talks. The decision and Trump’s subsequent actions are already impacting his trade deals struck over the past year, with China urging Washington to scrap tariff measures, the European Union set to freeze its agreement and India delaying planned talks. Trump used his social media post to again lash out against the justices who ruled against him, which included two whom he had appointed during his first term in the White House. In its ruling, authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, the court reasserted its power to check the power of the president. The president also expressed concern that the top court could rule against his administration’s bid to restrict birthright citizenship in its forthcoming decision in that case.",

      "title": "Trump renews attack on US Supreme Court, vows other tariffs and licences",
      "summary": "US President Donald Trump renewed his condemnation of the Supreme Court on Monday after it ruled against his sweeping tariff programme last week, vowing to turn to other tariff powers and licences but giving no details. “The court has also approved all other Tariffs, of which there are many, and they can all be used in a much more powerful and obnoxious way, with legal certainty, than the Tariffs as initially used,” he wrote in a social media post. Trump said on Saturday he would raise a temporary tariff from 10 per cent to 15 pc on US imports from all countries, the maximum level allowed under the law, a day after the court ruled that Trump had exceeded his presidential authority when he imposed an array of higher tariff rates under an economic emergency law. In his post on Monday, Trump also pointed to the potential use of licences to pressure countries, writing that “incomprehensibly, according to the ruling, (I) can’t charge them a Licence fee — BUT ALL LICENCES CHARGE FEES, why can’t the United States do so? You do a licence to get a fee! The opinion doesn’t explain that, but I know the answer!” Wall Street futures and the dollar dropped early on Monday amid confusion over the US trade policy, while oil prices initially fell over uncertainty for global growth and fuel demand over the latest tariff hike before being steadied by news of planned US-Iran talks.

      "summary_orig": "LAKKI MARWAT: Three Federal Constabulary men were martyred in a terrorist attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district on Monday, according to officials. In a statement, Karak police spokesperson Shaukat Khan said terrorists initially carried out a quadcopter attack on the Federal Constabulary fort in the Dargah Shaheedan area. The spokesperson said that during the initial attack, the terrorists detonated four rounds of explosives, causing injuries to four Federal Constabulary personnel. However, the Federal Constabulary personnel retaliated. The exchange of fire went on for a long time, he added. He said that Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the site of the incident to rush the injured to a nearby hospital; however, the ambulances were ambushed by the terrorists near Ghole Banda Dam, leading to the martyrdom of three Federal Constabulary personnel. Three Rescue 1122 officials were left injured, he said. He added that following the attack, the ambulances caught fire and were destroyed. Karak District Police Officer Saood Khan also confirmed that three Federal Constabulary men were martyred as the ambulance carrying the injured came under attack. Separately, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Asif Khan, in a statement, said that two of the injured rescue personnel were in critical condition. Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari condemned the attack, terming it “cowardly and inhumane,” as per a statement issued by the PPP’s media cell. “Those who opened fire on an ambulance have proven that they reject the teachings of Islam,” Bilawal was quoted as saying. Bilawal, as per the statement, paid tribute to the martyred personnel and offered condolences to their families. He stressed that “a Muslim cannot even think of harming an animal, let alone a human being, in the holy month of Ramazan”. Last week, a terrorist attack, involving an explosive-laden vehicle, on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel. On February 18, two Federal Constabulary personnel were injured when unidentified assailants attacked a checkpost in the Salgazi area of Wazir subdivision. In November last year, in a major attack on the force, three Federal Constabulary personnel were martyred in a suicide attack on the force’s headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area. KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.",

      "summary_orig": "Members of the opposition protested outside the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday to demand that the cases of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately scheduled for hearing and that he be allowed to meet his family. Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja participated in the protest, which ended at around 2pm. Other leaders present included chief whip Amir Dogar, MNAs Ali Muhammad Khan and Shahid Khattak, MPA Shafiullah Jan, and Muhammad Hussain. The protest participants also demanded that “a complete medical examination be conducted through his personal doctors”, according to a post by the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on X. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was convicted in another case regarding state gifts recently. His health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January. Abbas urged the government to take “confidence-building measures”, which included allowing Imran’s family and personal physicians to meet him. “We consider these rulers Form-47 ones but any talks would still be held with them,” the Senante opposition leader said . Speaking to reporters, the PTI secretary general said the party does not trust “any government report”, apparently referring to one submitted to SC by the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). “This is not a moment where we organise a movement or hold talks,” Raja said, noting the concerns of Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum regarding her brother’s life. Raja further lamented that they were unable to meet with Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, adding that he would again attempt to meet him. “Not just the PTI founder’s eye but his body needs a checkup,” he contended. Ali Muhammad also demanded that Imran be taken to a hospital, adding that the ex-premier was “not asking for anything special”. “It is through the leader’s eye that the nation sees its future,” the MNA remarked, calling for the PTI founder to be taken to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital as demanded by his personal doctors and family. “With so much concerns being raised about Imran Khan’s eye issue everywhere especially at the level of apex court of the country, it’s strange the government has taken so long to take the critical decision of shifting him to hospital. It’s about time that government shouldn’t delay more,” he had said earlier on X. Meanwhile, Khattak lamented that “our leaders’ treatment has been made into an issue of ego”. He further said that Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi was also jailed in “political cases”. The lawmaker asserted that he and other party leaders would “again and again come here (to SC) and keep reminding” of the matter. A video shared by the TTAP earlier in the day showed the opposition members sitting on the lawn outside the SC and talking amongst themselves. Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the SC’s intervention earlier this month led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which said only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting outrage and protests from the opposition against his treatment. The TTAP had held a sit-in at the Parliament House the previous week for the fulfillment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination, eventually calling it off after five days in deference to the holy month of Ramazan.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed nine terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to statements issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday. According to the military’s media affairs wing, an IBO in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan was conducted on Monday, on the “reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Khawarij” . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban. The ISPR said that security personnel “effectively engaged the khawarij location” during the operation, and after an intense exchange of fire, four terrorists were killed. It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from “Indian-sponsored killed khawarij , who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”. Earlier in the day, ISPR shared the details of the IBO in Balochistan’s Pishin in a separate statement. It said security forces had killed five terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during that IBO on Sunday. The military’s media wing said the terrorist tashkeel (formation) was engaged with multiple weapons. “After an intense fire exchange, suicide bomber kharji cowardly blew himself up and four other Indian sponsored khawarij were hunted down and sent to hell.” Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from the killed terrorists during the Pishin IBO as well, said the ISPR, and added that the militants were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”. Both statements by ISPR stated: “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i -Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.“ Separately, the spokesperson for Balochistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) also confirmed the IBO in Pishin and the losses suffered by the terrorists in an earlier statement. He said that the terrorists had “planned to attack the police lines and Cadet College Pishin”. President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists in Pishin, state-run Radio Pakistan reported . The president said the IBO “against the Indian-backed Fitna al Khawarij reflects the nation’s resolve in the fight against terrorism”. He said the war against terrorism will continue until the “complete eradication of this menace”. In his statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted that the security forces were making great progress against terrorist groups “every single day with courage, determination and strength”, Radio Pakistan reported. The premier reaffirmed that the entire nation stood with armed forces and law enforcement authorities in the war against terrorism. Last week, on February 18, the CTD said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts. These included eight armed men killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area and “six terrorists were killed” during an IBO in Barkhan, according to the CTD. A day later, ISPR said security forces had also killed four “Indian-sponsored” terrorists in an IBO in KP’s Lakki Marwat district. The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Additional reporting by Saleem Shahid.",

According to the military’s media affairs wing, an IBO in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan was conducted on Monday, on the “reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Khawarij” . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban. The ISPR said that security personnel “effectively engaged the khawarij location” during the operation, and after an intense exchange of fire, four terrorists were killed. It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from “Indian-sponsored killed khawarij , who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”. Earlier in the day, ISPR shared the details of the IBO in Balochistan’s Pishin in a separate statement. It said security forces had killed five terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during that IBO on Sunday. The military’s media wing said the terrorist tashkeel (formation) was engaged with multiple weapons. “After an intense fire exchange, suicide bomber kharji cowardly blew himself up and four other Indian sponsored khawarij were hunted down and sent to hell.” Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from the killed terrorists during the Pishin IBO as well, said the ISPR, and added that the militants were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”. Both statements by ISPR stated: “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i -Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.“ Separately, the spokesperson for Balochistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) also confirmed the IBO in Pishin and the losses suffered by the terrorists in an earlier statement. He said that the terrorists had “planned to attack the police lines and Cadet College Pishin”. President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists in Pishin, state-run Radio Pakistan reported . The president said the IBO “against the Indian-backed Fitna al Khawarij reflects the nation’s resolve in the fight against terrorism”. He said the war against terrorism will continue until the “complete eradication of this menace”. In his statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted that the security forces were making great progress against terrorist groups “every single day with courage, determination and strength”, Radio Pakistan reported. The premier reaffirmed that the entire nation stood with armed forces and law enforcement authorities in the war against terrorism. Last week, on February 18, the CTD said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts. These included eight armed men killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area and “six terrorists were killed” during an IBO in Barkhan, according to the CTD. A day later, ISPR said security forces had also killed four “Indian-sponsored” terrorists in an IBO in KP’s Lakki Marwat district. The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Additional reporting by Saleem Shahid.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran said on Monday that any attack by the United States, including limited strikes, would be an “act of aggression” that would precipitate a response, after US President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran. “With respect to your first question concerning the limited strike, I think there is no limited strike,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said at a briefing in Tehran attended by an AFP journalist. “An act of aggression would be regarded as an act of aggression. Period. “And any state would react to an act of aggression as part of its inherent right of self-defence ferociously so that’s what we would do.” Trump said on Friday he was considering a limited strike if Tehran did not reach a deal with the US. “I guess I can say I am considering that,” he replied following a question from reporters. The two countries concluded a second round of indirect talks in Switzerland on Tuesday under Omani mediation, against the backdrop of a major US military build-up in the region. Further talks, confirmed by Iran and Oman but not by the US, are scheduled for Thursday. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading the negotiations for Iran, while the United States is represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump is wondering why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military deployment, Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday. Baqaei responded on Monday by saying that Iranians had never capitulated at any point in their history.",
