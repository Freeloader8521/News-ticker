      "summary_orig": "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s coalition swept to a historic election win on Sunday, paving the way for promised tax cuts that have spooked financial markets and military spending aimed at countering China. The conservative Takaichi, Japan’s first female leader who says she is inspired by Britain’s “Iron Lady” Margaret Thatcher, was projected to deliver as many as 328 of the 465 seats in parliament’s lower house for her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP alone sailed past the 233 seats needed for a majority less than two hours after polls closed, on track for one of its best-ever election results. With her coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, Takaichi now has a supermajority of two-thirds of seats, easing her legislative agenda as she can override the upper chamber, which she does not control. Winter election brings blizzard of votes “This election involved major policy shifts — particularly a major shift in economic and fiscal policy, as well as strengthening security policy,” Takaichi said in a television interview as the results rolled in. “These are policies that have drawn a great deal of opposition … If we have received the public’s support, then we truly must tackle these issues with all our strength.” A voter pets a dog outside a polling station during the general election, in Uonuma, Niigata Prefecture, Japan on Feb 8, 2026. — Reuters Takaichi, 64, called the rare winter snap election to capitalise on her buoyant personal approval ratings since she was elevated to lead the long-ruling LDP late last year. Voters have been drawn to her straight-talking, hardworking image, but her nationalistic leanings and emphasis on security have strained ties with Japan’s powerful neighbour China, while her promises of tax cuts have rattled financial markets. Residents trudged through snow to cast their ballots, with record snowfall in some parts snarling traffic and requiring some polling stations to close early. It was only the third post-war election held in February, with elections typically called during milder months. Outside a polling station in the town of Uonuma in the mountainous Niigata prefecture, 54-year-old teacher Kazushige Cho braved below-freezing temperatures and deep snow to cast his vote for Takaichi’s LDP. “It feels like she’s creating a sense of direction — like the whole country is pulling together and moving forward,” Cho said. But Takaichi’s election promise to suspend an 8 per cent sales tax on food to help households cope with rising prices has rattled investors concerned about how the nation with the heaviest debt burden among advanced economies will fund the plan. Takaichi said on Sunday she would speed up consideration of the sales tax cut while focusing on fiscal sustainability. “Her plans for the cut in the consumption tax leave open big question marks about funding and how she’s going to go about making the arithmetic add up,” said Chris Scicluna, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe in London. Backed by Trump, bashed by China The head of Japan’s top business lobby Keidanren, Yoshinobu Tsutsui, welcomed Takaichi’s win as restoring political stability. “Japan’s economy is now at a critical juncture for achieving sustainable and strong growth,” he said. The LDP, which has ruled for almost all of Japan’s postwar history, had lost control of both houses in elections over the past 15 months under Takaichi’s predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba. Takaichi has managed to turn around the party’s fortunes by striking a chord with younger voters. She has even sparked a “ sanakatsu ” craze, roughly translated as “Sanae-mania”. Her handbag and the pink pen she scribbles notes with in parliament have been in high demand. US President Donald Trump last week gave Takaichi his “total endorsement” and said he would host her at the White House next month. China will also be parsing the result. Weeks after taking office, Takaichi touched off the biggest dispute with Beijing in over a decade by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, the democratic island claimed by China. China responded with several countermeasures, including urging its citizens not to travel to Japan. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te was one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate Takaichi, saying he hoped her victory would “bring a more prosperous and secure future for Japan and its partners in the region”. Takaichi’s strong mandate could accelerate her plans to bolster Japan’s defences, further angering Beijing, which has cast her as attempting to revive its militaristic past. Japan’s Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi told TV stations on Sunday evening that he wanted to push ahead with policies to strengthen Japan’s defence while pursuing dialogue with China. “Beijing will not welcome Takaichi’s victory,” said David Boling, principal at the Asia Group, a firm that advises companies on geopolitical risk. “China now faces the reality that she is firmly in place — and that its efforts to isolate her completely failed.”",

      "summary_orig": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A policeman was shot dead, while two of his family members were injured on Sunday after unidentified armed men opened fire on them in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan district, officials said. According to the police, the incident took place in the Boya area of Upper South Waziristan. The policeman, identified as Constable Zahidullah Wazir, was martyred on the spot, while his father, Ghulam Nabi, and brother, Waheed, sustained serious injuries. All three belonged to the Shakai tehsil of Upper South Waziristan District. “The martyred police constable was the brother of Muhammad Jan Wazir, a political moharrir of the district administration, Lower South Wazirista,” Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Wana Circle, Asghar Ali Shah, told Dawn. “The condition of the injured persons is critical; however, they are being provided immediate medical treatment.” Following the incident, the unidentified assailants managed to flee the scene. Police rushed to the area soon after receiving information, cordoned off the locality, and collected evidence, they said. The injured persons and the body of the martyred police constable were taken to the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) Wana, where medical treatment of the injured was underway. DSP Shah added that the police have formally initiated an investigation to determine the nature and motives of the attack. He clarified that the family of political Moharrir Wazir had “no personal enmity with anyone, and initial evidence suggested that the incident was an act of terrorism.” Over the past year, the law and order situation in Lower and Upper South Waziristan as well as North Waziristan, has remained highly volatile, causing serious concern among local tribes. Tribal elders have stated that frequent incidents have created fear and insecurity among the population. According to police reports, incidents of bomb blasts, targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom, killings of civilians, and attacks on police and security forces’ check posts have intensified in the three tribal districts of KP, posing serious threats to overall peace and stability in the region. The situation gradually worsened since November 2022, when the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government and vowed to target security personnel, police and personnel of law enforcement agencies.",

      "summary_orig": "A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to boycott the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15. Sources, however, say that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan. ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja landed in Lahore during the day to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived in Lahore to partake in some meetings. Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport. Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said. The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter. Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting. Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials. The high-level visits come a day after the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup commenced. The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland. Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka. After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo. In response to the development even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC in a statement said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”. It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of. “The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated. A government source told Dawn at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh. “The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added. Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue. It was reported earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses. Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown . Pakistan, who edged out the Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate. Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE/ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR/QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lahore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections. The PTI — a part of the TTAP — had announced a strike today to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024 general elections , which it alleges were marred by rigging . The party also said it will observe a day of mourning following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives . A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported in Quetta. In Lahore, all major markets remained closed, primarily due to Sunday and the ongoing Basant festival . In the evening, the TTAP could not hold a torch-bearing rally outside Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque as planned, claiming road closures and the arrest of over two dozen workers. Despite the alleged arrests of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmed, as well as TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site. Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown against the party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located. However, police sources did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker. Speaking to the media, Abbas criticised the Punjab government for “supporting Basant and dance parties” in the wake of the Islamabad imambargah attack . Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had cancelled her Basant-related activities following the incident. “The law enforcement agencies failed badly to provide security to the masses, and that is why such a huge number of people lost their lives,” Abbas added. Meanwhile, Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.” He asserted that the movement will soon gain further momentum and stated that the whole nation was worried about PTI founder Imran Khan’s health. In his remarks, Ahmed termed Pakistan’s possible participation in the upcoming meeting of the United States-led Board of Peace as “unfortunate”. Yousafzai claimed that the shutter-down strike was successful in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and interior Sindh. “However, it was partially successful in Punjab, Karachi and Hyderabad,” he acknowledged. Earlier in the day, the TTAP and PTI shared purported visuals of shops shut in various cities, including KP’s Peshawar , Abbottabad , Balakot , Haripur , Bajaur , Upper Chitral and Lakki Marwat ; Sindh’s Hyderabad , Mirpurkhas , Umerkot , Badin and Nawabshah ; Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin , Mianwali , Muzaffargarh ; and Balochistan’s Quetta , Chaman , Zhob , and Kuchlak . It also posted videos showing PTI workers and supporters gathered in KP’s Kohat , as well as Balochistan’s Nasirabad , Qila Saifullah , Chaman and Pishin . KP In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A Dawn correspondent reported a partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. He expressed his gratitude to “all traders associations and transport associations of Haripur for their cooperation in showing solidarity” with TTAP’s call. PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders. PTI’s chapter arranged a gathering at Chowk Yadgar in the afternoon. Seating arrangement and panaflex boards could be seen at the venue prior to the event, with PTI banners hanging in front of closed shops. PTI KP Deputy Information Secretary Ikram Khatana had said party workers would gather at Hashtnagri Chowk around 12pm and later march through Rampura Bazaar to reach Chowk Yadgar. All the district chapters across the province were to arrange events, according to Khatana. In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests. PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under the MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found. Sindh All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. The PTI’s Karachi chapter also claimed that markets in Safoora Town , North Nazimabad , Landhi , Shah Faisal Colony , Model Town and Malir were shut by traders to record their protest silently. In another post, Sheikh contended, “This strike is not just a strike, it’s a referendum! Today’s nationwide strike has set a new precedent. “Historically, strikes in this province were enforced with sticks, threats, roadblocks, burning tyres, even bullets and arson.” He claimed, “This may be the first strike in Pakistan’s history where workers were not on the streets — yet the public itself shut everything down. That is not a strike; that is a referendum.” Punjab In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”. However, a Dawn correspondent in Lahore reported that markets exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with routine traffic movement observed. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival , which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level. Party leaders in the province also criticised police raids and arrests of workers on Saturday, alleging harassment of families during search operations. Islamabad, Rawalpindi Meanwhile, most of the markets in the federal capital remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Fawad Khan, a PTI supporter who was selling garments, said that he and other traders cannot afford to close their shops. “We are already hand-to-mouth, and I cannot starve my family. I am a follower of Imran Khan and even voted for his candidate, but I cannot afford to close the stall,” he said. People shop at the H-9 Sunday bazaar in Islamabad on Feb 8, 2026. — Ikram Junaidi Muhammad Faiq, a resident who had come for shopping, said that although they have sympathy for PTI, it was not possible for him to remain limited to his house on a Sunday. “I get only one day in a week to purchase grocery and I must do it,” he said. However, resident Muhammad Danish said that all the political parties were the same and they never cared about the masses. “When PTI was in power, they did not care about the masses and Imran Khan has been facing charges that he sold the [state] gifts. He used to give examples of different premiers that they come to office on bicycles but he himself travelled on a helicopter to go to office,” he said. “No one, including the establishment, cares about Pakistan; otherwise, we would not be suffering and facing such a situation,” he lamented. PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal had said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities. A local district administration official confirmed that the metro bus service that runs between the twin cities was suspended. The electric bus service operated by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was also suspended. However, traffic on the capital’s roads was reported to be the same as usual. Balochistan A complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in the provincial capital Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin in Quetta, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic. Mobile internet services have been suspended again , a Dawn correspondent reported. Workers of the PTI and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — which is headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — staged demonstrations in some areas of the city. Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. Police were reported to have used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and removed the barricades and the burning tyres to open the road for traffic. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. A small demonstration also took place near Airport Road, but police dispersed the participants and cleared the route for traffic. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. Protesters attempted to block inter-provincial roads, but police dispersed them, reportedly resorting to baton charges in Qila Saifullah. In Chaman, political workers pelted stones at the police, injuring one constable who was taken to a hospital. In an exchange on X, Balochistan government official Shahid Rind said in a reply to Achakzai that the Quetta Airport road usually displayed similar scenes as today on “a Sunday in winters”. In his post, Achakzai had shared a picture showing a deserted road. In a post, the TTAP said its workers had “blocked all roads” in Balochistan’s Loralai and Harnai . Tyres were also burned to block the road near Duki’s Eidgah Chowk, it said . PTI hails public ‘response’ In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. “It is a day of mourning over the stolen vote and terrorism in Balochistan and Islamabad,” he added. Recalling the Feb 8, 2024 elections, Raja termed it a “historic moment of the Pakistani nation’s democratic expression”. He highlighted that the people voted for PTI in support of its founder, Imran Khan despite “months-long oppression and snatching the electoral symbol”. He further said, “On that dark evening, the wolves who looted the votes of those young people and of the entire nation across the country, they negated the very existence of millions of human beings.” Meanwhile, KP CM Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for what he called a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike. In a social media post on X, he wrote: “I thank all Pakistanis for once again sending a clear message today to those who robbed them of their mandate that we stood with Imran Khan, we are standing with him today, and we will continue to stand with him. “Across Pakistan, people participated wholeheartedly in the shutter-down and wheel-jam strike, which is both encouraging and also fearsome for our opponents,” he claimed. “Today, Pakistanis once again rejected the imposed group and those who brought them to power,” the KP CM said. Furthermore, he said that “each small or big event holds great importance” in the opposition’s movement for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, and for the restoration of an independent judiciary. “We must neither abuse nor resort to bullets. We must continue our peaceful struggle within the framework of the Constitution and the law, so that no one gets an excuse to open fire,” CM Afridi said. He reiterated the PTI’s allegation that its supporters were fired upon during the Nov 26, 2024 protest in Islamabad. “Yet even today, Pakistanis are fearless and are not stepping back from any sacrifice,” the chief minister said, hailing the supporters’ courage. On the other hand, CM Maryam said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.” Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the public had “rejected the politics of incitement and division”, quipping that the “wheel-jam [strike] itself was jammed”. “The public is tired of protest politics and the PTI’s call was badly dismissed. There is hustle and bustle despite a Sunday,” he said on X. Minister for States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam also asserted that the public rejected the TTAP’s call for a wheel-jammed and shutter-down strike. “The people of KP have realised how long they can keep believing the false narrative that has been pushed for the last 13 years,” he said in a statement. Muqam said the people of KP wanted progress, peace and development. He claimed this was the first time he had seen a chief minister calling for businesses to be shut down. On Saturday, PTI leader Asad Qaiser had told Dawn the party had neither postponed nor cancelled its protest programme in the wake of the Islamabad attack. “The day will be observed as a National Day of Mourning and, at the same time, protests will be held across the country against rigging in the general election,” he said. Qaiser said the party would hold protests and a shutter-down strike “with the masses” against the alleged electoral manipulation. Additional input from Irfan Raza, Imtiaz Ali",

      "summary_en": "LAHORE/ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR/QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lahore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections. The PTI — a part of the TTAP — had announced a strike today to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024 general elections , which it alleges were marred by rigging . The party also said it will observe a day of mourning following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives . A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported in Quetta. In Lahore, all major markets remained closed, primarily due to Sunday and the ongoing Basant festival . In the evening, the TTAP could not hold a torch-bearing rally outside Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque as planned, claiming road closures and the arrest of over two dozen workers. Despite the alleged arrests of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmed, as well as TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site. Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown against the party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located. However, police sources did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker. Speaking to the media, Abbas criticised the Punjab government for “supporting Basant and dance parties” in the wake of the Islamabad imambargah attack . Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had cancelled her Basant-related activities following the incident. “The law enforcement agencies failed badly to provide security to the masses, and that is why such a huge number of people lost their lives,” Abbas added. Meanwhile, Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.” He asserted that the movement will soon gain further momentum and stated that the whole nation was worried about PTI founder Imran Khan’s health. In his remarks, Ahmed termed Pakistan’s possible participation in the upcoming meeting of the United States-led Board of Peace as “unfortunate”. Yousafzai claimed that the shutter-down strike was successful in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and interior Sindh. “However, it was partially successful in Punjab, Karachi and Hyderabad,” he acknowledged. Earlier in the day, the TTAP and PTI shared purported visuals of shops shut in various cities, including KP’s Peshawar , Abbottabad , Balakot , Haripur , Bajaur , Upper Chitral and Lakki Marwat ; Sindh’s Hyderabad , Mirpurkhas , Umerkot , Badin and Nawabshah ; Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin , Mianwali , Muzaffargarh ; and Balochistan’s Quetta , Chaman , Zhob , and Kuchlak . It also posted videos showing PTI workers and supporters gathered in KP’s Kohat , as well as Balochistan’s Nasirabad , Qila Saifullah , Chaman and Pishin . KP In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A Dawn correspondent reported a partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. He expressed his gratitude to “all traders associations and transport associations of Haripur for their cooperation in showing solidarity” with TTAP’s call. PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders. PTI’s chapter arranged a gathering at Chowk Yadgar in the afternoon. Seating arrangement and panaflex boards could be seen at the venue prior to the event, with PTI banners hanging in front of closed shops. PTI KP Deputy Information Secretary Ikram Khatana had said party workers would gather at Hashtnagri Chowk around 12pm and later march through Rampura Bazaar to reach Chowk Yadgar. All the district chapters across the province were to arrange events, according to Khatana. In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests. PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under the MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found. Sindh All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. The PTI’s Karachi chapter also claimed that markets in Safoora Town , North Nazimabad , Landhi , Shah Faisal Colony , Model Town and Malir were shut by traders to record their protest silently. In another post, Sheikh contended, “This strike is not just a strike, it’s a referendum! Today’s nationwide strike has set a new precedent. “Historically, strikes in this province were enforced with sticks, threats, roadblocks, burning tyres, even bullets and arson.” He claimed, “This may be the first strike in Pakistan’s history where workers were not on the streets — yet the public itself shut everything down. That is not a strike; that is a referendum.” Punjab In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”. However, a Dawn correspondent in Lahore reported that markets exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with routine traffic movement observed. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival , which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level.

Islamabad, Rawalpindi Meanwhile, most of the markets in the federal capital remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Fawad Khan, a PTI supporter who was selling garments, said that he and other traders cannot afford to close their shops. “We are already hand-to-mouth, and I cannot starve my family. I am a follower of Imran Khan and even voted for his candidate, but I cannot afford to close the stall,” he said. People shop at the H-9 Sunday bazaar in Islamabad on Feb 8, 2026. — Ikram Junaidi Muhammad Faiq, a resident who had come for shopping, said that although they have sympathy for PTI, it was not possible for him to remain limited to his house on a Sunday. “I get only one day in a week to purchase grocery and I must do it,” he said. However, resident Muhammad Danish said that all the political parties were the same and they never cared about the masses. “When PTI was in power, they did not care about the masses and Imran Khan has been facing charges that he sold the [state] gifts. He used to give examples of different premiers that they come to office on bicycles but he himself travelled on a helicopter to go to office,” he said. “No one, including the establishment, cares about Pakistan; otherwise, we would not be suffering and facing such a situation,” he lamented. PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal had said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities. A local district administration official confirmed that the metro bus service that runs between the twin cities was suspended. The electric bus service operated by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was also suspended. However, traffic on the capital’s roads was reported to be the same as usual. Balochistan A complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in the provincial capital Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut.

Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. Police were reported to have used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and removed the barricades and the burning tyres to open the road for traffic. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. A small demonstration also took place near Airport Road, but police dispersed the participants and cleared the route for traffic. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. Protesters attempted to block inter-provincial roads, but police dispersed them, reportedly resorting to baton charges in Qila Saifullah. In Chaman, political workers pelted stones at the police, injuring one constable who was taken to a hospital. In an exchange on X, Balochistan government official Shahid Rind said in a reply to Achakzai that the Quetta Airport road usually displayed similar scenes as today on “a Sunday in winters”. In his post, Achakzai had shared a picture showing a deserted road. In a post, the TTAP said its workers had “blocked all roads” in Balochistan’s Loralai and Harnai . Tyres were also burned to block the road near Duki’s Eidgah Chowk, it said . PTI hails public ‘response’ In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. “It is a day of mourning over the stolen vote and terrorism in Balochistan and Islamabad,” he added. Recalling the Feb 8, 2024 elections, Raja termed it a “historic moment of the Pakistani nation’s democratic expression”.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Militants escaped as law enforcement personnel retaliated after a police checkpoint came under attack in the Passani village on the outskirts of Peshawar, officials said. Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmed told Dawn , “The militants attacked the police post number 8, and an exchange of fire also took place, but the policemen, deployed at the facility, retaliated and the militants escaped.” The CCPO further added that the situation was “under control”. No personnel or militant casualties or injuries were reported so far; however, the nature of the attack and physical losses were yet to be identified. On November 26, unidentified persons blew up a gas pipeline in Hameed Khan Machine area, some five miles south of the police post in Passani. Residents said that an explosion had triggered a fire from the pipeline. A police official said that the pipeline was blown up for the second time. “The same pipeline was blown up two years ago by terrorists,” he added. On August 15 last year, police and security forces repulsed three midnight militant attacks at as many locations in the jurisdiction of Mattani police station. Police officials said that militants attacked the Hameed Khan police checkpoint using the latest weaponry from a nearby forest. However, they said that the militants could not hit the police post since they were firing from a distance. They added that the personnel returned the fire, repulsing the attack. They said that there were no casualties reported. In a similar attack on Fort Mackson, commonly known as Kishangar post, the militants fired from a distance, which too was repulsed. The third attack was carried out at the Azakhel Dam post. However, the attack was repulsed when the personnel fired back.",

      "summary_orig": "Gunmen killed three people and abducted a Catholic priest and several others during an early morning attack on the clergyman’s residence in northern Nigeria’s Kaduna state, church and police sources said on Sunday. Saturday’s assault in Kauru district highlights persistent insecurity in the region, and came days after security services rescued all 166 worshippers abducted in attacks by gunmen on two churches elsewhere in Kaduna. Such attacks have drawn the attention of US President Donald Trump, who has accused Nigeria’s government of failing to protect Christians, a charge Abuja denies. US forces struck what they described as terrorist targets in northwestern Nigeria on December 25. The Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan named the kidnapped clergyman as Nathaniel Asuwaye, parish priest of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Karku, and said 10 other people were abducted. Three residents were killed during the attack, which began at about 3:20am (7:20 PKT, the diocese said in a statement. A Kaduna police spokesperson confirmed the incident, but said five people had been abducted in total and that the three people killed were members of the security forces. “Security agents exchanged gunfire with the bandits, killed some of them, and unfortunately, two soldiers and a police officer lost their lives,” he said. Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement on Sunday that Nigeria’s security crisis was “increasingly getting out of hand”. It accused the government of “gross incompetence” and failure to protect civilians as gunmen kill, abduct and terrorise rural communities across several northern states. A presidency spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment. Pope Leo, during his weekly address to the faithful in St. Peter’s Square, expressed solidarity with the victims of recent attacks in Nigeria. “I hope that the competent authorities will continue to act with determination to ensure the security and protection of every citizen’s life,” Leo said.",

      "summary_orig": "Recognition of Iran’s right to enrich uranium is key for nuclear talks with the United States to succeed, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Sunday. American and Iranian diplomats held indirect talks in Oman on Friday, aimed at reviving diplomacy amid a US naval buildup near Iran and Tehran’s vows of a harsh response if attacked. “Zero enrichment can never be accepted by us. Hence, we need to focus on discussions that accept enrichment inside Iran while building trust that enrichment is and will stay for peaceful purposes,” Araqchi said. Iran and the US held five rounds of nuclear talks last year, which stalled mainly due to disagreements over uranium enrichment inside Iran. In June, the US attacked Iranian nuclear facilities at the end of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said it has halted enrichment activity, which the US views as a possible pathway to nuclear bombs. Iran says its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes. A diplomat in the region briefed by Iran told Reuters on Friday that Tehran was open to discussing the “level and purity” of enrichment as well as other arrangements, as long as it was allowed to enrich uranium on its soil and would be granted sanctions relief in addition to military de-escalation. “Iran’s insistence on enrichment is not merely technical or economic (…) it is rooted in a desire for independence and dignity,” Araqchi said. “No one has the right to tell the Iranian nation what it should or should not have.” The minister also said that Iran’s missile programme, which the US would like to include in negotiations, had never been part of the agenda. President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on Sunday that talks with the US were a “step forward” and that Tehran wanted its rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be respected. The date and venue of the next round of talks will be determined in consultation with Oman and might not be Muscat, Araqchi said.",

      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday issued renewed warnings about the threats to global peace due to “terrorist organisations operating in Afghanistan”, and criticised the Taliban regime’s policies, which he said created conditions “similar to or worse than pre-9/11”. He made the remarks in a statement thanking world leaders for showing solidarity with Pakistan over the recent attack on an imambargah in Islamabad , which killed 36 people and injured more than 160. The militant group Islamic State (IS) had claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat, Zardari reiterated the Pakistani nation’s resolve to combat terrorism and violent ideology. “Pakistan has long maintained that terrorism cannot be confronted by a single country in isolation,” he was quoted as saying. Citing Pakistan’s experience, he said in the statement that whenever “terrorist groups are allowed space, facilitation or impunity beyond national borders, the consequences are borne by innocent civilians all over the world.” Under such a context, he continued, certain neighbouring countries had become partners in crime by allowing terrorist elements to operate against Pakistan from their soil, while some not only finance them directly but also provide them with technical and military means. “This is a reality that has shaped the regional developments in recent years. Pakistan takes strong exception to the situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime has created conditions similar to or worse than pre-9/11, when terror organisations posed threats to global peace, ending in the 9/11 tragedy,” the statement quoted him as saying. The Sept 11, 2001 , attacks, also known as 9/11, refer to a series of coordinated plane hijackings by the armed Al Qaeda group, which claimed almost 3,000 lives. Zardari also accused India of “assisting the Taliban regime and threatening not only Pakistan but also the regional and global peace.” Following Friday’s mosque attack in Islamabad, government officials, including the Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, had also blamed “Indian-backed proxies” for carrying out the attack. President Zardari appreciated the international community for expressing solidarity with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism. “Pakistan is humbled by the strong and sincere outpouring of support and solidarity from world leaders, governments and international organisations,” he said in the statement. “The messages of sympathy and solidarity had brought comfort to the people of Pakistan and strength to the families who mourned.” Islamabad has reiterated that Afghanistan’s soil has been continuously used by terrorists against Pakistan and urged the Taliban regime to rein in the terror groups’ operations in its land to target civilians and military personnel in Pakistan.",

      "summary_orig": "Opener Tim Seifert struck a blistering 65 off 42 balls to lead New Zealand’s highest-ever run in a T20 World Cup as they beat Afghanistan by five wickets on Sunday. After Afghanistan made 182-6, New Zealand were driven by Seifert’s 42-ball knock and 42 by Glenn Phillips to achieve their target with 13 balls to spare in Chennai. New Zealand’s previous best chase in the T20 World Cup was their 167 against England in the 2021 semi-final. Afghanistan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman had New Zealand in early trouble when he struck on successive balls in the second over of the chase to dismiss Finn Allen, for one, and Rachin Ravindra, for a duck. The hat-trick was avoided by Phillips, who then got going with wicketkeeper Seifert in a partnership of 74 for the third wicket to thwart Afghanistan’s spin-heavy attack. Captain Rashid Khan let out a roar as he broke through to dismiss Phillips, who inside-edged onto his stumps. Leg-spinner Rashid dropped Seifert on 48 off his own bowling, and the batsman reached his fifty with a six off veteran spinner Mohammad Nabi. Seifert hit Nabi for another six and a four on successive balls before the bowler had his revenge on the next when he top-edged to be caught in the deep. Mark Chapman fell after a 17-ball 28, but Daryl Mitchell, on 25, and skipper Mitchell Santner, on 17, saw New Zealand to 183-5 and a comfortable victory. Afghanistan won the toss and chose to bat, and Gulbadin Naib, coming in at number three, struck 63 off 35 balls after they had slipped to 44-2. Matt Henry nearly had Rahmanullah Gurbaz caught after he skied a top edge behind the stumps, but keeper Seifert and Allen collided as they both ran back, and the chance went begging. Pace bowler Lockie Ferguson struck twice in his opening over to send back Ibrahim Zadran, for 10, and then Gurbaz, bowled for 27 off an inside edge. Naib and left-hander Sediqullah Atal, who made 29, got together to rebuild the innings with a 79-run stand for the third wicket. Naib reached his fourth T20 fifty off 29 balls before he departed attempting a slog off left-arm spinner Rachin Ravindra.",

      "summary_orig": "China condemned on Sunday the deadly suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad earlier this week, asserting that it “firmly supports” the Pakistani government in safeguarding national security and stability. “China is deeply shocked by the deadly explosion in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad and the heavy casualties it has inflicted. China mourns for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones. “China strongly condemns the attack, opposes any form of terrorism and firmly supports the Pakistani government in safeguarding national security and stability and protecting the safety of the people,” a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry said. Turkiye FM offers condolences over loss of life Separately, in a phone call with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan conveyed “heartfelt condolences on behalf of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, himself, and the brotherly people of Turkiye” over the loss of life in the attack, the Foreign Office (FO) said. FM Dar “thanked the Turkish leadership for their solidarity and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unshaken resolve to combat terrorism and protect its civilians,” according to the statement. “Both leaders also exchanged views on bilateral relations, matters of mutual interest, and key regional and international developments,” the FO added. The attack The attack took place inside the mosque at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra, located in the Tarlai area of what is considered ‘rural Islamabad’, off Lehtrar Road on Friday. It left over 30 people dead and more 100 injured. Police officials said the blast occurred after Friday prayers, adding that the attacker was stopped at the gate of the mosque, where he detonated his explosive payload. Footage and photos from the blast site showed several bodies lying near the mosque’s front gate, with people and debris also strewn across the red-carpeted prayer hall. Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the mosque as people called for help. The brazen attack elicited an outpouring of grief from across the country, and prompted condemnations from most world capitals, as well as local political and religious groups. Authorities have pointed fingers at Afghanistan and India as the investigation into the incident continues. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said yesterday that four facilitators behind the suicide bombing, including the mastermind, had been arrested, saying the suspects were detained in overnight raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said multiple agencies launched an investigation immediately after the blast and carried out operations overnight. “I want to praise our agencies and the Counter-Terrorism Department in KP that all the people who were linked to the blast, including the masterminds, were arrested before 3am,” he added. After the blast, raids were conducted in Peshawar and Nowshera and the facilitators and the mastermind were arrested. Naqvi claimed that the mastermind was an Afghan national, affiliated with the militant Islamic State (IS) group. “The terrorist involved in the incident got training in Afghanistan. How he was trained, his travel history tells everything,” Naqvi said. A KP police assistant sub-inspector was martyred during the overnight raids, while several personnel were injured, the minister added. He stressed that the network had been dismantled. “The entire ISIS network has been busted,” he said. Naqvi claimed there were at least “21 terrorist organisations” operating from Afghanistan. He alleged that the mercenaries shifted allegiance “to whoever paid them more”. “Someone is giving them funds, and they are getting dollars from somewhere,” he said, alleging India was providing funding and targets. “Those who were giving $500 are now giving $1,500… India has increased the funding three times after May,” he said.",

Bilateral interaction is close to zero, while Pakistan has strong reasons to believe that its eastern neighbour is playing a key role in fomenting terrorism within its borders. This is unsustainable in the long run, as the threat of conflict is never far away when such a massive gulf of mistrust exists. And while India keeps harping on about the main obstacle to better ties being ‘terrorism’, which it alleges emanates from Pakistan, it is India which is bringing terrorism to this country. Meanwhile, the main flashpoint in South Asia remains the unresolved question of Kashmir. Though New Delhi would like to believe its own fiction that the Kashmir dispute has been ‘resolved’ by the scrapping of the occupied territory’s limited autonomy in 2019, the fact remains that internationally, Kashmir remains a disputed region. The lack of resolution of the Kashmir question results in a state of permanent insecurity in the subcontinent. We must not forget that both states fought a limited war after the Pahalgam episode last year. The threat of fresh conflict is ever-present as long as the dispute is not judiciously settled. Moreover, Indian repression in occupied Kashmir continues unabated. And when events such as Pahalgam occur, the plight of Kashmiris in the held region, as well as in India, becomes even more acute. They are punished doubly; because of their Kashmiri origin, as well as their Muslim faith. Human Rights Watch has documented Hindu mob attacks in India after the Pahalgam assault in which Kashmiri students and workers were targeted in various Indian states. UN human rights experts have reached similar conclusions. Furthermore, the UN experts have condemned “arbitrary arrests and detentions, suspicious deaths in custody, torture … lynchings” of Muslims including Kashmiris. These grim facts reveal the true face of the ‘world’s largest democracy’. Pakistan has consistently sought to bring India to the table in order to resolve the Kashmir question. Yet India, particularly under Narendra Modi, has arrogantly rejected the invitation. While New Delhi abhors the thought of third-party meditation in Kashmir, it is time international actors paid more attention to the issue. US President Donald Trump has on several occasions said he is willing to step in and help resolve the dispute. Last year, he claimed to have “stopped the war” between Pakistan and India, while adding that “I can solve anything”. He is welcome to try, perhaps using his Board of Peace as a platform to address the Kashmir issue. While the Indians talk tough, they will have a hard time resisting US pressure, as their recent ‘commitment’ to stop buying Russian oil shows. Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026",

A two-member delegation, headed by a senior Bangladeshi official, has also visited the Pakistan Railways (PR) carriage factory in Islamabad and the Mughalpura Workshop in Lahore to receive a briefing from the railway authorities and to witness the rolling stock manufacturing process, Dawn has learnt. According to the Lahore-based PR authorities, Mr Farhad Islam, Bangladesh’s Secretary for International Organisations and Consular Affairs and Designate D-8 Commissioner and Mohammad Iqbal Hussain Khan, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan, visited the Mughalpura workshop on Friday. Muhammad Nasir Khalili, Chief Mechanical Engineer (Carriage and Wagons), briefed the delegation on the overall functioning, technical capabilities, and ongoing projects of the PR’s workshops. A short documentary highlighting the workshops’ operational and working strengths was also shown to the guests. Pakistan Railways offers attractive prices to seal export deal Mr Khalili stated that Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries sharing a common history, culture, and heritage, and that there exists immense potential for cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the railway sector. The delegation was subsequently given a detailed tour of the Mughalpura Locomotive Workshop, where they were briefed on the various stages of locomotive maintenance, rehabilitation, and manufacturing. The diplomats termed their visit informative, productive, and encouraging, and appreciated the technical expertise and professional competence of Pakistan Railways. “Our visit stands as a clear testament to the strengthening bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” said Mr Islam. On the other hand, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has expressed his resolve to advance railway-to-railway cooperation between the two countries, emphasising that such collaboration can yield substantial benefits. PR is currently supplying coaches and wagons to four countries with broad-gauge rail networks — Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chile and Argentina. ““It reflects that we have achieved modern, indigenous manufacturing capability for coaches and wagons,” the minister said in a statement. In the next phase, according to Mr Khalili, the railway experts from Bangladesh will also visit Pakistan for a detailed technical evaluation. In the 1980s, Pakistan Railways exported rolling stock to Bangladesh while it provided freight wagons to Sri Lanka in 1999 and 2000 and 2009. In the current regional context, Pakistan is emerging as a suitable and cost-effective alternative to other international suppliers for Bangladesh. Bangladesh was dealing with India regarding the provision of wagons and coaches. But now Dhaka has shown its interest in us for this purpose,” Mr Khalili told Dawn when contacted. He said the delegation also visited the Islamabad carriage factory a few days ago. Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The public health crisis triggered by unchecked increase in stray dog population once again came into the spotlight when two female polio workers and a policeman escorting the field staff were injured in separate incidents of animal attacks on Saturday. Sources said one female worker carrying out door-to-door vaccination campaign was attacked by a street dog in Zaman town, Korangi, while the other in the area of Malir Cantonment. The third incident, the sources said, was reported in the Quaidabad area where a policeman escorting the polio team was bitten by a stray dog. He was later treated at the Indus Hospital. Speaking to Dawn , a spokesperson for the Sindh Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) only confirmed the cases involving two female workers. EOC confirms two incidents involving as many female polio workers; cop bitten by stray dog receives treatment at Indus Hospital “Two incidents involving street dogs affecting polio workers were officially reported today in Korangi and Malir. The safety of our frontline workers is our highest priority, and we stand fully with our teams,” said EOC-Sindh spokesperson Minahil Mustafa. According to her, the cases were immediately managed as per the health and safety protocols, with full support from relevant departments. She explained that teams established for the polio vaccination drive at union council level included representatives from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, town municipal corporations and the local government and “such issues are promptly raised and addressed through these coordination mechanisms”. The government encouraged the media and community members to share any relevant information so targeted support and solutions could be provided in affected areas, she added. Rabies Prevention and Training Centre Manager Aftab Gohar of the Indus Hospital confirmed that a policeman engaged in polio-related duties reported at the hospital with dog-bite injuries on Saturday. “A 21-year-old policeman, escorting the polio workers, reported at our facility today with dog-bite injuries. His leg injury was classified as a Category II exposure,” he said, adding that he was provided treatment and asked to report back for follow-up doses scheduled on Day 3 and Day 7. This year, he pointed out, at least two to three polio workers with dog-bite injuries had received treatment at the hospital. One of the victims was a woman in her late 30s. “On a daily basis, however, 150 to 200 dog-bite [old and new] cases are reported at our facility,” he said. The official emphasised the need for controlling dog population, training healthcare providers in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and creating public awareness. It might be recalled that this week a rabies case was reported in Karachi, raising the total number of reported cases of the deadly infectious disease to three in the province. Last year, at least 22 people lost their lives to rabies. Over 41,000 dog-bite cases were reported at three tertiary care hospitals — over 16,000 at the Indus Hospital, over 12,000 at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and over 13,000 at Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.

      "summary_orig": "RAWALPINDI: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Rawalpindi on Saturday dismissed an application filed by PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan, seeking permission for a medical check-up by his personal doctors at Adiala jail. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court declined to grant access to Mr Khan’s private physicians inside the jail. Appearing for the PTI founder, counsel Faisal Malik argued that as a former prime minister, his client deserved the same medical facilities previously extended to other ex-premiers, citing Nawaz Sharif as precedent. He contended that Mr Khan was an undertrial prisoner and had the legal right to be examined by doctors of his choice. The lawyer also claimed that Adiala jail lacked adequate facilities for specialised eye treatment. Referring to Pakistan Prison Rules, Mr Malik said Rule 795 required that a prisoner’s family be informed before any medical treatment. He questioned why Mr Khan had been taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) late at night, stating that he had not been taken out of jail for three years. Denial of access to personal doctors, he argued, amounted to discriminatory treatment. Special Prosecutor Zaheer Shah opposed the plea, arguing that Mr Khan was on bail in the GHQ attack case related to the May 9 events and convicted in other cases, and therefore could not be treated as an undertrial prisoner whose custody could be regulated by a criminal court. He further maintained that the ATC lacked jurisdiction to issue directions regarding jail administration or medical arrangements. Under prison rules, he said, medical care was the responsibility of government-appointed doctors, with no provision for private physicians. After hearing both sides, the court dismissed the application. Separately, Mr Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum alleged on X that medical reports promised by the Supreme Court had not been provided to the family, urging the chief justice to take contempt action. Meanwhile, a Pims medical report confirmed that Mr Khan was diagnosed with right central retinal vein occlusion and received hospital-based treatment, which was completed smoothly. Jail authorities informed the court that Mr Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were receiving medical care strictly under jail rules. Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026",
