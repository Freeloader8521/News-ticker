      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Former federal minister Shireen Mazari on Tuesday approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC), seeking urgent judicial intervention to allow her to meet her imprisoned daughter, human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, and son-in-law Hadi Ali Chatha, both held in Adiala jail. A sessions court had sentenced Imaan and Hadi to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts. In a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, Mazari, through prominent lawyers including Kamran Murtaza, members of the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) Raja Aleem Abbasi, Chaudhry Hafeezullah Yaqub, Zafar Khokhar, Asif Irfan, Abdul Rehman Hur Bajwa, President Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) Syed Wajid Ali Gillani, President District Bar Association Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar, Riasat Ali Azad, and others, alleged that jail authorities had completely cut off the detainees from family contact and legal counsel, without any written order, recorded reasons, or lawful justification. The petition states that Imaan and Hadi were convicted on January 24, 2026, in a case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, and have since been held in “continuous judicial custody”. Despite repeated requests, the petitioner — mother of Imaan and mother-in-law of Hadi — has been denied visitation rights and kept in the dark about their physical and mental health, medical care, and jail conditions. The plea contends that the detainees have also been deprived of confidential access to their lawyers, obstructing their ability to file an appeal against their conviction — a time-sensitive legal remedy. It argues that such “complete and indefinite denial” amounts to “incommunicado detention,” violating constitutional guarantees under Articles 4, 9, 10-A, and 14, which protect the rights to due process, dignity, fair trial, and humane treatment. The petition further invokes the Punjab Prison Rules, 1978, and international standards such as the UN Nelson Mandela Rules, asserting that the state has a heightened duty of care toward individuals in custody. In her interim relief request, Mazari has urged the IHC to issue immediate directions allowing temporary family visits and legal consultations pending the final decision of the writ. The respondents in the petition include the Federation of Pakistan through the secretary of Interior, the inspector general of police Islamabad, and the superintendent of Adiala Jail. The IHC is yet to fix a hearing date on the petition. The case The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCI) in Islamabad. The NCCIA complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The First Information Report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Judge Majoka issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025. Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him. Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them. Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC. Separately, a case related to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo. The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case. Separataely, on January 23, Imaan and Hadi were arrested by the police in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025. They were then sent to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution calling for an “aggressive” national response against the external sponsors and internal facilitators of terrorism. The lower house of Parliament continued its discussion on the prevailing security situation in Balochistan in the wake of a series of deadly attacks across the province on Saturday. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the resolution, which was passed with a majority vote. It stated: “This House condemns in the strongest terms the recent terrorist incidents in Balochistan, in which not only innocent civilians were targeted but also heinous and inhumane tactics such as using women as weapons were adopted.” The NA further demanded that an “immediate, aggressive, coordinated, and effective national response be ensured against these external sponsors and internal facilitators, funding, smuggling, and propaganda hubs, in which political, diplomatic, military, intelligence, legal, and rhetorical fronts are united”. The resolution highlighted that “in several cases, evidence available points to external sponsorship, [and] particularly there are serious concerns over the role of India”. It further said terrorism was “being supported in some neighbouring countries through logistical and operational facilitation, financial support, training, treatment, movement and propaganda networks”. The resolution expressed “deep sorrow and concern over the fact that terrorist networks are trying to use women against the state and society through exploitation, coercion and blackmail”, adding that it was completely contrary to Islamic, Pakistani and Baloch values. It appreciated the “timely and effective measures taken by the security forces, law enforcement agencies, the provincial government of Balochistan and the civil administration”. Expressing solidarity with the martyrs and the injured, the resolution asserted that attacks on “civilian populations, women, and children are unforgivable crimes, and the state must take decisive action against such elements on the principle of zero tolerance”. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan on Saturday. The security forces killed 92 terrorists as they responded to the incidents, with more militants being eliminated later to take the 48-hour tally to 177 on Monday. Lawmakers sound alarm Meanwhile, lawmakers from across the political spectrum, including those from the PTI and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), sounded an alarm on the surge in terrorism in the province. At some points during a few opposition lawmakers’ speeches, the proceedings were not livestreamed on the NA’s YouTube channel. PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said terrorist incidents were taking place in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa frequently. “If we do not see its root causes and the basic issues leading to this, and do not assess it correctly […], the situation would not move forward,” he said. Stating that Pakistanis are aggrieved when someone is killed in a terrorist incident, Qaiser said: “We need to see what the fundamental reason is for this insurgency in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the moment, and that insurgency is not being controlled in any way.” He further said, “A state is like a mother, and when a state does not do justice to its children, does not give them basic rights, differentiates between them and does not treat them fairly, then it has to face such situations.” The former NA speaker stressed the need to figure out the root causes behind the rising unrest in Balochistan. “The fundamental thing is democracy,” he added. “When you do not give importance to the public and do not accept their opinions and suggestions, and when the people think they are beings of a lower level and their thoughts have no value,” he said, before the NA YouTube livestream was disrupted for over a minute. The PTI leader then lamented that ex-premier Imran Khan was being denied the right to meet his family in jail. He contended that his imprisonment was “unlawful”, and his remarks were not aired for half a minute. Echoing the KP government’s stance , Qaiser lamented that the province was not being provided with the funds allocated for it. He also highlighted the purported difference in the services provided to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz. “The chief minister of a province sits outside the Adiala jail to beg for a meeting, but he is denied . On the other hand, the chief minister of a province uses a government airplane when going to China and Brazil. Is this not one country but two constitutions?” he said. Noting the planned talks between the United States and Iran over their concerns, Qaiser said, “If Iran and America can sit for talks in Istanbul, if India and Pakistan can also [] on hard land, then why not with Afghanistan, however much serious your concerns are?” The PTI MNA affirmed that Pakistan’s cross-border terrorism concerns with Kabul should be addressed, but stressed the importance of using diplomatic channels for it. “All our trading, our business, our livelihood is linked with Afghanistan, our survival is not [possible] without it,” he said. He asserted that his party wanted full implementation on the National Action Plan and the complete eradication of terrorism. “Since we are the victims, make a policy after speaking to us. We want the end of terrorism,” Qaiser said, calling for civilian supremacy and strong economic and foreign policies. Noting that even India and the US, which were seen as having strained relations, have now signed a trade deal, Qaiser contended that Pakistan was “moving towards isolation”. “We should revisit our policies. The state should act like a mother and remain within its jurisdiction, […] and this parliament should be rightfully elected,” the PTI leader said. JUI-F MNA Aliya Kamran questioned the “delayed” response of security forces during the attacks, and claimed the situation in some areas had yet to normalise, including in the Nushki district. She said reliable information had not been received from some areas of the province so far, adding that questions raised regarding Balochistan must be answered. “Where have the terrorists who escaped gone, and why is action not being taken against them?” she asked, stressing that the situation should be taken seriously. She also urged the House to reflect on why even women were becoming suicide bombers, wondering what reasons were behind this trend. According to the defence minister , women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted”. “For God’s sake, save these children,” Kamran said, while suggesting the initiation of dialogue with the people of Balochistan. Usman Badini, another JUI-F lawmaker, said Balochistan had been on fire for the past 48 hours. “We are sitting here, crying and pleading. For God’s sake, take care of Balochistan,” he said. “Where was the writ of the state at the time of the attack?” he asked. Badini remarked that a youth in Balochistan got exhausted after crying for his rights and then finally fell into someone’s hands, stressing this was not the time to talk about dividing Balochistan. “Balochistan gets electricity for only one hour […] the reason Balochistan is falling behind is the denial of rights,” the JUI-F leader noted. Stating that the people of Balochistan were not beggars, as they had resources, Badini said, “There is no need for anyone to do politics in the name of Balochistan”. He pointed out that those who spoke about their rights were labelled a traitor. “Dialogue must be held with all those who accept the flag of Pakistan; otherwise, the problem will not be resolved,” he emphasised. Ejazul Haq of the PML-Zia also pointed out during his speech that the benches of federal ministers were empty despite an “important matter” being discussed. A day ago, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had briefed the lower house of Parliament on the security situation in Balochistan. In his remarks on the NA floor on Monday, Asif had rejected any attempt to justify violence in the name of political or nationalist movements, saying the state’s “bottom line” was that no such rationalisation would be allowed. Referring to the recent wave of coordinated terrorist attacks in Balochistan, he said these acts were being falsely portrayed as a freedom struggle to legitimise what he described as organised criminal activity. Balochistan attacks The attacks took place on Saturday in Quetta and several other parts of Balochistan, where militants carried out coordinated assaults on security forces and civilian targets across the province. According to the military’s media wing, the January 31 attacks were reported from the provincial capital as well as Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni, prompting an immediate and widespread security response. A police officer walks past damage at the site, after militant attacks, in Quetta on Feb 1, 2026. — Reuters The Inter-Services Public Relations said security forces and law enforcement agencies launched clearance operations in the affected areas, killing 92 terrorists, including three suicide bombers, while 15 security personnel were martyred. The attacks also claimed the lives of at least 18 civilians, including women, children, elderly people and labourers, particularly in Gwadar and Kharan. The military said intelligence reports confirmed that the assaults were orchestrated by terrorist leaders operating from outside Pakistan, who remained in contact with the attackers throughout the incidents.",

He also highlighted the purported difference in the services provided to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz. “The chief minister of a province sits outside the Adiala jail to beg for a meeting, but he is denied . On the other hand, the chief minister of a province uses a government airplane when going to China and Brazil. Is this not one country but two constitutions?” he said. Noting the planned talks between the United States and Iran over their concerns, Qaiser said, “If Iran and America can sit for talks in Istanbul, if India and Pakistan can also [] on hard land, then why not with Afghanistan, however much serious your concerns are?” The PTI MNA affirmed that Pakistan’s cross-border terrorism concerns with Kabul should be addressed, but stressed the importance of using diplomatic channels for it. “All our trading, our business, our livelihood is linked with Afghanistan, our survival is not [possible] without it,” he said. He asserted that his party wanted full implementation on the National Action Plan and the complete eradication of terrorism. “Since we are the victims, make a policy after speaking to us. We want the end of terrorism,” Qaiser said, calling for civilian supremacy and strong economic and foreign policies. Noting that even India and the US, which were seen as having strained relations, have now signed a trade deal, Qaiser contended that Pakistan was “moving towards isolation”. “We should revisit our policies. The state should act like a mother and remain within its jurisdiction, […] and this parliament should be rightfully elected,” the PTI leader said. JUI-F MNA Aliya Kamran questioned the “delayed” response of security forces during the attacks, and claimed the situation in some areas had yet to normalise, including in the Nushki district. She said reliable information had not been received from some areas of the province so far, adding that questions raised regarding Balochistan must be answered. “Where have the terrorists who escaped gone, and why is action not being taken against them?” she asked, stressing that the situation should be taken seriously. She also urged the House to reflect on why even women were becoming suicide bombers, wondering what reasons were behind this trend. According to the defence minister , women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted”. “For God’s sake, save these children,” Kamran said, while suggesting the initiation of dialogue with the people of Balochistan. Usman Badini, another JUI-F lawmaker, said Balochistan had been on fire for the past 48 hours. “We are sitting here, crying and pleading. For God’s sake, take care of Balochistan,” he said. “Where was the writ of the state at the time of the attack?” he asked. Badini remarked that a youth in Balochistan got exhausted after crying for his rights and then finally fell into someone’s hands, stressing this was not the time to talk about dividing Balochistan. “Balochistan gets electricity for only one hour […] the reason Balochistan is falling behind is the denial of rights,” the JUI-F leader noted. Stating that the people of Balochistan were not beggars, as they had resources, Badini said, “There is no need for anyone to do politics in the name of Balochistan”. He pointed out that those who spoke about their rights were labelled a traitor. “Dialogue must be held with all those who accept the flag of Pakistan; otherwise, the problem will not be resolved,” he emphasised. Ejazul Haq of the PML-Zia also pointed out during his speech that the benches of federal ministers were empty despite an “important matter” being discussed. A day ago, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had briefed the lower house of Parliament on the security situation in Balochistan. In his remarks on the NA floor on Monday, Asif had rejected any attempt to justify violence in the name of political or nationalist movements, saying the state’s “bottom line” was that no such rationalisation would be allowed. Referring to the recent wave of coordinated terrorist attacks in Balochistan, he said these acts were being falsely portrayed as a freedom struggle to legitimise what he described as organised criminal activity. Balochistan attacks The attacks took place on Saturday in Quetta and several other parts of Balochistan, where militants carried out coordinated assaults on security forces and civilian targets across the province. According to the military’s media wing, the January 31 attacks were reported from the provincial capital as well as Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni, prompting an immediate and widespread security response. A police officer walks past damage at the site, after militant attacks, in Quetta on Feb 1, 2026. — Reuters The Inter-Services Public Relations said security forces and law enforcement agencies launched clearance operations in the affected areas, killing 92 terrorists, including three suicide bombers, while 15 security personnel were martyred. The attacks also claimed the lives of at least 18 civilians, including women, children, elderly people and labourers, particularly in Gwadar and Kharan. The military said intelligence reports confirmed that the assaults were orchestrated by terrorist leaders operating from outside Pakistan, who remained in contact with the attackers throughout the incidents.",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution calling for an “aggressive” national response against the external sponsors and internal facilitators of terrorism. The lower house of Parliament continued its discussion on the prevailing security situation in Balochistan in the wake of a series of deadly attacks across the province on Saturday. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the resolution, which was passed with a majority vote. It stated: “This House condemns in the strongest terms the recent terrorist incidents in Balochistan, in which not only innocent civilians were targeted but also heinous and inhumane tactics such as using women as weapons were adopted.” The NA further demanded that an “immediate, aggressive, coordinated, and effective national response be ensured against these external sponsors and internal facilitators, funding, smuggling, and propaganda hubs, in which political, diplomatic, military, intelligence, legal, and rhetorical fronts are united”. The resolution highlighted that “in several cases, evidence available points to external sponsorship, [and] particularly there are serious concerns over the role of India”. It further said terrorism was “being supported in some neighbouring countries through logistical and operational facilitation, financial support, training, treatment, movement and propaganda networks”. The resolution expressed “deep sorrow and concern over the fact that terrorist networks are trying to use women against the state and society through exploitation, coercion and blackmail”, adding that it was completely contrary to Islamic, Pakistani and Baloch values. It appreciated the “timely and effective measures taken by the security forces, law enforcement agencies, the provincial government of Balochistan and the civil administration”. Expressing solidarity with the martyrs and the injured, the resolution asserted that attacks on “civilian populations, women, and children are unforgivable crimes, and the state must take decisive action against such elements on the principle of zero tolerance”. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan on Saturday. The security forces killed 92 terrorists as they responded to the incidents, with more militants being eliminated later to take the 48-hour tally to 177 on Monday. Lawmakers sound alarm Meanwhile, lawmakers from across the political spectrum, including those from the PTI and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), sounded an alarm on the surge in terrorism in the province. At some points during a few opposition lawmakers’ speeches, the proceedings were not livestreamed on the NA’s YouTube channel. PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said terrorist incidents were taking place in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa frequently. “If we do not see its root causes and the basic issues leading to this, and do not assess it correctly […], the situation would not move forward,” he said. Stating that Pakistanis are aggrieved when someone is killed in a terrorist incident, Qaiser said: “We need to see what the fundamental reason is for this insurgency in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the moment, and that insurgency is not being controlled in any way.” He further said, “A state is like a mother, and when a state does not do justice to its children, does not give them basic rights, differentiates between them and does not treat them fairly, then it has to face such situations.” The former NA speaker stressed the need to figure out the root causes behind the rising unrest in Balochistan. “The fundamental thing is democracy,” he added. “When you do not give importance to the public and do not accept their opinions and suggestions, and when the people think they are beings of a lower level and their thoughts have no value,” he said, before the NA YouTube livestream was disrupted for over a minute. The PTI leader then lamented that ex-premier Imran Khan was being denied the right to meet his family in jail. He contended that his imprisonment was “unlawful”, and his remarks were not aired for half a minute. Echoing the KP government’s stance , Qaiser lamented that the province was not being provided with the funds allocated for it. He also highlighted the purported difference in the services provided to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz. “The chief minister of a province sits outside the Adiala jail to beg for a meeting, but he is denied .

      "summary_orig": "Near the Thatta-Karachi bypass, a rabrri [a condensed milk-based dessert] seller in his late thirties stands behind his roadside stall as sweat carves clean lines through the dust on his face. There are no trees nearby, no shade. There is only the open road and the sun beating straight down. The rabrri seller speaks about what Makli (located near Thatta in Sindh) used to be like two decades ago. “Even summers felt different then,” he says. In those days, thick trees lined the road, holding back the heat. Some evenings even brought a light drizzle, settling the dust and softening the air. People lingered outside and animals existed in their natural habitats. It seemed like there was a balance to things and a natural order. But now, there is only heat — and the trucks. MANUFACTURING HEAT A truck loaded with freshly cut wood thunders past. Then another. Then another. All of them are headed towards Karachi with engines roaring, and timber stacked high and loose. Tree varieties of neem , babul and keekarr are all piled atop this truck. Their trunks look thick enough to have been standing for decades. The trucks passing the rabrri seller’s stall are not an anomaly. They form a steady, visible supply chain running from lower Sindh into Karachi. Each one of these trucks carries with it more than wood. These trucks carry away shade from roads such as this one in Makli, cover from fields and riverbanks across Sindh, the homes of various local animals and birds, and the natural setting that gives rise to flora and fauna. Trucks barrelling across Sindh loaded with illegally cut timber have become an alarmingly routine sight in the province. It is estimated that Sindh has lost nearly 80 percent of its forest cover since Pakistan came into being, much of it in the last 30 years. As this rabid deforestation in Sindh has led to heatwaves and other related calamities year-after-year, are officials simply turning a blind eye, or are they complicit? What policies have led us to this juncture, and can anything be done to reverse the damage? According to numerous studies, deforestation and the removal of trees is directly linked to an increase in the intensity and frequency of heatwaves. Research shows that cutting down forests removes the cooling effect that trees provide, leading to local surface temperature increases of up to 4.5 degrees Celsius. As a result of this slow, engineered erasure of the natural ecosystem across Sindh, hundreds of people and livestock are dying every year in the province, as recurring heatwaves continue to ravage the land. According to a news report published in Dawn on June 22, 2025, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Sindh stated that “the 2024 heatwave alone led to 5,358 hospital admissions for heat-related illnesses and 158 livestock deaths. During the period between April and May, 2025, 675 heatstroke cases were treated across the province. Overall, an estimated 8.6 million people across 26 districts in Sindh faced heightened food insecurity due to compounding heat and drought risks.” This naturally begs the question: given the direct causation between deforestation and the increase in heat-related calamities and ailments, why are the authorities in the province allowing Sindh’s trees to be mowed down? According to drivers and residents familiar with these routes, each truck pays around Rs 4,000 to officials from the Sindh Forest Department in order to move freely across these lands. Trucks carrying timber from Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Thatta and lower Sindh funnel onto the National Highway N-5 for Karachi. On average, one truck passes every 15 minutes. That amounts to roughly 96 trucks a day. On a single route, that is Rs 384,000 changing hands daily. Over a month, the figure exceeds Rs 11.5 million. A truck driver tells Eos , “Pay and you can go anywhere. If you don’t pay, then you’re in trouble.” None of the trucks display visible permits and none of them are stopped for inspection at checkpoints. The Sindh Forest Department, which has publicly emphasised reclamation of encroached lands and afforestation drives, did not respond to requests for comments on the operation of these trucks and the seeming absence of any checks and balances. These trucks that have, in the words of the rabrri seller, “eaten everything” did not appear overnight. In fact, Sindh’s forests have been slowly dismantled in stages over nearly two centuries now, but the scale and impact has never been this large. A HISTORY OF DESTRUCTION When the British annexed Sindh in 1843, the Indus riverine forests were among the first landscapes to be surveyed, mapped and claimed. Timber from babul and keekarr fed railway expansion, cantonments and canal construction. Forests ceased to be living systems and became inventories. Large stretches of riverine forests were cleared to serve colonial infrastructure and revenue needs as floodplains were also regulated. In 1932, the Sukkur Barrage diverted water, thus reducing inundations and riverine regeneration. After Partition, the same logic persisted, as Pakistan inherited colonial forest laws. In 1947, the Sindh Forest Department inherited and managed 269,511 hectares of reserved forests and 24,369 hectares of protected forests, mainly riverine forests along the Indus floodplains. These figures marked the baseline for productive cover in the province, with dense stands of babul , keekarr and other species regenerating naturally through annual inundations. Since then, the nominal area of riverine forests has stayed roughly stable on official records at 241,198 hectares, as per the Sindh Forest Department, reflecting a modest nominal decline of about 28,313 hectares from the 1947 reserved figure. Yet, the effective loss is much steeper due to degradation, encroachment, illegal felling and reduced freshwater flows from barrages. Estimates indicate that up to 80 per cent of riverine forests have been destroyed or heavily degraded. By the 1950s, barrages such as Guddu and Kotri intensified the issue. The average annual flow from the Kotri Barrage dropped from 41 million acre-feet (MAF) during 1976-1998 to 14 MAF during 1999-2023. By the 1980s and 1990s, forest land in Sindh increasingly existed only on paper. Forest boundary pillars disappeared, while guards were few, poorly paid and easily overruled. Between the 1980s and early 2000s, Sindh’s forest cover declined drastically, with riverine forests in some areas shrinking by more than two-thirds or more — from over 20 percent to under seven percent of mapped study areas. Province-wide, Sindh likely lost 50 to 80 percent of its forested areas compared to its mid-20th century levels, with most of that reduction happening through the late 20th century and into the early 2000s. Men piling timber near the Kharochan Jetty: in rural Sindh, landlessness and debt pushes labourers into forest-cutting POLICY FAILURES In 2005, the Sindh government introduced its Agroforestry Policy , officially aimed at increasing tree cover through private participation. In practice, it opened vast tracts of riverine and irrigated forests to leasing. Natural forests were often cleared first and replantation was promised later. But oversight weakened as plantation targets were rarely enforced and influential landlords received leases. Environmental impact assessments arrived years late, if at all. As a result, while it was designed to increase tree cover by engaging local communities, the policy led to widespread deforestation, as land was often acquired by individuals who prioritised agricultural cultivation over planting trees. Despite this, by 2010, the policy was expanded. Lease terms were relaxed and more land was handed out as forests continued to vanish. In 2014, the policy was officially scrapped. The government announced the reclamation and restoration of encroached lands. According to the Sindh Sustainable Forest Management Policy 2019 , published on May 18, 2023 and available on the Sindh Forest Department’s website, one of the major factors behind the decrease in forest cover has been the “weak law enforcement of the forestry administration.” It also cites the Agroforestry Lease Policy of 2005 as being “detrimental for the forests.” The Sindh Forest Department has routinely taken budgetary allocations from provincial and federal governments specifically for the purpose of reclaiming encroached forest lands. But a persistent critique from environmental groups and after media investigations is that a cycle has been created, where funds are drawn for clearance operations while powerful encroachers are still allowed to delay or avoid eviction, thus letting the deforestation continue. This highlights a recurring failure of governance, where policies — whether for leasing or for reclamation — are undermined by weak enforcement and a lack of transparency. According to the Sindhi newspaper Pehnji Ikhbar , as of January 25, 2026, 75,000 acres of forest department land in Matiari have continuously been handed over to contractors who permit tree-cutting. Despite court orders and government restrictions, wood is still being cut from forest lands and government lands are being cultivated, with the forest department remaining a silent spectator. Furthermore, the Nasri Forest in Shaheed Benazirabad district (previously known as Nawabshah) has been granted to Bahria Town for the development of their third mega project in the area. Environmentalists and local residents have raised concerns that this move will lead to large-scale deforestation, an increase in temperature, loss of biodiversity and the disruption of the local ecosystem. IGNORANCE OR COMPLICITY? Ayaz Samoo has been cutting wood for over 20 years. He has spent decades working in forests, felling trees with skill and precision — first with axes and saws, now with machines. He used to cut trees by relying only on strength, experience and patience. “Back then, it was all hands and sweat,” he says. “Every tree has its own rhythm. You had to move carefully, understand it, or you could get hurt.” Today, machines have changed his work. Chainsaws roar through the forest where once only the sound of axes filled the air. “It is faster now, yes,” he explains, “but you do not ‘feel’ the tree in the same way.” That’s because cutting down trees has become a ruthlessly profitable business that is coming at the cost of the province and its people. Advocate Ammar Dayo, a vocal campaigner against deforestation and climate destruction in northern Sindh, calls the situation in Ghotki district “unprecedented”. “During the last three years, forest destruction here has reached levels never seen before,” he says. “The years 2024 and 2025 have been catastrophic for the following forests: Mirpur, Jahanpur, Adilpur, Jarwar, Sardar, Sandrani and Ronte. “The Sindh Forest Department is 100 percent involved in this,” Dayo claims. “From conservators to DFOs [divisional forest officers] to guards. Along with them, influential politicians, landlords, the police and even some local residents are involved.” In the Mirpur and Jahanpur forests, Dayo says mature babul trees — worth Rs 300,000 to Rs 400,000 per tree — have been cut and sold by the thousands. In Jror, Adilpur and Ronte forests, he estimates millions of keekarr and babul trees have been removed. Court orders banning sawmills within 10 kilometres of forest boundaries exist. On the ground, however, sawmills operate inside forest limits, cutting timber into planks and beams that are then loaded on to trucks. But the men cutting the trees are not the men profiting from them. In rural Sindh, landlessness and debt pushes labourers into forest-cutting. Daily wages are low, work is seasonal and alternatives are scarce as timber offers quick cash. The legal, ecological and climatic concerns are abstract to these men. Their hunger is not. A cutter in Sujawal tells Eos , “We cut for 500 rupees a day. The agents pay us and we use the money to get food for ourselves and our families.” But this is only a short-term monetary fix for a long-term monetary disaster. As forests shrink, pastoralists lose grazing land, heat exposure increases, livestock dwindles, families migrate towards cities already stretched thin and poverty deepens. A MAN-MADE CALAMITY Environmental expert Nasir Panhwar describes riverine forests not just as scenery but as infrastructure, and this infrastructure is being dismantled. “Biodiversity has been lost,” Panhwar says. “Some flora and fauna have disappeared entirely. Migration is underway because livelihoods dependent on forests and water are collapsing.” He estimates that up to 80 per cent of Sindh’s riverine forests have been destroyed. Official figures by the Sindh Forest Department paint a similar picture. Productive forests — riverine and irrigated plantations — now account for around just two per cent of Sindh’s land area. Nationally, Pakistan’s forest cover stands at around 4.7 per cent, among the lowest in the region. In Sindh, riverine forests have faced sharper degradation despite nominal stability in managed areas. In Thatta district alone, riverine area fell from 45,128 hectares in 1990 to 36,432 hectares in 2010 and then to 25,888 hectares by 2014 — an overall decline of about 43 per cent in that district, with other studies showing up to 89 per cent loss in Thatta’s forest cover from 1979 to 2010 (from 35.11 per cent to 2.23 per cent). As of 2025, Pakistan has only five trees per person, as per the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) estimates — far below the global average of 422 and the desirable 900 for sustainability. In Sindh, it’s lower still due to urban pressures and riverine loss. And, as forests vanish, heat intensifies. Trees lower surface temperatures, retain moisture and break heatwaves. Without them, roads and fields absorb sunlight. Nights offer no relief. A single mature tree provides shade for 10 people, cools the air by 2-5 degrees Celsius through evapotranspiration and absorbs 22 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide (CO2) yearly. In order to offset Sindh’s heat, one person would need a now-impossible number of around 200-300 trees. Nisar Laghari, a political activist from Hyderabad, disputes official figures on the scale of forest loss, arguing that even existing data understates the damage. According to him, Miani Forest historically spanned nearly 2,500 acres, stretching from the riverine belt up to Hyderabad Taluka. “Local records still show the forest at 2,500 acres,” he says, “but satellite mapping today reduces it to around 1,700 acres, already masking a significant loss.” Laghari alleges that of the land still visible on satellite imagery, 150 to 200 acres have been converted into agricultural fields through political pressure, while much of the remaining area is under illegal occupation. Adjacent to Miani Forest lies the Nawab Muhammad Khan Forest, covering another 500 acres, which he argues must be counted as part of the same ecological system when assessing total deforestation. “The destruction was not accidental,” Laghari says. “It became systematic when forest leases began to be issued, despite the fact that forest land is not legally eligible for leasing.” Those leases, he claims, opened the forest to commercial cutting and cultivation, fragmenting what was once a continuous green belt into isolated, degraded patches. Independent verification of these claims remains limited, but historical maps, satellite imagery and local testimony all point towards decades of gradual, policy-enabled deforestation rather than sudden encroachment. A truck, packed to the brim with timber, pictured at dusk: these operations continue through the night, despite the Sindh government announcing a ban on night-time transportation of timber and wood materials HOW TO RIGHT A WRONG Internationally, Pakistan presents itself as a climate victim — and it is. The country ranks among the world’s most climate-affected nations as it continues to be battered by floods, heatwaves and many other disasters. Ironically, Sindh has become a focal point for blue carbon projects, especially mangrove restoration, thus attracting international attention, consultants and seed funding. Carbon credits are calculated, maintenance budgets are allocated and photo opportunities multiply. But such efforts are futile if the broader picture across Sindh is ignored by the authorities. The province’s lungs are being depleted, and those tasked with protecting these forests are instead aiding in their destruction through negligent policymaking and a failure to enforce more stringent measures. It is important to stress that deforestation in Sindh is a governance failure. The steady disappearance of riverine forests and inland tree cover reflects weak policy frameworks, institutional complicity and the marginalisation of communities who once acted as de facto custodians of the land. Addressing this problem requires more than tree-planting drives or donor-funded campaigns. It demands structural reform, transparency and a reimagining of how forests are governed in the province. Reforming the Sindh Forest Department must be the starting point. The department currently suffers from overlapping mandates, poor accountability mechanisms and limited independent oversight. Forest officers wield extensive discretionary power over permits and enforcement, creating opportunities for rent-seeking and collusion with timber mafias. Introducing an independent forest oversight authority could help break this cycle. Regular third-party audits, public disclosure of logging permits and mandatory reporting of forest cover changes would make it harder for illegal activity to thrive under bureaucratic cover. Closely tied to institutional reform is the need for a clear, enforceable forest policy. Sindh’s forest laws are outdated and often poorly aligned with current land-use realities. Ambiguous classifications such as ‘protected’, ‘reserved’ and ‘unclassed’ forests are routinely exploited to justify encroachment and conversion. Updating forest legislation to remove loopholes, clarify land tenure and impose stricter penalties for illegal logging is essential. Equally important is ensuring that these laws are actually enforced, rather than selectively applied against small-scale offenders while large operators go untouched. Additionally, both the riverine trees and the mangroves in Sindh need the silt from the Indus in order to flourish, so the Indus River must also be allowed to flow if trees are to grow freely in Sindh once again. Technology can also play a transformative role in improving enforcement and transparency. Satellite imagery, drone surveillance and real-time forest monitoring systems are already being used successfully in other countries to track deforestation. Sindh could adopt some similar tools to create a publicly accessible forest monitoring dashboard, showing changes in tree cover, district by district. When deforestation becomes visible and verifiable, denial becomes harder and accountability easier. At the same time, economic incentives must be realigned. Deforestation persists in part because cutting trees is often more profitable than conserving them. The provincial government can counter this by expanding payment-for-ecosystem-services schemes, where communities are compensated for maintaining forest cover that provides flood protection, carbon sequestration and climate resilience. Agroforestry models that integrate trees into agricultural land can also reduce pressure on natural forests while supporting rural incomes. Finally, deforestation in Sindh has persisted because it rarely carries political consequences. Legislators, ministers and senior bureaucrats must be held publicly accountable for forest loss in their jurisdictions. Environmental protection cannot remain a peripheral concern in a province increasingly vulnerable to climate change. In the end, reversing deforestation in Sindh is less about planting more trees and more about fixing the systems that allow them to be cut down with impunity. Without institutional reform, legal clarity, community involvement and transparent governance, even the most ambitious afforestation campaigns will amount to little more than greenwashing. These solutions are not anything new or revolutionary, but what remains uncertain is whether the province’s political and bureaucratic leadership is willing to implement them. OF TRUCKS AND TORMENT The trucks do not stop even when the sun sets. Even after the Sindh government announced a ban on night-time transportation of timber and wood materials, which came into effect around November 2025, the loads keep moving in the dark. The order was meant to curb illegal cutting, give checkpoints better visibility and strengthen forest conservation efforts. But on stretches such as the Thatta-Karachi bypass and the National Highway, N-5, trucks carrying trees continue to roll through the night. Locals say the ban exists mostly on paper, so the wood keeps flowing out from rural Sindh through the night too. And when the rabrri seller will open his stall in the morning once again, the trucks loaded with timber will still be flowing past.

      "summary_en": "Near the Thatta-Karachi bypass, a rabrri [a condensed milk-based dessert] seller in his late thirties stands behind his roadside stall as sweat carves clean lines through the dust on his face. There are no trees nearby, no shade. There is only the open road and the sun beating straight down. The rabrri seller speaks about what Makli (located near Thatta in Sindh) used to be like two decades ago. “Even summers felt different then,” he says. In those days, thick trees lined the road, holding back the heat. Some evenings even brought a light drizzle, settling the dust and softening the air. People lingered outside and animals existed in their natural habitats. It seemed like there was a balance to things and a natural order. But now, there is only heat — and the trucks. MANUFACTURING HEAT A truck loaded with freshly cut wood thunders past. Then another. Then another. All of them are headed towards Karachi with engines roaring, and timber stacked high and loose. Tree varieties of neem , babul and keekarr are all piled atop this truck. Their trunks look thick enough to have been standing for decades. The trucks passing the rabrri seller’s stall are not an anomaly. They form a steady, visible supply chain running from lower Sindh into Karachi. Each one of these trucks carries with it more than wood. These trucks carry away shade from roads such as this one in Makli, cover from fields and riverbanks across Sindh, the homes of various local animals and birds, and the natural setting that gives rise to flora and fauna. Trucks barrelling across Sindh loaded with illegally cut timber have become an alarmingly routine sight in the province. It is estimated that Sindh has lost nearly 80 percent of its forest cover since Pakistan came into being, much of it in the last 30 years. As this rabid deforestation in Sindh has led to heatwaves and other related calamities year-after-year, are officials simply turning a blind eye, or are they complicit? What policies have led us to this juncture, and can anything be done to reverse the damage? According to numerous studies, deforestation and the removal of trees is directly linked to an increase in the intensity and frequency of heatwaves. Research shows that cutting down forests removes the cooling effect that trees provide, leading to local surface temperature increases of up to 4.5 degrees Celsius. As a result of this slow, engineered erasure of the natural ecosystem across Sindh, hundreds of people and livestock are dying every year in the province, as recurring heatwaves continue to ravage the land. According to a news report published in Dawn on June 22, 2025, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Sindh stated that “the 2024 heatwave alone led to 5,358 hospital admissions for heat-related illnesses and 158 livestock deaths. During the period between April and May, 2025, 675 heatstroke cases were treated across the province. Overall, an estimated 8.6 million people across 26 districts in Sindh faced heightened food insecurity due to compounding heat and drought risks.” This naturally begs the question: given the direct causation between deforestation and the increase in heat-related calamities and ailments, why are the authorities in the province allowing Sindh’s trees to be mowed down? According to drivers and residents familiar with these routes, each truck pays around Rs 4,000 to officials from the Sindh Forest Department in order to move freely across these lands. Trucks carrying timber from Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Thatta and lower Sindh funnel onto the National Highway N-5 for Karachi. On average, one truck passes every 15 minutes. That amounts to roughly 96 trucks a day. On a single route, that is Rs 384,000 changing hands daily. Over a month, the figure exceeds Rs 11.5 million. A truck driver tells Eos , “Pay and you can go anywhere. If you don’t pay, then you’re in trouble.” None of the trucks display visible permits and none of them are stopped for inspection at checkpoints. The Sindh Forest Department, which has publicly emphasised reclamation of encroached lands and afforestation drives, did not respond to requests for comments on the operation of these trucks and the seeming absence of any checks and balances. These trucks that have, in the words of the rabrri seller, “eaten everything” did not appear overnight. In fact, Sindh’s forests have been slowly dismantled in stages over nearly two centuries now, but the scale and impact has never been this large. A HISTORY OF DESTRUCTION When the British annexed Sindh in 1843, the Indus riverine forests were among the first landscapes to be surveyed, mapped and claimed. Timber from babul and keekarr fed railway expansion, cantonments and canal construction. Forests ceased to be living systems and became inventories. Large stretches of riverine forests were cleared to serve colonial infrastructure and revenue needs as floodplains were also regulated. In 1932, the Sukkur Barrage diverted water, thus reducing inundations and riverine regeneration. After Partition, the same logic persisted, as Pakistan inherited colonial forest laws. In 1947, the Sindh Forest Department inherited and managed 269,511 hectares of reserved forests and 24,369 hectares of protected forests, mainly riverine forests along the Indus floodplains. These figures marked the baseline for productive cover in the province, with dense stands of babul , keekarr and other species regenerating naturally through annual inundations. Since then, the nominal area of riverine forests has stayed roughly stable on official records at 241,198 hectares, as per the Sindh Forest Department, reflecting a modest nominal decline of about 28,313 hectares from the 1947 reserved figure. Yet, the effective loss is much steeper due to degradation, encroachment, illegal felling and reduced freshwater flows from barrages. Estimates indicate that up to 80 per cent of riverine forests have been destroyed or heavily degraded. By the 1950s, barrages such as Guddu and Kotri intensified the issue. The average annual flow from the Kotri Barrage dropped from 41 million acre-feet (MAF) during 1976-1998 to 14 MAF during 1999-2023. By the 1980s and 1990s, forest land in Sindh increasingly existed only on paper. Forest boundary pillars disappeared, while guards were few, poorly paid and easily overruled. Between the 1980s and early 2000s, Sindh’s forest cover declined drastically, with riverine forests in some areas shrinking by more than two-thirds or more — from over 20 percent to under seven percent of mapped study areas. Province-wide, Sindh likely lost 50 to 80 percent of its forested areas compared to its mid-20th century levels, with most of that reduction happening through the late 20th century and into the early 2000s. Men piling timber near the Kharochan Jetty: in rural Sindh, landlessness and debt pushes labourers into forest-cutting POLICY FAILURES In 2005, the Sindh government introduced its Agroforestry Policy , officially aimed at increasing tree cover through private participation. In practice, it opened vast tracts of riverine and irrigated forests to leasing. Natural forests were often cleared first and replantation was promised later. But oversight weakened as plantation targets were rarely enforced and influential landlords received leases. Environmental impact assessments arrived years late, if at all. As a result, while it was designed to increase tree cover by engaging local communities, the policy led to widespread deforestation, as land was often acquired by individuals who prioritised agricultural cultivation over planting trees. Despite this, by 2010, the policy was expanded. Lease terms were relaxed and more land was handed out as forests continued to vanish. In 2014, the policy was officially scrapped. The government announced the reclamation and restoration of encroached lands. According to the Sindh Sustainable Forest Management Policy 2019 , published on May 18, 2023 and available on the Sindh Forest Department’s website, one of the major factors behind the decrease in forest cover has been the “weak law enforcement of the forestry administration.” It also cites the Agroforestry Lease Policy of 2005 as being “detrimental for the forests.” The Sindh Forest Department has routinely taken budgetary allocations from provincial and federal governments specifically for the purpose of reclaiming encroached forest lands. But a persistent critique from environmental groups and after media investigations is that a cycle has been created, where funds are drawn for clearance operations while powerful encroachers are still allowed to delay or avoid eviction, thus letting the deforestation continue. This highlights a recurring failure of governance, where policies — whether for leasing or for reclamation — are undermined by weak enforcement and a lack of transparency. According to the Sindhi newspaper Pehnji Ikhbar , as of January 25, 2026, 75,000 acres of forest department land in Matiari have continuously been handed over to contractors who permit tree-cutting. Despite court orders and government restrictions, wood is still being cut from forest lands and government lands are being cultivated, with the forest department remaining a silent spectator. Furthermore, the Nasri Forest in Shaheed Benazirabad district (previously known as Nawabshah) has been granted to Bahria Town for the development of their third mega project in the area. Environmentalists and local residents have raised concerns that this move will lead to large-scale deforestation, an increase in temperature, loss of biodiversity and the disruption of the local ecosystem. IGNORANCE OR COMPLICITY? Ayaz Samoo has been cutting wood for over 20 years. He has spent decades working in forests, felling trees with skill and precision — first with axes and saws, now with machines. He used to cut trees by relying only on strength, experience and patience. “Back then, it was all hands and sweat,” he says. “Every tree has its own rhythm. You had to move carefully, understand it, or you could get hurt.” Today, machines have changed his work. Chainsaws roar through the forest where once only the sound of axes filled the air. “It is faster now, yes,” he explains, “but you do not ‘feel’ the tree in the same way.” That’s because cutting down trees has become a ruthlessly profitable business that is coming at the cost of the province and its people. Advocate Ammar Dayo, a vocal campaigner against deforestation and climate destruction in northern Sindh, calls the situation in Ghotki district “unprecedented”. “During the last three years, forest destruction here has reached levels never seen before,” he says. “The years 2024 and 2025 have been catastrophic for the following forests: Mirpur, Jahanpur, Adilpur, Jarwar, Sardar, Sandrani and Ronte. “The Sindh Forest Department is 100 percent involved in this,” Dayo claims. “From conservators to DFOs [divisional forest officers] to guards. Along with them, influential politicians, landlords, the police and even some local residents are involved.” In the Mirpur and Jahanpur forests, Dayo says mature babul trees — worth Rs 300,000 to Rs 400,000 per tree — have been cut and sold by the thousands. In Jror, Adilpur and Ronte forests, he estimates millions of keekarr and babul trees have been removed. Court orders banning sawmills within 10 kilometres of forest boundaries exist. On the ground, however, sawmills operate inside forest limits, cutting timber into planks and beams that are then loaded on to trucks. But the men cutting the trees are not the men profiting from them. In rural Sindh, landlessness and debt pushes labourers into forest-cutting. Daily wages are low, work is seasonal and alternatives are scarce as timber offers quick cash. The legal, ecological and climatic concerns are abstract to these men. Their hunger is not. A cutter in Sujawal tells Eos , “We cut for 500 rupees a day. The agents pay us and we use the money to get food for ourselves and our families.” But this is only a short-term monetary fix for a long-term monetary disaster. As forests shrink, pastoralists lose grazing land, heat exposure increases, livestock dwindles, families migrate towards cities already stretched thin and poverty deepens. A MAN-MADE CALAMITY Environmental expert Nasir Panhwar describes riverine forests not just as scenery but as infrastructure, and this infrastructure is being dismantled. “Biodiversity has been lost,” Panhwar says. “Some flora and fauna have disappeared entirely. Migration is underway because livelihoods dependent on forests and water are collapsing.” He estimates that up to 80 per cent of Sindh’s riverine forests have been destroyed. Official figures by the Sindh Forest Department paint a similar picture. Productive forests — riverine and irrigated plantations — now account for around just two per cent of Sindh’s land area. Nationally, Pakistan’s forest cover stands at around 4.7 per cent, among the lowest in the region. In Sindh, riverine forests have faced sharper degradation despite nominal stability in managed areas. In Thatta district alone, riverine area fell from 45,128 hectares in 1990 to 36,432 hectares in 2010 and then to 25,888 hectares by 2014 — an overall decline of about 43 per cent in that district, with other studies showing up to 89 per cent loss in Thatta’s forest cover from 1979 to 2010 (from 35.11 per cent to 2.23 per cent). As of 2025, Pakistan has only five trees per person, as per the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) estimates — far below the global average of 422 and the desirable 900 for sustainability. In Sindh, it’s lower still due to urban pressures and riverine loss. And, as forests vanish, heat intensifies. Trees lower surface temperatures, retain moisture and break heatwaves. Without them, roads and fields absorb sunlight. Nights offer no relief. A single mature tree provides shade for 10 people, cools the air by 2-5 degrees Celsius through evapotranspiration and absorbs 22 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide (CO2) yearly. In order to offset Sindh’s heat, one person would need a now-impossible number of around 200-300 trees. Nisar Laghari, a political activist from Hyderabad, disputes official figures on the scale of forest loss, arguing that even existing data understates the damage. According to him, Miani Forest historically spanned nearly 2,500 acres, stretching from the riverine belt up to Hyderabad Taluka. “Local records still show the forest at 2,500 acres,” he says, “but satellite mapping today reduces it to around 1,700 acres, already masking a significant loss.” Laghari alleges that of the land still visible on satellite imagery, 150 to 200 acres have been converted into agricultural fields through political pressure, while much of the remaining area is under illegal occupation. Adjacent to Miani Forest lies the Nawab Muhammad Khan Forest, covering another 500 acres, which he argues must be counted as part of the same ecological system when assessing total deforestation. “The destruction was not accidental,” Laghari says. “It became systematic when forest leases began to be issued, despite the fact that forest land is not legally eligible for leasing.” Those leases, he claims, opened the forest to commercial cutting and cultivation, fragmenting what was once a continuous green belt into isolated, degraded patches. Independent verification of these claims remains limited, but historical maps, satellite imagery and local testimony all point towards decades of gradual, policy-enabled deforestation rather than sudden encroachment. A truck, packed to the brim with timber, pictured at dusk: these operations continue through the night, despite the Sindh government announcing a ban on night-time transportation of timber and wood materials HOW TO RIGHT A WRONG Internationally, Pakistan presents itself as a climate victim — and it is. The country ranks among the world’s most climate-affected nations as it continues to be battered by floods, heatwaves and many other disasters. Ironically, Sindh has become a focal point for blue carbon projects, especially mangrove restoration, thus attracting international attention, consultants and seed funding. Carbon credits are calculated, maintenance budgets are allocated and photo opportunities multiply. But such efforts are futile if the broader picture across Sindh is ignored by the authorities. The province’s lungs are being depleted, and those tasked with protecting these forests are instead aiding in their destruction through negligent policymaking and a failure to enforce more stringent measures. It is important to stress that deforestation in Sindh is a governance failure. The steady disappearance of riverine forests and inland tree cover reflects weak policy frameworks, institutional complicity and the marginalisation of communities who once acted as de facto custodians of the land. Addressing this problem requires more than tree-planting drives or donor-funded campaigns. It demands structural reform, transparency and a reimagining of how forests are governed in the province. Reforming the Sindh Forest Department must be the starting point. The department currently suffers from overlapping mandates, poor accountability mechanisms and limited independent oversight. Forest officers wield extensive discretionary power over permits and enforcement, creating opportunities for rent-seeking and collusion with timber mafias. Introducing an independent forest oversight authority could help break this cycle. Regular third-party audits, public disclosure of logging permits and mandatory reporting of forest cover changes would make it harder for illegal activity to thrive under bureaucratic cover. Closely tied to institutional reform is the need for a clear, enforceable forest policy. Sindh’s forest laws are outdated and often poorly aligned with current land-use realities. Ambiguous classifications such as ‘protected’, ‘reserved’ and ‘unclassed’ forests are routinely exploited to justify encroachment and conversion. Updating forest legislation to remove loopholes, clarify land tenure and impose stricter penalties for illegal logging is essential. Equally important is ensuring that these laws are actually enforced, rather than selectively applied against small-scale offenders while large operators go untouched. Additionally, both the riverine trees and the mangroves in Sindh need the silt from the Indus in order to flourish, so the Indus River must also be allowed to flow if trees are to grow freely in Sindh once again. Technology can also play a transformative role in improving enforcement and transparency.

But the men cutting the trees are not the men profiting from them. In rural Sindh, landlessness and debt pushes labourers into forest-cutting. Daily wages are low, work is seasonal and alternatives are scarce as timber offers quick cash. The legal, ecological and climatic concerns are abstract to these men. Their hunger is not. A cutter in Sujawal tells Eos , “We cut for 500 rupees a day. The agents pay us and we use the money to get food for ourselves and our families.” But this is only a short-term monetary fix for a long-term monetary disaster. As forests shrink, pastoralists lose grazing land, heat exposure increases, livestock dwindles, families migrate towards cities already stretched thin and poverty deepens. A MAN-MADE CALAMITY Environmental expert Nasir Panhwar describes riverine forests not just as scenery but as infrastructure, and this infrastructure is being dismantled. “Biodiversity has been lost,” Panhwar says. “Some flora and fauna have disappeared entirely. Migration is underway because livelihoods dependent on forests and water are collapsing.” He estimates that up to 80 per cent of Sindh’s riverine forests have been destroyed. Official figures by the Sindh Forest Department paint a similar picture. Productive forests — riverine and irrigated plantations — now account for around just two per cent of Sindh’s land area. Nationally, Pakistan’s forest cover stands at around 4.7 per cent, among the lowest in the region. In Sindh, riverine forests have faced sharper degradation despite nominal stability in managed areas. In Thatta district alone, riverine area fell from 45,128 hectares in 1990 to 36,432 hectares in 2010 and then to 25,888 hectares by 2014 — an overall decline of about 43 per cent in that district, with other studies showing up to 89 per cent loss in Thatta’s forest cover from 1979 to 2010 (from 35.11 per cent to 2.23 per cent). As of 2025, Pakistan has only five trees per person, as per the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) estimates — far below the global average of 422 and the desirable 900 for sustainability. In Sindh, it’s lower still due to urban pressures and riverine loss. And, as forests vanish, heat intensifies. Trees lower surface temperatures, retain moisture and break heatwaves. Without them, roads and fields absorb sunlight. Nights offer no relief. A single mature tree provides shade for 10 people, cools the air by 2-5 degrees Celsius through evapotranspiration and absorbs 22 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide (CO2) yearly. In order to offset Sindh’s heat, one person would need a now-impossible number of around 200-300 trees. Nisar Laghari, a political activist from Hyderabad, disputes official figures on the scale of forest loss, arguing that even existing data understates the damage. According to him, Miani Forest historically spanned nearly 2,500 acres, stretching from the riverine belt up to Hyderabad Taluka. “Local records still show the forest at 2,500 acres,” he says, “but satellite mapping today reduces it to around 1,700 acres, already masking a significant loss.” Laghari alleges that of the land still visible on satellite imagery, 150 to 200 acres have been converted into agricultural fields through political pressure, while much of the remaining area is under illegal occupation. Adjacent to Miani Forest lies the Nawab Muhammad Khan Forest, covering another 500 acres, which he argues must be counted as part of the same ecological system when assessing total deforestation. “The destruction was not accidental,” Laghari says. “It became systematic when forest leases began to be issued, despite the fact that forest land is not legally eligible for leasing.” Those leases, he claims, opened the forest to commercial cutting and cultivation, fragmenting what was once a continuous green belt into isolated, degraded patches. Independent verification of these claims remains limited, but historical maps, satellite imagery and local testimony all point towards decades of gradual, policy-enabled deforestation rather than sudden encroachment. A truck, packed to the brim with timber, pictured at dusk: these operations continue through the night, despite the Sindh government announcing a ban on night-time transportation of timber and wood materials HOW TO RIGHT A WRONG Internationally, Pakistan presents itself as a climate victim — and it is. The country ranks among the world’s most climate-affected nations as it continues to be battered by floods, heatwaves and many other disasters. Ironically, Sindh has become a focal point for blue carbon projects, especially mangrove restoration, thus attracting international attention, consultants and seed funding. Carbon credits are calculated, maintenance budgets are allocated and photo opportunities multiply. But such efforts are futile if the broader picture across Sindh is ignored by the authorities. The province’s lungs are being depleted, and those tasked with protecting these forests are instead aiding in their destruction through negligent policymaking and a failure to enforce more stringent measures. It is important to stress that deforestation in Sindh is a governance failure. The steady disappearance of riverine forests and inland tree cover reflects weak policy frameworks, institutional complicity and the marginalisation of communities who once acted as de facto custodians of the land. Addressing this problem requires more than tree-planting drives or donor-funded campaigns. It demands structural reform, transparency and a reimagining of how forests are governed in the province. Reforming the Sindh Forest Department must be the starting point. The department currently suffers from overlapping mandates, poor accountability mechanisms and limited independent oversight. Forest officers wield extensive discretionary power over permits and enforcement, creating opportunities for rent-seeking and collusion with timber mafias. Introducing an independent forest oversight authority could help break this cycle. Regular third-party audits, public disclosure of logging permits and mandatory reporting of forest cover changes would make it harder for illegal activity to thrive under bureaucratic cover. Closely tied to institutional reform is the need for a clear, enforceable forest policy. Sindh’s forest laws are outdated and often poorly aligned with current land-use realities. Ambiguous classifications such as ‘protected’, ‘reserved’ and ‘unclassed’ forests are routinely exploited to justify encroachment and conversion. Updating forest legislation to remove loopholes, clarify land tenure and impose stricter penalties for illegal logging is essential. Equally important is ensuring that these laws are actually enforced, rather than selectively applied against small-scale offenders while large operators go untouched. Additionally, both the riverine trees and the mangroves in Sindh need the silt from the Indus in order to flourish, so the Indus River must also be allowed to flow if trees are to grow freely in Sindh once again. Technology can also play a transformative role in improving enforcement and transparency. Satellite imagery, drone surveillance and real-time forest monitoring systems are already being used successfully in other countries to track deforestation. Sindh could adopt some similar tools to create a publicly accessible forest monitoring dashboard, showing changes in tree cover, district by district. When deforestation becomes visible and verifiable, denial becomes harder and accountability easier. At the same time, economic incentives must be realigned. Deforestation persists in part because cutting trees is often more profitable than conserving them. The provincial government can counter this by expanding payment-for-ecosystem-services schemes, where communities are compensated for maintaining forest cover that provides flood protection, carbon sequestration and climate resilience. Agroforestry models that integrate trees into agricultural land can also reduce pressure on natural forests while supporting rural incomes. Finally, deforestation in Sindh has persisted because it rarely carries political consequences. Legislators, ministers and senior bureaucrats must be held publicly accountable for forest loss in their jurisdictions. Environmental protection cannot remain a peripheral concern in a province increasingly vulnerable to climate change. In the end, reversing deforestation in Sindh is less about planting more trees and more about fixing the systems that allow them to be cut down with impunity. Without institutional reform, legal clarity, community involvement and transparent governance, even the most ambitious afforestation campaigns will amount to little more than greenwashing. These solutions are not anything new or revolutionary, but what remains uncertain is whether the province’s political and bureaucratic leadership is willing to implement them. OF TRUCKS AND TORMENT The trucks do not stop even when the sun sets. Even after the Sindh government announced a ban on night-time transportation of timber and wood materials, which came into effect around November 2025, the loads keep moving in the dark. The order was meant to curb illegal cutting, give checkpoints better visibility and strengthen forest conservation efforts. But on stretches such as the Thatta-Karachi bypass and the National Highway, N-5, trucks carrying trees continue to roll through the night. Locals say the ban exists mostly on paper, so the wood keeps flowing out from rural Sindh through the night too. And when the rabrri seller will open his stall in the morning once again, the trucks loaded with timber will still be flowing past.

      "summary_orig": "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the start of nuclear talks with the United States, as his counterpart Donald Trump threatened “bad things” if no deal with the Islamic republic was struck. Following the Iranian authorities’ response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, the US president has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East. Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will “work something out” with Iran, but also warned late on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal is reached. Tehran has insisted it wants diplomacy, while vowing an unbridled response to any aggression. Iranian state media reported on Monday that President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of nuclear talks with Washington. Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of nuclear talks. “I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” Pezeshkian said in a post on X. The talks will be held “within the framework of our national interests”, he said. A meeting is likely to take place in Turkiye on Friday, following interventions by Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Oman, an Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. US news site Axios cited two unnamed sources as saying Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal on the nuclear issue. Trump had warned “time is running out” for Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb, a claim Tehran has repeatedly denied. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” adding that, “in return, we expect sanctions lifting”. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said earlier on Monday that Tehran was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players. ‘Police the world’ Turkiye has led a diplomatic push to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and speaking with other regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Jordan’s top diplomat, Ayman Safadi, assured Araghchi on Monday that the kingdom would “not be a battleground in any regional conflict or a launching pad for any military action against Iran”. Iranian authorities, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have warned any US attack would trigger a “regional war”. In Tehran, pensioner Ali Hamidi told AFP he was a veteran and “not afraid of war”, but that “America should mind its own business, why does it want to police the world?” But, the 68-year-old added, “Iranian officials are also at fault for not providing for the people. The economic troubles are back-breaking… The officials should do something tangible, not just talk.” The protests were sparked in late December by economic strain and exploded in size and intensity over several days in early January. Authorities have said the protests were “riots” inflamed by its arch-foes US and Israel, with Khamenei likening them to a “coup” attempt. Ambassadors summoned Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday the presidency published the names of 2,986 people out of the 3,117 whom authorities said were killed in the unrest. Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”. Young Iranian Selina, who would not give her full name, travelled to Iraqi Kurdistan seeking some relief from “living in fear”. “It’s not safe for us” in Iran, the 25-year-old told AFP . “We don’t even dare to go out after 6:00 pm because soldiers are everywhere.” The crackdown prompted the European Union to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation, with Iranian lawmakers retaliating on Sunday by slapping the same designation on European armies. The EU also issued fresh sanctions on Iranian officials, including the interior minister, a move echoed on Monday by Britain, which announced sanctions on 10 individuals over the “brutality against protesters”. Baqaei said on Monday the foreign ministry had summoned all the EU member state ambassadors in Tehran over the designation, and that other responses were to come. Iranian state television also announced four foreigners had been arrested in Tehran for “participation in riots”, without specifying their nationalities. Authorities have continued to announce arrests, with rights groups estimating at least 40,000 people have been detained over the protests.",

      "title": "Trump warns of ‘bad things’ if no deal reached with Iran",
      "summary": "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the start of nuclear talks with the United States, as his counterpart Donald Trump threatened “bad things” if no deal with the Islamic republic was struck. Following the Iranian authorities’ response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, the US president has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East. Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will “work something out” with Iran, but also warned late on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal is reached. Tehran has insisted it wants diplomacy, while vowing an unbridled response to any aggression. Iranian state media reported on Monday that President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of nuclear talks with Washington. Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of nuclear talks. “I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” Pezeshkian said in a post on X. The talks will be held “within the framework of our national interests”, he said. A meeting is likely to take place in Turkiye on Friday, following interventions by Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Oman, an Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. US news site Axios cited two unnamed sources as saying Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal on the nuclear issue. Trump had warned “time is running out” for Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb, a claim Tehran has repeatedly denied. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” adding that, “in return, we expect sanctions lifting”. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said earlier on Monday that Tehran was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players. ‘Police the world’ Turkiye has led a diplomatic push to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and speaking with other regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Jordan’s top diplomat, Ayman Safadi, assured Araghchi on Monday that the kingdom would “not be a battleground in any regional conflict or a launching pad for any military action against Iran”. Iranian authorities, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have warned any US attack would trigger a “regional war”. In Tehran, pensioner Ali Hamidi told AFP he was a veteran and “not afraid of war”, but that “America should mind its own business, why does it want to police the world?” But, the 68-year-old added, “Iranian officials are also at fault for not providing for the people.

Despite a November 2024 truce that sought to end more than a year of hostilities including two months of all-out war between Israel and the group, Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon and has maintained troops in five areas it deems strategic. Justifying the destruction, the Israeli military claimed that it was targeting “weapons storage facilities”. It further attempted to legitimise the bombing of residential neighbourhoods by reciting its standard claims, saying fighters hiding among “civilian infrastructure”. The Israeli army had previously sent evacuation warnings for the towns of Kfar Tibnit and Ain Qana in southern Lebanon. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported strikes on the targeted buildings in both towns. Earlier on Monday, the Lebanese health ministry said an Israeli strike on Ansariyeh in southern Lebanon killed one person and wounded four others. Another strike on Qleileh, elsewhere in the south, also wounded four people, according to the ministry. The NNA reported Israeli strikes on vehicles near both areas, which came without warning. Lebanon has repeatedly protested Israeli strikes on Lebanon as violations of the ceasefire. More than 360 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon since the ceasefire.

Despite a November 2024 truce that sought to end more than a year of hostilities including two months of all-out war between Israel and the group, Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon and has maintained troops in five areas it deems strategic. Justifying the destruction, the Israeli military claimed that it was targeting “weapons storage facilities”. It further attempted to legitimise the bombing of residential neighbourhoods by reciting its standard claims, saying fighters hiding among “civilian infrastructure”. The Israeli army had previously sent evacuation warnings for the towns of Kfar Tibnit and Ain Qana in southern Lebanon. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported strikes on the targeted buildings in both towns. Earlier on Monday, the Lebanese health ministry said an Israeli strike on Ansariyeh in southern Lebanon killed one person and wounded four others. Another strike on Qleileh, elsewhere in the south, also wounded four people, according to the ministry. The NNA reported Israeli strikes on vehicles near both areas, which came without warning. Lebanon has repeatedly protested Israeli strikes on Lebanon as violations of the ceasefire. More than 360 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon since the ceasefire.

      "summary_orig": "• Achakzai terms murder of innocents ‘inhuman act’; says sense of deprivation has fuelled terrorism • Khawaja Asif rejects disparity narrative, says it is being used to exploit sympathies of Baloch youth • PPP’s Ashraf suggests parties should avoid confrontation on issues of national import • Senate adopts resolution against terror attacks • Sana insists on calling spade a spade ‘without ifs or buts’ ISLAMABAD: As lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in the lower house of parliament exhibited rare unity on Monday in condemning the deadly terror attacks in Balochistan, with varying opinions on the way of tackling the menace, Def­e­nce Minister Khawaja Asif asserted that backwardness of any area was no justification to stand against the state. Suggestions came from across the aisles that instead of a mere debate on the grave issue of terrorism, the government should take decisive action to eliminate terrorists with full force so that the life of a common man could be safeguarded. However, when proceedings concluded, only 10 members were sitting in the house, indicating the seriousness of lawmakers in addressing one of the biggest challenges confronting Pakistan. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who was presiding over the NA session, earlier suspended its agenda and confined its proceedings to the issue of fresh terror attacks in Balochistan. In his speech on the floor of the house, the defence minister said a total of 177 terrorists were killed within a few days following the deadly attacks in Balochistan that claimed the lives of 10 policemen, one Levies man, six FC personnel and as many as 33 civilians. The defence minister warned that political polarisation and fragmented national narratives were undermining Pakistan’s fight against terrorism, cautioning that internal divisions only served the interests of militant groups and hostile foreign actors. He said the country continued to pay a heavy price for past policy decisions, particularly those linked to regional conflicts, adding that the burden of those choices was being borne by civilians and security personnel rather than by those who had made the decisions decades ago. He urged parliamentarians to demonstrate unity on matters of national security, saying a divided political discourse weakened public confidence and emboldened hostile forces. Highlighting the human cost of terrorism, the defence minister said civilians in affected areas faced daily threats, while members of the armed forces continued to make sacrifices to safeguard national security. He ruled out the narrative of disparity and backwardness in Balochistan, saying that banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which he described as India-sponsored, exploited this narrative to gain the sympathy of Baloch youth. While presenting a comparison between the current situation and that at the time of independence in 1947, he said, “In 1947, there were only 114 schools in Balochistan, whereas today there are 1,596. There was no university in the province at that time, but now there are 12 universities. Today, Balochistan has five medical colleges, 145 other colleges, 13 cadet colleges, 21 technical institutions, 13 hospitals, 18 teaching hospitals, 23 district headquarters hospitals, 756 basic health units, 841 dispensaries, four cardiac centres and 24 dialysis centres,” he added. But Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai rejected the claims and figures presented by the defence minister, saying Mr Asif had no understanding of the situation in the province. He said the unjust distribution of resources had created a sense of deprivation among the people, which fuelled terrorism. “The first right over resources rests with the people of the areas from where those resources are extracted. We can overcome terrorism in a short time by giving due rights to the people,” he added. An ‘inhuman’ act Mr Achakzai, however, condemned the attacks and said the killing of innocent labourers, teachers and people from other provinces in Balochistan was an inhuman act and could not be justified. He urged the National Assembly speaker to hold a marathon session on terrorism lasting two days and to allow all members to speak on the issue. Tracing the history of Balochistan since the British Raj, the opposition leader claimed that the Pashtun population was equal to the Baloch population in the province. When Mr Achakzai held the country’s intelligence agencies responsible for failing to prevent the attacks, Speaker Sadiq commended the role of the security forces and intelligence agencies and urged the defence minister to provide details of how many terrorist attacks had been thwarted in the recent past. A critical moment Taking part in the debate, senior PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf said political disagreements were a part of democratic life, but should not overshadow issues of terrorism, national integrity and security. He cautioned against targeting national institutions for political gain, saying such actions damaged morale and could be exploited by hostile neighbours. He warned that political infighting and confrontational narratives were weakening the country at a critical moment. Referring to the sacrifices of soldiers deployed along the borders and in terrorism-affected areas, the PPP lawmaker said any impression that their sacrifices were being undermined could have serious consequences for national resolve. He urged all political parties, including the opposition parties, to rise above partisan interests and present a united front on matters of national security. The PPP leader called for comprehensive parliamentary engagement on security challenges, proposing that the House hold full debates and form committees to examine the situation and present concrete recommendations. He stressed that Balochistan’s stability must remain a national priority and should be addressed through consensus rather than political confrontation. The debate was held following the adoption of a motion to discuss the prevailing law and order situation in the country. During their speeches, Mehmood Achakzai and Barrister Gohar demanded the release of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and called for him to be allowed to meet his doctors and family particularly in light of reports that he was suffering from ‘a serious medical condition’.

      "title_orig": "Govt rules out talks with terrorists as Senate condemns spate of attacks in Balochistan",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday ruled out talks with terrorists as the upper house of Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the spate of terrorist attacks in Balochistan , while also urging the government to ensure a transparent investigation into the incidents. Speaking in the Senate, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah ruled out talks with terrorists. He urged all political forces to adopt a unified national stance against terrorism, fully support law enforcement agencies and the armed forces, and honour the sacrifices of martyrs and their families. Responding to the points raised by opposition leader Raja Nasir Abbas, he said: “No one is angry in Balochistan; there is no issue of rights. They are taking action against Pakistan on the instructions of the enemy.” He said that terrorists should be called terrorists without any ifs or buts and that action should be taken against them without any ambiguity. He pointed out that the enemy was humiliated during Marka-i-Haq and these terrorists would also face a similar fate. He went on to say that criminal and terrorist activities could be carried out anywhere by small armed groups, even in relatively secure areas, but the pattern of violence witnessed in Balochistan reflected organised terrorism rather than isolated criminal acts. Sanaullah said terrorists in Balochistan had repeatedly stopped passenger buses, checked travellers’ identity cards and executed innocent citizens in front of their families, including women and children. He said such brutality had also been witnessed in attacks on trains, including the Jaffar Express. “These are acts of extreme savagery that no sane human being can justify,” he said, questioning the narrative that such groups were merely “disgruntled”. He said the terrorists were acting as the operatives of a hostile country, seeking to avenge the defeat suffered by enemy forces during Marka-i-Haq. He said security forces had thwarted attempts to breach the Quetta Red Zone and neutralised the terrorists wherever they attempted to operate. “They could not withstand direct engagement with the forces and were forced to flee back to their hideouts,” he added. He rejected any linkage between terrorism and political demands such as elections, saying the terrorists had no public mandate, no political agenda and no belief in the democratic system. Meanwhile, in his speech, the Senate opposition leader called for moving toward the rule of law to steer the country out of crisis. He also called for initiating dialogue and taking everyone on board. “We should have talked to the angry people; Those who talk about the Constitution, talk about Pakistan, hold sit-ins — their words are not heard. And, when their women come to Islamabad, they are treated badly,” he noted. He said most of the sitting lawmakers were not true representatives of the people and therefore cannot represent them. Referring to the attacks in Balochistan, he said, “They (terrorists) freely moved around for three or four hours, and security was breached. Banks were blown up … no one stopped them.” He questioned whether anyone had resigned in the wake of the incidents. He said Rs 80 billion were spent annually on security in the province but regretted there was no government writ at night. He said that those responsible should be held accountable. Meanwhile, PTI’s parliamentary leader Ali Zafar rejected attempts to create the impression that the party was siding with terrorists, declaring that the enemies of Pakistan were also the enemies of the party. He said those who kill, set the national flag on fire and damage state property were enemies of the country and should be treated as terrorists. He, however, said the PTI supported all peaceful movements for rights. He noted that people’s support was essential to effectively tackle the menace of terrorism, for which incarcerated party founder Imran Khan must be taken on board. He regretted that the government was labelling the PTI as a terrorist organisation and was not ready to give political space to it. “You will meet the fate of failure if you do not include the PTI in your national plan. You need us because we have the true public mandate”, he remarked. Senate passes resolution Meanwhile, the Senate passed a resolution condemning the attacks in Balochistan. Moved by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the resolution urged the government to ensure a transparent, swift and conclusive investigation into the incidents, and bring the perpetrators, facilitators, and local and international sponsors of terrorism to justice in accordance with the law. It also called upon the federal and provincial governments to further strengthen intelligence coordination, border security, and counter-terrorism mechanisms, with a special focus on Balochistan. The resolution condemned the attacks and offered condolences to the families of the martyrs. It also lauded the courage and sacrifices of the security forces and law enforcement agencies, and reiterated the nation’s resolve to foil terrorist attempts. “The unity of the state and the will of the people will prevail over all forces of violence, extremism, and terrorism,” the resolution said. It also reaffirmed the Senate’s commitment to peace, development and political inclusion in Balochistan, recognising that “sustainable security is inseparable from socio-economic progress, good governance, and respect for constitutional rights”. As many as 92 terrorists were killed on Saturday as security forces repulsed coordinated attacks by members of banned organisations in parts of the provincial capital and around a dozen other cities and towns across Balochistan, the military’s media wing said. In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR said that at the “behest of their foreign masters, these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the lives of the local populace and the development of Balochistan”. It said that said 15 security personnel were martyred while repulsing the attacks, while 18 civilians also lost their lives. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had held India responsible for the spate of attacks. Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said: “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.” He said that authorities would go after every single one of those involved and the “masters behind them”.",

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday ruled out talks with terrorists as the upper house of Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the spate of terrorist attacks in Balochistan , while also urging the government to ensure a transparent investigation into the incidents. Speaking in the Senate, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah ruled out talks with terrorists. He urged all political forces to adopt a unified national stance against terrorism, fully support law enforcement agencies and the armed forces, and honour the sacrifices of martyrs and their families. Responding to the points raised by opposition leader Raja Nasir Abbas, he said: “No one is angry in Balochistan; there is no issue of rights. They are taking action against Pakistan on the instructions of the enemy.” He said that terrorists should be called terrorists without any ifs or buts and that action should be taken against them without any ambiguity. He pointed out that the enemy was humiliated during Marka-i-Haq and these terrorists would also face a similar fate. He went on to say that criminal and terrorist activities could be carried out anywhere by small armed groups, even in relatively secure areas, but the pattern of violence witnessed in Balochistan reflected organised terrorism rather than isolated criminal acts. Sanaullah said terrorists in Balochistan had repeatedly stopped passenger buses, checked travellers’ identity cards and executed innocent citizens in front of their families, including women and children. He said such brutality had also been witnessed in attacks on trains, including the Jaffar Express. “These are acts of extreme savagery that no sane human being can justify,” he said, questioning the narrative that such groups were merely “disgruntled”. He said the terrorists were acting as the operatives of a hostile country, seeking to avenge the defeat suffered by enemy forces during Marka-i-Haq. He said security forces had thwarted attempts to breach the Quetta Red Zone and neutralised the terrorists wherever they attempted to operate. “They could not withstand direct engagement with the forces and were forced to flee back to their hideouts,” he added. He rejected any linkage between terrorism and political demands such as elections, saying the terrorists had no public mandate, no political agenda and no belief in the democratic system. Meanwhile, in his speech, the Senate opposition leader called for moving toward the rule of law to steer the country out of crisis. He also called for initiating dialogue and taking everyone on board. “We should have talked to the angry people; Those who talk about the Constitution, talk about Pakistan, hold sit-ins — their words are not heard. And, when their women come to Islamabad, they are treated badly,” he noted. He said most of the sitting lawmakers were not true representatives of the people and therefore cannot represent them. Referring to the attacks in Balochistan, he said, “They (terrorists) freely moved around for three or four hours, and security was breached. Banks were blown up … no one stopped them.” He questioned whether anyone had resigned in the wake of the incidents. He said Rs 80 billion were spent annually on security in the province but regretted there was no government writ at night. He said that those responsible should be held accountable. Meanwhile, PTI’s parliamentary leader Ali Zafar rejected attempts to create the impression that the party was siding with terrorists, declaring that the enemies of Pakistan were also the enemies of the party. He said those who kill, set the national flag on fire and damage state property were enemies of the country and should be treated as terrorists. He, however, said the PTI supported all peaceful movements for rights. He noted that people’s support was essential to effectively tackle the menace of terrorism, for which incarcerated party founder Imran Khan must be taken on board. He regretted that the government was labelling the PTI as a terrorist organisation and was not ready to give political space to it. “You will meet the fate of failure if you do not include the PTI in your national plan. You need us because we have the true public mandate”, he remarked. Senate passes resolution Meanwhile, the Senate passed a resolution condemning the attacks in Balochistan. Moved by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the resolution urged the government to ensure a transparent, swift and conclusive investigation into the incidents, and bring the perpetrators, facilitators, and local and international sponsors of terrorism to justice in accordance with the law. It also called upon the federal and provincial governments to further strengthen intelligence coordination, border security, and counter-terrorism mechanisms, with a special focus on Balochistan. The resolution condemned the attacks and offered condolences to the families of the martyrs. It also lauded the courage and sacrifices of the security forces and law enforcement agencies, and reiterated the nation’s resolve to foil terrorist attempts. “The unity of the state and the will of the people will prevail over all forces of violence, extremism, and terrorism,” the resolution said.
