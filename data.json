The flight, KE9689, took off at around 7:26 p.m. for Phnom Penh. It is scheduled to depart the Cambodian capital at around 2 a.m. Saturday, carrying the Koreans, and expected to arrive in Incheon later in the day, the government said. A large number of law enforcement officers are reportedly on board the flight to escort the individuals being repatriated. Typically, two officers accompany each suspect during such extradition operations. Korea has sent a joint response team to Cambodia to address crimes targeting nationals amid public outrage over the torture and death of a Korean college student in August.",

      "summary_orig": "A recent protest lodged by United States Forces Korea (USFK) over a special counsel team’s search at Osan Air Base has raised questions among Seoul officials about the basis of the complaint, sources said Friday. The rare protest by the U.S. military focuses on the fact that the search was not communicated in advance, even though investigators passed through areas managed by U.S. forces to reach a Korean-managed zone — their intended target during the search on July 21. Washington has claimed that the move violated procedures under the bilateral Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), which governs the legal status of the U.S. military’s operations in Korea. Seoul, however, appears to argue that passing through the U.S.-managed area was unavoidable for the investigators to access their target area, and thus does not constitute a violation of SOFA. \"The investigators’ entry to Osan base was carried out in line with established security and entry procedures agreed upon by both sides,\" a government official told The Korea Times on condition of anonymity. \"Under the agreement, visitors fr",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan and Afghanistan extend ceasefire, confirms diplomatic source",
      "summary_orig": "The temporary ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan has been extended, a senior diplomatic source confirmed to Dawn.com on Friday. On the night of August 11, Afghanistan launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistani border posts, triggering a series of skirmishes that carried on until Wednesday, leaving 23 troops martyred and over 200 Taliban fighters dead. The Pakistan armed forces conducted “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and the capital Kabul. A temporary ceasefire was agreed at Afghanistan’s request for 48 hours, which expired at 6pm today. According to the diplomatic source, the ceasefire period has been extended until the end of talks in the Qatari capital Doha. “The temporary ceasefire was extended at the request of the Afghan Taliban government,” the source said. “High-level talks are expected to begin on Saturday.” Islamabad Kabul working to resolve ‘complex but solvable’ issue Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) stated that Pakistan and Afghanistan are sincerely working towards resolving the “complex but solvable” issue of border clashes amid a temporary ceasefire. During a weekly press briefing at the FO, spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan highlighted that during the 48-hour ceasefire, both sides were making “sincere efforts to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue”. “Pakistan greatly values dialogue and diplomacy and a mutually beneficial relationship with Afghanistan,” he said. “At the same time, the Government of Pakistan continues to closely monitor the situation and would take all possible measures to safeguard its territory and the lives of its people.” Khan added that Pakistan wants a “peaceful, stable, friendly, inclusive, regionally connected, and prosperous Afghanistan” but highlighted that Kabul needs to fulfil its obligations and promises under the Doha Process. He also reiterated Pakistan’s requests to the Afghan Taliban to prohibit the use of their soil for terrorism. “Pakistan has repeatedly shared its concerns related to the presence of Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan operating from Afghan soil,” Khan said. “Pakistan expects concrete and verifiable actions against these terrorist elements by the Taliban regime.” Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Islamabad was ready to talk if Kabul agreed to fulfil Pakistan’s “justified” conditions following recent hostilities between the two countries. “Yesterday we decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready. The ball is in their court,” he said during a cabinet meeting. Last week, the FO censured Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for remarks during a visit to India and said “deflecting” the responsibility of controlling terrorism could not absolve the Afghan authorities of their responsibilities towards regional peace. “Whatever the problems are in each country should be solved by themselves,” he said, seemingly in response to Pakistan’s repeated requests to prevent terrorists from operating in Afghan territory. He added that there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan. The FO responded by saying terrorism was not an internal problem and highlighted the presence of Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan in Afghan territory. The border clashes come against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. While Kabul maintains that it does not provide safe havens to terrorists, Afghan officials blamed Pakistan on Friday for bombing a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line and also violating the territory of the capital Kabul. This was after an explosion was reported in Afghanistan last Thursday night. The FO in Islamabad avoided directly acknowledging the incident in Kabul during a weekly briefing last Friday, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil. Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, the Inter-Services Public Relations director general also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out any strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan opener Omaima Sohail said on Friday that the team was still looking forward to a chance to make the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s World Cup , ahead of their clash with New Zealand on Saturday. On Wednesday, Pakistan’s hopes of a first victory at the World Cup were hit by rain , with their crucial fixture against England being abandoned after a second downpour in Colombo. Chasing a revised target of 113 to win after earlier rains had reduced the match to 31 overs per side, Pakistan were well on their way at 34-0 in 6.4 overs when rains returned to end any chance of the match being completed — saving England from their first ever loss against the Green Shirts. Speaking at the pre-match press conference at the R. Pramedasa Stadium in Colombo, Omaima said: “We are not relaxed at all. We have a chance to go [to the] semis if we win the matches, like three matches. “So maybe the scenario is open, so maybe we will win the three matches, so we have a chance in the semis.” Omaima showed glimpses of form in the England encounter, hitting a couple of sublime drives through the covers on her way to an unbeaten run-a-ball 18. She, along with fellow opener Muneeba Ali, will be pivotal to providing stability at the top for a batting line-up that has failed to cross the 200-run mark in the tournament so far. “I think the main challenge is to open — play the new ball. If you saw the matches, they are seaming and the pitch is [helping] seam. I’m trying to play the new ball and working on it,” the right-handed batter said of the challenges of opening. Pakistan’s bowling, however, has been the real positive for the Green Shirts so far — having strong sides like England and Australia 78-7 and 76-7 in back-to-back matches. New Zealand head coach Ben Sawyer was also wary about the danger posed by the Pakistani bowling at the presser. “From Pakistan, Yeah. Look, they’ve put some teams in some real tough spots, so I think they had Australia 6 for 60. And then obviously the other night England was 7 for 70. So, their bowling attack is one that we’ve got to be really wary of. Sawyer also spoke about the improvements seen in the Pakistani top-order in the previous outing against England, saying: “Their top order is, they made a little bit — look like light work of maybe chasing down that total the other night. So, they’ve been impressive.” The Kiwis also go into the encounter with a washout of their own against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. The match got called off after Sri Lanka scored a daunting 258-6 batting first. Last week‘s defeat against Australia had left the Green Shirts’ knockout hopes hanging by a thread as Pakistan registered three losses on the trot. Pakistan will be hoping to register their first win and get on the board on Saturday, and then hope the permutations and other teams’ results go in their favour to make it into the semis somehow — a quintessentially Pakistani World Cup experience.",

But the truth is that passport strength reflects far more than airport convenience: it mirrors international trust, governance standards and economic credibility. The weaker the state, the weaker its passport. And ours, sadly, carries the weight of poor diplomacy, inconsistent policies, and a brand image that does not inspire confidence abroad. What can be done? For starters, the government might invest in the kind of soft power that cannot be stamped or embossed — improving governance, security, and regional relationships. Trade, tourism and academic exchange do more for mobility than slogans about ‘image building’. A modern passport design or biometric upgrade will not help if the world continues to view Pakistan as unpredictable rather than a reliable partner with a coherent vision for engagement. Until then, Pakistanis can take comfort in the one privilege our passport still offers: the ability to stay firmly grounded. After all, who really needs jet lag anyway?

      "summary_orig": "A high-level meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, was informed on Friday that as of October 16, a total of 1,477,592 Afghan nationals have been repatriated and the government will grant no further extension. A drive to expel more than 1.3 million Afghan nationals with Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders, the last category of refugees legally living in the country without visas, has been underway since Sept 1 this year. According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the meeting’s attendees were told that only those Afghans who possess a valid Pakistani visa would be allowed to stay in Pakistan and the number of exit points on the Afghan side are being increased to make the repatriation process smoother and faster. “Officials informed the meeting that harboring Afghan nationals residing illegally in Pakistan or allowing them to stay in guesthouses is a criminal offense, and efforts are underway to identify such individuals. The public will be involved in the repatriation process, and no one will be allowed to violate government policy by providing shelter to Afghan nationals,” stated the statement from the PMO. PM Shehbaz emphasised that during the repatriation of illegal Afghan refugees, elderly persons, women, children, and minorities must be treated with dignity. The meeting was attended by Chief of the Staff Army Field Marshall Asim Munir, chief ministers of all provinces except KP, premier of Azad Kashmir, federal ministers and other officials. Referring to Afghanistan, the prime minister said that senior Pakistani officials, including the deputy prime minister, had visited Kabul multiple times to hold discussions with the Afghan interim government, urging them to prevent Afghan soil from being used for terrorism against Pakistan. “Pakistan has made serious diplomatic and political efforts to stop the infiltration of militants from Afghanistan,” said the prime minister during the meeting. “The brave people of Pakistan, who have lost loved ones in the war against terrorism, now ask: how long will the government continue to bear the burden of Afghan refugees?” The prime minister maintained that the recent attack on the border areas of Pakistan from Afghanistan and support for terrorist infiltration is a “matter of serious concern”. “The brave armed forces of Pakistan gave a strong and decisive response to this attack. Under the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir, the Pakistan Armed Forces repelled the Afghan attacks. The entire nation joins me in paying tribute to them,“ added Shehbaz. Concluding the meeting, the premier urged all provinces to extend full cooperation regarding the repatriation of Afghan refugees. The forum also decided that all recommendations presented would be “strictly implemented”. The UN’s refugee agency had reported that more than 3.5 million Afghans had been living in Pakistan, including around 700,000 people who came after the Taliban takeover in 2021. The UN estimated that half of them were undocumented. Though Pakistan had taken care of Afghans during the past decades of war, the government is now compelled to say that the high number of refugees is eventually posing risks to national security and causing pressure on public services.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Friday approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC), seeking permission to meet PTI founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail. On Thursday, Afridi, who was elected as the provincial chief minister on Monday, was denied a meeting with Imran during a visit to the prison. The PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. Afridi said he waited outside the prison for around two hours yesterday bef­ore departing. Speaking to reporters, he said he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran and seeking his input. He claimed he had officially notified the Punjab government and the federal government of his plan to visit Adiala, but received no response, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not reply to his subsequent request, made during a phone call , to facilitate a meeting with Imran. Per Afridi’s writ petition seen by Dawn.com , as a chief minister, he was  constitutionally responsible for governance of the province, and was “under both legal and moral obligation” to consult Imran for “guidance and instructions of urgent and sensitive provincial matters” concerning the governance and formation of the provincial cabinet. The petition was filed against the federal secretary of the Interior Ministry, the secretary of the Punjab Home Department, the inspector general of Punjab prisons, and the superintendent of Central Prison Adiala, Rawalpindi. Filed through counsel Syed Ali Bukhari, the petition stated that Afridi had approached the Interior Ministry and Punjab Home Department on October 15, 2025, seeking a meeting with Imran through an official letter that was “duly received” by both offices. Aside from approaching the IHC, CM Afridi also wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, requesting the arrangement of a meeting with Imran. According to the letter, seen by Dawn.com , it was “necessary in the public interest that a periodical meeting” of the KP CM be permitted under the supervision of the competent authorities at Central Prison Adiala, Rawalpindi. Per the letter, Afridi has been elected CM of KP on the ticket of PTI, a province with a population of 45 million, for the governance and securing/safeguarding the fundamental rights and matters relating to law and order situation, formation of provincial cabinet, critical economic challenges being faced by the province’s people and important policy matters. “There is a pressing need to seek direction from [Imran] regarding [these] matters and others, including relations regarding certain important matters with the federation and other provinces,” said the letter. “The seeking of direction is extremely essential, even presently the province of Punjab has stopped the inter-provincial trade, i.e., of wheat, etc,” the letter said. Separately, in a post on X, Afridi apologised for not attending the meeting regarding agriculture and Afghan refugees with the federal government today, saying that he was unable to do so without consulting Imran first. “Until I meet [Imran Khan] and receive policy guidelines, participating in such a meeting would be an insult to the mandate of the province’s people,” he said. “I hope that the federal government will resolve this issue as soon as possible and issue directions to the relevant authorities so that arrangements can be made for my regular meetings with my leader and the representative of the mandate of the people of KP.” Pre-election controversy Afridi was elected the new KP chief executive on Monday during an assembly session marred by the opposition’s walkout and amid the prevailing uncertainty regarding the resignation of outgoing CM Ali Amin Gandapur. Declaring Afridi’s election constitutional, Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah had orderered KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Tuesday to administer the oath by 4pm the next day or else the provincial assembly speaker would perform the ceremony the same day under Article 255(2) of the Constitution.",

      "summary_orig": "India has halved its purchases of Russian oil, a White House official said, but Indian sources said no immediate reduction had been seen, as President Donald Trump’s administration presses New Delhi and other nations to buy less Russian crude. Russian oil is a main irritant for Trump in prolonged trade talks with India — half of his 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods are in retaliation for those purchases. His administration says Moscow is using petroleum revenue to fund its war in Ukraine . The White House official told Reuters on Thursday that talks with an Indian delegation in Washington this week have been productive and that Indian refiners were already cutting Russian oil imports by 50%. But Indian industry sources said on Friday that New Delhi had not informed refiners of any request to cut Russian imports. Trump says Modi pledged to halt Russian oil purchases Refiners have already placed orders for November loading, including some cargoes for December arrival, so any cut could be visible in December or January import numbers, said the sources, who asked not to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Indeed, India’s imports of Russian oil are set to rise about 20pc this month to 1.9 million barrels per day, according to estimates from commodities data firm Kpler, as Russia ramps up exports after Ukrainian drones hit its refineries. The Indian oil ministry and refiners that buy Russian oil did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him on Wednesday that India would stop buying Russian oil. India’s foreign ministry did not respond to Trump’s assertion except to say it was not aware of any telephone conversation between the two leaders that day. Still, India’s oil minister on Thursday sought data on Russian oil imports from all the refiners, including their loadings and arrivals tied up for November and December. Oil prices fell on Friday, with Brent crude futures down 48 cents, or 0.79pc, to $60.58 a barrel at 0720 GMT (12:20 pm PKT), amid uncertainty over global supply as Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared to discuss ending the war. US-India trade talks have floundered India has become the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian oil sold at a discount after Western nations shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow for its 2022 invasion of its neighbour. New Delhi initially hoped to secure a quick trade deal with the US due to Modi’s warm relationship with Trump, but the talks have floundered and the president has slapped some of the highest levies in his global tariff regime on India’s products. When Modi visited Trump in February, India pledged to more than double its annual US energy purchases to $25 billion, with both nations targeting $500bn in bilateral trade by 2030. US negotiators have said curbing India’s Russian crude purchases would be crucial to reducing its tariff rate and sealing a trade deal. Indian refiners are looking to buy at least 10pc of their liquefied petroleum gas needs from the US to help narrow India’s bilateral trade surplus, sources told Reuters this week. Russia accounted for 36pc of India’s oil imports, some 1.75m barrels per day, in the six months through September, trade data shows. Moscow said on Thursday it was confident its energy partnership with India would continue. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia could supply oil more cheaply to countries that Trump is trying to persuade to stop buying Russian oil.",

      "summary_orig": "South Korea kicked off its largest-ever arms fair on Friday, with firms expected to show off new unmanned and artificial intelligence-enhanced weapons from howitzers to suicide drones, as Seoul seeks to strengthen its military and pursues more global defence sales. Organisers said 600 companies from 35 countries were scheduled to participate in the Seoul International Aerospace & Defence Exhibition (ADEX) 2025. This year’s ADEX kicked off with three days of public air shows at an air base, including flights by its newly developed KF-21 fighter jet. A man films South Korean Air Force FA-50 fighter jets during Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition (ADEX) in Seongnam, South Korea, October 17. —Reuters The festivities will be followed next week by business exhibitions at a sprawling conference centre. Earlier this month, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said that the country’s defence budget for next year would rise 8.2 per cent to 66.3 trillion won ($47.1 billion) as it faces more tensions around the region and a nuclear-armed North Korea. Foreign dignitaries were invited to Pyongyang earlier in October to tour North Korea’s arms exhibition, which included drones and nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, followed by a grand military parade. Arms have become one of South Korea’s fastest-growing exports, as it has inked multibillion-dollar deals selling everything from howitzers and ammunition to missiles and warships around the world. At this year’s ADEX, Hanwha Aerospace said it would unveil next-generation versions of its popular self-propelled K9 howitzer that use automation and AI to reduce or eliminate the need for a crew. In addition, the company said it would showcase its L-PGW, a missile-launched loitering munition — also known as a suicide drone — which can circle an area before using AI to identify and destroy a target. Unmanned weapons and AI will provide more capabilities and help South Korea maintain its defences, despite a shrinking population that will reduce the number of available soldiers, Hanwha said in a statement. A South Korean Air Force KF21 fighter jet takes part during Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition (ADEX) in Seongnam, South Korea, October 17. —Reuters Seok Jong-gun, the minister for the Defence Acquisition Programme Administration, told parliament on Friday that its focus included developing and modernising manned and unmanned weapons systems, while expanding its defence export markets in cooperation with the US, Canada, Saudi Arabia and others. “We will pursue entry into the global supply chain by expanding cooperation with the US in defence shipbuilding,“ he said. South Korea’s shipbuilding cooperation with the US has become a flashpoint with China, which unveiled sanctions on Hanwha Ocean’s US-linked affiliates earlier this week.",

At this year’s ADEX, Hanwha Aerospace said it would unveil next-generation versions of its popular self-propelled K9 howitzer that use automation and AI to reduce or eliminate the need for a crew. In addition, the company said it would showcase its L-PGW, a missile-launched loitering munition — also known as a suicide drone — which can circle an area before using AI to identify and destroy a target. Unmanned weapons and AI will provide more capabilities and help South Korea maintain its defences, despite a shrinking population that will reduce the number of available soldiers, Hanwha said in a statement.

South Korea’s shipbuilding cooperation with the US has become a flashpoint with China, which unveiled sanctions on Hanwha Ocean’s US-linked affiliates earlier this week.",

      "summary": "South Korea kicked off its largest-ever arms fair on Friday, with firms expected to show off new unmanned and artificial intelligence-enhanced weapons from howitzers to suicide drones, as Seoul seeks to strengthen its military and pursues more global defence sales. Organisers said 600 companies from 35 countries were scheduled to participate in the Seoul International Aerospace & Defence Exhibition (ADEX) 2025. This year’s ADEX kicked off with three days of public air shows at an air base, including flights by its newly developed KF-21 fighter jet. A man films South Korean Air Force FA-50 fighter jets during Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition (ADEX) in Seongnam, South Korea, October 17. —Reuters The festivities will be followed next week by business exhibitions at a sprawling conference centre. Earlier this month, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said that the country’s defence budget for next year would rise 8.2 per cent to 66.3 trillion won ($47.1 billion) as it faces more tensions around the region and a nuclear-armed North Korea.

      "summary_orig": "Four terrorists were killed after security forces foiled a suicide attack on a military camp in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali district, state-run PTV reported on Friday. “According to sources, a khawarij attempted to carry out a suicide attack against security forces in Mir Ali. One kharji rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the wall of the security forces’ camp after which three more khawarij tried to enter the camp,” the report said. “As a result of security forces’ timely and courageous action, the three khawarij were killed outside the camp. Security forces did not suffer any losses in the incident. In the last two days alone, 88 terrorists supported by the Afghan Taliban have been killed,” the report said. Khawarij is a term that the state uses to refer to terrorists. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to security forces for foiling the attack and praised their professionalism. “Salute to the brave soldiers who thwarted the evil intentions of Khawarij,” Naqvi said, according to a statement issued by the ministry. “Security forces took timely action and brought the khawarij to an exemplary end,” he said, adding that the nation was “proud of the brave soldiers”. The development comes a day after the ISPR’s said that 34 “India-backed” terrorists had been killed in multiple operations in KP’s North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and Bannu districts over the previous three days. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Last week, a lieutenant colonel and a major were among 11 military personnel martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Orakzai, in which 19 terrorists were reported killed. The same week, the ISPR reported that 30 terrorists who were involved in the incident had been killed in a “retribution operation”. A day after the Orakzai operation, another officer was martyred in an operation in Dera Ismail Khan, in which seven terrorists were also killed, according to the ISPR. In July, the government designated the TTP as Fitna al Khawarij , mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks, even before the most recent deadly border clashes between the two countries this past week. However, Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations. Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy. The development also comes tensions have flared between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the past few days after the two countries engaged in border clashes over the weekend. Tensions escalated to the point where both sides agreed to a temporary ceasefire 48-hour ceasefire after Islamabad carried out strikes in Kabul and Kandahar. On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made it clear that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.",

      "summary_orig": "Japan’s former prime minister Tomiichi Murayama, best known for making a statement apologising over World War II, died Friday aged 101, officials said. Murayama issued the 1995 proclamation on the 50th anniversary of Japan’s surrender, expressing “deep remorse” over the country’s atrocities in Asia. The statement became a benchmark for Tokyo’s subsequent apologies over World War II. “Tomiichi Murayama, the father of Japanese politics, passed away today at 11:28am at a hospital in Oita City at the age of 101,” Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Social Democratic Party, seen as the successor to Murayama’s now-defunct Socialist Party, said on X. Hiroyuki Takano, the secretary general of the Social Democratic Party in Oita, Murayama’s hometown, told AFP he had been informed that the former premier died of old age. In the landmark statement in August 1995, Murayama said that “Japan …\nthrough its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations”. “In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology,” he added. The phrases “deep remorse” and “heartfelt apology” were used by successive Japanese prime ministers when marking the 60th and 70th World War II anniversaries. Murayama, who was also well-known for his distinctive bushy eyebrows, was elected as the prime minister in a coalition government that also included the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan’s dominant postwar political force. He was in office from 1994 to 1996, a turbulent period that saw a huge 1995 earthquake in western Japan, and a sarin gas attack on Tokyo’s subway that killed more than a dozen people and injured more than 5,800. Murayama was conscripted into the Japanese Imperial Army in 1944 while studying at university. In a 2015 interview with public broadcaster NHK , he called the military a “dreadful thing”, describing how “rebellion or argument was absolutely forbidden”. He also recalled his difficult memories of the run-up to the end of the war, when “food was already scarce, and very few weapons remained”. “We had weapons made of bamboo. I wondered if we could wage war in this condition,” he said at the time.",

      "summary_orig": "Saudi Arabia is discussing a defence deal with the United States which it hopes to seal when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits the White House next month, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. A senior Trump administration official told the Financial Times there were discussions about signing something when the crown prince comes, but the details are in flux. The FT said the deal in discussion was similar to the recent US-Qatar pact that pledged to treat any armed attack on Qatar as a threat to the United States. The US deal with Qatar came after Israel last month attempted to kill leaders of Hamas with an air strike on Doha. The US State Department told the FT that defence co-operation with the kingdom was a “strong bedrock of our regional strategy,” but declined to comment on details of the potential deal. The US State Department, the White House and the Saudi government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the FT report. Last month, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.

      "summary_orig": "• Shehbaz says Afghanistan must take the lead if it is serious about quelling cross-border terrorism; hopes Taliban govt will take steps to address ‘TTP problem’ • Uncertainty surrounds reports of peace talks in Doha in absence of official confirmation • Beijing, Tehran and UN mission urge restraint, ready to play constructive role for de-escalation ISLAMABAD: Back-channel diplomatic efforts were afoot on Thursday, as the Pakistan-Afghanistan border remained calm and no ceasefire violations being reported. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however, made it clear that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks. “The ball is in [their] court,” he said while addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet, informing his colleagues that the Afghan Taliban had formally requested a ceasefire after intense clashes between the two sides earlier in the week. “We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks. He, however, hoped that thorny issues between the two be resolved on a long-term basis, including the elimination of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) , which uses Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan, so that the neighbouring country’s territory was no longer used by terrorists. PM Shehbaz reiterated his hope that the ceasefire be maintained for the future on the basis of “solid demands”. “If this was only done to buy time, then we won’t accept it,” the premier warned, as per Dawn.com. He elaborated that officials from Pakistan had visited Kabul many times and engaged in cordial dialogue on resolving their issues together with mutual agreement for the sake of peace and prosperity. “Unfortunately, despite all efforts, this was not possible, and when this attack was ongoing on Pakistan, on India’s complete incitement, their (Afghan) Foreign Minister [Amir] Muttaqi was in New Delhi, so we were forced to give a comprehensive response,” the PM said. According to PM Shehbaz, the Qatari emir had condemned the entire episode in talks with him in Egypt and expressed his desire to play a role in cooling down tensions. There was no immediate response to his remarks from Kabul, with Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayatullah Khowarazmi saying only that the ceasefire was holding so far. A statement from the Afghan Taliban interior ministry said Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani met senior Iranian officials and told them that Afghanistan seeks good relations with all countries, especially its neighbours, Reuters reported. It may be noted that both sides reached a ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, which took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours. Doha talks? Though diplomatic efforts were continuing to arrange a meeting between the two sides before the truce expires, uncertainty surrounded the planned talks in the absence of any official confirmation. In its statement announcing the ceasefire, the Foreign Office had said that both sides would hold dialogue “to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue.” According to diplomatic sources, the talks were expected to focus on extending the ceasefire and finding ways to defuse the latest border tensions. On Thursday, reports emerged that Qatar had invited high-level delegations from both countries for talks in Doha on Friday. Though Doha’s invitation was not made public, but a day earlier, Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had received a message from Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr. M. Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi about “the regional situation.” The timing of the message, which coincided with the announcement of the ceasefire, appeared linked to Qatar’s efforts to mediate. Saudi Arabia also joined the diplomatic push on Thursday, with Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan speaking by phone with FM Dar to discuss “the regional situation and recent developments,” according to the Foreign Office. While Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Saudi Arabia on regional and international issues, the statement did not directly mention Afghanistan. Diplomatic sources said the main hurdle to the planned dialogue appeared to be internal deliberations within the Taliban’s top leadership. A source in Kabul said that Taliban supreme leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada had yet to give formal approval for his side’s participation. Late-night reports from Kabul suggested that Mullah Haibatullah had eventually agreed to send Defense Minister Mullah Yaqub to represent the Taliban at the proposed Doha meeting. The Pakistani side remained cautious. Officials in Islamabad declined to confirm or deny the meeting. They seemed to be waiting for Kabul’s decision. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the talks take place,” a Pakistani diplomat said on condition of anonymity, describing the negotiations as “fluid but not off the table.” Calls for restraint On Thursday, Iran and China urged restraint on both sides, calling on them to settle the current conflict through talks. China said it supports countries in exercising restraint and realising a full and lasting ceasefire. A foreign ministry spokesperson, when asked about Pakistan and Afghanistan agreeing to a 48-hour ceasefire, said that Beijing stands ready to continue to play a constructive role for continued improvement in the two countries’ relations. “Pakistan and Afgh­anistan are each other’s neighbours and both are China’s friends. China supports the two countries in staying cool-headed and exercising restraint, realizing a full and lasting ceasefire, properly handling differences through dialogue and consultation, returning to the track of political settlement, and together maintaining peace and stability in both countries and the wider region.” Iran also welcomed the ceasefire, urging dialogue and diplomacy. In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei expressed concern over civilian casualties and called for stronger regional cooperation to combat terrorism, while reaffirming Tehran’s readiness “to assist in any effort to maintain calm and reduce tensions between the two neighbouring Muslim countries”. Meanwhile, the Tasnim News Agency quoted Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian as calling for Muslim unity and dialogue following the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He said the renewed tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have raised serious concern among regional nations, including Iran, which shares borders with both. Pezeshkian reiterated that Iran would use all available resources to reduce tensions, promote dialogue, and strengthen ties between the two neighbours. Enemies continually seek to create discord among Muslim nations to weaken them, he said, adding that the region needs peace, cohesion, and cooperation more than ever. Meanwhile, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) also called on all parties “to bring a lasting end to hostilities to protect civilians and prevent further loss of life”. It also urged both Afghanistan and Pakistan to comply with their obligations under international law “to prevent” more civilian casualties. Published in Dawn, October 17th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Nearly 300 Afghan refugee families are living under the open sky in Islamabad’s Argentina Park, just miles from Islamabad’s ‘Red Zone’, the heavily secured government and diplomatic district in the federal capital. They sleep on the wet ground under plastic tarps, with no access to sanitation, medical care or legal protection — caught between Pakistan’s intensifying deportation campaign and the Taliban regime they fled. The day after rain showers swept through parts of Islamabad on September 18, teenager Uswa Kohistani sits alone under a tree, writing poetry in Dari about the crisis unfolding around her. Families spread soaked clothing across the grass to dry. Passports and school certificates lie damp inside a mosquito net. “We can neither go to work nor buy food from the markets,” says Kohistani, 19. “The police arrest us and forcibly take us to the border for deportation to Afghanistan.” Caught between Pakistan’s intensifying campaign to expel Afghans and the Taliban regime many of them fled, nearly 300 families live under tarps in Islamabad’s Argentina Park. Facing a legal vacuum, even registered refugees find themselves with no right to stay The Policy Behind the Crisis This makeshift camp is a direct consequence of a stringent government policy that began two years ago. In September 2023, Pakistan announced that it was launching its “Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan”, giving undocumented Afghans till the end of October to leave the country or face forced expulsion. At the time, Pakistan said it was hosting over four million Afghans — having arrived in the country in various waves over the last four decades, including after the return of the Taliban to power in 2021. The policy distinguished between three categories: undocumented Afghans, those holding Afghan Citizen Cards (ACC) — documents issued by Pakistan since 2017 to those who couldn’t obtain refugee status — and those with Proof of Registration (PoR) cards, issued by Pakistan’s National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) with the support of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Approximately 1.4 million PoR cards had been issued to registered refugees, with another over 800,000 Afghans having ACCs. The first phase, beginning in October 2023, focused on expelling undocumented Afghans. Within months, Pakistan had deported over half a million people. At the same time, the government also found ways to reclassify legal refugees as deportable. When PoR cards expired, authorities refused to renew them — effectively stripping documented refugees of their legal status. Following appeals from UN agencies amid mass deportation, Pakistan agreed to extend the PoR cards by a year, in June 2024. They expired again on June 30, 2025, after which started the third phase of deportations. But before that came the second phase, in April 2025, targeting the ACC holders. Returns surged dramatically — in April alone, fear of arrest drove the vast majority of departures. Since September 2023, more than 1.5 million Afghans have returned to Afghanistan, according to data released earlier this month by UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration. In the final week of September 2025, over 45,000 Afghans crossed back through border points at Torkham, Chaman and elsewhere. Among recent returnees, 56 percent held PoR cards — proof that even “legal” refugees are being pressured to leave. Nearly 40 percent were undocumented and five percent held ACC cards, the data adds. But with PoR cards no longer being renewed, over 1.4 million registered refugees became technically undocumented on June 30. The categories have collapsed and nearly everyone faces deportation risk. The camp in Argentina Park represents those who refuse to go back. Life in the Park Noora Khandhari, from Kabul, says landlords evicted refugee families from rented homes as the crackdown intensified. She has lived in the park for close to two months, with only plastic sheeting for shelter. “The whole area flooded last night,” she says, referring to the September 18 rainfall that hit G-6 and surrounding sectors. “We stayed awake while the kids were terrified and crying,” she tells Eos. Around 180 children under age five live in the camp, according to residents’ own count. Lina Mehrabzada, a widow with five children, says families pool money for one shared meal daily. “Every other child has diarrhoea,” says Mehrabzada. “The government hospital near the park refuses treatment without a national ID card,” she adds. Women at the camp say they use washrooms in a nearby mosque or hospital once a day. There is no privacy for sleeping, bathing or changing clothes, they add. “We can’t go back to Afghanistan with the Taliban still in charge,” says Mehrabzada. “We see no future for our children there,” she adds. The Resettlement Bottleneck It is the same for Hassina Rafy, who worked as a journalist and human rights activist in Kabul before fleeing to Pakistan in 2022 after receiving Taliban threats. “The Taliban were against women’s voices like mine — journalists, musicians, activists,” she says. “UNHCR registered us when we arrived and promised support,” Rafy continues. “Now they’re nowhere to be seen.” Rafy says she and others entered Pakistan legally but the government stopped extending visas. Sanam Kabiri, a human rights activist who recently resettled in Australia after more than two years in Pakistan, describes the bureaucratic maze refugees face while waiting for third-country resettlement. “Every two months, our SIM cards were locked,” she tells Eos via WhatsApp. “We kept applying for visas, but most were rejected and we had to reapply,” she continues. She says she was taken ill during her last few months in Pakistan, but the stress stemmed more from her precarious situation than from direct harassment by authorities. Kabiri left in February this year, before the crackdown on documented migrants. At the same time, the refugee resettlement process can take one to three years, according to UNHCR. The annual global resettlement quotas for Afghan refugees, determined by individual countries, have dropped sharply — from over 116,000 refugees resettled last year to a few thousand this year. The United States and Germany both suspended or severely restricted their resettlement programmes in 2025, further narrowing options for those waiting. “I know many people still stranded in Pakistan—journalists, activists,” says Kabiri. “Many had flights to the US cancelled and remain in limbo.” A Legal Vacuum Pakistan is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol — the international treaties that establish legal protections for refugees in 149 countries worldwide. Instead, it operates under the Foreigners Act, which empowers the authorities to arrest, hold and deport foreigners, including refugees and asylum seekers who do not possess valid documentation. This means refugees in Pakistan exist in a legal vacuum. The absence of a legal framework explains why visa extensions stopped, why no registration mechanism exists, and why refugees like those in Argentina Park have no recourse when threatened with deportation. Qaiser Khan Afridi, UNHCR’s spokesperson in Pakistan, says the agency met with protesters at Argentina Park and has assigned a legal team to assist refugees who are detained. “Many Afghans in need of protection cannot regularise their stay, leaving them exposed to serious risks,” Afridi tells Eos. “We are urging the government to establish a registration and documentation mechanism.” He acknowledges processing delays, but disputes claims of abandonment, noting that resettlement quotas are set by receiving countries, not UNHCR. UNHCR stresses that refugees should not be returned to situations of danger — a principle known as non-refoulement. But without Pakistan’s signature on the Refugee Convention, this remains an appeal to humanitarian norms rather than enforceable law. No Return, No Future Back in Argentina Park, Uswa Kohistani closes her poetry notebook as evening approaches. She came to Pakistan seeking safety. Now, even stepping out of the park leaves her vulnerable to harassment; police in Islamabad can detain Afghan refugees at will and force them to cough up a bribe due to their status. “We are not criminals, we are educated families,” she says. “Most importantly, we are human beings,” Kohistani adds. “The Pakistani state should treat us as such.” The writer is Dawn’s correspondent in Shangla, KP.

The United States and Germany both suspended or severely restricted their resettlement programmes in 2025, further narrowing options for those waiting. “I know many people still stranded in Pakistan—journalists, activists,” says Kabiri. “Many had flights to the US cancelled and remain in limbo.” A Legal Vacuum Pakistan is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol — the international treaties that establish legal protections for refugees in 149 countries worldwide. Instead, it operates under the Foreigners Act, which empowers the authorities to arrest, hold and deport foreigners, including refugees and asylum seekers who do not possess valid documentation. This means refugees in Pakistan exist in a legal vacuum. The absence of a legal framework explains why visa extensions stopped, why no registration mechanism exists, and why refugees like those in Argentina Park have no recourse when threatened with deportation. Qaiser Khan Afridi, UNHCR’s spokesperson in Pakistan, says the agency met with protesters at Argentina Park and has assigned a legal team to assist refugees who are detained. “Many Afghans in need of protection cannot regularise their stay, leaving them exposed to serious risks,” Afridi tells Eos. “We are urging the government to establish a registration and documentation mechanism.” He acknowledges processing delays, but disputes claims of abandonment, noting that resettlement quotas are set by receiving countries, not UNHCR. UNHCR stresses that refugees should not be returned to situations of danger — a principle known as non-refoulement. But without Pakistan’s signature on the Refugee Convention, this remains an appeal to humanitarian norms rather than enforceable law. No Return, No Future Back in Argentina Park, Uswa Kohistani closes her poetry notebook as evening approaches. She came to Pakistan seeking safety. Now, even stepping out of the park leaves her vulnerable to harassment; police in Islamabad can detain Afghan refugees at will and force them to cough up a bribe due to their status. “We are not criminals, we are educated families,” she says. “Most importantly, we are human beings,” Kohistani adds. “The Pakistani state should treat us as such.” The writer is Dawn’s correspondent in Shangla, KP.

      "summary": "Nearly 300 Afghan refugee families are living under the open sky in Islamabad’s Argentina Park, just miles from Islamabad’s ‘Red Zone’, the heavily secured government and diplomatic district in the federal capital. They sleep on the wet ground under plastic tarps, with no access to sanitation, medical care or legal protection — caught between Pakistan’s intensifying deportation campaign and the Taliban regime they fled. The day after rain showers swept through parts of Islamabad on September 18, teenager Uswa Kohistani sits alone under a tree, writing poetry in Dari about the crisis unfolding around her. Families spread soaked clothing across the grass to dry. Passports and school certificates lie damp inside a mosquito net. “We can neither go to work nor buy food from the markets,” says Kohistani, 19. “The police arrest us and forcibly take us to the border for deportation to Afghanistan.” Caught between Pakistan’s intensifying campaign to expel Afghans and the Taliban regime many of them fled, nearly 300 families live under tarps in Islamabad’s Argentina Park. Facing a legal vacuum, even registered refugees find themselves with no right to stay The Policy Behind the Crisis This makeshift camp is a direct consequence of a stringent government policy that began two years ago. In September 2023, Pakistan announced that it was launching its “Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan”, giving undocumented Afghans till the end of October to leave the country or face forced expulsion. At the time, Pakistan said it was hosting over four million Afghans — having arrived in the country in various waves over the last four decades, including after the return of the Taliban to power in 2021. The policy distinguished between three categories: undocumented Afghans, those holding Afghan Citizen Cards (ACC) — documents issued by Pakistan since 2017 to those who couldn’t obtain refugee status — and those with Proof of Registration (PoR) cards, issued by Pakistan’s National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) with the support of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Approximately 1.4 million PoR cards had been issued to registered refugees, with another over 800,000 Afghans having ACCs. The first phase, beginning in October 2023, focused on expelling undocumented Afghans. Within months, Pakistan had deported over half a million people. At the same time, the government also found ways to reclassify legal refugees as deportable. When PoR cards expired, authorities refused to renew them — effectively stripping documented refugees of their legal status. Following appeals from UN agencies amid mass deportation, Pakistan agreed to extend the PoR cards by a year, in June 2024. They expired again on June 30, 2025, after which started the third phase of deportations. But before that came the second phase, in April 2025, targeting the ACC holders. Returns surged dramatically — in April alone, fear of arrest drove the vast majority of departures. Since September 2023, more than 1.5 million Afghans have returned to Afghanistan, according to data released earlier this month by UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration. In the final week of September 2025, over 45,000 Afghans crossed back through border points at Torkham, Chaman and elsewhere. Among recent returnees, 56 percent held PoR cards — proof that even “legal” refugees are being pressured to leave. Nearly 40 percent were undocumented and five percent held ACC cards, the data adds. But with PoR cards no longer being renewed, over 1.4 million registered refugees became technically undocumented on June 30. The categories have collapsed and nearly everyone faces deportation risk. The camp in Argentina Park represents those who refuse to go back. Life in the Park Noora Khandhari, from Kabul, says landlords evicted refugee families from rented homes as the crackdown intensified. She has lived in the park for close to two months, with only plastic sheeting for shelter. “The whole area flooded last night,” she says, referring to the September 18 rainfall that hit G-6 and surrounding sectors. “We stayed awake while the kids were terrified and crying,” she tells Eos. Around 180 children under age five live in the camp, according to residents’ own count. Lina Mehrabzada, a widow with five children, says families pool money for one shared meal daily. “Every other child has diarrhoea,” says Mehrabzada. “The government hospital near the park refuses treatment without a national ID card,” she adds. Women at the camp say they use washrooms in a nearby mosque or hospital once a day. There is no privacy for sleeping, bathing or changing clothes, they add. “We can’t go back to Afghanistan with the Taliban still in charge,” says Mehrabzada. “We see no future for our children there,” she adds. The Resettlement Bottleneck It is the same for Hassina Rafy, who worked as a journalist and human rights activist in Kabul before fleeing to Pakistan in 2022 after receiving Taliban threats. “The Taliban were against women’s voices like mine — journalists, musicians, activists,” she says. “UNHCR registered us when we arrived and promised support,” Rafy continues. “Now they’re nowhere to be seen.” Rafy says she and others entered Pakistan legally but the government stopped extending visas. Sanam Kabiri, a human rights activist who recently resettled in Australia after more than two years in Pakistan, describes the bureaucratic maze refugees face while waiting for third-country resettlement. “Every two months, our SIM cards were locked,” she tells Eos via WhatsApp. “We kept applying for visas, but most were rejected and we had to reapply,” she continues. She says she was taken ill during her last few months in Pakistan, but the stress stemmed more from her precarious situation than from direct harassment by authorities. Kabiri left in February this year, before the crackdown on documented migrants. At the same time, the refugee resettlement process can take one to three years, according to UNHCR. The annual global resettlement quotas for Afghan refugees, determined by individual countries, have dropped sharply — from over 116,000 refugees resettled last year to a few thousand this year.
