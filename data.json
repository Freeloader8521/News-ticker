      "title_orig": "At UN, Pakistan voices hope for early normalisation of situation in Iran, rejects any external interference",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has told the UN Security Council that it hopes for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, warning that the UN Charter and international law prohibit external interference in the internal affairs of states. “The UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against other states’ territorial integrity or political independence, or interference in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of states,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told an emergency meeting of the 15-member Council on Thursday evening. The United States convened the Security Council meeting to discuss the situation in Iran, with the country’s Ambassador Mike Waltz criticising the actions taken against Iranian protesters and assuring them of President Donald Trump’s support. In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy said, “We have been carefully observing developments in Iran and the region in recent days,” pointing out that new threats to regional peace and stability remain a serious cause of concern. Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds. A stable and peaceful Iran is in the interests of Pakistan, the region and beyond, he said, adding that his country has full confidence in the wisdom of the Iranian people and leadership, rooted in the country’s culture, history and resilience. Ambassador Asim Ahmad highlighted that the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct, noting that the Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states. Any external interference in the internal affairs of states, he added, is inconsistent with international law and the principles of the UN Charter. “We strongly believe that all disputes must be resolved through peaceful means and in accordance with international law,” the Pakistani envoy affirmed, warning that continued hostilities, use of force and unilateral actions would only deepen crises and cause unnecessary suffering. “We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure, and that all relevant parties will return to the negotiating table to find a lasting solution to their differences, based on mutual respect and understanding,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad said in conclusion. Opening the debate, UN Assistant Secretary-General Martha Pobee, briefing the Security Council members, called for restraint by all parties to prevent further escalation. Ms Pobee described the situation in Iran as fluid and deeply concerning, noting that protests continue, albeit reportedly at a smaller scale than last week. She voiced alarm, however, over public statements suggesting possible military strikes on the country. “This external dimension adds volatility to an already combustible situation. All efforts must be undertaken to prevent any further deterioration,” she said. Moreover, UN Secretary-General António Guterres remains convinced that all concerns regarding Iran, including those related to the nuclear issue and ongoing protests, are best addressed through diplomacy and dialogue. He also urged maximum restraint at this sensitive moment and called on all actors to refrain from any actions that could lead to further loss of life or ignite a wider regional escalation. The protests erupted on 28 December after shopkeepers in the Iranian capital, Tehran, took to the streets to rail against the collapse of the national currency, soaring inflation and worsening living conditions. Ambassador Waltz, the US envoy, accused the Iranian government of actions against its own citizens that have repercussions for international peace and security. “President Donald J. Trump and the United States of America stand by the brave people of Iran,” he said. “Regardless of its excuses, the regime is solely responsible for the economic misery of the Iranian people and will be held accountable.” Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia hit back, saying the world has been watching as the United States continues to escalate tensions and fuel hysteria around Iran. He said that the current Security Council meeting, requested by the United States, is nothing more than yet another attempt to justify blatant aggression and interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. “And if, as Washington puts it, Iran’s authorities do not come to their senses, then Washington will solve the Iranian problem in its favourite way: through strikes aimed at overthrowing an undesirable regime in order to lend credibility to and justify its actions,” the Russian envoy said. China’s Ambassador, Sun Lei, said the United States has openly issued threats of the use of force against Iran. Stressing that China has always advocated adherence to UN Charter principles and international law, he said sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are the most fundamental norms of international affairs. “The use of force can never solve problems,” the Chinese envoy said, noting that military adventurism would push the region towards an abyss. “No action that defies international law can be tolerated,” he added. Ambassador Gholamhossein Darzi, Deputy Permanent Representative of Iran, said he was speaking on behalf of a nation in mourning. “It is deeply regrettable that the representative of the United States, which requested this meeting, has today resorted to lies, distortions of facts and deliberate disinformation to conceal his country’s direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran towards violence,” he said. He added that the United States requested the meeting in order to conceal its direct complicity in the crimes its mercenaries have committed against Iran. “The United States is attempting to portray itself as a friend of the Iranian people, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for political destabilisation and military intervention under a so-called humanitarian narrative,” he said. He described these claims as particularly cynical in light of what he called the United States’ long and well-documented record of unlawful military interventions, regime-change operations and systematic violations of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.",

      "summary_orig": "“The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters” — Antonio Gramsci THE more things change, the more they stay the same. China may have emerged as a power of global import, but America is still the world’s sheriff, and the Trump ad­­ministration wants everyone to know that. The dust had barely settled on the audacious kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro that the Yankee propaganda machinery started fanning the flames of war on Iran. Imperialism abroad has been accompanied by Trump’s unleashing of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) goons on American streets with orders to literally shoot ‘suspects’ at sight. The combination of bravado and terror portends more darkness ahead. But what is the end game? There isn’t one. At a base level, Washington still just wants the oil, the lifeblood of the global capitalist order over which it has presided since the end of World War II. This order is creaking at the seams, but a better world system is not visible yet. Venezuela sits atop the biggest reserves of black gold in the world. Iran is number three on the list. US imperialism wants it all. Then there is the other bedrock of the military-industrial complex — making war. In the face of China’s inexorable economic rise and partial erosion of dollar hegemony, US power is not what it was. But Washington possesses 10 times the means of destruction of any other single country. It still bombs and invades other countries at will, kidnaps heads of state in broad daylight. The combination of bravado and terror portends more darkness. Will military might and oil stave off America’s terminal economic decline? The answer depends on who monopolises the new global commodity on the block — critical minerals. Or maybe you prefer the term ‘rare earth’. Whatever your fancy, control over the rock equates to monopolies of renewable energy, electric vehicles, everyday smart technology, high-grade weapons systems and so much more. And this is where China calls out the Empire’s bluff. Beijing’s announcement of unprecedented export controls on rare earth elements a few months ago confirmed its willingness to play hard ball after Trump’s dramatic tariff announcements earlier in 2025. Oil, gas, plastic and coal still matter, but critical minerals are starting to matter more. Capitalism is greening itself and the Empire is being forced to play catch up. What does the tortured withering away of the old order mean for us in this country? Mostly business as usual, at least for now. The current hybrid plus regime is ingratiating itself with as many external patrons as possible to generate those coveted geostrategic rents. You want military personnel to serve in Gaza? Happy to consider it. A port in Pasni to rival the Chinese in Gwadar? Why not? Access to copper, gold and other mineral exploration projects in already conflict-ravaged Baloch­istan and KP? Ayub Khan spun it by claiming: friends, not masters. All of this while Chinese solar panels flood Pakistani markets at breakneck speed, Chinese electric SUVs become the new status symbol of our hedonistic chattering classes, and all manner of defence deals are signed with Gulf kingdoms and whatnot. No one seems to be concerned with the geopolitical wars that will surely intensify. Which brings us to crypto. Earlier this week, the CEO of the shady Trump-owned crypto company World Liberty Finance was in town to ink a deal with the go­­vernment. The big guns were all present to oversee the ‘historic’ agreem­ent. What exactly does it mean to ‘ex­­­-plore innovation in digital finance’? No one really knows, just as no one is privy to what the newly created Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Autho­rity is actually doing, on whose watch and to what end. The crypto game is arguably even more opaque than any other money-making enterprise in the country, and that is saying a lot. More than $600 million was lost to crypto transactions in 2025. The one thing that can be said for certain is that World Liberty Finance has brought in a lot of cash for the Trump family, especially since he became president, and that there is more on the horizon for a select few in both Pakistan and the US in the wake of this deal. And herein lies the rub. For all the geopolitical change taking place around the world, the logic of the system at large remains the accumulation of power and profit. As bloody games around oil, minerals and crypto intensify, brutalised masses in Pakistan and beyond are in line for even more of the brunt of a rapid race to the bottom.

Earlier, on the night of December 31, 2025, Bannu Cantonment was also targeted in a rocket attack when a rocket landed in vacant houses near the CMH. While no loss of life occurred in that incident, property damage was reported. According to initial information, the same type of rocket was used in both attacks, which militants have named the “Al-Farooq 2”. Following the December 31 attack, the model of the fired rocket was also widely circulated on social media. Security agencies have launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident, while evidence is being collected from the site to determine the motives behind the attack and identify those responsible. In another incident, militants launched an attack on the Fateh Khel police check post in Bannu. According to Bannu Police spokesman Asif Hassan, an intense exchange of fire continued for quite some time. The police successfully repulsed the attack, forcing the attackers to flee. However, a search operation is currently underway in the area.",

Earlier, on the night of December 31, 2025, Bannu Cantonment was also targeted in a rocket attack when a rocket landed in vacant houses near the CMH. While no loss of life occurred in that incident, property damage was reported. According to initial information, the same type of rocket was used in both attacks, which militants have named the “Al-Farooq 2”. Following the December 31 attack, the model of the fired rocket was also widely circulated on social media. Security agencies have launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident, while evidence is being collected from the site to determine the motives behind the attack and identify those responsible. In another incident, militants launched an attack on the Fateh Khel police check post in Bannu. According to Bannu Police spokesman Asif Hassan, an intense exchange of fire continued for quite some time. The police successfully repulsed the attack, forcing the attackers to flee. However, a search operation is currently underway in the area.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: At least 15 terrorists, including two armed suspects who were killed in an encounter with the police, were gunned down in different operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Rela­tions (ISPR) said 13 members of the “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij” — the state’s term for the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakistan — were killed in two separate engagements on January 13 and 14. In Bannu, the security forces effectively engaged the militants’ location and gunned down eight militants following an intense exchange of fire. The stat­e­ment read that an­other intelligence-based operation was conducted by the troops in Kurram, adding that five terrorists were killed in that operation. Meanwhile, two armed militants were killed and a policeman was injured in a shootout between the pol­ice and the militants in Dera Ismail Khan on Thursday. According to a police spok­esperson, the clash took place when the militants attacked the Khutti police check-post located within the limits of Dera Town police station on Wed­nesday night, triggering a fierce exchange of fire that left two attackers dead and a police constable injured. Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. In a press conference last week, ISPR Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025. Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.

      "summary_orig": "• Court hears dispute between Centre, province over anti-drugs legislation • Plea moved by federal govt argues presence of provincial law may ‘add to legal complications’ ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitu­tional Court (FCC) was told on Thursday that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s having its own narcotics law, in addition to the Control of Narcotics Substances Act (CNSA) 1997, would only undermine the federal government’s anti-drug efforts and might add to legal complications. The arguments were advanced by the federal government before a two-judge FCC bench comprising Justices Ali Baqar Najafi and Muhammad Karim Khan Agha. The bench was hearing a petition jointly moved by the federal government and the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) seeking to set aside the KP Control of Narcotics Substances Act 2019. The controversy revolves around whether a province can enact a parallel narcotics law in the presence of Section 71 of the CNSA 1997 — a move that the petitioners argue “undermine the federal government’s authority to legislate”. Filed against the backdrop of KP’s parallel legislation, despite the CNSA 1997 already being in effect, the petition asked the FCC to interpret the executive powers of both the federal and provincial governments under the Constitution. The petition argued that the federal government played a vital role in controlling and eliminating the narcotics threat in the country, particularly in the processing and trafficking of heroin and charas. It stated that the federal government had already taken effective measures to combat all aspects of the multifaceted drug problem since long. ‘Not a dispute’ During the hearing, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, representing the KP government, argued that the matter did not represent a dispute between the federal and provincial governments, as the law was duly enacted by the KP Assembly. In response, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman questioned how a provincial law could repeal a federal legislation. He added that once a province established its own force or agency to implement such a law, a dispute between the federal and provincial governments was bound to erupt. The FCC adjourned further proceedings until next week. ‘Comprehensive law’ The petition expressed the concern that the provincial law repealed the CNSA 1997 within KP to the extent of cultivation, possession, sale, purchase, delivery, and transportation of narcotics. It termed the KP law a “mala fide” and “colourable” exercise of power, seeking its declaration as illegal. It stated that licensing authority for import, export, internal transport, manufacturing, and transshipment of narcotic drugs fell within the purview of the federal government under the CNSA 1997. The provincial law, the petition contended, would create grave legal and constitutional chaos, including duplication of special courts, overlapping jurisdiction, and conflict of authority with other law enforcement agencies. This, the plea added, could lead to a legal and constitutional crisis. The petition argued that the CNSA 1997 was a comprehensive law applicable across Pakistan to curb the menace of narcotics as airports, dry ports, seaports, and land borders fell under the exclusive control of the federal government, which exercised its jurisdiction through the ANF. It contended that as narcotics trafficking was not only a cross-border offence but one with regional and international implications, only a federal agency could effectively deal with the menace, as the jurisdiction of provincial force extended only within its frontiers. The petition further argued that in the presence of a federal law enacted by parliament within its legislative competence under Articles 90 and 142 and Entries 3, 26, 27, 32, and 58 of the Federal Legislative List, any provincial law would be contradictory and thus void.

      "title_orig": "US imposes sanctions on Iran over crackdown on protesters",
      "summary_orig": "The US on Thursday imposed sanctions on five Iranian officials it accused of being behind the crackdown on protests and said it was tracking Iranian leaders’ funds being wired to international banks, as President Donald Trump keeps the pressure on Tehran. The US Treasury Department in a statement said it imposed sanctions on the secretary of the Supreme Council for National Security as well as Islamic Revolutionary Guard corps and law enforcement forces commanders, accusing them of being architects of the crackdown. The US also imposed sanctions on Fardis Prison, where the State Department said women had “endured cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a video on Thursday said Washington’s message to Iran’s leaders was clear: “US Treasury knows, that like rats on a sinking ship, you are frantically wiring funds stolen from Iranian families to banks and financial institutions around the world. Rest assured, we will track them and you. “But there’s still time, if you choose to join us. As President Trump has said, stop the violence and stand with the people of Iran.” ‘No death sentence for arrested protester’ Earlier today, Trump said he had been told that killings in Iran’s crackdown on protests were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions, adopting a wait-and-see posture after previously threatening intervention. Meanwhile, after Iran’s foreign minister said Iran had “no plan” to hang people, Iranian state media on Thursday reported that a 26-year-old man arrested during protests in the city of Karaj would not be given the death sentence. Rights organisation Hengaw, which reported earlier this week that Erfan Soltani was due to be executed on Wednesday, said a previously communicated order for his execution had been postponed, citing his relatives. In a social media post on Thursday, Trump responded to a news report that an Iranian protester was no longer being sentenced to death, writing: “This is good news. Hopefully, it will continue!” Iranian state media said that while Soltani was being charged with colluding against “internal security and propaganda activities against the regime”, the death penalty does not apply to such charges. Araghchi also said the Iranian government was “in full control” and reported an atmosphere of “calm” after what he called three days of “terrorist operation”. The British government said its embassy in Tehran had been “temporarily closed”, while the US embassy in Saudi Arabia urged staff to exercise caution and avoid military installations. Iran’s judiciary chief vowed to fast-track trials for those arrested, stoking fears authorities will use capital punishment as a tool of repression. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene on behalf of protesters in Iran, where the Iranian leadership has cracked down hard on nationwide unrest since December 28. Reuters quoted a Gulf official as saying that four Arab states conducted intense diplomacy with the United States and Iran this week to prevent a threatened US attack on Iran. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt were involved in the diplomacy over 48 hours before Trump signalled on Thursday that he had ultimately decided against an attack for now, saying the killings in Iran were easing. The four countries had conveyed to Washington that any attack would have consequences for the wider region in terms of both security and economics that would ultimately impact the United States itself, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. They told Iran that any retaliatory attack it launched on US facilities in the Gulf would have consequences for Tehran’s relations with other countries in the region, the official added. Saudi Arabia’s international media office, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry, Oman’s Information Ministry and Egypt’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Foreign Ministry of the United Arab Emirates, which was not involved in the diplomacy described by the official, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had engaged in any diplomacy on the issue. Protests appear to abate People inside the country, reached by Reuters on Wednesday and Thursday, said the protests appear to have abated since Monday. Information flows have been hampered by an internet blackout for a week. Tensions had escalated on Wednesday, with Iran saying it had warned neighbours it would hit American bases in the region in the event of US strikes, and a US official saying the United States was withdrawing some personnel from bases in the region. Trump, speaking at the White House, said he has been told that killings in the crackdown were subsiding. Asked who told him that the killings had stopped, Trump described them as “very important sources on the other side”. The president did not rule out potential US military action, saying “we are going to watch what the process is” before noting that his administration had received a “very good statement” from Iran. In separate comments to Reuters , Trump expressed uncertainty over whether Reza Pahlavi , the son of the late shah of Iran and a prominent figure in Iran’s fractured opposition, would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over. Trump told Reuters it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth “any regime can fail”. Turkiye, one of several states in the region where the US has forces, expressed opposition to the use of violence against Iran, with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan saying at a press conference in Istanbul that the priority is to avoid destabilisation. Saudi FM Prince Faisal bin Farhan held a phone call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Thursday and discussed ways to support security and stability in the region, the Saudi foreign ministry said. Qatar said on Wednesday that drawdowns from its Al Udeid air base , the biggest US base in the Middle East, were “being undertaken in response to the current regional tensions”. Iran launched missiles at Al Udeid last year in response to US airstrikes on its nuclear installations during the 12-day war between Tehran and Israel. Ali Shamkhani, a senior advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Trump that the strike showed “Iran’s will and capability to respond to any attack”. Iran reopens airspace Iran reopened its airspace after a nearly five-hour closure amid concerns about possible military action between the US and Iran that forced airlines to cancel, reroute or delay some flights. Iran closed its airspace to all flights except international ones to and from Iran with official permission at 10:15pmGMT (3:15amPKT) on Wednesday, according to a notice on the US Federal Aviation Administration website. The notice was removed shortly before 3amGMT (8am PKT), according to tracking service Flightradar24 , which showed five flights from Iranian carriers Mahan Air, Yazd Airways and AVA Airlines were among the first to resume over the country. Missile and drone barrages in a growing number of conflict zones represent a high risk to airline traffic. Indian airlines among those affected India’s largest airline IndiGo said some of its international flights would be impacted by Iran’s sudden airspace closure. Air India said its flights were using alternative routes that could result in delays or cancellations. A flight by Russia’s Aeroflot bound for Tehran returned to Moscow after the closure, according to Flightradar24 data. Earlier on Wednesday, Germany issued a new directive cautioning the country’s airlines from entering Iranian airspace, shortly after Lufthansa rejigged its flight operations across the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region. The United States already prohibits all US commercial flights from overflying Iran and there are no direct flights between the countries. Empty airspace over Iran, during a temporary closure of the country’s airspace amid concerns about possible military action between the United States and Iran, in this screengrab obtained from the internet on January 14, 2026. — FlightRadar/Reuters Airline operators like flydubai and Turkish Airlines have canceled multiple flights to Iran in the past week. “Several airlines have already reduced or suspended services, and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” said Safe Airspace, a website run by OPSGROUP, a membership-based organisation that shares flight risk information. “The situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defence, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.” Lufthansa said on Wednesday that it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice, while it would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman from Wednesday until Monday next week so that crew would not have to stay overnight. Some flights could also be cancelled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement. Italian carrier ITA Airways, in which Lufthansa Group is now a major shareholder, said that it would similarly suspend night flights to Tel Aviv until Tuesday next week. ‘Unprecedented level of brutality’ Separately, G7 nations said on Wednesday they were “deeply alarmed at the high level of reported deaths and injuries” and warned of further sanctions if the crackdown continued. Monitor NetBlocks said Iran’s internet blackout had lasted 156 hours. Amnesty International accused authorities of committing mass unlawful killings “on an unprecedented scale,” citing verified videos and eyewitness accounts. The US-based Institute for the Study of War said authorities were using “an unprecedented level of brutality to suppress protests,” noting reports of protest activity had sharply declined. A senior Iranian official told journalists there had been no new “riots” since Monday, distinguishing them from earlier cost-of-living protests. “Every society can expect protests, but we will not tolerate violence,” he said. Prosecutors have said some detainees will face capital charges of “waging war against God”. State media reported hundreds of arrests and the detention of a foreign national for espionage, without giving details. India tells citizens to leave Iran India’s foreign ministry has urged its citizens to leave Iran, where rights groups say a crackdown on mass protests has killed and arrested thousands of people. India’s foreign ministry estimates there are usually around 10,000 citizens in Iran. “Indian nationals who are currently in Iran (students, pilgrims, business persons and tourists) are advised to leave Iran by available means of transport,” the Indian Embassy in Tehran said, in a post on social media late Wednesday. AI-created Iran protest videos gain traction AI-generated videos purportedly depicting protests in Iran have flooded the web, researchers said Wednesday, as social media users push hyper-realistic deepfakes to fill an information void amid the country’s internet restrictions. US disinformation watchdog NewsGuard said it identified seven AI-generated videos depicting the Iranian protests — created by both pro- and anti-government actors — that have collectively amassed some 3.5 million views across online platforms. Among them was a video shared on the Elon Musk-owned platform X showing women protesters smashing a vehicle belonging to the Basij, the Iranian paramilitary force deployed to suppress the protests. One X post featuring the AI clip, shared by what NewsGuard described as anti-regime users, garnered nearly 720,000 views. Anti-regime X and TikTok users in the United States also posted AI videos depicting Iranian protesters symbolically renaming local streets after President Donald Trump. One such clip shows a protester changing a street sign to “Trump St” while other demonstrators cheer, with an overlaid caption reading: “Iranian protestors are renaming the streets after Trump.” Pro-regime social media users also shared AI videos purportedly showing large-scale pro-government counterprotests throughout the Islamic republic. The AI creations highlight the growing prevalence of what experts call “hallucinated” visual content on social media during major news events, often overshadowing authentic images and videos. In this case, AI creators were filling an information void caused by the internet blackout imposed by the Iranian regime as it sought to suppress demonstrations, experts said. “There’s a lot of news — but no way to get it because of the internet blackout,” said NewsGuard analyst Ines Chomnalez. “Foreign social media users are turning to AI video generators to advance their own narratives about the unfolding chaos.” The fabricated videos were the latest example of AI tools being deployed to distort fast-developing breaking news. AI fabrications, often amplified by partisan actors, have fueled alternate realities around recent news events, including the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and a deadly shooting by immigration agents in Minneapolis. AFP fact-checkers also uncovered misrepresented images that created misleading narratives about the Iranian protests, the largest since the Islamic Republic was proclaimed in 1979. One months-old video purportedly showing demonstrations in Iran was actually filmed in Greece in November 2025, while another claiming to depict a protester tearing down an Iranian flag was filmed in Nepal during last year’s protests that toppled the Himalayan nation’s government.",

The US also imposed sanctions on Fardis Prison, where the State Department said women had “endured cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a video on Thursday said Washington’s message to Iran’s leaders was clear: “US Treasury knows, that like rats on a sinking ship, you are frantically wiring funds stolen from Iranian families to banks and financial institutions around the world. Rest assured, we will track them and you. “But there’s still time, if you choose to join us. As President Trump has said, stop the violence and stand with the people of Iran.” ‘No death sentence for arrested protester’ Earlier today, Trump said he had been told that killings in Iran’s crackdown on protests were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions, adopting a wait-and-see posture after previously threatening intervention. Meanwhile, after Iran’s foreign minister said Iran had “no plan” to hang people, Iranian state media on Thursday reported that a 26-year-old man arrested during protests in the city of Karaj would not be given the death sentence. Rights organisation Hengaw, which reported earlier this week that Erfan Soltani was due to be executed on Wednesday, said a previously communicated order for his execution had been postponed, citing his relatives. In a social media post on Thursday, Trump responded to a news report that an Iranian protester was no longer being sentenced to death, writing: “This is good news. Hopefully, it will continue!” Iranian state media said that while Soltani was being charged with colluding against “internal security and propaganda activities against the regime”, the death penalty does not apply to such charges. Araghchi also said the Iranian government was “in full control” and reported an atmosphere of “calm” after what he called three days of “terrorist operation”. The British government said its embassy in Tehran had been “temporarily closed”, while the US embassy in Saudi Arabia urged staff to exercise caution and avoid military installations. Iran’s judiciary chief vowed to fast-track trials for those arrested, stoking fears authorities will use capital punishment as a tool of repression. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene on behalf of protesters in Iran, where the Iranian leadership has cracked down hard on nationwide unrest since December 28. Reuters quoted a Gulf official as saying that four Arab states conducted intense diplomacy with the United States and Iran this week to prevent a threatened US attack on Iran. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt were involved in the diplomacy over 48 hours before Trump signalled on Thursday that he had ultimately decided against an attack for now, saying the killings in Iran were easing. The four countries had conveyed to Washington that any attack would have consequences for the wider region in terms of both security and economics that would ultimately impact the United States itself, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. They told Iran that any retaliatory attack it launched on US facilities in the Gulf would have consequences for Tehran’s relations with other countries in the region, the official added. Saudi Arabia’s international media office, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry, Oman’s Information Ministry and Egypt’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Foreign Ministry of the United Arab Emirates, which was not involved in the diplomacy described by the official, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had engaged in any diplomacy on the issue. Protests appear to abate People inside the country, reached by Reuters on Wednesday and Thursday, said the protests appear to have abated since Monday. Information flows have been hampered by an internet blackout for a week. Tensions had escalated on Wednesday, with Iran saying it had warned neighbours it would hit American bases in the region in the event of US strikes, and a US official saying the United States was withdrawing some personnel from bases in the region. Trump, speaking at the White House, said he has been told that killings in the crackdown were subsiding. Asked who told him that the killings had stopped, Trump described them as “very important sources on the other side”. The president did not rule out potential US military action, saying “we are going to watch what the process is” before noting that his administration had received a “very good statement” from Iran. In separate comments to Reuters , Trump expressed uncertainty over whether Reza Pahlavi , the son of the late shah of Iran and a prominent figure in Iran’s fractured opposition, would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over. Trump told Reuters it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth “any regime can fail”. Turkiye, one of several states in the region where the US has forces, expressed opposition to the use of violence against Iran, with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan saying at a press conference in Istanbul that the priority is to avoid destabilisation. Saudi FM Prince Faisal bin Farhan held a phone call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Thursday and discussed ways to support security and stability in the region, the Saudi foreign ministry said. Qatar said on Wednesday that drawdowns from its Al Udeid air base , the biggest US base in the Middle East, were “being undertaken in response to the current regional tensions”. Iran launched missiles at Al Udeid last year in response to US airstrikes on its nuclear installations during the 12-day war between Tehran and Israel. Ali Shamkhani, a senior advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Trump that the strike showed “Iran’s will and capability to respond to any attack”. Iran reopens airspace Iran reopened its airspace after a nearly five-hour closure amid concerns about possible military action between the US and Iran that forced airlines to cancel, reroute or delay some flights. Iran closed its airspace to all flights except international ones to and from Iran with official permission at 10:15pmGMT (3:15amPKT) on Wednesday, according to a notice on the US Federal Aviation Administration website. The notice was removed shortly before 3amGMT (8am PKT), according to tracking service Flightradar24 , which showed five flights from Iranian carriers Mahan Air, Yazd Airways and AVA Airlines were among the first to resume over the country. Missile and drone barrages in a growing number of conflict zones represent a high risk to airline traffic. Indian airlines among those affected India’s largest airline IndiGo said some of its international flights would be impacted by Iran’s sudden airspace closure. Air India said its flights were using alternative routes that could result in delays or cancellations. A flight by Russia’s Aeroflot bound for Tehran returned to Moscow after the closure, according to Flightradar24 data. Earlier on Wednesday, Germany issued a new directive cautioning the country’s airlines from entering Iranian airspace, shortly after Lufthansa rejigged its flight operations across the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region. The United States already prohibits all US commercial flights from overflying Iran and there are no direct flights between the countries. Empty airspace over Iran, during a temporary closure of the country’s airspace amid concerns about possible military action between the United States and Iran, in this screengrab obtained from the internet on January 14, 2026. — FlightRadar/Reuters Airline operators like flydubai and Turkish Airlines have canceled multiple flights to Iran in the past week. “Several airlines have already reduced or suspended services, and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” said Safe Airspace, a website run by OPSGROUP, a membership-based organisation that shares flight risk information. “The situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defence, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.” Lufthansa said on Wednesday that it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice, while it would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman from Wednesday until Monday next week so that crew would not have to stay overnight. Some flights could also be cancelled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement. Italian carrier ITA Airways, in which Lufthansa Group is now a major shareholder, said that it would similarly suspend night flights to Tel Aviv until Tuesday next week. ‘Unprecedented level of brutality’ Separately, G7 nations said on Wednesday they were “deeply alarmed at the high level of reported deaths and injuries” and warned of further sanctions if the crackdown continued. Monitor NetBlocks said Iran’s internet blackout had lasted 156 hours. Amnesty International accused authorities of committing mass unlawful killings “on an unprecedented scale,” citing verified videos and eyewitness accounts. The US-based Institute for the Study of War said authorities were using “an unprecedented level of brutality to suppress protests,” noting reports of protest activity had sharply declined. A senior Iranian official told journalists there had been no new “riots” since Monday, distinguishing them from earlier cost-of-living protests. “Every society can expect protests, but we will not tolerate violence,” he said. Prosecutors have said some detainees will face capital charges of “waging war against God”. State media reported hundreds of arrests and the detention of a foreign national for espionage, without giving details. India tells citizens to leave Iran India’s foreign ministry has urged its citizens to leave Iran, where rights groups say a crackdown on mass protests has killed and arrested thousands of people. India’s foreign ministry estimates there are usually around 10,000 citizens in Iran. “Indian nationals who are currently in Iran (students, pilgrims, business persons and tourists) are advised to leave Iran by available means of transport,” the Indian Embassy in Tehran said, in a post on social media late Wednesday. AI-created Iran protest videos gain traction AI-generated videos purportedly depicting protests in Iran have flooded the web, researchers said Wednesday, as social media users push hyper-realistic deepfakes to fill an information void amid the country’s internet restrictions. US disinformation watchdog NewsGuard said it identified seven AI-generated videos depicting the Iranian protests — created by both pro- and anti-government actors — that have collectively amassed some 3.5 million views across online platforms. Among them was a video shared on the Elon Musk-owned platform X showing women protesters smashing a vehicle belonging to the Basij, the Iranian paramilitary force deployed to suppress the protests. One X post featuring the AI clip, shared by what NewsGuard described as anti-regime users, garnered nearly 720,000 views. Anti-regime X and TikTok users in the United States also posted AI videos depicting Iranian protesters symbolically renaming local streets after President Donald Trump. One such clip shows a protester changing a street sign to “Trump St” while other demonstrators cheer, with an overlaid caption reading: “Iranian protestors are renaming the streets after Trump.” Pro-regime social media users also shared AI videos purportedly showing large-scale pro-government counterprotests throughout the Islamic republic. The AI creations highlight the growing prevalence of what experts call “hallucinated” visual content on social media during major news events, often overshadowing authentic images and videos. In this case, AI creators were filling an information void caused by the internet blackout imposed by the Iranian regime as it sought to suppress demonstrations, experts said. “There’s a lot of news — but no way to get it because of the internet blackout,” said NewsGuard analyst Ines Chomnalez. “Foreign social media users are turning to AI video generators to advance their own narratives about the unfolding chaos.” The fabricated videos were the latest example of AI tools being deployed to distort fast-developing breaking news. AI fabrications, often amplified by partisan actors, have fueled alternate realities around recent news events, including the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and a deadly shooting by immigration agents in Minneapolis. AFP fact-checkers also uncovered misrepresented images that created misleading narratives about the Iranian protests, the largest since the Islamic Republic was proclaimed in 1979. One months-old video purportedly showing demonstrations in Iran was actually filmed in Greece in November 2025, while another claiming to depict a protester tearing down an Iranian flag was filmed in Nepal during last year’s protests that toppled the Himalayan nation’s government.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye have prepared a draft defence agreement after nearly a year of talks, Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj confirmed on Wednesday. His confirmation follows a statement by the Turkish foreign minister about the potential deal earlier today. Harraj told Reuters the potential deal between the three countries was separate from a bilateral Saudi-Pakistani accord announced last year. A final consensus between the three states is needed to complete the deal, he said. “The Pakistan-Saudi Arabia-Turkey trilateral agreement is something that is already in pipeline,” Harraj said in an interview. “The draft agreement is already available with us. The draft agreement is already with Saudi Arabia. The draft agreement is already available with Turkey. And all three countries are deliberating. And this agreement has been there for the last 10 months.” Asked at a press conference in Istanbul earlier today about media reports on negotiations between the three sides, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said talks had been held but that no agreement had been signed. Fidan pointed to a need for broader regional cooperation and trust to overcome distrust, which he said created “cracks and problems” that led to the emergence of external hegemonies or wars and instability stemming from terrorism, in the region. “At the end of all of these, we have a proposal like this: all regional nations must come together to create a cooperation platform on the issue of security,” Fidan said. Regional issues could be resolved if relevant countries would “be sure of each other,” he added. “At the moment, there are meetings, talks, but we have not signed any agreement. Our President (Tayyip Erdogan)’s vision is for an inclusive platform that creates wider, bigger cooperation and stability,” Fidan said, without naming Pakistan or Saudi Arabia directly. Bloomberg , citing people familiar with the matter, reported last week that Turkiye was seeking to join the Pak-Saudi defence pact signed in September 2025. The report said Turkiye viewed the pact “as a way of strengthening security and deterrents when there are questions over the reliability of the US, which has strong military ties with all three countries, and President Donald Trump’s commitment” to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Saudi Arabia brings financial clout, Pakistan has nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkiye has the military experience and has developed a defence industry, Bloomberg quoted Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV, as saying. Asked about reports of Istanbul eyeing such a pact, Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj told BBC Urdu : “From a strategic point of view, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan are close friendly countries of Pakistan, and there is a close relationship with them in terms of strategic policy.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had signed a “ Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement ” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.",

      "title_orig": "‘Don’t know whether his country will accept his leadership’: Trump questions support for Reza Pahlavi in Iran",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi “seems very nice” but expressed uncertainty over whether Pahlavi would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over. In an exclusive Reuters interview in the Oval Office, Trump said there was a chance Iran’s government could collapse and blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the stalemate in negotiations with Russia over the war in Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran. But he was reluctant on Wednesday to lend his full support to Pahlavi , the son of the late shah of Iran, who was ousted from power in 1979. “He seems very nice, but I don’t know how he’d play within his own country,” Trump said. “And we really aren’t up to that point yet. I don’t know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me.” Trump’s comments went further in questioning Pahlavi’s ability to lead Iran, after he said last week that he had no plans to meet with him. Opposition Fragmented The US-based Pahlavi , 65, has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution and has become a prominent voice in the protests. Iran’s opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions — including the monarchists who back Pahlavi — and appears to have little organised presence inside the Islamic Republic. Echoing Trump’s caution, Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Programme, said Pahlavi had gained prominence among some protesters and had helped mobilise them to some extent. “But I wouldn’t overstate it. It’s very hard to see how much support he has or how much support any figure has in Iran,” she said. Trump said it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth “any regime can fail”. “Whether or not it falls or not, it’s going to be an interesting period of time,” he said. Trump, who is closing out the first year of his second term in office, sat behind his massive Resolute Desk and sipped a Diet Coke during the 30-minute interview. At one point, he held up a thick binder of papers, which he said contained his achievements since being sworn into office on January 20, 2025. But he sought to manage expectations for Republicans in November’s congressional midterm elections, noting that the party in power frequently loses seats two years after a presidential election. “When you win the presidency, you don’t win the midterms,” he said. “But we’re going to try very hard to win the midterms.” ‘Zelensky’ main impediment to reaching a deal Trump, who has struggled throughout his presidency to end Russia’s war in Ukraine despite campaign boasts that he could end it in a day, said Zelensky is the main impediment to resolving the four-year-old war. Trump has frequently criticised both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky but seemed more downbeat once again on the Ukrainian president. Trump said Putin was “ready to make a deal.” Asked what the holdup is, Trump said simply: “Zelensky.” “We have to get President Zelensky to go along with it,“ he said. Trump calls Venezuelan opposition leader ‘very nice woman’ Trump is to meet on Thursday with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado at the White House, their first in-person meeting since Trump directed the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and seized control of the country earlier this month. “She’s a very nice woman,” Trump said of Machado. “I’ve seen her on television. I think we’re just going to talk basics.” Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year and dedicated it to Trump. She has offered to give him her prize, but the Nobel Committee said the peace prize cannot be transferred. He praised the acting president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez, who was vice president to Maduro when he was ousted. Trump said he had a “fascinating talk” with Rodriguez earlier on Wednesday and “she’s been very good to deal with.” Trump frequently extolled the strength of the US economy during the interview despite lingering worries among Americans about prices. He said he will carry that message with him next week to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he will stress “how great our economy is, how strong our job numbers are, how good we’re doing.”",
