      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The Trump administration’s point man for South and Central Asia has told Congress that Pakistan remains an important US partner in the region, with Washington seeking to expand trade, economic cooperation, and security ties with the country. Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Sub-committee on South and Central Asia on Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored Pakistan’s role in regional engagement and highlighted growing bilateral cooperation. “Pakistan is another important partner in the region. We are working together with Pakistan to realise the potential of its critical mineral resources, combining US government seed financing with private sector know-how would benefit both of our countries,” he told the sub-committee. Referring to broader economic engagement, Kapur said: “Our trade in energy and agriculture is expanding as well.” He also pointed to continued security cooperation between the two countries, adding: “And our ongoing counter-terrorism cooperation helps Pakistan combat internal security threats while addressing transnational dangers that can harm the US or our partners.” During the subsequent question-and-answer session, lawmakers raised issues related to militancy, Pakistan’s past security strategy and broader regional dynamics. Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States. Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups. When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere. The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect. The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests. He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific. Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence. At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said. Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people. She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute. Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable. Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces. “We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.",

      "title_orig": "Net metering fiasco",
      "summary_orig": "IF you are trying to follow the discussion around the government’s attempt to reduce net metering rates and find it too technical or too confusing, don’t worry. You’re not alone, and more importantly, as an ordinary consumer, you don’t need to get into the technicalities. All you need, as a user of electricity, is a clear and firm idea of where your specific interests lie. Around 10 years ago, the electricity in my bills cost me Rs20 per unit, including taxes and everything. Today, the same cost is around Rs60 and sometimes as high as Rs70. All of us have been hit by this tsunami of inflation. Some of us tried to cope with it by investing in a rooftop solar system in the hopes that once it pays itself off, it will provide us with some protection from the skyrocketing price of electricity. These prices did not skyrocket because of anything we did. They rose for two reasons. First, because the rupee fell against the dollar, and most of our electricity prices are indexed to the dollar since we rely on imported fuel and equipment in order to generate it. Second, the bureaucrats cannot run the power system and won’t let anyone else run it either. The most visible marker of their failure to operate the power system is the rise of the circular debt. So they kept taking the costs of their failures and passing them on to us. When their failures to run the power system led to the rise of the circular debt in the years since 2005, they moved to make the rest of us pay the interest cost of carrying this debt. In 2014, they succeeded, and we have had interest payments on the circular debt as part of our bills ever since. This is just one example, though a stark one. In 2016, they decided to make costs of raising a CPEC security force a ‘pass-through item’, meaning it would be part of the costs of a project that consumers pay through their bills. In 2023, they also started applying a withholding tax on income from net metering benefits. Good luck getting this refunded at the end of the year when you come around to filing your tax returns! Either way, we had no choice but to pay. We were prisoners inside this grid. The story goes on and on. Over the years, so many costs were bundled into the system — some visible in the bills but many tucked away as ‘pass-through’ items from generation companies which you cannot see but that are inside the variable charges of your bill — that the power system be­­came too large and too unwieldy for the bureaucrats and its losses mounted. In 2007, when I was covering the rise of the circular debt, it made headlines when it crossed Rs30 billion. By 2024, it had crossed Rs2 trillion . There were many contributing factors behind this rise, including system losses, but also larger macroeconomic mismanagement by the government, which led to devaluation of the rupee and hikes in dollar-indexed payments, as well as higher interest costs. None of this was our fault, yours or mine. But the costs of it all were billed straight to us. Then came the real killer: the devaluations of 2022 and 2023. As the rupee plummeted against the dollar, power bills skyrocketed. In rupee terms, my bills more than tripled in this period. In dollar terms, they barely rose a few cents. Either way, we had no choice but to pay. We were prisoners inside this grid. Look at your bills over the past decade and work out what percentage of your household income was going to pay for electricity. The sharply rising proportion is your prisoner tax, and left to its own devices, this would have continued indefinitely, forever. But the prison walls were breached at some point with the arrival of rooftop solar. At first, it moved slowly, between 2016 and 2020, as power utilities stonewalled people’s net metering licence applications. But once the stonewalling ended, a stampede ensued. The sheer scale with which solar adoption grew in Pakistan post-2020 made global headlines. The scale of the defection from the grid was like a prison break, with people fleeing in growing numbers as the price of electricity spiralled out of control in the inflationary fire of 2022 and 2023. The bureaucrats are angry because their best prisoners have found an alternative source of supply and can reduce their reliance on the grid. They are demanding that these people be rounded up and brought back and be made to buy the expensive electricity from the grid that has so many costs bundled into it that you need two separate Master’s degrees to be able to understand them, one in finance and the second in engineering. You don’t need to get into the technical issues to get this. You just need to know your own mind. Are you happy paying for all those ‘fixed costs’ the bureaucrats want to saddle you with in their grid? If not, then make your exit. The solar revolution has entered its next phase with the arrival of batteries. If the grid wants to pay me Rs11 for my electricity and charge me Rs60 for its electricity, I have a solution: simply store my electricity and use it myself. In the years ahead, more grid defections will take place and these will be permanent. The bureaucrats will probably try to halt these too, by adding sharp taxes and duties on batteries, but they will be unsuccessful because the local production of batteries has already begun. The grid is in terminal decline. It would be better to just admit that and start managing the transition rather than thrashing around like this to first spur solar adoption, then swivel around to try and stop it. The state looks rather foolish now, first announcing a solar policy, then grinding its teeth at those who opted for it.

In 2014, they succeeded, and we have had interest payments on the circular debt as part of our bills ever since. This is just one example, though a stark one. In 2016, they decided to make costs of raising a CPEC security force a ‘pass-through item’, meaning it would be part of the costs of a project that consumers pay through their bills. In 2023, they also started applying a withholding tax on income from net metering benefits. Good luck getting this refunded at the end of the year when you come around to filing your tax returns! Either way, we had no choice but to pay. We were prisoners inside this grid. The story goes on and on. Over the years, so many costs were bundled into the system — some visible in the bills but many tucked away as ‘pass-through’ items from generation companies which you cannot see but that are inside the variable charges of your bill — that the power system be­­came too large and too unwieldy for the bureaucrats and its losses mounted. In 2007, when I was covering the rise of the circular debt, it made headlines when it crossed Rs30 billion. By 2024, it had crossed Rs2 trillion . There were many contributing factors behind this rise, including system losses, but also larger macroeconomic mismanagement by the government, which led to devaluation of the rupee and hikes in dollar-indexed payments, as well as higher interest costs. None of this was our fault, yours or mine. But the costs of it all were billed straight to us. Then came the real killer: the devaluations of 2022 and 2023. As the rupee plummeted against the dollar, power bills skyrocketed. In rupee terms, my bills more than tripled in this period. In dollar terms, they barely rose a few cents. Either way, we had no choice but to pay. We were prisoners inside this grid. Look at your bills over the past decade and work out what percentage of your household income was going to pay for electricity. The sharply rising proportion is your prisoner tax, and left to its own devices, this would have continued indefinitely, forever. But the prison walls were breached at some point with the arrival of rooftop solar. At first, it moved slowly, between 2016 and 2020, as power utilities stonewalled people’s net metering licence applications. But once the stonewalling ended, a stampede ensued. The sheer scale with which solar adoption grew in Pakistan post-2020 made global headlines. The scale of the defection from the grid was like a prison break, with people fleeing in growing numbers as the price of electricity spiralled out of control in the inflationary fire of 2022 and 2023. The bureaucrats are angry because their best prisoners have found an alternative source of supply and can reduce their reliance on the grid. They are demanding that these people be rounded up and brought back and be made to buy the expensive electricity from the grid that has so many costs bundled into it that you need two separate Master’s degrees to be able to understand them, one in finance and the second in engineering. You don’t need to get into the technical issues to get this. You just need to know your own mind. Are you happy paying for all those ‘fixed costs’ the bureaucrats want to saddle you with in their grid? If not, then make your exit. The solar revolution has entered its next phase with the arrival of batteries. If the grid wants to pay me Rs11 for my electricity and charge me Rs60 for its electricity, I have a solution: simply store my electricity and use it myself. In the years ahead, more grid defections will take place and these will be permanent. The bureaucrats will probably try to halt these too, by adding sharp taxes and duties on batteries, but they will be unsuccessful because the local production of batteries has already begun. The grid is in terminal decline. It would be better to just admit that and start managing the transition rather than thrashing around like this to first spur solar adoption, then swivel around to try and stop it. The state looks rather foolish now, first announcing a solar policy, then grinding its teeth at those who opted for it.

      "title": "Net metering fiasco",
      "summary": "IF you are trying to follow the discussion around the government’s attempt to reduce net metering rates and find it too technical or too confusing, don’t worry. You’re not alone, and more importantly, as an ordinary consumer, you don’t need to get into the technicalities. All you need, as a user of electricity, is a clear and firm idea of where your specific interests lie. Around 10 years ago, the electricity in my bills cost me Rs20 per unit, including taxes and everything. Today, the same cost is around Rs60 and sometimes as high as Rs70. All of us have been hit by this tsunami of inflation. Some of us tried to cope with it by investing in a rooftop solar system in the hopes that once it pays itself off, it will provide us with some protection from the skyrocketing price of electricity. These prices did not skyrocket because of anything we did. They rose for two reasons. First, because the rupee fell against the dollar, and most of our electricity prices are indexed to the dollar since we rely on imported fuel and equipment in order to generate it. Second, the bureaucrats cannot run the power system and won’t let anyone else run it either. The most visible marker of their failure to operate the power system is the rise of the circular debt. So they kept taking the costs of their failures and passing them on to us. When their failures to run the power system led to the rise of the circular debt in the years since 2005, they moved to make the rest of us pay the interest cost of carrying this debt.

      "summary_orig": "• Palestinian leader demands ‘firm response’ from US over international law violation • Berlin joins criticism, calling move a step towards ‘de facto annexation’ GENEVA: The United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday that Israel’s plans to tighten control over the occupied West Bank pave the way for further settlement expansion and represent a step toward consolidating “illegal annexation”. Israel’s security cabinet on Sunday approved measures allowing Jewish Israelis to buy West Bank land directly and extending greater Israeli control over areas where the Palestinian Authority exercises power. The plan further grants Israel the authority to administer certain religious sites located in areas under Palestinian Authority control. The plans, which have sparked international outrage, modify the administration established under the Oslo Accords in the 1990s. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said the decisions by Israel’s security cabinet were the latest in a string of measures to annex Palestinian lands. “This is yet another step by the Israeli authorities towards rendering a viable Palestinian state impossible, in violation of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” Turk said in a statement. “If these decisions are implemented, they will undoubtedly accelerate the dispossession of Palestinians and their forcible transfer, and lead to the creation of more illegal Israeli settlements.” Turk noted that these measures would further deprive Palestinians of natural resources and restrict their human rights. He stated the moves will “further cement Israel’s control and integration of the occupied West Bank into Israel, consolidating unlawful annexation”. The UN official warned that these policies are part of a wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers and security forces, alongside a pattern of evictions, home demolitions, and land grabs. “We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” Turk said. “These decisions must be overturned.” Meanwhile, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas called for a “firm response” from the United States and the international community. Speaking during a visit to Oslo on Wednesday, Abbas said he discussed the issue with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store. “These serious violations require a firm response from the US administration and the international community because they hinder President Donald Trump’s efforts and constitute a violation of international law,” Abbas said. Abbas also cited issues including Israeli settler violence and Israel’s freezing of funds intended for the Palestinian people. Germany joined the chorus of criticism on Wednesday, with the foreign ministry calling the move “a further step towards de facto annexation.” “Israel remains an occupying power in the West Bank, and as an occupying power it is a violation of international law to build settlements, including transferring certain administrative functions to civilian Israeli authorities,” a German foreign ministry spokesman said in Berlin.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: In a fresh round of ambassadorial appointments, the government posted envoys across Europe, Africa and Asia, with several senior diplomats reassigned and a few vacancies filled. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, while announcing the new appointments, emphasised economic diplomacy as a central focus of Pakistan’s external engagement. “Building on the momentum of the last two years of robust foreign policy engagement and international outreach, may our envoys carry this mission forward with clarity of purpose and wisdom, with a clear emphasis on economic diplomacy,” Mr Dar posted on X. In Europe, Saadia Altaf Qazi, Pakistan’s ambassador to Norway, has been posted as ambassador to Thailand. She will replace Rukhsana Afzaal in Bangkok. Her transfer created a vacancy in Oslo, where Asim Ali Khan will replace her. Salman Sharif, presently serving at the Prime Minister’s Office, has been named ambassador to Germany. He will take over from Saqlain Syeda in Berlin. Pakistan’s embassy in Sweden will be headed by Ahmed Amjad Ali, currently consul general in Los Angeles. He replaced Bilal Hayee in Stockholm. Dar says clear emphasis on economic diplomacy, terms it central to external engagement In the United Kingdom, where Pakistan maintains a high commission, Tipu Usman, currently chief of protocol at the Foreign Office, has been appointed high commissioner to London. He replaced Dr Mohammad Faisal, who will return to the FO. At the United Nations in Geneva, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, who is serving as Foreign Office spokesperson, has been appointed Pakistan’s permanent representative. He replaced Bilal Ahmed. In a corresponding move, Mr Ahmed has been appointed as ambassador to Kenya, replacing Ibrar Hussain Khan in Nairobi. In Central Asia, Irfan Ahmed, director general for Europe at the Foreign Office, has been posted as ambassador to Tajikistan. The position in Dushanbe had been vacant. Meanwhile, Mudassir Tipu, currently Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran, has been appointed ambassador to Uzbekistan, replacing Ahmed Farooq in Tashkent. His move cleared the way for Imran Ahmed Siddiqui, presently additional secretary at the Foreign Office, to take over as ambassador in Tehran. In Africa, Hasnain Yousaf, currently director general of the Special Investment Facilitation Council at the Foreign Office, has been appointed ambassador to Tanzania, replacing Siraj Ahmed Khan in Dar es Salaam. Ashar Shahzad, presently deputy consul in Houston, has been named ambassador to Uganda, replacing Hassan Wazir in Kampala. In South Asia, Mohammad Aamir Khan, director general for the Americas at the Foreign Office, has been appointed ambassador to Nepal, replacing Abrar Hashmi in Kathmandu. In addition to the ambassadorial postings, the government also announced appointments to several consul general posts. Ali Anser Zaidi has been posted to Frankfurt, Yasir Iqbal Butt to Guangzhou, Shahbaz Hussain to Kandahar, Siraj Ahmad Khan to Los Angeles, Awais Ahmad Khan to Mazar-e-Sharif, and Faisal Abro to Montreal.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) enabled the recovery of about Rs506 billion in disputed tax revenue over the past year by deciding hundreds of long-pending tax and revenue cases and lifting stay orders that had blocked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from collecting dues, according to the court’s Annual Report 2025-26. The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation. To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC). A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes. Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog. LHC strikes down PRA sales tax case against Fauji Wind Energy on jurisdiction grounds Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn. According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn. The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn. The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years. The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives. The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”. Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records. Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction. A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025. Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority. The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million. The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction. A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025. Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority. The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million. The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) enabled the recovery of about Rs506 billion in disputed tax revenue over the past year by deciding hundreds of long-pending tax and revenue cases and lifting stay orders that had blocked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from collecting dues, according to the court’s Annual Report 2025-26. The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation. To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC). A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes. Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog. LHC strikes down PRA sales tax case against Fauji Wind Energy on jurisdiction grounds Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn. According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn. The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn. The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years. The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives. The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”. Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records.

      "title_orig": "Any military escalation involving Iran could destabilise region: President Zardari",
      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday appreciated efforts for easing tensions and promoting regional peace, warning that any military escalation involving Iran could destabilise the Gulf region, South and Western Asia. He said this while addressing a ceremony hosted by the Iranian embassy in Islamabad on the 47th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “Any instability involving Iran, or any attempt to resolve issues through military means, carries grave risks. Such actions could … undermine global peace, and cause serious harm to the global economy. The stakes are far too high for confrontation,” President Zardari said. He further stated that Pakistan opposed unilateral sanctions and coercive measures, including against Iran, and believed that “peaceful engagement best serves regional and global security”. “Pakistan welcomes efforts aimed at easing tensions and encourages continued dialogue among relevant parties in a constructive spirit, with the objective of promoting peace and stability in the region,” he added. Earlier, the president requested the participants of the ceremony to observe one minute of silence in the memory of victims of the recent blast in Islamabad , and the tragedies in Iran. “Let’s pray that wars never come to us,” he said. Referring to ongoing conflicts, terrorism, external interference and unresolved regional flashpoints in the region, the president said Pakistan firmly believed that such challenges could not be addressed through force or unilateral actions. He also emphasised that Pakistan and Iran shared responsibilities as neighbouring countries and remained committed to cooperating on border management, counter-terrorism and “turning the shared frontier into a zone of cooperation, lawful trade and development”. The president stressed that Pakistan valued balanced relations globally and was ready to play a constructive role in promoting restraint, dialogue and regional peace. He extended his warm congratulations to the leadership and people of Iran. “May our partnership continue to grow, and may our region move towards security, stability and shared prosperity,” he said. The president added Pakistan and Iran were not just neighbours, but also “civilisational partners”. “Our shared border reflects centuries of interaction, coexistence and mutual respect,” he stated. “Our relationship is rooted in faith, history and enduring cultural bonds that continue to shape our region.” He noted that the Persian language and its great literary tradition had profoundly influenced Pakistan’s intellectual life, adding that for hundreds of years, it was the official language of some of the regions that were now a part of Pakistan. “Its influence remains deeply embedded in our national consciousness. Pakistan’s national anthem itself reflects the deep imprint of the Persian language on our collective identity,” he stated. The president remembered Sachal Sarmast, a renowned 18th-century poet in Sindh, on the occasion, saying that he composed poetry in Persian, which reflected “a shared spiritual and philosophical space”. “Poets and thinkers such as Rumi, Hafiz, Saadi and Ferdowsi are widely respected in Pakistan, while Iqbal, who wrote much of his work in Persian, remains a shared symbol of dignity and renewal for both our societies,” he added. In his welcome address, Iranian Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam said that despite facing various external pressures and challenges, Iran had made remarkable progress in key sectors, including technology, defence, science and the economy. He noted that the Iranian nation had “consistently demonstrated resilience and self-reliance”, turning challenges into opportunities and continuing its journey of development with determination. Moghadam said that Iran did “not seek war and believes in resolving disputes through dialogue and diplomacy”. However, he made it clear that if a war broke out, Iran would “fully retaliate in defence of its sovereignty”. The ambassador appreciated the government and people of Pakistan for their support, particularly during “Israeli aggression against Iran”.",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least four policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), were martyred on Wednesday as armed terrorists attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area, police said. According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation. The operation was conducted in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Nawab police station following intelligence reports about militants’ presence in the area, it said, adding that the area was cordoned off before the search operation was initiated. While the police party was returning, militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire, the statement said. Four policemen were martyred in the attack and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire. The officers who lost their lives included SHO Faheem Mumtaz, Constable Irfan Khan, Constable Ghulam Subhani, and Constable Wajahat, the statement said. Paharpur Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police Hafiz Adnan and Assistant Sub-Inspector Tariq were injured in the attack. A police spokesperson earlier said that the martyrs and the wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Teaching Hospital for treatment. Following the incident, the spokesperson said, a heavy contingent of police, led by District Police Officer Sajad Ahmed Sahebzada, reached the scene and launched clearance a search operation to apprehend the militants. The police statement said that the area had been sealed off and the search and clearance operation was under way. It added that efforts were being made to recover the bodies of the slain militants from the forest area, while security in nearby localities has been further tightened. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack. “Eliminating the cancer of terrorism sponsored from abroad from the country is the topmost priority,” the president was quoted as saying. The statement added that he extended his prayers to the martyrs’ families and wished the wounded a swift recovery. Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took notice of the incident and strongly condemned it. In a statement, he paid tribute to the sacrifices of the martyred personnel. “The provincial government will provide all possible assistance to the affected families,” he said. He further said that the KP police were at the frontline in the fight against terrorism. “Terrorism is a common challenge for the entire country. Actions against elements hostile to peace will be further intensified in the province,” he said. He said police morale could not be dampened by such cowardly acts. CM Afridi said that a comprehensive and effective strategy was essential for the complete eradication of terrorism. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi expressed deep sorrow over the attack. He said he was saddened by the deaths of the police personnel and praised the bravery and sacrifice of Dera Ismail Khan police in protecting the public and the nation. The governor also directed that all possible medical care be provided to the injured officers and prayed for their speedy recovery.

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Wednesday, with the latter expected to press him to widen talks with Iran to include limits on Tehran’s missile arsenal and other security threats beyond its nuclear programme. In his seventh meeting with Trump since the president returned to office nearly 13 months ago, Netanyahu was looking to influence the next round of US discussions with Iran following nuclear negotiations held in Oman last Friday. Trump threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war. He has repeatedly voiced support for a secure Israel, a longstanding US ally and arch-foe of Iran. In media interviews on Tuesday, Trump reiterated his warning, saying that while he believes Iran wants a deal, he would do “something very tough” if it refused. Trump says no to Iranian nuclear weapons, missiles Trump told Fox Business that a good deal with Iran would mean “no nuclear weapons, no missiles,” without elaborating. He also told Axios he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier strike group as part of a major US buildup near Iran. Israel was concerned that the US might pursue a narrow nuclear deal that does not include restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missile programme or an end to Iranian support for armed proxies, according to people familiar with the matter. Israeli officials have urged the US not to trust Iran’s promises. “I will present to the president our perceptions of the principles in the negotiations,” Netanyahu told reporters before departing for the US. The two leaders could also discuss potential military action if diplomacy with Iran fails, one source said. Iran said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions, but ruled out linking the issue to missiles. “The Islamic republic’s missile capabilities are non-negotiable ,” Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said on Wednesday. Netanyahu’s arrival at the White House was lower-key than usual. He entered the building away from the view of reporters and cameras, and a White House official then confirmed he was inside meeting with Trump. Gaza on the agenda Also on the agenda was Gaza, with Trump looking to push ahead with a ceasefire agreement he helped to broker. Progress on his 20-point plan to end the war and rebuild the shattered Palestinian enclave stalled, with major gaps over steps such as Hamas disarming as Israeli troops withdraw in phases. Netanyahu’s visit, originally scheduled for February 18, was brought forward amid renewed US engagement with Iran. Both sides at last week’s Oman meeting said the talks were positive and further talks were expected soon. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said ahead of the Oman meeting that negotiations would need to address Iran’s missiles, its proxy groups, and its treatment of its own population. Iran said Friday’s talks focused only on nuclear issues. Trump has been vague about broadening the negotiations. He was quoted as telling Axios on Tuesday that it was a “no-brainer” for any deal to cover Iran’s nuclear programme, but that he also thought it possible to address its missile stockpiles. Iran says its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes, while the US and Israel have previously accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Last June, the US joined Israel’s strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during a 12-day war. Israel also heavily damaged Iran’s air defences and missile arsenal. Two Israeli officials say there are signs Iran is working to restore those capabilities. Trump threatened last month to intervene militarily during a crackdown on anti-government protests in Iran, but ultimately held off. Israel wary of a weakened Iran rebuilding Tehran’s regional influence was weakened by the 12-day war, losses suffered by proxies in the region and the ousting of its ally, former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. But Israel was wary of its adversaries rebuilding after the multi-front war, triggered by Hamas’ October 2023 attack on southern Israel. While Trump and Netanyahu have mostly been in sync and the US remains Israel’s main arms supplier, Wednesday’s meeting could expose tensions. Part of Trump’s Gaza plan held out the prospect for eventual Palestinian statehood, which Netanyahu and his coalition — the most far-right in Israel’s history — have long resisted . Netanyahu’s security cabinet on Sunday authorised steps that would make it easier for Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank to buy land while granting Israel broader powers in what the Palestinians see as the heartland of a future state. The decision drew international condemnation . “I am against annexation,” Trump told Axios , reiterating his stance. “We have enough things to think about now.”",

The premier made the announcement while visiting the site of the attack. On February 6, a suicide bomber ripped through the Friday congregation at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra on the outskirts of Islamabad. At least 38 people were killed in the incident and more than 150 were injured. During the visit, PM Shehbaz announced a sum of Rs 10 million for Oun Abbas, who resisted the suicide attacker; Rs5m for each martyr; Rs3m for those critically injured and under treatment at the hospital; and Rs1m for those with minor injuries who had been discharged. Speaking on the occasion, PM Shehbaz said, “These terrorists have no religion, and they have crossed all the limits of cruelty.” Talking to the affected families, he said the entire nation was in a state of grief and saddened over the tragic incident, which resulted in the martyrdom of elders and kids while scores of others were injured. He termed the incident the “worst kind of barbaric act”. PM Shehbaz said that all religious leaders had strongly condemned the incident with unity and praised them for foiling the nefarious designs of the enemies with solidarity. The prime minister observed that the attempt to sow seeds of disunity in society had failed miserably. He also commended the armed forces, law enforcement agencies and police force fighting against terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Later, the prime minister also visited Abbas’ residence to offer his condolences. Additional input from APP",

The explosive left-hander is an integral part of India’s T20 World Cup title defence and is doubtful for the Group A fixture against Namibia on Thursday in New Delhi. “He has been discharged today and he is doing well,” Varma, an attacking batter, told reporters on the eve of the match at Delhi’s Arun Jaitley Stadium. “We have got one more day for the game. Hopefully, we decide by tomorrow on how he feels and we’ll go with it.” The 25-year-old was admitted to a Delhi hospital on Tuesday with a stomach issue he had carried since their opening win on Saturday, an official told AFP on condition of anonymity. Abhishek was out for a duck in India’s win over the United States. India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah is expected to return for the second group match after he missed the opener due to having a fever, Varma said. India will move on after the Namibia match to Colombo, where they face a blockbuster clash against Pakistan on Sunday. The Pakistan government late Monday ended a week-long stand-off by reversing its order for the cricket team to boycott the big game due to political reasons. “We are actually excited to play (against Pakistan),” said the 23-year-old Varma. “We were already prepared for the game even before we got to know about it a couple of days back. We are in match zone now.” The explosive left-hander is key to India’s chances of defending their title at the 20-team tournament and is doubtful for the Group A fixture on Thursday in New Delhi.",

      "summary_orig": "Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti addressed the issue of terrorism in the province on Wednesday, asserting that no one was allowed to take up arms and kill innocent people. He made this statement while addressing the Balochistan Assembly, around 10 days after a spate of attacks on January 31 brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days . Security forces responded to the attacks by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 ”. Speaking about terrorism today, Bugti said there was, unfortunately, “confusion” on the issue in Pakistan. He linked this “confusion” to the use of “propaganda”, which he said was used to create distance between the state and the youth of Balochistan. Moreover, he claimed, “a forced narrative has been created against Pakistan that is purely based on perceptions and devoid of reality”. The minister decried that terrorism in Balochistan was linked to the lack of development in the province, adding that the problem of “unparalleled development” existed across the country. Why were arms not being taken up elsewhere, the CM said, adding, “How are you rationalising violence?” Again criticising the linking of terrorism with the lack of development, he remarked: “The monopoly of the right of violence is only with the state [ sic ]; be it whichever state in the world.” The CM then emphasised that no one was allowed to take up arms and kill innocent people on any issue. He said that those involved in terrorism in Balochistan wanted to “break the country and create a nation state on the basis of Baloch identity”. Bugti further said the aim behind the creation of such a nation state was to employ it for the use of three “tools”. “The first tool is of violence, the second is of social manoeuvre and legitimate voices, and the third is of social media,” he outlined, without elaborating any further on this. Bugti said that the “Baloch are being pushed towards a futile war. What can be gained of this futile war except for bloodshed?” he said, reiterating that he “feels that attempts are made to rationalise violence”. “This is very dangerous,” he added. The CM said that the National Action Plan was the most important document after the Constitution. In the NAP, he added, terrorism in the name of religion had been recognised with consensus as an act of terrorism. But, he continued, “terrorism in the name of so-called nationalism is treated differently”. The CM said that as far as the prospect of dialogue was concerned, “what will be the end result? What do you want from it?” He said he had requested the opposition in the provincial assembly multiple times to “take the lead” if they believed a resolution was possible through dialogue. “I, on behalf of the state of Pakistan, am ready to talk. But I cannot talk to those who are talking to us with the barrels of guns, those who are killing us, those who are killing our innocent children, those who are killing our innocent teachers, our doctors, our policemen and our security forces.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday criticised National Assembly (NA) Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai over his recent remarks about the army, saying that the “irresponsible” statement was an attempt to “belittle the sacrifices” of security personnel. Asif’s rebuke came during a session of the lower house of Parliament, where he recalled Achakzai’s recent remarks and quoted him as saying that the army was a “force of four districts”. Asif did not elaborate on the context of the remarks attributed to Achakzai. Terming it “highly irresponsible” and a “deliberate attempt to malign” the national institution, Asif asserted that the army was a national force. “It is the force of the federation, with representation from all provinces,” he stressed. “It is the force of the entire country.” During his address, the minister also shared data about the representation of different provinces in the army, reading out statistics from a document. According to the document, seen by Dawn , the province-wise representation in consonance with the population of districts in the army as per the 2023 census was 51.1 per cent from Punjab, 16.28pc from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 20.52pc from Sindh, 6.04pc from Balochistan, 2.54pc from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan and 3.52pc from the minorities. However, while reading out the numbers, Asif mistakenly stated that representation from Punjab was 91.1pc instead of 51.1pc. He also highlighted that the armed forces had rendered several sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. “Over the past five years, 3,141 personnel, including officers, junior commissioned officers, and jawans have embraced martyrdom in this fight,” the defence minister said, adding that those martyrs were from all regions of the country. According to data shared by Asif, those martyrs included 170 officers, 212 junior commissioned officers and 2759 soldiers. He added that the opposition leader’s “irresponsible statement is an attempt to belittle these sacrifices and tantamount to attacking public sentiments”. The minister said that the opposition leader’s position was a respectable one and such statements were not expected from Achakzai. He further asserted that the fight against terrorism was not confined to any particular province or district, but “is a collective struggle of the entire nation”. “Martyrs are our red line … We are indebted to the martyrs, who sacrificed their lives for our safety and protection,” he said. Asif went on to say, “We are in the middle of a very bloody war. Daily …” At this point, the NA’s live stream was disrupted for less than a minute. When the stream resumed, the defence minister said that “such attacks and behaviour, the spilling of blood is not allowed in our religion”. “The bodies of our soldiers are decapitated after their martyrdom. This is also happening. It is happening in Tirah Valley,” he said. Turning his attention to politicians, he said, “We are fighting a war for our political interests. If someone says that we are fighting for the country, then they are wrong. We are fighting a war for our political interests and power. Over the past 60-70 years, whenever someone was deprived of power, they fought for it, and there were no underlying principles in that fight. “And then a voice is raised in this house that it (army) is a force of four districts. I don’t want to use any strong words for this house as it has earned me immense respect.” But, he continued, if an individual crossed a “line drawn with blood” while safeguarding their political interests, they had no right to “sit in this house”. The defence minister also said that “no voice is raised from Balochistan when Punjabis are shot after their identity cards are checked … I don’t believe in provincial discrimination, but I take strong exception [to Achakzai’s remark]”. He also moved a resolution, which paid tribute to the armed forces for their “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism. The resolution was adopted by the house, which reaffirmed its commitment that the sacrifices of the martyrs would not go in vain. The resolution underscored that the nation was standing firmly alongside the armed forces in the fight against terrorism. It further lauded the “professional capabilities, bravery and dedication” of the military, declaring full support for its continued efforts to safeguard national security, uphold stability and maintain peace across the country. Achakzai, who joined the NA proceedings midway through Asif’s speech, responded to the defence minister, saying that he stood by his words and would continue to speak against the “enemies of democracy”. “You have punished us for supporting democracy”, he remarked and raised the question that whether Parliament was supposed to “justify martial law”. The opposition leader also commented that relations with Afghanistan could not improve until “we stop deeming the neighbouring country as our fifth province”. PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan also spoke during the session, raising objection to his party being held responsible for terrorism in the country. “Terrorists are our enemies wherever they are”, he said. Gohar further criticised the government for “using the crutches of the establishment to rule the country”. Gohar also reminded the defence minister that he used to openly criticise the army in the past and alleged that his statement in the house was “an attempt to divide the nation”. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, however, contended that sharing data on the number of martyrs could not be termed an attempt to divide the nation. NA passes 6 bills During the session, the short of quorum NA also passed six bills amid an outcry from the opposition, with Speaker Sadiq refusing to order a count. Just 66 members were present in the house at the time of passage of the bills after rules were suspended to take those up for immediate consideration. The bills included the Pakistan Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2025, Cannabis Control and Regulatory Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2026, The Pakistan Names and Emblems (Prevention of Unauthorised Use) (Amendment) Bill, 2026, National Archives (Amendment) Bill, 2026, Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2026 and Islamabad Capital Territory Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2025.",

Asif did not elaborate on the context of the remarks attributed to Achakzai. Terming it “highly irresponsible” and a “deliberate attempt to malign” the national institution, Asif asserted that the army was a national force. “It is the force of the federation, with representation from all provinces,” he stressed. “It is the force of the entire country.” During his address, the minister also shared data about the representation of different provinces in the army, reading out statistics from a document. According to the document, seen by Dawn , the province-wise representation in consonance with the population of districts in the army as per the 2023 census was 51.1 per cent from Punjab, 16.28pc from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 20.52pc from Sindh, 6.04pc from Balochistan, 2.54pc from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan and 3.52pc from the minorities. However, while reading out the numbers, Asif mistakenly stated that representation from Punjab was 91.1pc instead of 51.1pc. He also highlighted that the armed forces had rendered several sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. “Over the past five years, 3,141 personnel, including officers, junior commissioned officers, and jawans have embraced martyrdom in this fight,” the defence minister said, adding that those martyrs were from all regions of the country. According to data shared by Asif, those martyrs included 170 officers, 212 junior commissioned officers and 2759 soldiers. He added that the opposition leader’s “irresponsible statement is an attempt to belittle these sacrifices and tantamount to attacking public sentiments”. The minister said that the opposition leader’s position was a respectable one and such statements were not expected from Achakzai. He further asserted that the fight against terrorism was not confined to any particular province or district, but “is a collective struggle of the entire nation”. “Martyrs are our red line … We are indebted to the martyrs, who sacrificed their lives for our safety and protection,” he said. Asif went on to say, “We are in the middle of a very bloody war. Daily …” At this point, the NA’s live stream was disrupted for less than a minute. When the stream resumed, the defence minister said that “such attacks and behaviour, the spilling of blood is not allowed in our religion”. “The bodies of our soldiers are decapitated after their martyrdom. This is also happening. It is happening in Tirah Valley,” he said. Turning his attention to politicians, he said, “We are fighting a war for our political interests. If someone says that we are fighting for the country, then they are wrong. We are fighting a war for our political interests and power. Over the past 60-70 years, whenever someone was deprived of power, they fought for it, and there were no underlying principles in that fight. “And then a voice is raised in this house that it (army) is a force of four districts. I don’t want to use any strong words for this house as it has earned me immense respect.” But, he continued, if an individual crossed a “line drawn with blood” while safeguarding their political interests, they had no right to “sit in this house”. The defence minister also said that “no voice is raised from Balochistan when Punjabis are shot after their identity cards are checked … I don’t believe in provincial discrimination, but I take strong exception [to Achakzai’s remark]”. He also moved a resolution, which paid tribute to the armed forces for their “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism. The resolution was adopted by the house, which reaffirmed its commitment that the sacrifices of the martyrs would not go in vain. The resolution underscored that the nation was standing firmly alongside the armed forces in the fight against terrorism. It further lauded the “professional capabilities, bravery and dedication” of the military, declaring full support for its continued efforts to safeguard national security, uphold stability and maintain peace across the country. Achakzai, who joined the NA proceedings midway through Asif’s speech, responded to the defence minister, saying that he stood by his words and would continue to speak against the “enemies of democracy”. “You have punished us for supporting democracy”, he remarked and raised the question that whether Parliament was supposed to “justify martial law”. The opposition leader also commented that relations with Afghanistan could not improve until “we stop deeming the neighbouring country as our fifth province”. PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan also spoke during the session, raising objection to his party being held responsible for terrorism in the country. “Terrorists are our enemies wherever they are”, he said. Gohar further criticised the government for “using the crutches of the establishment to rule the country”. Gohar also reminded the defence minister that he used to openly criticise the army in the past and alleged that his statement in the house was “an attempt to divide the nation”. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, however, contended that sharing data on the number of martyrs could not be termed an attempt to divide the nation. NA passes 6 bills During the session, the short of quorum NA also passed six bills amid an outcry from the opposition, with Speaker Sadiq refusing to order a count. Just 66 members were present in the house at the time of passage of the bills after rules were suspended to take those up for immediate consideration. The bills included the Pakistan Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2025, Cannabis Control and Regulatory Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2026, The Pakistan Names and Emblems (Prevention of Unauthorised Use) (Amendment) Bill, 2026, National Archives (Amendment) Bill, 2026, Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2026 and Islamabad Capital Territory Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2025.",

      "summary_orig": "National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Wednesday accepted the resignation of veteran politician Sardar Akhtar Mengal, chief of his faction of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M). Mengal, who was elected as an MNA from Khuzdar (NA-256) in the 2024 general elections, had submitted his resignation in September that year, citing the “prevailing situation in Balochistan”. “PML-N has at last accepted my resignation after dragging its feet long enough to expose its own fear,” Mengal said in a social media post, referring to the speaker’s party. “Was it the applause that unsettled you or the fact that I could draw crowds in Punjab’s core?” he asked, apparently referring to his participation in a charged discussion about Balochistan at the Asma Jahangir Conference held recently in Lahore. At the event, Mengal had criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined. He also expressed concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties. In his post on X, Mengal said he had “not withdrawn one rupee” since he tendered his resignation, adding that he had vacated Parliament Lodges 17 months ago. “For the record, not one rupee has been withdrawn since my resignation. Every amount remains in Parliament’s bank. The lodges were vacated 17 months ago and I have not resided there since. Adios!” In a separate post, he said, “My resignation was submitted on 3rd September 2024 by choice and with full conviction.” He said the decision was taken on principle, in response to the “unresolved grievances of Balochistan”. “Instead of addressing those grievances, the authorities chose to suppress the issue, once again demonstrating that this federation has no real space for a Baloch voice,” he said. “What is now public is not just my resignation, but the mindset of those in power toward Balochistan’s suffering and how my appearance in Lahore was enough to unsettle many egos. I stand by this decision,” he said. The senior politician had resigned over security tensions in Balochistan after the Aug 26, 2024 deadly attacks across the province and increased protests against enforced disappearances. Soon after the resignation was submitted, the government and the PTI beseeched Mengal to take back his resignation and continue to be a voice for Balochistan in the lower house of Parliament. In July 2025, the BNP-M chief was barred from travelling abroad , with immigration officials at the Quetta airport info­rming him that his name had been placed in the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL), a temporary travel ban to stop people from going abroad. Two months later, the Balochistan High Court had declared the travel ban illegal and directed authorities to immediately lift the restriction. ‘Marginalised and ignored’ In his resignation letter addressed to the NA speaker, Mengal had said the “prevailing situation in Balochistan has compelled me to take this step”. “Our province has consistently been marginalised and ignored by this House. Each day, we are pushed further against the wall, leaving us with no choice but to reconsider our roles. “The lack of genuine representation in this Assembly for the people of Balochistan has left voices like mine unable to bring meaningful change. “It has become increasingly clear that our attempts to speak or protest are met with hostility, our people are either silenced, labelled as traitors, or worse, killed,” Mengal wrote in his letter. “Under such circumstances, I find it impossible to continue in this capacity, as my presence here no longer serves any purpose for the people I represent,” Mengal wrote.",

      "summary_orig": "South Africa prevailed in a double Super Over thriller as Afghanistan came up agonisingly short of a famous victory after their T20 World Cup clash ended in a tie on Wednesday. Afghanistan were 187 all out after South Africa scored 187-6 in Ahmedabad. The teams were tied again after a breathless first Super Over saw them both score 17, before South Africa won off the final ball of a heart-thumping second sudden-death showdown. After South Africa bludgeoned 23 from their second super over and Afghanistan lost a wicket off the second ball of theirs, Rahmanullah Gurbaz was left needing four sixes off four balls for an unlikely victory. Gurbaz sensationally launched Keshav Maharaj into the crowd three times with some huge blows. A wide off the fifth ball meant Afghanistan still needed six to win but now a four would send it, incredibly, to a third Super Over. With nerves jangling and pulses racing, the left-arm spinner held his nerve to bowl a wide yorker that saw Gurbaz smack into the grateful hands of Davis Miller at point as he looked to hit a boundary. It was South Africa’s second win in as many matches in Group D to be placed second behind toppers New Zealand. A few minutes earlier, after Gurbaz scored a brilliant 42-ball 84 in the chase, Afghanistan had needed 13 off the last over of the match to win with one wicket in hand. After Kagiso Rabada bowled two no balls and a wide and Noor Ahmad hit a six, Afghanistan needed two to win off three balls. But Noor was run out going for the the winning second run with the scores level. In the match’s first innings, Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton hit blazing half-centuries after Afghanistan invited South Africa to bat first. South Africa lost an early wicket but de Kock, who hit 59, and Rickelton (61) got going in a partnership of 114 to take the attack to the opposition. Afghanistan bowlers pulled things back after the duo fell to star spinner Rashid Khan as South Africa fell short of what looked like a total of more than 200 at one stage. De Kock reached his fifty off 34 balls with a four off Mujeebur Rahman and two balls later fellow left-hander Rickelton struck a six to get to his half-century. The duo unleashed a flurry of fours and sixes, forcing Afghanistan to rotate their bowlers at the world’s biggest cricket stadium, which was largely empty. Leg-spinner Rashid hit back as he got the dangermen in the space of three balls with de Kock caught out at deep mid-wicket and Rickelton trapped lbw. The wickets slowed down South Africa’s run-scoring and Dewald Brevis fell in his attempt to accelerate after his 23 off 19 balls. David Miller hit an unbeaten 20 and Marco Jansen made 16 off seven balls to help the Proteas finish strong.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump has now raised the tally of aircraft shot down during the May 2025 conflict between Pakistan and India to 10. The latest remarks by the US president came during an interview with Fox Business , which was aired on Wednesday. The host was praising Trump’s “reciprocity policy” in trade and using tariffs for that when the US president chimed in: “And that’s being very nice and gentle. Look, I settled eight wars. Out of the eight wars, at least six were settled because of tariffs.” Trump then explained: “In other words, I said, ‘if you don’t settle this war, I’m gonna charge you tariffs because I don’t wanna see people getting killed.’ And they said, ‘no, what does this have to do with it?’ I said, ‘you’re gonna be charged.’” “Like India and Pakistan would’ve been a nuclear war in my opinion. They were really going at it. Ten planes were shot down. They were going at it,” he added. Over the past 10 months, the US president has stated numerous times that aircraft were shot down during the conflict — albeit without specifying whose. Initially stating that five jets were shot down, Trump gradually raised that number to seven in October , and then eight in November . @dawn.today US President Donald Trump said that a conflict between India and Pakistan “would have been a nuclear war” and suggested the two countries “were really going at it.” In remarks during an interview with Fox News, Trump claimed that “ten planes were shot down” during the confrontation and said he believed the situation could have escalated to nuclear conflict “without tariffs.” DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com During the interview, Trump quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as praising him for “saving at least 10 million lives when he got us to stop fighting”. “Because, see, they were going to nuclear, in my opinion. Without tariffs, that (ceasefire) wouldn’t have happened,” the US president asserted. He also recalled Armenia and Azerbaijan’s decades-long conflict , which saw tensions reduce when Trump brokered an initial peace agreement in August 2025. During the interview, Trump also termed “every single” US president during the last 50 years as “bad on trade”. “But I’m not bad on trade. I’m real good on trade,” he boasted. US ties with Pakistan, India During his Oval Office meeting with Trump in September 2025, PM Shehbaz had thanked the US president for his role in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in their four-day military conflict in May 2025. Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared in April 2025 when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was, without evidence, blamed on Islamabad, which strongly refuted the allegations. The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in May with the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries. He has also praised Chief of the Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on several occasions, calling him a “ highly respected general ”, a “ great fighter ” and “ my favourite ”. India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks. After what some saw as strained relations between the US and India after failed talks , Trump earlier this month announced a “ trade deal ” with New Delhi. Days later, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also made a three-day official visit to the US, where he held talks with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) office has removed a controversial map of India from its official X (formerly Twitter) account after Pakistan lodged a strong diplomatic protest over the depiction of internationally-recognised disputed territories as part of India, diplomatic sources told Dawn on Wednesday. The map, which accompanied a USTR press release announcing a framework for an interim US-India trade agreement, showed the entire Jammu and Kashmir region — including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan — within Indian boundaries. It also depicted China’s Aksai Chin region as part of India, despite the fact that the area is claimed by China and remains disputed . It was posted on the site on Friday evening, but had been removed by Monday evening, which was also the first working day after the weekend. Diplomatic sources said Pakistan conveyed its protest both to the US Embassy in Islamabad and to State Department officials in Washington, stressing that the map contradicted the long-standing and stated US position that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory whose final status must be determined in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. Officials familiar with the matter said the map appeared to have been taken from Google Maps, as was the case with a separate map used by the USTR in a press release on a trade deal with Bangladesh. The maps merely showed territorial outlines and did not name any specific areas. However, Pakistani officials pointed out that even an outline map, when issued by an official US government body, carries political and diplomatic weight — particularly on an issue as sensitive as Kashmir. The concern was heightened after Indian media outlets seized upon the map as evidence of an alleged shift in US policy, portraying it as an implicit endorsement of India’s claims over disputed territories. Pakistani officials said this narrative made it imperative for Islamabad to immediately remind Washington of its traditional and consistent position on Kashmir, and to ensure that no such misinterpretation gained traction. Although the USTR press release remains available on its website and social media platforms, the specific map of India has since been withdrawn. By contrast, the map attached to the USTR’s press release on a trade arrangement with Bangladesh remains online, reinforcing the view that the India map was posted mistakenly. The controversy emerged as Washington and New Delhi announced , over the weekend, a framework for the first phase of a bilateral trade agreement aimed at boosting two-way commerce. According to a joint statement, the US will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, having already removed an additional 25pc punitive duty. Reciprocal tariffs are also expected to be lowered to similar levels. Pakistani officials said the protest was unavoidable, particularly in light of India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, when New Delhi revoked the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir — a move Pakistan rejects as illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of international law. Islamabad maintains that any official depiction suggesting Indian sovereignty over the disputed region undermines the UN-recognised status of the territory and weakens international commitments to neutrality. The inclusion of Aksai Chin within Indian territory further compounded concerns, as it misrepresented another unresolved territorial dispute and ran counter to Washington’s stated position of not taking sides in conflicts between India and China. US officials have not publicly commented on the removal of the map. Pakistani diplomats say the episode highlights the need for constant vigilance, as even seemingly technical or symbolic representations by influential international actors can have serious diplomatic consequences on an issue as sensitive and consequential as Kashmir.",

It was posted on the site on Friday evening, but had been removed by Monday evening, which was also the first working day after the weekend. Diplomatic sources said Pakistan conveyed its protest both to the US Embassy in Islamabad and to State Department officials in Washington, stressing that the map contradicted the long-standing and stated US position that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory whose final status must be determined in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. Officials familiar with the matter said the map appeared to have been taken from Google Maps, as was the case with a separate map used by the USTR in a press release on a trade deal with Bangladesh. The maps merely showed territorial outlines and did not name any specific areas. However, Pakistani officials pointed out that even an outline map, when issued by an official US government body, carries political and diplomatic weight — particularly on an issue as sensitive as Kashmir. The concern was heightened after Indian media outlets seized upon the map as evidence of an alleged shift in US policy, portraying it as an implicit endorsement of India’s claims over disputed territories. Pakistani officials said this narrative made it imperative for Islamabad to immediately remind Washington of its traditional and consistent position on Kashmir, and to ensure that no such misinterpretation gained traction. Although the USTR press release remains available on its website and social media platforms, the specific map of India has since been withdrawn. By contrast, the map attached to the USTR’s press release on a trade arrangement with Bangladesh remains online, reinforcing the view that the India map was posted mistakenly. The controversy emerged as Washington and New Delhi announced , over the weekend, a framework for the first phase of a bilateral trade agreement aimed at boosting two-way commerce. According to a joint statement, the US will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, having already removed an additional 25pc punitive duty. Reciprocal tariffs are also expected to be lowered to similar levels. Pakistani officials said the protest was unavoidable, particularly in light of India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, when New Delhi revoked the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir — a move Pakistan rejects as illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of international law. Islamabad maintains that any official depiction suggesting Indian sovereignty over the disputed region undermines the UN-recognised status of the territory and weakens international commitments to neutrality. The inclusion of Aksai Chin within Indian territory further compounded concerns, as it misrepresented another unresolved territorial dispute and ran counter to Washington’s stated position of not taking sides in conflicts between India and China. US officials have not publicly commented on the removal of the map. Pakistani diplomats say the episode highlights the need for constant vigilance, as even seemingly technical or symbolic representations by influential international actors can have serious diplomatic consequences on an issue as sensitive and consequential as Kashmir.",

      "summary": "WASHINGTON: The United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) office has removed a controversial map of India from its official X (formerly Twitter) account after Pakistan lodged a strong diplomatic protest over the depiction of internationally-recognised disputed territories as part of India, diplomatic sources told Dawn on Wednesday.
