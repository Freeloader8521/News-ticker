      "summary_orig": "The United States early on Saturday launched a “large-scale strike” on Venezuela, with President Donald Trump announcing that US forces had captured the South American country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro and his wife. “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country,“ Trump said in a Truth Social post . Multiple explosions rocked Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, earlier in the day, and columns of black smoke and aircraft could be seen. Responding to the development in a video statement, Venezuela’s Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said the country would resist the presence of foreign troops. The strikes come after months of steadily mounting US military and economic pressure on Maduro and his country’s oil-export-dependent economy. Here is how the world is reacting to the development. View this post on Instagram All countries should uphold international law: UK British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Saturday that all countries should “uphold international law” after Trump’s announcement that he captured Maduro in a large-scale assault. Starmer also said that the UK was not involved in Saturday morning’s strikes. “I want to establish the facts first, I want to speak to President Trump, I want to speak to allies,” the UK leader said in brief comments aired on British television hours after the US attack. “I can be absolutely clear that we were not involved in that. And as you know, I always say and believe we should all uphold international law,” he added. China ‘deeply shocked’ A statement from the Chinese foreign ministry said that Beijing was “deeply shocked and strongly condemns the use of force by the US against a sovereign country and the use of force against the president of a country”. “China firmly opposes such hegemonic behaviour by the US, which seriously violates international law, violates Venezuela’s sovereignty, and threatens peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean,“ the Chinese foreign ministry added. “We urge the US to abide by international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and stop violating the sovereignty and security of other countries.” ‘Violation of territorial integrity’: Iran In a statement, the Iranian foreign ministry condemned the attack on Venezuela. It strongly condemned the “American military attack on Venezuela”, declaring it a “flagrant violation of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country“. Raid ‘violates principles of not resorting to force’: France French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot criticised the raid, stating it violates the principle of not resorting to force, which underpins international law. “France reiterates that no lasting political solution can be imposed from the outside and that only sovereign people themselves can decide their future,” the minister wrote on X. Mexico warns that military action ‘jeopardises regional stability’ Mexico’s government condemned the US strikes, saying that any form of military action “seriously jeopardises regional stability.” Mexico “strongly condemns and rejects the military actions carried out unilaterally in recent hours by the armed forces of the United States of America against targets on the territory of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. UN chief warns that raid sets ’dangerous precedent United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is deeply alarmed by US military action in Venezuela that sets “a dangerous precedent,” his spokesperson said ahead of a potential meeting of the UN Security Council. “These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” Guterres‘ spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement . “The Secretary-General continues to emphasise the importance of full respect — by all — of international law, including the UN Charter. He’s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected.” Colombia calls for de-escalation In a post on X, Colombian President Gustavo Petro reaffirmed his country’s “unrestricted commitment to the principles enshrined in the charter of the United Nations, in particular the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, the prohibition of the use or threat of use of force, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes”. “In this regard, the Colombian government rejects any unilateral military action that could aggravate the situation or put the civilian population at risk,” he wrote on the social media platform. Petro said that Colombia had adopted a position “oriented toward the preservation of regional peace” and called for de-escalation. He further called on all parties to refrain from actions that deepen the confrontation and to prioritise dialogue and diplomatic channels. “As a preventive measure, the national government has arranged measures to protect the civilian population, preserve stability on the Colombian-Venezuelan border, and promptly address any eventual humanitarian or migratory needs, in coordination with local authorities and competent organisations,” he added. ‘Criminal attack’: Cuba In a sharp condemnation, Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez denounced the “criminal attack by the US on Venezuela”. In a post on X, he called on the international community to react against the US strikes. “Our Zone De Paz (Zone of Peace) is being brutally assaulted,” he wrote, describing the US action as “state terrorism” against not only the Venezuelan people but also “our America”. Qatar calls for restraint and dialogue Qatar’s foreign ministry called for “restraint, de-escalation, and the adoption of dialogue” in a statement. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reaffirms the State of Qatar’s position advocating adherence to the Charter of the United Nations and the established principles of international law, including obligations under the Charter to resolve international disputes through peaceful means,” the statement read. The ministry further reaffirmed Qatar’s full readiness to contribute to any international efforts for an immediate peaceful solution and its commitment to keeping channels of communication open with all concerned parties. EU calls for restraint The European Union called for “restraint” and respect for international law after the strikes. “The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition,” the bloc’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote on X after speaking with her US counterpart, Marco Rubio. “Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint,” she wrote. European Council seeks ’peaceful, democratic and inclusive solution’ in Venezuela European Council President Antonio Costa stated that the EU has called for de-escalation in Venezuela and supports a peaceful, democratic solution to the issue. “I am following the situation in Venezuela with great concern. The European Union calls for de-escalation and a resolution in full respect of international law and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,” Costa wrote on X. “The European Union will continue to support a peaceful, democratic, and inclusive solution in Venezuela,” he added. EU’s Von der Leyen supports ‘peaceful, democratic’ transition “We stand by the people of Venezuela and support a peaceful and democratic transition. Any solution must respect international law and the UN Charter,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X, adding that she was “Following very closely [ sic ] the situation in Venezuela”. “With HR/VP (High Representative/Vice President) [Kaja Kallas] and in coordination with EU Member States, we are making sure that EU citizens in the country can count on our full support.” Spain offers to negotiate The Spanish foreign ministry offered in a statement to negotiate and help find a peaceful solution in Venezuela. It further called for de-escalation, moderation and respect for international law in the South American country. ‘Act of armed aggression’: Russia Russia expressed deep concern over the development and condemned what it described as an “act of armed aggression” against Venezuela committed by the United States, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “In the current situation, it is important … to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue,” it said. “We call for immediate clarification of this situation. Such actions, if they did indeed take place, constitute an unacceptable violation of the sovereignty of an independent state, respect for which is a key principle of international law,” the ministry said in a statement. ‘Great concern’: Germany Germany’s foreign ministry said it was watching the situation in Venezuela with great concern. A written communication obtained by Reuters said the ministry was in close contact with the embassy in Caracas, and a crisis team would meet later in the day. Italy monitoring situation in Venezuela Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome and its diplomatic representation in Caracas were monitoring any developments of the situation in Venezuela with particular attention to the Italian community in the country. Tajani said in a post on X that Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was being kept constantly informed and that the foreign ministry’s crisis unit was operational. Earlier, Italy’s Ambassador in Venezuela said that around 160,000 Italians currently live in the country, most of them with dual passports, as well as some who are there for reasons of work and tourism. ‘Services fully mobilised’: Belgium Belgium said it was coordinating with European partners in order to closely monitor the situation in Venezuela. “Our embassy in Bogot, which is responsible for Venezuela, and our services in Brussels are fully mobilised. The situation is being closely monitored, in coordination with our European partners,” Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Prevot said in a post on X. Indonesia emphasises importance of UN Charter Indonesia is also monitoring developments in Venezuela to ensure the safety of its citizens. “Indonesia also calls on all relevant parties to prioritise peaceful resolution through de-escalation and dialogue, while prioritising the protection of civilians,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Yvonne Mewengkang said. “Indonesia emphasises the importance of respecting international law and the principles of the UN Charter.” Hezbollah expresses solidarity with Caracas Lebanese armed faction Hezbollah issued a statement condemning the strikes and expressing solidarity with the Venezuelan presidency and government “Hezbollah condemns the terrorist aggression and American thuggery against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,” the statement read. “Hezbollah further affirms its full solidarity with Venezuela — its people, presidency, and government — in confronting this American aggression and arrogance.” Header image: Fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, is seen from a distance after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP",

Indonesia emphasises importance of UN Charter Indonesia is also monitoring developments in Venezuela to ensure the safety of its citizens. “Indonesia also calls on all relevant parties to prioritise peaceful resolution through de-escalation and dialogue, while prioritising the protection of civilians,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Yvonne Mewengkang said. “Indonesia emphasises the importance of respecting international law and the principles of the UN Charter.” Hezbollah expresses solidarity with Caracas Lebanese armed faction Hezbollah issued a statement condemning the strikes and expressing solidarity with the Venezuelan presidency and government “Hezbollah condemns the terrorist aggression and American thuggery against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,” the statement read. “Hezbollah further affirms its full solidarity with Venezuela — its people, presidency, and government — in confronting this American aggression and arrogance.” Header image: Fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, is seen from a distance after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP",

      "summary_orig": "Key Developments Trump says US forces have captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro after launching a “large-scale strike”; hails “brilliant” operation US president says Washington will govern Venezuela until transition takes place Maduro and his wife indicted on weapon and drug charges, US attorney general says Venezuelan defence minister calls for united front of resistance in the face of “the worst aggression” ever US State Dept deputy chief declares ‘new dawn’ for Venezuela Venezuela calls for emergency UN Security Council meeting following strikes US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Washington would govern Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition takes place” after the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a military operation on Saturday morning. American forces had captured Maduro and his wife early on Saturday morning after launching a “large-scale strike” on the South American country. Addressing a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump said, “No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved yesterday,” he said. “We don‘t want to be involved with having somebody else get in and we have the same situation that we had for the last, long period of years,” the US president said. “So we’re going to run the country, until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. We’re going to run it, essentially.” US President Donald Trump speaks to the press following US military actions in Venezuela, at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, the US on January 3. — AFP Trump added: “All Venezuelan military capacities were rendered powerless as the men and women of the US military, working with law enforcement, successfully captured Maduro in the dead of night.” Moreover, he said that the US military caused a blackout in Caracas to execute the operation to capture Maduro. “It was dark. The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have,” Trump said. He added that the US is ready to launch a second and much larger wave of attacks if needed, adding that Washington assumed a second wave would be necessary. “The first wave … was so successful we probably don‘t have to do a second, but we’re prepared to do a second wave, a much bigger wave,” Trump stated. Continuing his address, Trump said that Venezuela’s oil industry “was a bust” and that US oil companies would come in, repair the oil infrastructure and “start making money for the country”. However, Trump brushed aside Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader Maria Corina Machado as a potential interim leader of Venezuela, as he said Washington was working with the deposed Maduro’s vice president. “I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader. She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country,” Trump said. “She’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect.“ Moreover, both he and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested potential action against Cuba and Colombia. ‘Months of planning and rehearsal’ The US military operation to extract Maduro in a nighttime raid in Caracas took “months of planning and rehearsal” and more than 150 US aircraft were used, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine told reporters at Trump’s press conference. “The word integration does not explain the sheer complexity of such a mission, an extraction so precise — it involved more than 150 aircraft launching across the Western Hemisphere,” Gen Caine told a joint press conference with President Donald Trump. He added that Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, surrendered to US forces in Caracas before being extracted. “Maduro and his wife, both indicted, gave up and were taken into custody by the Department of Justice, assisted by our incredible US military with professionalism and precision, with no loss of US life,” Gen Caine said. In a Truth Social post earlier today, Trump wrote: “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country. “This operation was done in conjunction with US law enforcement,” the US president added. In an interview with Fox News , Trump said Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken to a ship after their capture by US forces and will be transported to New York. “They were indicted in New York and they will be taken to New York,” he said, stating that the Venezuelan president and his wife were aboard the USS Iwo Jima. The White House posted a photograph of Maduro aboard the vessel wearing a blindfold and ear defenders, which Trump also shared on Truth Social. In a brief phone interview with The New York Times , Trump hailed the “brilliant” operation. “A lot of good planning and a lot of great, great troops and great people,” the paper quoted Trump as saying. Venezuela has since demanded an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the US attacks. “Faced with the criminal aggression committed by the US government against our homeland, we have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which is responsible for upholding international law,” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil wrote on the Telegram messaging platform. It was unclear if the US would now stand back while other senior figures in Venezuela’s ruling party — like Vice President Delcy Rodriguez — fill the void or if there would be pressure for their ouster as well. ‘It was an amazing thing’: Trump Speaking on Fox News , Trump praised his team for the operation and described watching the operation as it took place. “I watched it like I was watching a television show,” he said. “If you had seen the speed and the violence … it was an amazing thing and an amazing job these people did.” Elaborating on watching the operation unfold, he said that it was an “extremely complex manoeuvre” and that multiple helicopters were employed. “We watched it and we watched every aspect of it,” Trump said. “I’ve never seen anything like this. It was amazing to see the professionalism, the quality of leadership.“ The US president did mention that there were “a few injuries on our side”, but noted that no American personnel were killed. Trump said that the operation was initially going to take place four days ago, but was delayed because of bad weather. “The weather has to be perfect and we had just the perfect weather,” he explained. He added that Maduro was in a “house that was more like a fortress” when US forces captured him. “We had nobody killed and we lost no aircraft. “We had to do it, it’s a war,” Trump emphasised. Moreover, he added that Maduro “wanted to negotiate at the end”, but Trump refused. “I told him ‘you have to give up, you have to surrender’,” Trump said, adding that he spoke with Maduro a week ago. Reacting to US lawmakers calling the strike “unjustified [and] illegal”, Trump said, “These are weak, stupid people and they’re trying to save themselves from almost destroying our country.” Next steps Asked about the next steps for Venezuela, Trump said, “We‘re making that decision now. We’ll be involved in it very much.” He added that the people of Venezuela were happy and that the US “wanted to do liberty for” them. “People have little loyalty, if any loyalty to him (Maduro),” Trump said. Trump further said that Washington will be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry. “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it,” he said. Speaking about Maduro loyalists remaining in Venezuela, Trump warned that anyone loyal to the Venezuelan president “is going to have a bad future”. When asked if the operation in Venezuela was a message to Mexico, Trump said “it wasn’t meant to be”, adding that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is not running the country, but the cartels are. “We have to do something … we lost 300,000 people … to drugs,” he claimed. “They come in through the southern border and something’s going to have to be done about Mexico.” Maduro indicted on drug, weapon charges In a post on X, US Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been charged in the Southern District of New York. The charges include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the United States. “They (Maduro and Flores) will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” she wrote. “On behalf of the entire US DOJ (Department of Justice), I would like to thank President Trump for having the courage to demand accountability on behalf of the American people, and a huge thank you to our brave military who conducted the incredible and highly successful mission to capture these two alleged international narco traffickers.” ‘New dawn, the tyrant is gone’ “A new dawn for Venezuela! The tyrant is gone. He will now — finally — face justice for his crimes,” US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said on X. US Senator Mike Lee said the country had completed its military action, quoting Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “He anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody,” Lee, a Republican initially critical of the operation, wrote on X after what he said was a telephone call with Rubio. Rubio, meanwhile, uploaded a screenshot of one of his old posts on X today, which claimed Maduro was not the president of Venezuela. The old post, dated July 27, 2025, reads: “Maduro is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is NOT the legitimate government. “Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States,” Rubio added. Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, situated in the south of Caracas, and Carlota airbase in the north, were among the targets of the strikes. Blasts were also heard in La Guaira, north of the capital, where Caracas’s airport and port are located. A US official said Maduro was captured by elite US special forces troops. Proof of life Earlier today, Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez said the government does not know the whereabouts of President Maduro or Flores, in an audio played on state TV. “We demand immediate proof of life of President Nicolas Maduro and the first combatant Cilia Flores,” Rodriguez said. Smoke rises near Fort Tiuna, after U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. has struck Venezuela and captured its President Nicolas Maduro, in Caracas, Venezuela, January 3, 2026. — Reuters Meanwhile, Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino López accused the United States of hitting residential areas. The “invading” US forces “have desecrated our soil, going so far as to strike, using missiles and rockets fired from their combat helicopters, residential areas populated by civilians,” Lopez said in a video statement shared on social media. He also said the South American country would launch a “massive deployment of all land, air, naval, riverine and missile capabilities … for comprehensive defence“. The defence minister called for a united front of resistance in the face of “the worst aggression” ever against Venezuela. Fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, is seen from a distance after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, meanwhile, said that the country “will overcome” the wave of US military strikes. Considered one of the most powerful men in Caracas, Cabello told a local television broadcast, “At the end of these attacks, we will overcome,” adding that “this is not our first battle against our people… we have managed to survive under all circumstances. The opposition, headed by Machado, had no immediate comment but has said for 18 months that it won the 2024 election and has a democratic right to take power. However, her whereabouts, after recently fleeing Venezuela in disguise to pick up her Nobel prize, were unknown. Separately, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he ordered the deployment of military forces to the Venezuelan border. Petro described Washington’s actions as an “assault on the sovereignty” of Latin America and said they would result in a humanitarian crisis. Petro made no mention of Maduro’s capture, despite the Venezuelan leader being one of his government’s closest allies in the region. Action in Venezuela recalls past US interventions While various Latin American governments oppose Maduro and say he stole the 2024 election, direct US action has revived painful memories of past interventions and is generally strongly opposed by governments and populations in the region. Washington has not made such a direct intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega. Trump‘s action recalls the ‘ Monroe Doctrine ’, laid out in 1823 by President James Monroe, laying the US claim to influence in the region, as well as the “gunboat diplomacy” seen under Theodore Roosevelt in the early 1900s. In his Mar-a-Lago press conference, Trump made reference to the Monroe Doctrine but said “We’ve superseded it … they call it the Donroe Doctrine”. Night view of Caracas taken after a series of explosions heard on January 3, 2026. — AFP In the early hours on Saturday, explosions rocked Caracas and elsewhere, prompting Maduro’s government to declare a national emergency and mobilise troops. It said attacks also took place in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira. Blasts, aircraft and black smoke could be seen across Caracas from about 2am local time (0600 GMT; 11am PKT) for roughly 90 minutes, according to Reuters witnesses and images circulating on social media. Residents expressed shock and fear as they captured video of billowing smoke and bright orange flashes in the sky. “My love, oh no, look at that,” said one woman in a video, gasping at blasts in the distance. Carmen Marquez, 50, a resident of the eastern part of the capital, said she went to her roof and could hear planes at different altitudes, though she could not see them. “Flare-like lights were crossing the sky and then explosions could be heard. We’re worried about what‘s coming next. We don’t know anything from the government, only what the state television says,” she said. Political backlash in the US? Trump’s stunning announcement follows months of steadily mounting US military and economic pressure on leftist leader Maduro and his country’s oil-export-dependent economy. The US president said in December, “it would be smart for [Maduro]” to step down“ and has also said that the Venezuelan leader’s “days are numbered”. It was unclear under what legal authority the latest US strikes were carried out. Legal experts have raised questions about the legality of attacks on suspected drug vessels in the region, which have killed more than 110 people so far. Trump‘s move risks drawing backlash from the US Congress, which has the constitutional right to declare war, and from his own political base, which favours an ‘America First policy’ and largely opposes military intervention abroad. MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said oil prices were likely to jump on the near-term risk to supply, but that the US strike could be bearish in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government results in sanctions being lifted and renewed foreign investment. Venezuelan state-run energy company PDVSA’s oil production and refining were normal and its most important facilities had suffered no damage according to an initial assessment, two sources with knowledge of the company’s operations said. Picture of fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP Trump’s claim of Maduro’s capture comes two days after Maduro attempted to engage with Trump, offering cooperation on fighting drug trafficking and illegal migration. The US has accused Maduro of running a “narco-state” and rigging an election. Trump had also repeatedly promised land operations in Venezuela. The Venezuelan leader, who succeeded Hugo Chavez to take power in 2013, has said Washington wants to take control of its oil reserves, the second-largest in the world.",

He added that the US is ready to launch a second and much larger wave of attacks if needed, adding that Washington assumed a second wave would be necessary. “The first wave … was so successful we probably don‘t have to do a second, but we’re prepared to do a second wave, a much bigger wave,” Trump stated. Continuing his address, Trump said that Venezuela’s oil industry “was a bust” and that US oil companies would come in, repair the oil infrastructure and “start making money for the country”. However, Trump brushed aside Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader Maria Corina Machado as a potential interim leader of Venezuela, as he said Washington was working with the deposed Maduro’s vice president. “I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader. She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country,” Trump said. “She’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect.“ Moreover, both he and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested potential action against Cuba and Colombia. ‘Months of planning and rehearsal’ The US military operation to extract Maduro in a nighttime raid in Caracas took “months of planning and rehearsal” and more than 150 US aircraft were used, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine told reporters at Trump’s press conference. “The word integration does not explain the sheer complexity of such a mission, an extraction so precise — it involved more than 150 aircraft launching across the Western Hemisphere,” Gen Caine told a joint press conference with President Donald Trump. He added that Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, surrendered to US forces in Caracas before being extracted. “Maduro and his wife, both indicted, gave up and were taken into custody by the Department of Justice, assisted by our incredible US military with professionalism and precision, with no loss of US life,” Gen Caine said. In a Truth Social post earlier today, Trump wrote: “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country. “This operation was done in conjunction with US law enforcement,” the US president added. In an interview with Fox News , Trump said Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken to a ship after their capture by US forces and will be transported to New York. “They were indicted in New York and they will be taken to New York,” he said, stating that the Venezuelan president and his wife were aboard the USS Iwo Jima. The White House posted a photograph of Maduro aboard the vessel wearing a blindfold and ear defenders, which Trump also shared on Truth Social. In a brief phone interview with The New York Times , Trump hailed the “brilliant” operation. “A lot of good planning and a lot of great, great troops and great people,” the paper quoted Trump as saying. Venezuela has since demanded an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the US attacks. “Faced with the criminal aggression committed by the US government against our homeland, we have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which is responsible for upholding international law,” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil wrote on the Telegram messaging platform. It was unclear if the US would now stand back while other senior figures in Venezuela’s ruling party — like Vice President Delcy Rodriguez — fill the void or if there would be pressure for their ouster as well. ‘It was an amazing thing’: Trump Speaking on Fox News , Trump praised his team for the operation and described watching the operation as it took place. “I watched it like I was watching a television show,” he said. “If you had seen the speed and the violence … it was an amazing thing and an amazing job these people did.” Elaborating on watching the operation unfold, he said that it was an “extremely complex manoeuvre” and that multiple helicopters were employed. “We watched it and we watched every aspect of it,” Trump said. “I’ve never seen anything like this. It was amazing to see the professionalism, the quality of leadership.“ The US president did mention that there were “a few injuries on our side”, but noted that no American personnel were killed. Trump said that the operation was initially going to take place four days ago, but was delayed because of bad weather. “The weather has to be perfect and we had just the perfect weather,” he explained. He added that Maduro was in a “house that was more like a fortress” when US forces captured him. “We had nobody killed and we lost no aircraft. “We had to do it, it’s a war,” Trump emphasised. Moreover, he added that Maduro “wanted to negotiate at the end”, but Trump refused. “I told him ‘you have to give up, you have to surrender’,” Trump said, adding that he spoke with Maduro a week ago. Reacting to US lawmakers calling the strike “unjustified [and] illegal”, Trump said, “These are weak, stupid people and they’re trying to save themselves from almost destroying our country.” Next steps Asked about the next steps for Venezuela, Trump said, “We‘re making that decision now. We’ll be involved in it very much.” He added that the people of Venezuela were happy and that the US “wanted to do liberty for” them. “People have little loyalty, if any loyalty to him (Maduro),” Trump said. Trump further said that Washington will be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry. “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it,” he said. Speaking about Maduro loyalists remaining in Venezuela, Trump warned that anyone loyal to the Venezuelan president “is going to have a bad future”. When asked if the operation in Venezuela was a message to Mexico, Trump said “it wasn’t meant to be”, adding that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is not running the country, but the cartels are. “We have to do something … we lost 300,000 people … to drugs,” he claimed. “They come in through the southern border and something’s going to have to be done about Mexico.” Maduro indicted on drug, weapon charges In a post on X, US Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been charged in the Southern District of New York. The charges include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the United States. “They (Maduro and Flores) will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” she wrote. “On behalf of the entire US DOJ (Department of Justice), I would like to thank President Trump for having the courage to demand accountability on behalf of the American people, and a huge thank you to our brave military who conducted the incredible and highly successful mission to capture these two alleged international narco traffickers.” ‘New dawn, the tyrant is gone’ “A new dawn for Venezuela! The tyrant is gone. He will now — finally — face justice for his crimes,” US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said on X. US Senator Mike Lee said the country had completed its military action, quoting Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “He anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody,” Lee, a Republican initially critical of the operation, wrote on X after what he said was a telephone call with Rubio. Rubio, meanwhile, uploaded a screenshot of one of his old posts on X today, which claimed Maduro was not the president of Venezuela. The old post, dated July 27, 2025, reads: “Maduro is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is NOT the legitimate government. “Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States,” Rubio added. Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, situated in the south of Caracas, and Carlota airbase in the north, were among the targets of the strikes. Blasts were also heard in La Guaira, north of the capital, where Caracas’s airport and port are located. A US official said Maduro was captured by elite US special forces troops. Proof of life Earlier today, Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez said the government does not know the whereabouts of President Maduro or Flores, in an audio played on state TV. “We demand immediate proof of life of President Nicolas Maduro and the first combatant Cilia Flores,” Rodriguez said. Smoke rises near Fort Tiuna, after U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. has struck Venezuela and captured its President Nicolas Maduro, in Caracas, Venezuela, January 3, 2026. — Reuters Meanwhile, Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino López accused the United States of hitting residential areas. The “invading” US forces “have desecrated our soil, going so far as to strike, using missiles and rockets fired from their combat helicopters, residential areas populated by civilians,” Lopez said in a video statement shared on social media. He also said the South American country would launch a “massive deployment of all land, air, naval, riverine and missile capabilities … for comprehensive defence“. The defence minister called for a united front of resistance in the face of “the worst aggression” ever against Venezuela. Fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, is seen from a distance after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, meanwhile, said that the country “will overcome” the wave of US military strikes. Considered one of the most powerful men in Caracas, Cabello told a local television broadcast, “At the end of these attacks, we will overcome,” adding that “this is not our first battle against our people… we have managed to survive under all circumstances. The opposition, headed by Machado, had no immediate comment but has said for 18 months that it won the 2024 election and has a democratic right to take power. However, her whereabouts, after recently fleeing Venezuela in disguise to pick up her Nobel prize, were unknown. Separately, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he ordered the deployment of military forces to the Venezuelan border. Petro described Washington’s actions as an “assault on the sovereignty” of Latin America and said they would result in a humanitarian crisis. Petro made no mention of Maduro’s capture, despite the Venezuelan leader being one of his government’s closest allies in the region. Action in Venezuela recalls past US interventions While various Latin American governments oppose Maduro and say he stole the 2024 election, direct US action has revived painful memories of past interventions and is generally strongly opposed by governments and populations in the region. Washington has not made such a direct intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega. Trump‘s action recalls the ‘ Monroe Doctrine ’, laid out in 1823 by President James Monroe, laying the US claim to influence in the region, as well as the “gunboat diplomacy” seen under Theodore Roosevelt in the early 1900s. In his Mar-a-Lago press conference, Trump made reference to the Monroe Doctrine but said “We’ve superseded it … they call it the Donroe Doctrine”. Night view of Caracas taken after a series of explosions heard on January 3, 2026. — AFP In the early hours on Saturday, explosions rocked Caracas and elsewhere, prompting Maduro’s government to declare a national emergency and mobilise troops. It said attacks also took place in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira. Blasts, aircraft and black smoke could be seen across Caracas from about 2am local time (0600 GMT; 11am PKT) for roughly 90 minutes, according to Reuters witnesses and images circulating on social media. Residents expressed shock and fear as they captured video of billowing smoke and bright orange flashes in the sky. “My love, oh no, look at that,” said one woman in a video, gasping at blasts in the distance. Carmen Marquez, 50, a resident of the eastern part of the capital, said she went to her roof and could hear planes at different altitudes, though she could not see them. “Flare-like lights were crossing the sky and then explosions could be heard. We’re worried about what‘s coming next. We don’t know anything from the government, only what the state television says,” she said. Political backlash in the US? Trump’s stunning announcement follows months of steadily mounting US military and economic pressure on leftist leader Maduro and his country’s oil-export-dependent economy. The US president said in December, “it would be smart for [Maduro]” to step down“ and has also said that the Venezuelan leader’s “days are numbered”. It was unclear under what legal authority the latest US strikes were carried out. Legal experts have raised questions about the legality of attacks on suspected drug vessels in the region, which have killed more than 110 people so far. Trump‘s move risks drawing backlash from the US Congress, which has the constitutional right to declare war, and from his own political base, which favours an ‘America First policy’ and largely opposes military intervention abroad. MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said oil prices were likely to jump on the near-term risk to supply, but that the US strike could be bearish in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government results in sanctions being lifted and renewed foreign investment. Venezuelan state-run energy company PDVSA’s oil production and refining were normal and its most important facilities had suffered no damage according to an initial assessment, two sources with knowledge of the company’s operations said. Picture of fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP Trump’s claim of Maduro’s capture comes two days after Maduro attempted to engage with Trump, offering cooperation on fighting drug trafficking and illegal migration. The US has accused Maduro of running a “narco-state” and rigging an election. Trump had also repeatedly promised land operations in Venezuela. The Venezuelan leader, who succeeded Hugo Chavez to take power in 2013, has said Washington wants to take control of its oil reserves, the second-largest in the world.",

      "title_orig": "Who is Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s president?",
      "summary_orig": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been in power for nearly 12 years, saw his rule come to a sudden end earlier today. After a lightning raid on Caracas, President Donald Trump said Maduro had been captured by US forces on Saturday. Trump, whose government has accused the Venezuelan president of running drug cartels and other crimes, had been pressuring the strongman to leave office for months. Maduro was born into a working-class family on November 23, 1962, the son of a trade union leader. He worked as a bus driver during the time army officer Hugo Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992. He campaigned for Chavez’s release from prison and became a fervent supporter of his leftist agenda. According to a BBC report, Maduro held a long and close association with Chavez, which dates back to Chavez’s imprisonment. Maduro won a seat in the legislature following Chavez’s 1998 election. In the years that followed, he rose to become president of the National Assembly and then foreign minister, travelling the globe to build international alliances through oil-financed assistance programs. Maduro, who likes to chug green juices at campaign events, citing their health properties, is heir to his late mentor. In 2012, Chávez named him as his hand-picked successor, and Maduro was narrowly elected president in 2013 following his death. During his tenure, his administration oversaw a spectacular economic collapse characterised by hyperinflation and chronic shortages. His rule became best known for allegedly rigged elections, food shortages and rights abuses, including harsh crackdowns on protests in 2014 and 2017. Millions of Venezuelans emigrated abroad. In 2016, following the release of years of economic data, Maduro declared a state of economic emergency, followed by a constitutional state of emergency, as per a report by CNN. According to a Reuters report from last year, the Venezuelan president has a flair for theatrics, and often calls opposition politicians “fascist demons” and “the surnames,” the latter a jibe at their supposedly wealthy backgrounds. Critics both at home and abroad say he is a dictator who has jailed or persecuted political opponents, repeatedly and unfairly blocking opposition candidates from participating in elections. It has been claimed that he deliberately misspeaks in English so as not to be seen as high-brow. As president, Maduro weathered many threats imagined and real – including a failed explosive-laden drone attack in 2018 that wounded several soldiers. To deflect blame for Venezuela’s political and economic woes, he kept up Chavez’s anti-American conspiracy theories, repeatedly accusing the United States of plotting to unseat him. While casting himself as the victim of an international plot, Maduro shuttered channels for political dissent, locking up dissidents and challengers with little regard for due process. In 2020, Maduro‘s government was subject to aggressive sanctions by the US and other powers as Washington indicted him on corruption and other charges. According to the US Department of State, an initial reward offer of up to $15 million was placed for Maduro’s capture, which was revised in August 2025 to $50m. Maduro has rejected the accusations. In January 2025, he was sworn in for a third term following a 2024 election that was widely condemned by international observers and the opposition as fraudulent. Thousands of people who protested the government’s declaration of victory were jailed. Last month, a UN Fact-Finding Mission found that the country’s Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) committed serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity over more than a decade in targeting political opponents, often with impunity. Maduro’s government’s repressive measures were also highlighted by the award of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: PPP Parliamentary Leader in the Senate Sherry Rehman on Saturday expressed grave concern over the continued silence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on violence carried out by Hindu radical groups against religious minorities, particularly Christians and Muslims. Just before December 25, mobs armed with wooden sticks vandalised Christmas decorations at a shopping mall in central India, while right-wing groups disrupted school celebrations and burned holiday merchandise in the northeast, according to Indian media. The incidents occurred in the states of Chhattisgarh, Assam, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh ahead of the holiday. “What stops Prime Minister Modi from condemning the actions of Hindu radicals who attack Christians — as we all do in Pakistan — from clearly stating that such violence is unacceptable in a civilised country?” Senator Rehman asked. “I think we know the answer, he is okay with impunity.” She underscored that leadership is ultimately tested by its willingness to confront extremism within its own support base. Silence, she warned, risks signalling tolerance for impunity and normalising hate-driven violence. Her remarks align with a piece published by The Wall Street Journal , which has documented a significant rise in violence against religious minorities in India since Prime Minister Modi took office in 2014. According to the article, groups aligned with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been implicated in attacks against Muslims and Christians, alongside systemic discrimination in employment, education, housing, and access to civic participation. According to the WSJ , India’s Muslim community — approximately 14 per cent of the population — has borne the brunt of the most severe attacks, facing widespread social exclusion and ghettoisation. Christians, who comprise just a meagre 2.3pc of the population and largely belong to economically marginalised communities, have also increasingly been targeted. WSJ noted that radical Hindu groups remain fixated on what they describe as the “threat” of Christian conversion, despite the Christian community’s small size and with 80pc of India’s population being Hindus. The paper further highlighted that at least 12 Indian states have enacted laws prohibiting religious conversion by “force, fraud, or allurement,” with “allurement” often interpreted so broadly that even peaceful evangelical activity is criminalised. Violence against Christians is frequently justified under the pretext of enforcing these laws. Senator Rehman emphasised that the protection of religious freedom and minority rights is not a regional or partisan issue but a universal democratic obligation. “Condemning extremism should never be selective,” she stated. “A civilised nation is defined not by the power of its majority, but by how it protects its most vulnerable citizens.” She asserted that a democratic country should unequivocally denounce hate-based violence, uphold constitutional protections for all faiths, and ensure accountability for those who incite or carry out attacks in the name of religion.",

      "summary_orig": "The US military attack on Caracas on Saturday — and reported capture of President Nicolas Maduro — caps years of tensions between Washington and Venezuela, which started in 2006 with US sanctions. 2006: First sanctions Relations between Washington and Venezuela plummet following the 1999 arrival in power of President Hugo Chavez, Latin America’s leftist firebrand. In 2006, the United States under President George W. Bush bans the sale of weapons and US-made military equipment to Venezuela, citing a lack of cooperation in the fight against terrorism. By 2010, the two countries no longer have ambassadors in each other’s capital. 2014: Accusations of human rights violations After Chavez dies in 2013 following a battle with cancer and his handpicked successor Nicolas Maduro takes over, the US administration of Barack Obama imposes in late 2014 and early 2015 sanctions on several top Venezuelan officials, freezing their US assets and banning visas. Washington accuses Venezuela of rights breaches in its violent crackdown on demonstrations against Maduro. 2017: Trump raises ‘military option’ The first administration of Donald Trump in 2017 slaps financial sanctions on several top officials, including members of the supreme court, for having undermined the powers of parliament. The legislative body had been under the control of the opposition since late 2015. After Maduro created a Constituent Assembly to override parliament, Washington imposes sanctions on him, freezing his assets in the United States. Trump for the first time speaks of a “military option” in Venezuela, a threat he would go on to repeat over the coming years. Washington bans the purchase of bonds issued by the Venezuelan government and by national oil company PDVSA. 2019: Sanctions toughened After Maduro’s re-election, which Washington and other capitals consider a sham, Trump in 2019 toughens economic sanctions with the aim of strangling the country and ousting Maduro. Caracas severs diplomatic relations after the United States, followed by dozens of other countries, recognises opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president. Guaido’s self-proclaimed government is dissolved in 2023. Washington also imposes sanctions on oil company PDVSA and Venezuela’s central bank. 2019: Oil embargo On April 28, 2019, Washington slaps an oil embargo on Venezuela. It then freezes all Venezuelan government assets in the United States. The oil embargo is slightly eased in 2023 to compensate for a shortfall of Russian crude after the invasion of Ukraine. It is reinstated when Washington says that Maduro is not meeting his commitment to hold a fair presidential election in 2024, with opposition leader Maria Corina Machado — a future Nobel Peace laureate — declared ineligible. At the beginning of his second term in early 2025, Trump puts a stop to the oil licences which allowed oil and gas multinationals to operate in Venezuela despite the sanctions. US company Chevron is allowed to operate anew in July, but is no longer allowed to give money to the Venezuelan government. 2020: Bounty for Maduro In 2020 Maduro, and several of his entourage are charged in the United States with “narco-terrorism” with Washington offering a reward of $15 million for any information leading to his arrest. In August 2025, it raises the reward to $50 million. Washington accuses Maduro of leading the so-called “Cartel of the Suns”, whose existence remains to be proved, according to experts. 2025: Airstrikes August 2025 signals the start of a massive US military build-up in the Caribbean, where Washington has since September been carrying out deadly airstrikes on boats it alleges are used by drug traffickers, accusing Caracas of being behind drugs flooding into the United States. On Wednesday, December 10 the United States says it had seized an oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast. Caracas accuses Washington of international piracy. Trump on December 29 says his forces hit and destroyed a docking area on Venezuela’s coast which he alleged was used by drug boats — the first known land strike in the US military campaign. 2026: Caracas attacked, Maduro grabbed On January 3, the US conducts a wave of airstrikes on and around Caracas and Trump declares that his military captured Maduro and his wife and flew them out of Venezuela. The Venezuelan government accuses the United States of an “extremely serious military aggression” and calls for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.",

      "summary_orig": "Venezuelan security forces patrolled largely empty streets at dawn in the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, hours after loud explosions woke residents to the news that US commandos had bombed the country and captured President Nicolas Maduro . Streets close to the Miraflores presidential palace were deserted except for checkpoints manned by uniformed gunmen, as residents expressed their shock at a US military strike that left them guessing who was now in charge of the oil-rich nation. Smoke streaked the sky, with a dark plume still billowing from the direction of the Port of La Guaira to the north, while another was visible near an air base in the capital. Most residents stayed home, devouring the latest information on their phones, while some went to stock up on groceries in case they need to hunker down for a prolonged period. For supporters of the opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado , excitement was also in the air. People ride a motorbike on an empty street, after US President Donald Trump said the US has struck Venezuela and captured its President Nicolas Maduro, in Caracas, Venezuela, January 3, 2026. —Reuters “My sister, who is in the United States, woke me up with the news; she was crying. We cried together out of happiness,” said Jairo Chacin, 39, a mechanic and workshop owner in oil hub Maracaibo, as he waited in a long line to stock up on groceries. “I went out to check on my business because I was afraid of looting, but the street is deserted. I wanted to fill up my gas tank, but the service stations are already closed, so I took the opportunity to buy food because we don’t know what’s coming. Honestly, I have a mix of fear and joy.” US President Donald Trump confirmed Maduro’s capture after months of pressuring him over accusations of drug-running and illegitimacy in power. It was the first such U.S. military intervention since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega . Soon after the capture of Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello appeared on state TV standing on the street and wearing a helmet and flak jacket, urging Venezuelans not to cooperate with the “terrorist enemy”. The Venezuelan opposition said in a statement on X that it had no official comment on the events. The overnight attack began at about 2am (0600 GMT), according to Reuters witnesses, who saw blasts, aircraft and black smoke across Caracas for roughly 90 minutes. Video verified by Reuters showed multiple explosions illuminating the night sky, followed by loud blasts. The attack left the southern area of the city, near a major military base, without electricity. “I couldn’t believe it. I saw it first on social media and then on television. Now, I want to know what will come next,” said Nancy Pérez, a 74-year-old woman who went out to a bakery near her home in Valencia, central Venezuela. People stand in an empty street in Caracas, Venezuela, January 3, 2026. —Reuters One eyewitness video, authenticated by Reuters, captured fire and smoke rising above the Port of La Guaira. The location was confirmed by the port layout, road dividers and buildings, which matched file and satellite imagery. Other verified videos captured explosions and smoke at the Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base in eastern Caracas. Flight radar trackers on Saturday morning showed the airspace over Venezuela was completely empty. Carmen Marquez, 50, who lives in the east of the capital, said she went to her roof and could hear planes at different altitudes, though she could not see them. “Flare-like lights were crossing the sky and then explosions could be heard. We’re worried about what’s coming next. We don’t know anything from the government, only what the state television says,” she said.",

      "summary_orig": "Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders have been told to release fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia said on Saturday, amid growing tensions between the countries. The development comes after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sangeet Som’s criticed Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise, calling Khan a traitor. Mustafizur’s selection to play for KKR had come amid allegations mostly by the Indian right-wing over attacks on Hindus. Last month, hundreds protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi after Hindu factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). A total of 12 people were arrested in connection with his death. “Due to recent developments going on all across, the BCCI has instructed the franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release one of their players, Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, from their squad,” Saikia told Indian news agency ANI . “They can ask for a replacement if needed. And upon request, BCCI will allow a replacement player.” “BCCI will allow Kolkata Knight Riders a replacement player in line with IPL regulations, and further details will be communicated in due course,” the team added in a statement. Reuters has approached Mustafizur for comment. Mustafizur, 30, has played for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals in previous seasons of the IPL, taking 65 wickets in 60 matches. He was signed by Kolkata in last month’s auction for a fee of 92 million Indian rupees ($1.02 million), making him the most expensive player from Bangladesh in IPL history. According to the Hindustan Times , opposition Congress party on Thursday condemned Som’s criticism of Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise. While calling Khan a “gaddar” (traitor), former Uttar Pradesh MLA Som questioned him for investing money in a player “from a country working against India”. The Hindustan Times quoted from a video clip of him as saying: “The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there. “Despite all this, traitors like Shahrukh Khan, I’m calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shahrukh that they will not succeed.” The incident worsened relations between India and its neighbour, with ties already strained after Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to New Delhi following protests against her in 2024. The 19th edition of the IPL begins on March 26, after India and Sri Lanka co-host the Twenty20 World Cup starting in February.",

In a statement , Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the development marked another significant milestone in the advancement of national aerospace and defence capabilities. “Taimoor air-launched cruise missile is capable of engaging enemy land and sea targets with high precision at a range of 600 kilometres, carrying a conventional warhead,” it said. “Equipped with state-of-the-art navigation and guidance system, Taimoor is designed to fly at very low altitudes, enabling it to effectively evade hostile air and missile defence systems,” it said. “Its precision-strike capability significantly enhances the conventional deterrence and operational flexibility of PAF, further strengthening the country’s overall defence posture,” it added. “The successful flight test underscores the technical maturity, innovation and self-reliance achieved by Pakistan’s defence industry. The launch was witnessed by senior officers of the Pakistan Armed Forces, along with distinguished scientists and engineers who played a pivotal role in the development of this advanced weapon system,” ISPR said. PAF Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu also extended congratulations to the scientists, engineers and PAF team on the achievement, the statement said. “He lauded their professional excellence, dedication and unwavering commitment to strengthening Pakistan’s defence capabilities,” it added. The air chief also reaffirmed that such accomplishments “are a testament to the nation’s resolve to achieve technological self-sufficiency and maintain a credible conventional deterrent in the evolving regional security environment”. “The successful test of the Taimoor weapon system reflects Pakistan Air Force’s continued pursuit of operational readiness, technological superiority and national security objectives,” he was quoted as saying. President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to PAF for the successful test. “The preparation of modern weapons at the local level is a clear reflection of national capability, resolve, and institutional expertise,” the president was quoted as saying. The president said that the success of the test has “further strengthened national defence and bolstered Pakistan’s responsible defence policy for ensuring stability in the region“. He lauded the “hard work, dedication, and spirit of national service of scientists, engineers, and the officers and personnel of the PAF”. He added that the achievement marked a “significant milestone in Pakistan’s journey toward self-reliance in the arena of national defence”. “The promotion of modern technology in the defence sector exhibited Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding its security and sovereignty,” the statement added.

Police and local residents said the attack on the police post, located in the hilly Kohi Sar area about 22 kilometres from Khar, the district headquarters, occurred at around 2am. Israr Khan, the spokesperson for the district police, told Dawn that the deceased was identified as 60-year-old Naseem Gul, a local resident. He added that the injured included two cops, 35-year-old Constable Suliman Khan and 58-year-old Constable Saz Muhammad, and 28-year-old Sahibzada, a school watchman. He said the injured were taken to the District Headquarter Hospital in Khar for treatment, where their condition was said to be stable. He said terrorists used both heavy and light weapons in the attack. The police spokesperson said that soon after the attack, a joint team comprising security forces and police reached the area and launched a clearance operation. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year. This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday rejected the “irresponsible assertions” made by Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar, saying that New Delhi was again seeking to “deflect attention from its own troubling record as a neighbour that promotes terrorism and contributes to regional instability”. Although the FO statement did not make a specific mention of the remarks by the Indian minister, its rebuke came after Indian media reported Jaishankar as saying on Friday that New Delhi had a right to defend itself against terrorism while talking about “bad neighbours”. “You can also have bad neighbours … unfortunately, we do. When you have bad neighbours … if you look to the one to the West — if a country decides that they will deliberately, persistently, unrepentantly continue with terrorism, we have a right to defend our people against terrorism,” he was quoted as saying by The Hindu . He also spoke about the Indus Water Treaty (IWT), which has been a major bone of contention between the two countries following an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22 blamed by India on Pakistan without evidence, saying: “Many years ago we agreed to a water-sharing arrangement — the belief was it was gesture of goodwill — because of good neighbourliness we were doing it … but if you have decades of terrorism there is no good neighbourliness and you don’t get the benefit of good neighbourliness.” “You can’t say … Please share water with me but I will continue terrorism – that’s not reconcilable,” he was quoted as saying by the publication. In a statement issued on Saturday, the FO said, “Pakistan firmly rejects the irresponsible assertions made by the Indian external affairs minister. Once again, India seeks to deflect attention from its own troubling record as a neighbour that promotes terrorism and contributes to regional instability.” The FO said that India’s “documented involvement in promoting terrorist activities in the region, particularly in Pakistan, is well known”. “The case of Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav remains a stark example of organised, state-sponsored terrorism directed against Pakistan,” it added. Jadhav was captured in Balochistan in March 2016 and later confessed to his association with the Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing and his involvement in espionage and terrorism in Pakistan. He remains imprisoned in Pakistan. “Equally concerning are recurring instances of extraterritorial killings, sabotage through proxies, and covert support to terrorist networks. This pattern is consistent with the extremist ideology of Hindutva and its violent proponents,” the FO said. “India continues its illegal and violent military occupation of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to extend full political, moral, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their just struggle to realise their right to self-determination, as enshrined in relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” the statement added. On the topic of the IWT, the FO said that it was an international agreement “concluded in good faith and at considerable cost”. “Any unilateral violation of the treaty by India would undermine regional stability and call into question its credibility as a state that claims to respect international legal obligations. Pakistan will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights under the treaty,” it added. The development comes after National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka on Wednesday during the funeral of the country’s former premier Khaleda Zia, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: A fresh round of diplomatic talks on the formation of a proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza is expected to be held in a Middle Eastern capital in the coming days, diplomatic sources told Dawn as Muslim countries, including Pakistan, continue to press for clarity on the force’s mandate, operational scope, and political objectives. The ISF, a central element of a US-brokered Gaza peace plan , is envisioned to stabilise the territory following over two years of Israeli atrocities in the Gaza Strip, protect civilians and humanitarian corridors, and assist in establishing transitional governance through a proposed “Board of Peace”. However, several core issues remain unresolved, including the force’s legal authority, chain of command, funding, duration, and whether it would play a role in disarming Hamas or other Palestinian groups. Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other states have expressed willingness to participate in a stabilisation effort that genuinely restores order and facilitates humanitarian access. “They are prepared to join any credible international force that brings stability to Gaza,” a diplomatic source said. “But they will not be part of a mission whose primary focus is disarming Palestinian resistance groups.” Hamas has rejected the idea of an international force tasked with disarmament, warning that such a deployment would be considered a party to the conflict rather than a neutral stabilising presence. This stance complicates efforts to secure broad regional participation and raises concerns about the safety and legitimacy of any deployed troops. Last month, Reuters reported that international troops could be deployed in the Gaza Strip as early as 2026 to form a UN-authorised stabilisation force. US signals gratitude, Pakistan remains cautious Three weeks ago, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Pakistan’s willingness to consider particpating as “key” to the initiative and expressed gratitude for Islamabad’s engagement. Pakistani officials, however, emphasise that no final decision has been taken yet, and that Islamabad has neither committed troops nor received a formal request. In December 2025, Pakistan also attended a US Central Command–hosted conference in Qatar, with representatives from nearly 45 countries, where the operational framework of the ISF was discussed. Reports suggesting Pakistan might deploy up to 3,500 troops remain speculative. Diplomatic sources stressed that any troop commitment would depend on a mandate that is fully transparent, politically neutral, and focused on humanitarian stabilisation rather than disarmament or law enforcement inside Gaza. ‘2025 saw positive trends in Pak-US ties’ Meanwhile, in a press briefing at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington on Friday, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh framed discussions on the ISF alongside broader Pak–US relations. He said that 2025 had been a year of positive trends in bilateral ties and that 2026 would be a year where concrete results were expected. “The opportunities are positive and clear but 2026 will be a critical year for translating these possibilities into practical outcomes across every sector of our bilateral partnership,” he said. The ambassador highlighted economic cooperation in minerals, energy, information technology, health, education, and counterterrorism as areas of particular promise. Ambassador Sheikh also emphasised Pakistan’s competitive advantages, noting that the country’s production costs were lower than China’s. He drew attention to the skills of Pakistan’s youth, particularly in technology and English-language proficiency, which have earned global recognition. Highlighting trade relations, he said Pakistan’s goods trade with the US rose 16.3pc in 2025, exports increased by 11.5pc, and services trade grew by 39.7pc. Remittances from the US also rose by 5.4pc. He stressed that while these achievements were commendable, sustained effort and institutional coordination would be required to translate potential into tangible results. “Our partnership with the US is not just a matter of choice or convenience; it is a strategic necessity rooted in geography, economics, population, and shared interests,” the ambassador said. Strategic and operational considerations The ISF discussions, combined with Pakistan’s broader engagement with Washington, reflect the delicate balancing act Islamabad faces: supporting humanitarian stabilisation in Gaza while safeguarding Pakistan’s principles on Palestinian sovereignty. Analysts say that unless a mandate acceptable to all stakeholders is clearly defined, the force may struggle to attract broad participation and could encounter operational and political obstacles on the ground. Experts also note that the involvement of countries like Pakistan is politically significant. Islamabad has traditionally played a mediating role in Middle Eastern conflicts, balancing ties with Arab states, the US and the broader Muslim world. Any misstep in defining the ISF’s role could complicate Pakistan’s regional diplomacy, affect its credibility with partners in the Gulf, and influence its perception among Palestinians. The coming meetings will be closely watched by both regional actors and Washington, as they may determine the pace at which the ISF is deployed. While humanitarian objectives remain central, the debates over mandate, command, and responsibilities illustrate the inherent complexity of deploying a multinational stabilisation force in a highly contested environment. Israel has banned 37 foreign humanitarian organizations from accessing the Gaza Strip after they had refused to share lists of their Palestinian employees with government officials, a move that the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said will “further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians”. It is worth mentioning that eight Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, have expressed concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, saying that severe winter weather has further worsened conditions and stressing the need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts. In a joint statement, Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates — which had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza — have demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs can operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip.

Israel has banned 37 foreign humanitarian organizations from accessing the Gaza Strip after they had refused to share lists of their Palestinian employees with government officials, a move that the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said will “further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians”. It is worth mentioning that eight Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, have expressed concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, saying that severe winter weather has further worsened conditions and stressing the need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts. In a joint statement, Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates — which had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza — have demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs can operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip.

      "summary_orig": "Australian police said they would bolster staffing at the Sydney Cricket Ground for the fifth Ashes Test starting on Sunday, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city. The father-and-son gunmen are alleged to have carried out the attack at a Hanukkah event at the famed Bondi Beach on December 14. Australia’s worst mass shooting in almost three decades shocked the nation and stoked fears of rising antisemitism in the country. The massacre has sparked more active policing in Sydney, Australia’s most populous city and the capital of New South Wales state. Authorities on Saturday announced a “high-visibility” police presence for the marquee cricket series between Australia and England, which is held every two years. Measures at the cricket ground, some 5km from Bondi Beach, would include the riot patrol unit, officers on horseback and officers carrying rifles. “The difference will be in the visibility of long arms and a stronger presence,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said in a statement . Police said they expected a capacity crowd for day one of the fixture, the final encounter in the five-match series already claimed by Australia. “Many people may not be used to seeing police carrying rifles at sporting events, but our objective here is to help the public feel safe,” Lanyon said. Cricket Australia said first responders to the attack and “community members who bravely acted” would be honoured before the start of play on Sunday. There will be a guard of honour on the field and a round of applause for “emergency response agencies and members of the community in the face of extreme danger”, the governing body said in a statement. On Wednesday, around 3,000 police, some carrying long arms, were deployed in the city during New Year celebrations, which typically attract over a million revellers. Several New Year events planned at Bondi were cancelled, while traditional Christmas celebrations there were muted, following the attack that authorities believe was inspired by Sunni Muslim militant group Islamic State.",

      "summary_orig": "With the political impasse continuing among the country’s main stakeholders, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said on Friday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had not imposed any “minus Imran” condition on political engagement. A day earlier, the premier’s adviser had proposed “ confidence-building measures ” between the leadership of the PML-N, the PTI, and the PPP could bring down political temperatures. “Prime Minister Shehbaz has not set any condition of minus Imran Khan [from politics]. We neither seek to minus anyone nor consider it politically viable. Similar efforts were made to sideline us in the past,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan. As the leader of the House, PM Shehbaz has offered negotiations to the opposition, saying they [PTI] should sit with him as dialogue is key to parliamentary democracy, Sanaullah added. Maintaining that the opposition PTI had to take a step forward, the senior PML-N leader said that dialogue on behalf of the president, the PML-N supremo and the establishment was the premier’s “responsibility”. “The PM has invited the opposition to meet in the National Assembly chamber if they do not want to visit [his office],” he added. When asked about the statement he made a day earlier, Sanaullah said the prime minister must have taken Nawaz Sharif, President Asif Ali Zardari and the establishment in to confidence before extending the offer of dialogue to the opposition. Sanaullah added that despite efforts by Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) and PTI’s second- and third-tier leadership to initiate talks, nothing could materialise unless “Imran Khan’s policy changes in favour of dialogue”. The PM’s adviser noted that the PTI founder had not authorised anyone to hold negotiations, adding that his message, conveyed by his sister Aleema Khan, was that “anyone who talks about negotiations is not among us”. “He sent a message of street agitation and a wheel-jam strike, and also asked Sohail Afridi to visit Punjab, Balochistan and Sindh for mobilisation,” he said, reiterating that Imran was the sole “hindrance” in negotiations. Earlier in December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence. The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.",
