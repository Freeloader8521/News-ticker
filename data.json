      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday said that the PTI’s provincial government would participate in the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting on December 4 and “fight the case for our province and its people” in the best possible manner. The 11th NFC was constituted on Aug 22 to finalise a new award for sharing federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces. The first meeting was originally scheduled for Aug 27, then delayed to Aug 29 for unspecified reasons. This, too, was postponed on the request of the Sindh government due to flood-related engagements. The session was later rescheduled for Nov 17, then Nov 18, and again deferred at the desire of the Prime Minister’s Office. Earlier this week, CM Afridi said that the federal government still owed Rs1.3 trillion under the NFC framework to the province. Addressing a press conference in Peshawar today, the CM said that the erstwhile tribal areas were merged with KP administratively in 2018, but they were yet to be financially integrated. The NFC share for the merged districts had not been paid to KP since 2018, he added, deeming it “constitutional violation”. He further said that the federal government should consider the provincial government’s suggestions for maintaining lasting peace in the province, adding that “decisions taken behind closed doors” adversely affected KP. “If the federal government implements our suggestions, it will be our responsibility to carry out decisions and maintain the law and order situation,” CM Afridi said. “The provincial government wants all stakeholders to be taken on board about any decision regarding peace in the province.” The chief minister alleged that the “powers-that-be” had always conspired to push the PTI into conflict, but emphasised that the party would remain peaceful, adding that it “will, however, never hesitate to offer sacrifices”. “Persistent efforts have been made to isolate the PTI and peaceful protesters were shot at,” CM Afridi said, claiming that founder PTI Imran Khan was being kept in isolation and all visitors, including his sisters, were being denied a meeting with the incarcerated ex-premier. The chief minister said the PTI had decided that all parliamentarians would peacefully protest outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday. They would also accompany Imran’s sisters to the Adiala jail, and the provincial government would follow directions issued by party leadership. “All the parliamentarians, including provincial and national assembly members, along with senators, will protest outside the IHC over delayed case hearings. They will all then move towards Adiala, accompanying Imran Khan’s sisters,” CM Afridi told reporters. The CM said that after reports by the international media about the PTI founder’s health, he went to the Adiala jail to meet Imran on November 27, but was refused an audience, even after spending the entire night outside the prison in a sit-in protest. He said that he decided to hold a sit-in outside the Adiala jail because his party was being mistreated. He also claimed that while some chief ministers were “faciliatated and offered Pakistan Air Force jets”, his name was added to the passport control list. Fielding questions, the chief minister said “no part of KP is under the control of the militants”. However, without naming anyone, CM Afridi alleged “the entire country is being controlled by one person”. While responding to another question, the chief minister said his family owned property in Tirah but denied owning any himself, adding that a recent documentary against him was an attempt to divert public attention, but people never believed those who shared the documentary. “People know everything. They know who is lying, and we want them to do their job, and only then, the country will develop,” the chief minister said.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed at least three terrorists on Sunday in retaliatory action after one of the attackers blew himself up at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Balochistan’s Nokkundi, according to a statement issued by the spokesperson for FC Balochistan South. The FC spokesperson’s statement said terrorists from Fitna-al-Khawarij “attempted the attack”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The statement by the FC spokesperson said one of the “suicide attackers” blew himself up at the headquarters’ main gate, following which quick response force personnel retaliated and killed three terrorists. It added that security forces were carrying out a clearance operation and the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with soon. Reports said at least six armed attackers had entered the headquarters after one of the terrorists blew himself up at the entrance. According to last reports received after midnight, the clearance operation was under way at the site until then. Meanwhile, there was no confirmation of any more casualties. While the operation in Nokkundi was under way, a checkpost in the Gurmakan area of Panjgur district also reportedly came under attack. Pakistan has witnessed an increase in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended a ceasefire with the government in November 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, it had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. On Saturday, seven blasts rocked Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali in Balochistan, with one explosion blowing up a section of railway track near the provincial capital and suspending train traffic to other parts of the country. The first blast occurred near a police checkpost on Quetta’s Qambrani Road, where unidentified atta­ckers hurled a grenade. Police said the second blast took place shortly afterwards on the same road, when armed men detonated a motorcycle carrying an improvised explosive device (IED) as a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) vehicle passed by, carrying bomb disposal squad personnel to the site of the first explosion. “Miscreants planted an IED on the motorbike and detonated it with a remote control when the CTD vehicle was passing through the area,” Senior Superintendent of Police (Operations) Capt (retd) Asif Khan told Dawn , adding that the CTD vehicle escaped the blast and no casualties were reported in either attack. SSP Khan said two more explosions were reported in the evening. “One blast took place on the railway track near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, which blew up the main line connecting Quetta with other parts of the country.” In another incident, unidentified motorcyclists hurled a grenade at the city’s Manzoor Shaheed Police Station, but the device failed to explode. A bomb disposal squad later defused it. Later, unidentified attackers hurled another grenade in the Kechi Beg area at a police patrol. The grenade exploded, but no casualties were reported. Meanwhile, armed men also targeted a police vehicle at DC Chowk in Dera Murad Jamali by throwing a grenade. The device did not explode and was defused by the bomb disposal squad. In yet another incident late on Saturday night, unidentified armed men attacked the camp of a construction company in Quetta’s Sariab area.",

      "summary_en": "Security forces killed at least three terrorists on Sunday in retaliatory action after one of the attackers blew himself up at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Balochistan’s Nokkundi, according to a statement issued by the spokesperson for FC Balochistan South. The FC spokesperson’s statement said terrorists from Fitna-al-Khawarij “attempted the attack”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The statement by the FC spokesperson said one of the “suicide attackers” blew himself up at the headquarters’ main gate, following which quick response force personnel retaliated and killed three terrorists. It added that security forces were carrying out a clearance operation and the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with soon. Reports said at least six armed attackers had entered the headquarters after one of the terrorists blew himself up at the entrance. According to last reports received after midnight, the clearance operation was under way at the site until then. Meanwhile, there was no confirmation of any more casualties. While the operation in Nokkundi was under way, a checkpost in the Gurmakan area of Panjgur district also reportedly came under attack. Pakistan has witnessed an increase in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended a ceasefire with the government in November 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, it had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.

      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Sunday slammed the sisters of PTI founder Imran Khan for giving interviews to the Indian media while one of ex-premier’s sisters, Noreen Niazi, criticised the PML-N for having “double standards”. Last week, Imran’s sisters had camped outside Adiala Jail, where the PTI founder is currently incarcerated , along with other PTI members after being denied a meeting. According to the PTI, Aleema Khan, Dr Uzma Khan and Noreen were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when they were manhandled and “violently detained” by police. After repeatedly being barred from meeting their brother, Noreen and another sister of Imran, Aleema Khan, gave separate interviews to the Indian media on the matter. “These three sisters of Imran Ahmed Niazi sahib , on May 9 they were also present at the Core Commander’s House,” he said, but added that until now they had not been told not to “cry victimisation”. “If you ask my legal opinion, their presence is proof … They were there on May 9, they brought groups there and it is visible in the cameras that all three are present there,” Tarar said. “The drama being made today — there is a reason for that.” He said that the foreign policy success after Marka-i- Haq was not being digested well by the PTI. “In their era the economy had dipped; it is (now) moving towards an economy of stability. They are not able to digest this.” “Why are these sisters going on Indian channels and Afghanistan’s channels and crying for their brother?” Tarar stressed. “In the interview that Noreen Khan Niazi gave to an Indian channel, did she say that she condemns Modi? Those innocent children that were martyred, did she talk about Irtaza Abbas? Did she talk about those citizens that were martyred in Muridke and Bahawalpur? Did she talk about those soldiers and young officers who were martyred? Did she pay tribute to them?” He slammed the sisters’ actions, saying: “Those who go on Indian channels and defame Pakistan should be ashamed of themselves.” He added that Indian channels were providing their platform because they knew that “this family, and this party’s mindset is against Pakistan”. He further slammed Noreen for not condemning the Hindutva ideology on the Indian channel, the cruelty against Muslims in India, or talking about the issue of India-occupied Kashmir. “Shame on you!” the minister said with emphasis. “That you go on Indian channels and don’t talk about occupied Kashmir, Marka-i-Haq, martyrs, and you go and cry about victimisation about a prisoner who is involved in a corruption case?” He said that the family was building “hype” in foreign media about the danger to Imran’s health, saying, “Let me assure you: he’s hale and hearty. There’s no issue. He runs every day on a treadmill for an hour. “This kind of privileged prisoner — this kind of VVIP prisoner who enjoys five-star hotel facilities — you will not find anywhere in the world,” he said. He added, “If only, Noreen Khan sahiba , you had gone there and talked about your martyred, about that child Irtiza Abbas. About the victory in Marka-i-Haq … if only you had paid tribute to your prime minister and chief of army staff, and condemned Modi … but for you, politics is important, defaming Pakistan is important, and personal matters are important.” Noreen Niazi rebukes PML-N Meanwhile, Noreen Khan criticised the ruling party, PML-N, for what she called “double standards”. “PML-N’s double standards are staggering. They attack me for giving an interview to Indian media, yet Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister, has himself used Indian platforms to malign Pakistan’s own military leadership,” she alleged , adding that today, “he and his family sit comfortably in power on the back of a blatantly manipulated mandate”. “His brother, his daughter, and his party enjoy the perks of authority while lecturing others on ‘principles’.” She further alleged that “elements aligned with this same power structure shamelessly doctored portions of my interview using AI, a deliberate attempt to distort my words and mislead public opinion. “These are the same actors who have kept Imran Khan in unlawful, inhumane isolation for four weeks cut off from family, lawyers, and basic rights,” she continued her accusation, adding: “I have never held public office. My only purpose in speaking publicly is to expose the injustice of my brother’s imprisonment and to urge the human rights organisations and judiciary to recognise the systematic denial of his legal, political, and humanitarian rights.” ‘Political-terror-crime nexus’ Tarar also accused Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and his team of having “ties with enemies of the state”, saying it was now “out in the open”. “Over 4,000 cases have been registered regarding the infiltration of terrorists, who are sheltered [in KP’s] areas, in three years. But, the rate of punishment is nonexistent,” he alleged. “This prosecution system is under the provincial government, which is supposed to bring in legal reforms and make it stronger.” The minister said the KP government had been “unable to form a system to prosecute terrorists in its 12-and-a-half years in power”. Continuing his accusations, he said: “The border is being guarded, but due to the weaknesses and failures of the district administration and provincial govt, infiltration has increased.” Moreover, “there is a political-terror-crime nexus. The CM and his people are involved in drug trade in KP, they maintain close ties with drug lords”, Tarar alleged. “Within 12-and-a-half years, whose responsibility was it to stop drug money being used to finance terrorism?” He claimed that the KP government’s performance was “negligible because of the political-terror-crime nexus”, under which “drug smuggling is promoted and drug money is used”. “They (KP government) don’t punish terrorists, and of the over 10,000 cases of drug trafficking from January-August 2025, only 679 cases have been decided,” Tarar added. “If the KP government knows of such a large drug cartel operating in its territory and cannot take action against it, that means there is a political-terror-crime nexus,” he reiterated the accusation. Tarar further alleged that “terrorists attack state institutions but not those involved in KP’s drug trade, because doing so, they’d lose their source of financing”.",

      "summary_orig": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked the country’s president on Sunday for a pardon in his long-running corruption trial, arguing that criminal proceedings were hindering his ability to govern and a pardon would be good for Israel. Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, denies the bribery, fraud, and breach of trust charges. His lawyers said in a letter to the president’s office that the prime minister still believes the legal proceedings would result in a complete acquittal. “My lawyers sent a request for pardon to the president of the country today. I expect that anyone who wishes for the good of the country [will] support this step,” Netanyahu said in a brief video statement released by his political party, the Likud. Neither the prime minister, who has been on trial for five years, nor his lawyers made any admission of guilt. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Netanyahu should not be pardoned without admitting guilt, expressing remorse, and immediately retiring from political life. Pardons in Israel have typically been granted only after legal proceedings have concluded and the accused has been convicted. Netanyahu’s lawyers argued that the president can intervene when public interest is at stake, as in this case, with a view to healing divisions and strengthening national unity. Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s office described the request as “extraordinary” with “significant implications”. The president “will responsibly and sincerely consider the request” after receiving relevant opinions, his office said. US President Donald Trump wrote to Herzog this month, urging him to consider granting the prime minister a pardon, saying the case against him was “a political, unjustified prosecution”. Herzog’s office said the request would be forwarded to the pardons department in the justice ministry, as is standard practice, to collect opinions, which would be submitted to the president’s legal adviser, who will formulate a recommendation for the president. Israel’s Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, is a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party and a close ally of the prime minister. In the letter, Netanyahu’s lawyers argued that criminal proceedings against him had deepened societal divisions and that ending the trial was necessary for national reconciliation. They also wrote that increasingly frequent court hearings were burdensome while the prime minister was attempting to govern. “I am required to testify three times a week … that is an impossible demand that is not made of any other citizen,” Netanyahu said in the video statement, emphasising that he had received the public’s trust by repeatedly winning elections. Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three separate but related cases that centre around accusations that he granted favours to prominent business figures in exchange for gifts and sympathetic media coverage. The prime minister has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Coalition allies issued statements supporting Netanyahu’s request for a pardon, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Opposition politician Yair Golan , a former deputy chief of the military, called on the prime minister to resign, urging the president not to grant a pardon. Netanyahu is one of the country’s most polarising political figures, who was first elected prime minister in 1996. He has since served in government and opposition and returned to the prime minister’s office following the 2022 election. The next election is due by October 2026, and many polls indicate that his coalition, the most right-wing in Israel’s history, would struggle to win enough seats to form a government. Throughout his career, Netanyahu has cultivated a reputation for prioritising security and economic issues, but he has also been dogged by corruption charges. He was prime minister on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel. Since then, he has overseen the devastating war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and levelled much of the territory, drawing broad international criticism and condemnation. Israel has severely weakened Hamas and Hezbollah, and this year launched a war against Iran that destroyed critical military infrastructure.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Sunday expressed concerns about Israel’s commitment to peace in Gaza, saying that Muslim countries that had supported the peace treaty may need to “reassess their stance” in the face of continued violations of the fragile ceasefire in the region. Despite the declaration of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on October 9, Israel has continued to bombard the territory while a long-term plan for peace is discussed. The defence minister posted today on social media platform X that the ceasefire agreement had been criticised for being one-sided and that Israeli forces “continue to violate the truce, killing Palestinians including children”. “The agreement, signed in Sharm el-Sheikh, was meant to bring stability to the region, but Israel’s actions have raised concerns about its commitment to the deal,” Asif said. The defence minister added, “Muslim countries that supported the treaty, including Turkiye, Egypt, and Qatar, may need to reassess their stance given the ongoing violence. “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already expressed concerns, stating that the ceasefire agreement shouldn’t be mistaken for a final settlement to the Palestinian issue,” he said. Asif pointed out that since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, at least 352 Palestinians had been killed, while over 70,000 people had lost their lives in Gaza since the start of the conflict. He added that Amnesty International had warned that “Israel’s genocide is not over, and the international community especially western governments must keep pressuring Israel to abide by international law”. A cornerstone of the United States-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. However, countries that had previously supported the plan have since expressed reservations. Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said that Pakistan was willing to commit troops to the Gaza peace force, but “not ready” to participate in the disarming of Hamas. “We are not ready for that. This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement,” he said.",

Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government pushes aggressive immigration enforcement operations. Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a CRCL document confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website. Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL document . This included an investigation into a 2024 incident during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original complaint , submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said. In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL complaint submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case. Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower complaint . Continue reading...",

Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The Pakis­tan Population Summit 2025 , a dialogue on the country’s high population rate, will be held in Islamabad from Dec 1 to 2. Data compiled by research organisation Population Council, UK Aid and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) shows the average annual growth rate in Pakistan — based on data from 2017 to 2023 — is 2.55 per cent , resulting in a population of 241.5 million, making it the fifth most populous country in the world. The country is on course to cross 300 million within the next five years and edge towards 400 million by 2050. According to a DawnMedia press release, the two-day event will take place at the Serena Hotel. The event will take stock of the situation in Pakistan, as it faces the challenges of rising population growth outpacing available resources. “Urgent and serious action is required to bridge the growing gap between demographic increase and sustainable resource management. Recognising the crucial implications of a high population growth rate on Pakistan’s economy, social infrastructure, education, health, food and water security, and employment is critical,” it said. The summit is aimed at bringing together politicians, economists, development specialists, and private-sector leaders to establish a practical pathway to long-term growth. Notable speakers exp­ected to address the event include Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb, among others. The summit is being organised by DawnMedia in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning, De­­v­­elopment and Special Ini­tiatives; the Ministry of Na­­tional Health Services, Regulations and Coordi­nation; the Sindh government, the KP government, UK International Deve­lopment and the World Bank Group as principal partners. It is supported by the Karachi Water and Sewe­rage Corporation, while the Population Council and FCDO serve as strategic partners, while Pathfinder International, Population Services International, QZ Catalyst, and UNFPA contribute as knowledge partners. Ipsos and Repu Media-Acumen Media Intel­ligence also support the initiative as research partners. Published in Dawn, November 30th, 2025",

Jhang Satellite Town police said the attackers managed to flee after the shooting. Munir Sadhana was on the way to Jhang District Courts Complex when his car was attacked near Bilqees Hospital. As a result of firing, his driver Mumtaz Ahmad died instantly while Sadhana himself, shopkeeper and passer-by Mushtaq were shifted to Jhang District Headquarters Hospital where Sadhana and passer-by also succumbed to their injuries. The lawyer was a close aide of former federal interior minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat , who was present at the hospital to receive the body of his friend along with relatives of the deceased. Deputy Commissioner Ali Akbar Bhinder and DPO Bilal Kiani were also present. As soon as news of attack reached the courts, the lawyers started their strike. In a press release, DBA President Mehr Muhammad Fareed Nawaz Naul has announced three working days of mourning over the assassination of Sadhana. He demanded the immediate arrest of the killers. Till the filing of this report, no FIR was registered and the police said they had not received a complaint for registration of the case yet. A large number of people, including lawyers, judges and government officers, attended the funeral prayers for Sadhana at Church Ground. ACCIDENT: A motorcycle rider died and his two pillions were injured critically after a speeding car hit their two-wheeler near the FDA City gate on the Sargodha Road. Nishatabad police identified the deceased as Ahmad Ali (19) of Chak 46-JB and injured as Naveed (18) and Nawaz (21). Both the injured were shifted to Allied Hospital. The car driver fled after the accident. Meanwhile, a 22-year-old unidentified man died at Allied Hospital after being hit by a train near the graveyard of Chak Bhaiwala in Millat Town police area. He was crossing the track when he was hit by the train. APPROVAL: The Provincial Development Working Party (PWDP) has approved the establishment of a landfill site for waste management in Faisalabad. The landfill site, which will be established on 150 acres, at the locality of Lakwana located on the Makkuana-Khurianwala Road will have a capacity to dump 1,100 tonnes of waste every day while a plan for recycling waste/garbage is also included in it. Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar said there was a dire need for a landfill site in Faisalabad and the approval of funds for it by the PWDP was a significant step. He said the work on this project would start soon. Published in Dawn, November 30th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday rejected what it called the “baseless” statement by United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk expressing concerns about the 27th Constitutional Amendment. In a statement issued in Geneva on Friday, the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society. He added that the “hastily adopted” amendments undermined judicial independence and raised concerns about military accountability. A press release issued by the FO said that Pakistan rejected the “baseless” statement. “Pakistan notes with deep concern the ungrounded and misplaced apprehensions aired on behalf of the UN high commissioner for human rights regarding the 27th Constitutional Amendment adopted by the two-third majority of the parliament of Pakistan,” the press release by the FO said. “Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the Constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan,” it added. The FO said that democracy and democratic methods “form the bedrock of civil and political rights, and therefore must be respected”. “The constitutional amendments adopted by the parliament of Pakistan followed due procedures as enshrined in Pakistan’s Constitution,” it said. It added that Pakistan remained “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law” as enshrined in the Constitution. “While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan’s views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the FO said. “We urge the high commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan’s parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation.” The recent 27th Amendment was pushed through Parliament at top speed earlier this month amid widespread outcry. Among the top concerns are its overhaul of the judicial system via the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court, and changes to Article 243 positioning the army chief as the new Chief of Defence Forces at the top of Pakistan’s armed services.",

      "summary_orig": "THE photo shows one of the damaged sections of a railway track on the outskirts of Quetta.—Dawn QUETTA: Seven blasts rocked Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali on Saturday, with one explosion blowing up a section of railway track near the provincial capital and suspending train traffic to other parts of the country. The first blast took place near a police checkpost on Qambrani Road, where unidentified atta­ckers hurled a grenade. The device exploded but caused no loss of life. Police said the second blast occurred shortly afterwards on the same road, when armed men detonated a motorcycle carrying an improvised explosive device (IED) as a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) vehicle passed by, carrying bomb disposal squad personnel to the site of the first explosion. “Miscreants planted an IED on the motorbike and detonated it with a remote control when the CTD vehicle was passing through the area,” SSP Operations Capt (retd) Asif Khan told Dawn , adding that the CTD vehicle escaped the blast and no casualties were reported in either attack. SSP Khan said two more explosions were reported in the evening. “One blast took place on the railway track near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, which blew up the main line connecting Quetta with other parts of the country,” he said. No casualties reported; seven explosions occur in Quetta, Dera Murad Jamali Police said an IED had been planted on the track and was detonated shortly before a train was exp­e­c­ted to arrive in Quetta. “Around one and a half feet of the track was blown up in the blast,” an official added. Rail traffic was suspended while repair work was initiated. In another incident, unknown motorcyclists hurled a grenade at Manzoor Shaheed Police Station, but the device failed to explode. A bomb disposal squad later defused it. Later in the evening, unidentified attackers hurled another grenade in the Kechi Beg area at a police patrol. The grenade exploded, but no casualties were reported. Meanwhile, armed men also targeted a police vehicle at DC Chowk in Dera Murad Jamali by throwing a grenade. The device did not explode and was defused by the bomb disposal squad. Police said the vehicle was on routine patrol when it came under attack. In yet another incident late on Saturday night, unidentified armed men attacked the camp of a construction company in Quetta’s Sariab area. Police said motorcyclist hurled a grenade at the site, damaging mac­h­inery and injuring a security guard, who was shif­ted to the Civil Hospital. The company is currently engaged in the construction of Sariab Road. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the incidents.

      "summary_orig": "• Kyiv plunges into darkness as grid hit in Russian strikes; three killed • Moscow’s oil terminal halts operations after Black Sea drone attack KYIV/MOSCOW: Ukrainian Presi­d­ent Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation headed by security council secretary Rustem Umerov was on its way to the United States to continue talks on an agreement to end Russia’s war. Umerov has been put in charge of the Ukrainian delegation after the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky’s powerful chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned on Friday hours after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment. Zelensky said he expected that the res­ults of previous meetings with the US in Geneva, which took place last weekend, would now be “hammered out” on Sunday. Those meetings allowed Ukraine to present a counter-offer to proposals laid out by US Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll to leaders in Kyiv almost two weeks ago. “Rustem delivered a report today, and the task is clear: to swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war,” Zelensky wrote on X. Yermak told the New York Post hours after his resignation that he was “going to the front”. “I am an honest and decent person,” he said. Russian oil terminal One of Russia’s largest oil terminals halted operations on Saturday following an attack by sea drones. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), a group that includes US oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil and which owns the terminal, called the strike a “terrorist attack”. Ukraine, which did not comment on the incident, has sought to punch back against its neighbour as the war grinds through its fourth year. “As a result of a targeted terrorist attack by unmanned boats at 4:06am Moscow time (6:06 PKT) single Mooring Point 2 (SMP-2) sustained significant damage,” the CPC said in a statement on Telegram. “Further operation of SMP-2 is not possible. Loadings at the terminal will be carried out in accordance with established rules once the drone threats are lifted,” it added. The CPC pipeline, which begins in Kazakhstan and ends at the terminal, is a major conduit for Kazakh oil and one of the world’s largest by volume, handling around one percent of global supplies. A Ukrainian source, meanwhile, clai­m­ed responsibility for attacks on two oil tankers in the Black Sea allegedly cover­tly transporting sanctioned Russian oil. The two ships, the Virat and the Kairos, were rocked by explosions off Turkey’s coast late Friday, according to the Turkish transport ministry. One of the two was struck again early Saturday, the ministry said. “Modernised Sea Baby naval drones successfully targeted the vessels,” a source in Ukraine’s SBU security service told AFP . The source shared a video that purported to show sea drones gliding towards the two ships, before sparking explosions. Kazakhstan’s energy ministry said on Saturday it had activated a plan to redirect oil exports to alternative routes after the CPC halted operations following the Ukrainian naval drone attack. Kazakhstan’s energy ministry called the attack unacceptable. Strikes on Ukraine The attack came as vast Russian overnight attack on Ukraine killed three people and wounded nearly 30, officials said on Saturday, with more than 600,000 households left without power after strikes on the grid. President Zelensky said Russia had launched around 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones in the attack. AFP journalists in Kyiv reported a night of intense explosions that kept many in the capital awake. In the morning, reporters saw burned out cars and apartment buildings charred from fire. Russia, which denies targeting civilians, says it struck energy infrastructure powering the Ukraine’s military-industrial complex. Published in Dawn, November 30th, 2025",
