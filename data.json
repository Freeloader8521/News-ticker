      "summary_orig": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) has dismissed the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) complaint seeking the removal of match referee Andy Pycroft from the ongoing Asia Cup over a dispute during the recent Pakistan-India match , Indian media outlets claimed on Tuesday. The PCB had yesterday lodged a complaint with the ICC against Pycroft over his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket“, with the board claiming that the referee had asked the Pakistan and India captains “not to shake hands at the time of the toss” for Sunday’s match. “Late last night, ICC had sent a reply to PCB stating that Pycroft won’t be removed and their plea has been rejected,” an unnamed ICC source told the Press Trust of India . However, Cricbuzz reported , “When contacted, the PCB has denied receiving any communication from the ICC.” The PCB has yet to issue an official statement on the development. The Times of India ( TOI ) reported it was “actually the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) officials on the ground who informed Pycroft about the no-handshake policy at the toss”. It is unclear if any such official policy had been set for the match. Another TOI report quoted an unnamed PCB source as saying, “It is very unlikely that the PCB will pull out from the Asia Cup.” At the centre of the complaint is the Indian team’s refusal to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts at the toss and the match’s end, as is customary. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi yesterday claimed , without naming, that Pycroft had violated the “ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket”. According to an earlier press release by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Pycroft is scheduled to be the match referee for the Pakistan-UAE match tomorrow. ‘Politicised’ victory The Asia Cup match between India and Pakistan took place on Sunday in Dubai, where spinners led by Kuldeep Yadav helped the Men in Blue beat the Green Shirts by seven wickets as the neighbours met on the cricket pitch for the first time since their military conflict in May. After hitting the winning shot, skipper Suryakumar Yadav and his teammates refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts. The captain said in the post-match press conference that the move was in alignment “with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) and the government” and the team wanted to give the Green Shirts a “proper reply”. Suryakumar also seemingly “politicised” the victory by bringing up the April terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam — over which Delhi and Islamabad fought the four-day conflict in May — at his post-match presentation and said the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country. He also dedicated the win to the Indian armed forces, with Pakistani cricketers and various analysts criticising his comments. In response, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha did not show up in the post-match ceremony and coach Mike Hesson termed the Indian team’s conduct “ disappointing ”.",

      "title_orig": "We have ‘effective’ armed forces: Dar on Pakistan’s possible position if united body is formed against Israel in ME",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has “very large” and “effective” armed forces that have proven their capabilities in conventional warfare, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said during an interview to Al Jazeera when asked about the possible position Islamabad would take in case a united body in the Middle East was formed to stop Israeli aggression. The interview, recorded ahead of an Arab-Islamic summit on Israel’s recent strikes in Qatar and published late on Monday night, saw Dar in conversation with Al Jazeera ’s Osama Bin Javed. who asked the foreign minister if the formation of a united body in the Middle East, away from the United Nations structure, to intervene in Gaza was an option on the table. To that, Dar began his response by mentioning that “vis a vis UN Security Council, a mechanism could be chalked out”. “For example, they have [imposed] very serious sanctions on countries that don’t listen to them. And that is a very severe economic dent or pain they can cause to any country.” He then went on to say that there had been talk along the lines of “some sort of combined security force” during recent interactions among Arab nations and the Arab League. Dar added, “Why not? What’s wrong with that? They should [have a combined force]. And according to their own capacity, own strength, they should create some mechanism. Not for aggression purpose [ sic ], but for peaceful purpose[s], for stopping the aggressor, for stopping the occupier, for stopping someone who just doesn’t listen.” Where would a “nuclear-powered Pakistan” stand with that, asked Javed. “Nuclear-powered Pakistan, obviously, as a member of the ummah, would discharge its duty,” replied Dar. Javed then asked him to further elaborate in his answer. In his response, Dar clarified that Pakistan saw nuclear weapons only for deterrence and didn’t intend to use them. “We have no intention of using it; it is only a deterrence.” He continued: “But Pakistan has a very large, known, very effective army, very effective air force, very effective navy … We have proved that we can beat [our opponent] even conventionally, if challenged.” The interviewer then brought up a recent debate at the UN Security Council where Israel had invoked a 2011 attack within Pakistan to kill Osama Bin Laden in a bid to justify its attacks in Gaza. “So if now Pakistan comes under attack, from a country like the United States, for instance, would Pakistan act differently [than it did in 2011]?” he asked. “We would not allow the breach of our territorial integrity, no matter by whom, be it the smallest or the largest country. We would respond. But I don’t see any reason why the US or any other country would do it. India did it. You saw what happened to them,” replied Dar. Javed then pointed to the lack of action by the US in stopping Israel from attacking Qatar and asked Dar whether Pakistan still saw America as a “trustworthy” security partner. In his response, Dar highlighted the “positive” role the US had played in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan following a recent escalation between the two countries in May. Earlier in the interview, recent strikes by Israel in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders in Doha also came up. Sharing his views on the subject, Dar said Israel’s reasons to attack a sovereign country were “totally baseless”. He pointed out that Qatar was mediating talks, along with the US and Egypt, for peace in Gaza when that attack happened, terming Israel’s actions “rogue”. Dar highlighted that Israel had attacked multiple countries in the Middle East and said that international laws, international humanitarian rules and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and UN Security Council resolutions seemed to have “no effect on one country, which is repeatedly doing what it feels like”. “That means [the] multilateral system needs very serious reforms right now … This is the need of the hour. I think the UN Security Council, as well as the UN system itself needs very serious reforms. “The UN Security Council is meant to maintain peace in the world. And if its resolutions are just put in the bin, as it is happening since so many years — [by] Israel in Gaza and Palestine and by India in Kashmir — what do we expect from the multilateral system?” Asked whether all Muslim countries in the world were carrying equal weight and “doing the jobs they should be doing”, Dar said Pakistan believed that no matter how big or small a state was, their “dignity and respect should be equal”. In this connection, he also gave the example of India, mentioning that “some country had claimed to have hegemony, to be the net security provider, to be the captain of the entire region”. But “you saw what happened between May 7 and 10. It’s all settled. The hegemony is buried,” he added, referring to a four-day armed escalation between India and Pakistan. Dar further said that military action by Pakistan at the time was in self-defence. Answering a follow-up question, he said he believed with regard to Gaza, diplomacy and dialogue were the best options. “It takes time, but you can reach a solution when you sit at the table. But if you are not willing to sit [at] the table, if you are not sincere and have negative and evil designs of expansionism […] then you will never be sincere about the dialogue. So, sincerity in dialogue is also required.” To a question about whether Israel could attack Pakistan next after Qatar, Dar reminded that India had tried that and Israel “gave it full support according to our information” and the “world saw that the claim is exposed”. “We are ready. Again, I repeat, we want peace. The nuclear-armed state does not want any destabilisation in the region because that will have consequences beyond [the region],” he added, stressing the need for collective efforts for reforms in UN Security Council resolutions. Saying that Israel and India were the only countries that did not abide by UN Security Council resolutions, he emphasised evolving a mechanism in the council for taking practical measures to “control the situation” if its resolutions were not acted upon and implemented. “And that might require physical actions, physical interventions.”",

And that is a very severe economic dent or pain they can cause to any country.” He then went on to say that there had been talk along the lines of “some sort of combined security force” during recent interactions among Arab nations and the Arab League. Dar added, “Why not? What’s wrong with that? They should [have a combined force]. And according to their own capacity, own strength, they should create some mechanism. Not for aggression purpose [ sic ], but for peaceful purpose[s], for stopping the aggressor, for stopping the occupier, for stopping someone who just doesn’t listen.” Where would a “nuclear-powered Pakistan” stand with that, asked Javed. “Nuclear-powered Pakistan, obviously, as a member of the ummah, would discharge its duty,” replied Dar. Javed then asked him to further elaborate in his answer. In his response, Dar clarified that Pakistan saw nuclear weapons only for deterrence and didn’t intend to use them. “We have no intention of using it; it is only a deterrence.” He continued: “But Pakistan has a very large, known, very effective army, very effective air force, very effective navy … We have proved that we can beat [our opponent] even conventionally, if challenged.” The interviewer then brought up a recent debate at the UN Security Council where Israel had invoked a 2011 attack within Pakistan to kill Osama Bin Laden in a bid to justify its attacks in Gaza. “So if now Pakistan comes under attack, from a country like the United States, for instance, would Pakistan act differently [than it did in 2011]?” he asked. “We would not allow the breach of our territorial integrity, no matter by whom, be it the smallest or the largest country. We would respond. But I don’t see any reason why the US or any other country would do it. India did it. You saw what happened to them,” replied Dar. Javed then pointed to the lack of action by the US in stopping Israel from attacking Qatar and asked Dar whether Pakistan still saw America as a “trustworthy” security partner. In his response, Dar highlighted the “positive” role the US had played in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan following a recent escalation between the two countries in May. Earlier in the interview, recent strikes by Israel in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders in Doha also came up. Sharing his views on the subject, Dar said Israel’s reasons to attack a sovereign country were “totally baseless”. He pointed out that Qatar was mediating talks, along with the US and Egypt, for peace in Gaza when that attack happened, terming Israel’s actions “rogue”. Dar highlighted that Israel had attacked multiple countries in the Middle East and said that international laws, international humanitarian rules and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and UN Security Council resolutions seemed to have “no effect on one country, which is repeatedly doing what it feels like”. “That means [the] multilateral system needs very serious reforms right now … This is the need of the hour. I think the UN Security Council, as well as the UN system itself needs very serious reforms. “The UN Security Council is meant to maintain peace in the world. And if its resolutions are just put in the bin, as it is happening since so many years — [by] Israel in Gaza and Palestine and by India in Kashmir — what do we expect from the multilateral system?” Asked whether all Muslim countries in the world were carrying equal weight and “doing the jobs they should be doing”, Dar said Pakistan believed that no matter how big or small a state was, their “dignity and respect should be equal”. In this connection, he also gave the example of India, mentioning that “some country had claimed to have hegemony, to be the net security provider, to be the captain of the entire region”. But “you saw what happened between May 7 and 10. It’s all settled. The hegemony is buried,” he added, referring to a four-day armed escalation between India and Pakistan. Dar further said that military action by Pakistan at the time was in self-defence. Answering a follow-up question, he said he believed with regard to Gaza, diplomacy and dialogue were the best options. “It takes time, but you can reach a solution when you sit at the table. But if you are not willing to sit [at] the table, if you are not sincere and have negative and evil designs of expansionism […] then you will never be sincere about the dialogue. So, sincerity in dialogue is also required.” To a question about whether Israel could attack Pakistan next after Qatar, Dar reminded that India had tried that and Israel “gave it full support according to our information” and the “world saw that the claim is exposed”. “We are ready. Again, I repeat, we want peace. The nuclear-armed state does not want any destabilisation in the region because that will have consequences beyond [the region],” he added, stressing the need for collective efforts for reforms in UN Security Council resolutions. Saying that Israel and India were the only countries that did not abide by UN Security Council resolutions, he emphasised evolving a mechanism in the council for taking practical measures to “control the situation” if its resolutions were not acted upon and implemented. “And that might require physical actions, physical interventions.”",

      "title_orig": "Suspected gunman Robinson wrote note threatening Kirk, tied to scene by DNA, FBI director says",
      "summary_orig": "The suspect accused of assassinating right-wing activist Charlie Kirk in Utah wrote a text message before the shooting that he planned to kill Kirk, FBI Director Kash Patel said on Monday. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” Patel said investigators believe Tyler Robinson also wrote a physical note saying he had the “opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk” and would do so. The note was destroyed, Patel said, but investigators have collected forensic evidence that it had existed and confirmed its contents through interviews. Patel did not say who had received the text message or whether anyone had seen the written note before the attack. Investigators have not publicly identified a motive. Law enforcement authorities have said they believe Robinson acted alone when he shot Kirk, but are investigating whether anyone else had a role in plotting the killing. Separately, the Washington Post reported on Monday that Robinson had sent a message via the online platform Discord to friends, apparently confessing to the crime on Thursday night, shortly before he was arrested. “It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,” read a message from the account belonging to Robinson, the newspaper reported, citing two people familiar with the chat as well as screenshots it had obtained. Kirk, an influential ally of US President Donald Trump who co-founded the leading conservative student group Turning Point USA, was killed by a single rifle shot last Wednesday during an event at Utah Valley University in Orem, about 40 miles south (65 km) of Salt Lake City. Court hearing by video Robinson, 22, is expected to be formally charged on Tuesday, around the same time that he makes an initial court appearance by video from his jail cell. Patel told Fox News that DNA matching the suspect’s was found on a towel that was wrapped around the rifle believed to be the murder weapon and on a screwdriver found on the rooftop that served as the shooter’s sniper perch. Robinson has not cooperated with authorities, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said on Sunday, but investigators have been interviewing his friends and family in an effort to determine the motive for the shooting. The killing has shaken a country already gripped by a spike in political violence, fueled by deepening polarisation between the right and the left.\nBoth sides have universally condemned Kirk’s slaying as an indefensible act of political violence, though partisan differences have emerged over the framing of that message. Some Republicans, including Trump, have blamed liberal groups for Kirk’s murder despite a lack of evidence, while Democrats have noted that left-wing figures have also been the targets of political violence in recent years.\nThe left and right also disagree over Kirk’s legacy and how he should be remembered. Legacy divided Kirk’s supporters cast him as an influential and charismatic figure who galvanised support for Trump among younger voters in 2024, and the Republican president has honoured Kirk by ordering flags flown at half-staff on public buildings. Civil rights advocates and liberals have criticised Kirk as a divisive figure who embraced Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of a stolen election in 2020 and has marginalised Blacks, women, the LGBT community, Muslims and immigrants with derogatory rhetoric. In an appearance on Kirk’s eponymous podcast on Monday, Vice President JD Vance said the “incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism” had helped lead to Kirk’s killing. While Robinson was raised in a Mormon household by religious parents in a deeply conservative region of the state, “his ideology was very different than his family,” Cox said on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program, without going into specifics. State records show Robinson had registered to vote without choosing a party affiliation and did not vote in the 2024 presidential election. But a relative told police that Robinson had grown more political and had expressed dislike for Kirk in a recent conversation. House Speaker Mike Johnson and three other top members of the House Republican leadership held a brief vigil on Monday for Kirk, attended by dozens of lawmakers, friends and supporters in Statuary Hall of the US Capitol. Back in Utah, at the scene of Kirk’s assassination, scores of mourners have flocked to makeshift memorials in recent days to leave flowers and handwritten notes, and to inscribe messages in chalk on campus sidewalks, many of them Bible verses. Dally Bronson, 22, a sheriff’s dispatcher from neighbouring Wasatch County who was on duty at the time Kirk was shot, said that as a devout Christian, she felt torn about what justice should look like. Describing herself as an admirer of Kirk, Bronson said she had been praying for both him and his accused killer. “By all accounts (Robinson) was a good kid until recently, when something went terribly wrong,” she said, speaking through tears. Kirk’s “killing isn’t about one political side or the other - it’s about good and evil. The shooter encountered a darkness online; he went into some black hole on the internet, and it’s something people our age fall into.”",

Civil rights advocates and liberals have criticised Kirk as a divisive figure who embraced Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of a stolen election in 2020 and has marginalised Blacks, women, the LGBT community, Muslims and immigrants with derogatory rhetoric. In an appearance on Kirk’s eponymous podcast on Monday, Vice President JD Vance said the “incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism” had helped lead to Kirk’s killing. While Robinson was raised in a Mormon household by religious parents in a deeply conservative region of the state, “his ideology was very different than his family,” Cox said on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program, without going into specifics. State records show Robinson had registered to vote without choosing a party affiliation and did not vote in the 2024 presidential election. But a relative told police that Robinson had grown more political and had expressed dislike for Kirk in a recent conversation. House Speaker Mike Johnson and three other top members of the House Republican leadership held a brief vigil on Monday for Kirk, attended by dozens of lawmakers, friends and supporters in Statuary Hall of the US Capitol. Back in Utah, at the scene of Kirk’s assassination, scores of mourners have flocked to makeshift memorials in recent days to leave flowers and handwritten notes, and to inscribe messages in chalk on campus sidewalks, many of them Bible verses. Dally Bronson, 22, a sheriff’s dispatcher from neighbouring Wasatch County who was on duty at the time Kirk was shot, said that as a devout Christian, she felt torn about what justice should look like. Describing herself as an admirer of Kirk, Bronson said she had been praying for both him and his accused killer. “By all accounts (Robinson) was a good kid until recently, when something went terribly wrong,” she said, speaking through tears. Kirk’s “killing isn’t about one political side or the other - it’s about good and evil. The shooter encountered a darkness online; he went into some black hole on the internet, and it’s something people our age fall into.”",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against the match referee for yesterday’s Asia Cup game between Pakistan and India over his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket”, PCB Chairperson Mohsin Naqvi said. “The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket,” Naqvi posted on X, referring to referee Andy Pycroft. “The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the match referee from the Asia Cup,” he added. According to an earlier press release by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Pycroft was scheduled to be the match referee for the Pakistan-UAE match on Wednesday. The Asia Cup match between the two sides took place on Sunday in Dubai, where spinners led by Kuldeep Yadav helped India beat Pakistan by seven wickets as the neighbours met on the cricket pitch for the first time since a military conflict between them in May. After hitting the winning shot, Suryakumar and his teammates refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts. The captain said in the post-match press conference that the move was in alignment “with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) and the government”. In the post-match presentation, Suryakumar said India took the match against Pakistan as “just another game” and dedicated the win to the Indian armed forces. “We stand with the victims of the families of the Pahalgam terror attack, and we express our solidarity,” Suryakumar said. “We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.” The April 22 attack on civilians in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam triggered Pakistan-India hostilities in May. New Delhi, without evidence, accused Pakistan of backing the attack — a charge Islamabad strongly denies . After the match, the PCB confirmed to Dawn.com that Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema had “registered a protest against the match referees’ behaviour.” “It was against the sportsman spirit that the Indian team did not shake hands,” the PCB statement quoted the manager as saying. It alleged that the “match referee had asked the captains not to shake hands at the time of the toss”. Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha did not show up in the post-match ceremony as a reaction to the Indian team’s move. Pakistan’s coach Mike Hesson explained that the reason Salman was absent from the ceremony was because of the Indian team’s “disappointing” conduct at the end of the match. “It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Hesson said. Following the developments, PCB chief Naqvi earlier today said on X: “Utterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today. Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports. “Let’s hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace.” The match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to ‘ boycott ’ the fixture. The Indian cricket board had said it could not boycott an international event and that such a move would “bring a lot of negativity for all our future endeavours of hosting any multinational tournament”. New Delhi only cleared the match in a recently announced sports policy , saying the Indian national team can play Pakistan in multi-national events but not in bilateral competitions. Pakistan last played a bilateral series against India in 2012, when the Green Shirts toured India for an ODI and T20I series.",

The Toshakhana record, made public by the cabinet division for the period between January and June 2025, lists high-value items such as watches, luxury vehicles, carpets, handicrafts, and traditional artefacts presented to top state functionaries, including the president, prime minister, ministers, and senior officials during foreign visits and local engagements. The data, comprising 137 entries, records gifts received from heads of state, royal families, diplomats, and business delegations. However, the value of these gifts is still being assessed by the cabinet division. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received a total of 61 gifts, mostly decorative and traditional items. These included several high-end wristwatches. Notably, on the first day of 2025, he was presented with two luxury wristwatches — an IWC Schaffhausen and a Panerai, both with warranty cards — by Sheikh Abdul Hadi Mana Al-Hajri of Qatar. Record shows PM received 61 out of total 137 gifts presented to state officials The Shah of the State of Selangor, Malaysia, gifted PM Shehbaz a ‘Golden Kris’ — a traditional Malaysian dagger. Additionally, the president of Turkiye presented him with an electric car. During his visit to Azerbaijan, the prime minister received a handmade silk carpet and other items. The President of Tajikistan gifted him a box containing a golden teacup with a spoon. While in Saudi Arabia , PM Shehbaz received a model of Mimbar-e-Rasool from Prince Mansour Bin Muhammad Bin Saad bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, and a wooden box containing two documents — the Charter of Makkah in English and Arabic — from Dr Mohammad Abdulkareem Al-Issa, Secretary General of the Muslim World League. From Iran , the PM was presented with a wall hanging and a shield by the Chief of General Staff. Other gifts included handmade carpets, onyx decorations, paintings, tea sets, books, and shields. Interestingly, while the Saudi hosts did not overwhelm the prime minister with lavish gifts, several Pakistani officials visiting the Kingdom — led by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi — received high-end wristwatches. On Jan 28, Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia gifted six Rolex watches, five Tudor watches, three Black Armin watches, and nine Frank Rosha watches to Pakistani officials, primarily government officers. The record shows that President Asif Ali Zardari received 11 gifts, including a ladies’ suit and a bedsheet from the High Commissioner of Bangladesh. The most valuable among his gifts was an electric vehicle from the president of Turkiye. He also received a carpet from the Iranian foreign minister, as well as vases, candle stands, shields, a coffee set, and onyx items. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received several Afghan carpets and traditional bowls, while Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was presented with prayer mats and Turkish handicrafts. Other ministers, advisers, and security officials were gifted watches, rugs, wall hangings, and porcelain items. Published in Dawn, September 16th, 2025",

Additionally, the president of Turkiye presented him with an electric car. During his visit to Azerbaijan, the prime minister received a handmade silk carpet and other items. The President of Tajikistan gifted him a box containing a golden teacup with a spoon. While in Saudi Arabia , PM Shehbaz received a model of Mimbar-e-Rasool from Prince Mansour Bin Muhammad Bin Saad bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, and a wooden box containing two documents — the Charter of Makkah in English and Arabic — from Dr Mohammad Abdulkareem Al-Issa, Secretary General of the Muslim World League. From Iran , the PM was presented with a wall hanging and a shield by the Chief of General Staff. Other gifts included handmade carpets, onyx decorations, paintings, tea sets, books, and shields. Interestingly, while the Saudi hosts did not overwhelm the prime minister with lavish gifts, several Pakistani officials visiting the Kingdom — led by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi — received high-end wristwatches. On Jan 28, Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia gifted six Rolex watches, five Tudor watches, three Black Armin watches, and nine Frank Rosha watches to Pakistani officials, primarily government officers. The record shows that President Asif Ali Zardari received 11 gifts, including a ladies’ suit and a bedsheet from the High Commissioner of Bangladesh. The most valuable among his gifts was an electric vehicle from the president of Turkiye. He also received a carpet from the Iranian foreign minister, as well as vases, candle stands, shields, a coffee set, and onyx items.

      "summary_orig": "India’s Supreme Court has suspended key provisions of a controversial new law that changes how properties donated by Muslims are owned and managed in the country. The Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025 was criticised by opposition parties and challenged for violating the rights of the Muslim community to manage their own religious endowments, which are typically used as schools or mosques, while the Modi government asserts that it will make managing the properties more transparent, according to a BBC News report . In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties — sometimes worth billions of dollars — are important to India’s 200 million Muslims as they are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages — and cannot be sold for any other purpose. Allows nomination of non-Muslims to waqf board Historically, these properties have been governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level waqf boards to manage them. But in April this year, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led government amended the act, including changes to how a waqf property is determined and managed, sparking criticism from the community. On Monday, the SC bench comprising Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai and Justice A.G. Masih refused to strike down the entire law, saying that “the grant of stay is only in the rarest of rare category”. Controversial clauses It did, however, halt a controversial provision that allowed the government to decide whether a disputed property is waqf or not. Over the years, many properties that were donated through oral declarations or community customs have been legitimised as waqf properties because of their continuous use by the Muslim community. But under the new law, waqf boards were required to provide valid documents to claim a property as waqf. In case of disputes, the final decision rested with the government. The court struck down the rule, saying that allowing the government to determine the rights of a citizen would go against the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary, mandated under the constitution. Another contentious provision that was scrapped was a clause that required a waqf donor to be a practising Muslim for at least five years. The waqf properties are currently managed by state-level boards and a central council, with nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of state bar council, Islamic scholars and the managers of these properties. While the judges refused to stay a provision that allows the nomination of non-Muslims to the waqf board, they limited the number of non-Muslim members to four in the 22-member federal board and to three in the 11-member state boards. The court also said, “Efforts should be made to appoint the chief executive officer of the board from amongst the Muslim community.” The case reached the top court in early April, soon after the law was passed by parliament amid widespread criticism.
