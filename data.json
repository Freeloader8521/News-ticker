      "summary_orig": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday called for Hamas to be expelled from the region, a day after the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) endorsed United States President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan that offers the Palestinian group amnesty. Netanyahu publicly endorsed the plan during a White House visit in late September. However, his latest remarks appear to show that there are differences with the US on the path forward. Hamas has also objected to parts of the plan. Diplomats say privately that entrenched positions on both the Israeli and Hamas sides have made it difficult to advance the plan, which lacks specific timelines or enforcement mechanisms. Still, it has received strong international backing, including from the Arab and Muslim countries that worked on it. Netanyahu on Tuesday published a series of posts on X in response to the UN vote. In one post, he applauded Trump and in another wrote the Israeli government believes the plan would lead to peace and prosperity because it calls for the “full demilitarisation, disarmament, and deradicalisation of Gaza”. “Israel extends its hand in peace and prosperity to all of our neighbours” and calls on neighbouring countries to “join us in expelling Hamas and its supporters from the region”, he said. Asked what the prime minister had meant by expelling Hamas, a spokesperson said that it would mean “ensuring there is no Hamas in Gaza as outlined in the 20-point plan, and Hamas has no ability to govern the Palestinian people inside the Gaza Strip”. Plan does not call for Hamas’s expulsion Trump’s 20-point plan includes a clause saying that Hamas members “who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty”, and members who wish to leave will be given safe passage to third countries. Another clause says Hamas will agree to not having any role in Gaza’s governance. There is no clause that explicitly calls for the resistance group to disband or to leave Gaza. The plan says reforms to the Palestinian Authority may ultimately allow conditions “for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. Ahead of the UN vote, Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel remained opposed to Palestinian statehood after protests by far-right coalition allies over a US-backed statement indicating support for a pathway to Palestinian independence. Netanyahu also opposes any Palestinian Authority involvement in Gaza. European and Arab states have said that Gaza must be governed by the Palestinian Authority and that there must be a clear pathway to Palestinian independence. First step towards peace: Palestinian Authority The Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, earlier welcomed the vote and has said it is ready to take part in Trump’s plan, which doesn’t outline a clear role for the authority. Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin termed the UNSC resolution the “first step in a long road towards peace”. “That step was needed because we could not embark on anything else before we had a ceasefire,” Shahin told reporters in Manila during a visit to the Philippines. Shahin said there were still other issues that needed to be addressed, including Palestinian self-determination and eventual Palestinian independence, and that the process for implementing Trump’s plan must be governed by international law. She said that although Trump’s plan alludes to possible Palestinian statehood only after the Palestinian Authority carries out reforms, that issue could be taken up later. “As long as these elements are in there, we’re happy with this first step,” Shahin said. Multinational force for post-war Gaza The UNSC resolution authorised a multinational force that Trump’s plan says will be temporarily deployed to Gaza to stabilise the territory. The resolution’s text also says member states could join a “Board of Peace” that would oversee reconstruction and economic recovery inside Gaza. Hamas has criticised the resolution as failing to “live up to the demands and political and humanitarian rights” of the Palestinian people, who it said rejected an international guardianship mechanism of Gaza. Any international force must only be deployed along Gaza’s borders to monitor the ceasefire and under UN supervision, Hamas said in a statement, warning that such a force would lose its neutrality if it tried to disarm the group. Reham Owda, a Palestinian political analyst from Gaza, said the Hamas statement should be viewed as an objection, rather than complete rejection, in an attempt to negotiate mechanisms for the international force and the role of the board of peace. A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect on October 10 as part of Trump’s multi-phased plan to end Israel’s two-year relentless bombardment . Israel has partially withdrawn its forces but still controls 53 per cent of Gaza and the sides have accused each other of violations. Abu Abdallah, a businessman displaced in central Gaza, said Palestinians would support the deployment of international forces if it meant that Israel would fully withdraw its forces. “Hamas can’t decide our fate alone, but we also don’t want to get rid of one occupation, Israel, and get another international occupation,” he said by phone. Water provider suspends services after Hamas detains staff member Separately, a Gaza company that operates water desalination plants serving nearly half of the enclave’s population has stopped operations to protest the detention by Hamas of one of its staff. Youssef Yassin, a board member of the Abdul Salam Yassin Company, said the move would affect more than 1 million people who normally receive water from the company. Displaced Palestinians run to fill containers with water amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, in Gaza City on Nov 6, 2025. — Reuters Over 70 trucks that carry water containers across the enclave have also stopped operations, he added, risking further supply disruption after the pipeline network was badly damaged due to Israel’s bombing. “I know it is catastrophic but protecting our employees is a sacred issue,” Yassin told Reuters . Yassin said Hamas had given no reason for the arrest late on Monday. Hamas had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday. Hamas has been gradually reasserting control in areas of Gaza that Israel has withdrawn from as post-war talks over its future grind on. Foreign powers demand the group disarm and leave government but have yet to agree who will replace them. Israel continues to control around half the Gaza Strip. The move is a rare show of dissent against Hamas, which has run the Palestinian enclave since 2007. Demonstrations briefly erupted in March and April, demanding an end to the war and that Hamas give up power, but fizzled out after a warning that public disorder would not be tolerated. If the protest by the company persists, it could exacerbate the chronic water crisis in the enclave, which was worsened further by two years of Israel’s siege . Israel stopped all water and electricity supply to Gaza early in the offensive, resuming only a trickle of supplies later.",

      "summary_orig": "Disruptions in internet access were widely reported on Tuesday as Cloudflare, a content delivery network and domain name server (DNS) service, reported it was experiencing issues in its global network. Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources, showed that user reports from Pakistan indicated problems with Cloudflare, with complaints beginning around 4:10pm. Problems were also reported with OpenAI, Amazon Web Services, and Facebook. Social media platform X was also experiencing outages, with more than 5,600 reports of issues with the social media platform, as of 06:51am Eastern Time (4:51pm PKT), according to Downdetector. Cloudflare said it was “aware of and investigating an issue which impacts multiple customers”, but how did their service going down cause outages on multiple platforms? What is a DNS service provider? A DNS server is an address book that matches a website’s name (e.g. http://google.com ) to its real IP (a set of numbers). For nationwide use, you need DNS servers that can handle a lot of traffic and respond fast. All websites rely on DNS service providers like Amazon Web Services, GoDaddy and Cloudflare to function so that users can find and connect to the site’s server. This applies to online businesses, news outlets and social media platforms, among others. When the provider experiences an outage, like Cloudflare did today, websites using that service will become inaccessible, as users cannot connect to the site’s server. What causes these outages? Websites and other services going down can be attributed to a DNS outage, which the BBC reported was the root cause of a major outage of Amazon Web Services last month, which rendered over 1,000 websites and services inaccessible. DNS hosting service ClouDNS says on its website that a DNS outage is “a period of time when the domain name can’t be resolved to its IP address”. It adds that these can be caused by poor configuration or issues in data centres, maintenance of the authoritative server or even cyberattacks. What are the consequences? ClouDNS says that outages of this nature “could have a negative impact on your entire organisation and community of customers”. “When DNS is down, websites, applications, and online services related to the domain name, such as emails, won’t function correctly,” the service says. “Unfortunately, that has the potential to damage operations, revenue, and brand reputation.” ClouDNS listed a lack of potential visitors to websites, loss of revenue from potential sales, productivity losses and an impact on customers and partners as some of the issues that arise from a DNS service going down.",

      "title_orig": "MILITANCY: THE NEW FACE OF AL QAEDA",
      "summary_orig": "In a recent video report, German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle News observed that “more than two decades after 9/11, Al Qaeda hasn’t vanished, it’s adapted.” This assessment is reinforced by recent reports from the world’s leading news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and Al Jazeera , which indicate that one of Al Qaeda’s regional affiliates, Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), is on the verge of capturing the Malian capital, Bamako. Operating across the Sahel region of West Africa, primarily in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, JNIM is imposing an economic siege on the capital by blocking routes used by fuel tankers, effectively bringing the country to a standstill. Despite the elimination or arrest of its top to mid-ranking leadership in the Afghanistan-Pakistan (Af-Pak) region over the last two decades — through extensive US-led counter-terrorism operations across Af-Pak, the Middle East and Africa — Al Qaeda has persisted by adopting a key strategy: evolving from a hierarchical, centralised organisational structure to a decentralised network of franchises. More than two decades after 9/11, Al Qaeda hasn’t vanished — it’s adapted. As one of its regional affiliates brings Mali’s capital to a standstill and another, Al Shabaab, regains ground in Somalia, extremist networks are once again touting the establishment of Islamic emirates… These franchises have been granted operational autonomy while adhering to Al Qaeda Central’s (AQC) general ideology. This strategic shift has enabled the group to maintain its influence and continue its operations, even in the face of significant leadership losses. Apart from JNIM, Al Shabaab — another formidable Al-Qaeda affiliate — currently controls significant portions of southern and central Somalia, as of November 2025. The group has recently regained ground, reversing many of the territorial losses incurred during the Somali government’s 2022-2023 counter-offensive. Recently, a number of encrypted extremist channels, known for sharing propaganda from the Az-Zallaqah Foundation — the official media and propaganda arm of JNIM — featured one common written commentary with a bold prediction. “It seems that before the end of this year, the jihadists will have an Islamic state or emirate, either in Mali, Somalia or both.” THE EVOLUTION OF AFFILIATES These developments are not isolated incidents, but rather part of a broader extremist context and trend. The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has proven to be a key catalyst, ideologically inspiring and operationally emboldening extremist groups — including regional entities such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and global networks like Al Qaeda — to pursue territorial control. Al Qaeda is now predominantly managed by its affiliates, while its central leadership remains largely restricted to issuing general directives. Following the assassination of its second top leader, Ayman Al-Zawahiri , the organisation has been unable to formally announce his successor. The first affiliate, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), was established in 2004, followed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in 2006-2007 in North Africa and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2009. Al Shabaab, recognised as Al-Qaeda’s most affluent affiliate, with reported estimated annual revenue exceeding $100 million, emerged in 2012. Subsequently, Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) was formed in September 2014, and JNIM, which includes AQIM and four Malian armed groups, was established in 2017. Additionally, Hurras al-Din (HAD) surfaced in Syria in early 2018. Among the affiliates mentioned above, several have either gradually become completely defunct, merged with others, or dissolved. For instance, AQIM merged with JNIM, HAD was declared dissolved by Al-Qaeda, while AQI evolved into the Islamic State (IS). The split between Al Qaeda and the IS became official in February 2014, when Al-Qaeda publicly disavowed any relationship with the IS. It came after months of tension between the two groups, sparked by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s refusal to follow directives from Al Qaeda’s central command led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, on ideological, operational and organisational matters. The most intriguing case in our region is the Al Qaeda branch, AQIS, which was once responsible for nearly all significant attacks against key security installations throughout Pakistan, alongside the TTP. AQIS also played a crucial role in supporting the TTP in ideological, operational and propaganda efforts, but it is now primarily limited to disseminating propaganda content and is operationally inactive. IMPACT OF THE DOHA PEACE AGREEMENT Analysts maintain that AQC and AQIS have become the primary casualties of the US-Taliban Doha peace agreement in 2020, as a key condition of the deal is to prevent Al Qaeda from using Afghan soil to “threaten the security of the United States and its allies.” As a result of these bilateral arrangements, AQC is even unable to acknowledge the death of its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul in July 2022 or to announce his successor formally, while AQIS’s operations have completely disappeared. The Doha Agreement created a paradox for Al Qaeda, explains Riccardo Valle, my colleague and head of research at The Khorasan Diary , a digital platform focusing on extremist groups and conflict. “It achieved their primary goal of empowering the Taliban in Afghanistan, but it also forced AQC and AQIS to adopt a low profile, to avoid provoking the Americans,” he continues. “This has led AQIS to redirect its focus to Pakistan, supporting the Pakistani Taliban’s campaign against the state, often under the guise of new alliances.” A RESILIENT THREAT Al Qaeda has modified its operational tactics and organisational structure, yet its core ideology remains intact. The group seems to be refraining from executing major attacks, especially in the West, to avoid repercussions and to allow its territorial expansion in East and West Africa to continue unhindered. This strategic patience distinguishes Al Qaeda from the Islamic State’s approach in 2014-2017, when the latter simultaneously pursued territorial control while conducting high-profile international attacks — a strategy that ultimately drew overwhelming military response and territorial collapse. Reports suggest that the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI), the intelligence service of the Afghan Taliban, has a dedicated section for managing foreign terrorist entities in Afghanistan, including Al Qaeda. These entities are allegedly provided with security, accommodations, a monthly stipend and, in certain cases, even nationalities. Tajmir Jawad, the deputy director of GDI, is reportedly responsible for overseeing these foreign groups, primarily Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan. If one conducts even a basic investigation, a fundamental factor would emerge as the principal reason for the rise and growth of all these Al Qaeda affiliates within their respective countries: weak states struggling with issues such as foreign intervention, inadequate governance, political exclusion, ongoing conflicts, and economic disparities, all of which provide a conducive environment for militant organisations to thrive. With a robust ideological framework, these groups try to position themselves before the masses as an alternative to the current ruling class, which has not adequately addressed the people’s grievances over the years. Although Al Qaeda’s central leadership may be weakened, its influence is expanding within the extremist landscape, as the territorial strength of its affiliates continues to grow across various regions, presenting a significant threat. These affiliates, which share strong ideological alignment with AQC but operate with a degree of autonomy, will furnish Al Qaeda’s core leadership with new avenues for funding, recruitment and operational bases, thereby allowing it to sustain a global presence. A significant development in recent years has been the international acceptance and de facto diplomatic recognition of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, along with the formal diplomatic recognition and warm reception of the Ahmed Al-Sharaa-led government in Syria on the world stage (Al-Sharaa was once a member of AQI and headed the Al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra front). This may have established a precedent for Al Qaeda, suggesting that, if it were to seize control of a country, it could seek the same recognition and acceptance from the international community. Such a scenario could prompt Al Qaeda to adopt a strategy that merges warfare with political manoeuvring to fulfil its objectives, rather than resorting to confrontation as it did after the 9/11 attacks.

      "summary_en": "In a recent video report, German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle News observed that “more than two decades after 9/11, Al Qaeda hasn’t vanished, it’s adapted.” This assessment is reinforced by recent reports from the world’s leading news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and Al Jazeera , which indicate that one of Al Qaeda’s regional affiliates, Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), is on the verge of capturing the Malian capital, Bamako. Operating across the Sahel region of West Africa, primarily in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, JNIM is imposing an economic siege on the capital by blocking routes used by fuel tankers, effectively bringing the country to a standstill. Despite the elimination or arrest of its top to mid-ranking leadership in the Afghanistan-Pakistan (Af-Pak) region over the last two decades — through extensive US-led counter-terrorism operations across Af-Pak, the Middle East and Africa — Al Qaeda has persisted by adopting a key strategy: evolving from a hierarchical, centralised organisational structure to a decentralised network of franchises. More than two decades after 9/11, Al Qaeda hasn’t vanished — it’s adapted. As one of its regional affiliates brings Mali’s capital to a standstill and another, Al Shabaab, regains ground in Somalia, extremist networks are once again touting the establishment of Islamic emirates… These franchises have been granted operational autonomy while adhering to Al Qaeda Central’s (AQC) general ideology. This strategic shift has enabled the group to maintain its influence and continue its operations, even in the face of significant leadership losses. Apart from JNIM, Al Shabaab — another formidable Al-Qaeda affiliate — currently controls significant portions of southern and central Somalia, as of November 2025. The group has recently regained ground, reversing many of the territorial losses incurred during the Somali government’s 2022-2023 counter-offensive. Recently, a number of encrypted extremist channels, known for sharing propaganda from the Az-Zallaqah Foundation — the official media and propaganda arm of JNIM — featured one common written commentary with a bold prediction. “It seems that before the end of this year, the jihadists will have an Islamic state or emirate, either in Mali, Somalia or both.” THE EVOLUTION OF AFFILIATES These developments are not isolated incidents, but rather part of a broader extremist context and trend. The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has proven to be a key catalyst, ideologically inspiring and operationally emboldening extremist groups — including regional entities such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and global networks like Al Qaeda — to pursue territorial control. Al Qaeda is now predominantly managed by its affiliates, while its central leadership remains largely restricted to issuing general directives. Following the assassination of its second top leader, Ayman Al-Zawahiri , the organisation has been unable to formally announce his successor. The first affiliate, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), was established in 2004, followed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in 2006-2007 in North Africa and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2009. Al Shabaab, recognised as Al-Qaeda’s most affluent affiliate, with reported estimated annual revenue exceeding $100 million, emerged in 2012.

Taking place under Russia’s rotating presidency, the high-level meeting follows the landmark Tianjin summit three months earlier and comes at a pivotal moment for Eurasian economic connectivity in a shifting global order. “Excellencies, the agenda before us, spanning trade, economy, culture and humanitarian cooperation, is the basis of a mature, future-oriented SCO,” FM Dar said during his speech in Moscow. “Pakistan views them as interconnected threads in a single, stronger fabric of regional partnership.” He said that the Tianjin summit was a clear signal that “our organisation is evolving with the resolve to harness the full spectrum of our collective potential by focusing on economic integration through expanded trade collaboration, improved infrastructure connectivity, investment partnerships, advancement of cross-border trade corridors, and the promotion of digital economic development”. The SCO, Dar highlighted, has established a foundation for sustainable economic progress throughout the SCO space. “Pakistan has developed a technology-driven, proactive disaster management system,” the FM pointed out, adding that the country is “keen” to organise simulation exercises with SCO partners to bolster disaster preparedness across the region. “Excellencies, our discussions at Tianjin underscored the need to modernise our outreach. The value of our observer and partner states is immense,” Dar said. He added, “Let us move from a model of passive observation to one of real engagement. Let us invite them to participate not as guests on the periphery but as stakeholders in specific project-based initiatives that align with their expertise and our collective goals. This way, Dar emphasised, “we can create a flexible, multi-tiered model of cooperation that would benefit all”. “An important feature of the modernisation of the SCO is the introduction of English as a working language,” FM Dar pointed out. “Let us move forward from political declarations and establish a translation unit. The SCO can attract more partners and achieve wider goal influence with this only one step.” “Excellencies, to translate the momentum of Tianjin into tangible progress, we suggest greater focus on practical, cross-cutting initiatives,” Dar said. ‘Youth empowerment of foremost importance’ Pakistan, according to Dar’s address, has two proposals: operationalise financial tools for the promotion of trade and economy, and build human capital. “While our efforts continue to make available diversified financial tools such as the SCO Development Bank and development and investment funds for our economies and businesses, we must aggressively utilise the tools already at our disposal, like the SCO Interbank Consortium, to finance connectivity and technical collaboration projects,” he said. With respect to building human capital, Dar said the ultimate resource of the SCO is “our people”. “The empowerment of our youth is of foremost importance,” he stressed. “We must invest in them directly. Pakistan, therefore, advocates for a significant expansion of the SCO university network into a consortium for applied knowledge,” the minister said. He added that this would facilitate not just student exchanges but also joint research programmes in critical fields such as information technology, artificial intelligence, water resource management, agriculture, and telemedicine while addressing common challenges with shared intellect. “Excellencies, Pakistan is committed to being a proactive and creative partner in the journey,” Dar highlighted. “Let us build an SCO that is a launchpad for shared success, where every connection made, commercial, cultural, or intellectual, strengthens the whole. Let us ensure that the legacy of our work is a region more innovative, more interconnected, and more integrated.” A day earlier, FM Dar was received by the Russian Deputy FM Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Director of State Protocol Aleksander Prusov, Deputy Director of the Second Asia Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Alexei Surovtsev and Pakistan Embassy officers on his arrival to Moscow. Earlier this year, the SCO Council of Heads of State summit was held in Tianjin, China from August 31 to September 1, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif raised the Indus Waters Treaty issue. He also announced in September that Pakistan would be hosting the next SCO summit, but did not provide a date for it. Pakistan last hosted the SCO in 2024 for the Council of Heads of Government summit.",

      "summary_orig": "The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Tuesday staged a march from Parliament House to Supreme Court as part of its nationwide protest movement against the newly enacted 27th Amendment. The 27th Amendment was signed into law on November 13 after passage from the parliament amid strong criticism by the opposition parties. The legislation, which has brought major structural changes to the judiciary and the military , has been assailed by the legal fraternity , even former and sitting judges , as an “ attack ” on judicial independence. In a meeting on Friday, the TTAP had vowed to vigorously protest to “restore the Constitution to its original form”. Under a plan announced then, members of parties under the TTAP umbrella gathered outside Parliament House today to hold a protest. They then marched to the Supreme Court on Constitution Avenue. TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI Senator Faisal Javed were at the forefront of the march, visuals shared by the TTAP on social media platform X showed. “Battle will persist till the judiciary’s independence,” they chanted. TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai could be seen participating in the march as well. At the protest outside Parliament House, visuals shared by the TTAP showed protesters holding banners that read “Death to dictatorship, long live democracy”, “27th Amendment rejected”, and “Subjugation of the judiciary is the public’s subjugation”. Achakzai, Abbas, Raja, ex-senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser were among the key leaders present at the protest. Others included PTI MNAs Zain Qureshi and Junaid Akbar, Balochistan National Party-Mengal’s (BNP-M) Sajid Tareen, Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai and PTI lawyer Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry. The gathered protesters chanted, “ Aise dastoor ko nahi maantey, subh-i-be-nur ko nahi maantey ” (we do not accept this constitution, we do not accept this morning bereft of light) — echoing Habib Jalib’s poetry , also used by opposition lawmakers in recent parliamentary sessions . The TTAP leaders also raised slogans in favour of PTI founder Imran Khan, with some holding party flags. National moot planned; ‘Black Day’ on Friday Addressing the media, Achakzai announced that TTAP will organise a national conference on the 27th Amendment, where judges, lawyers, journalists, experts, and others will be invited. The TTAP chief, as decided in the group’s Friday meeting , also announced that a “Black Day” will be observed on Friday (November 21) across the country in protest of the 27th Amendment. He reiterated the TTAP’s objection to the lifetime immunities granted to the army chief and the president through the 27th Amendment, stressing that every person shall be held accountable for their actions under Islam. Achakzai further said that even if a political party held a “100 per cent mandate” in the parliament, it could not change the “basic structure” of the Constitution of civilian supremacy. “The military, the judiciary, everyone will be independent in their functions, but they must be subservient to the elected parliament,” he asserted. Speaking to reporters, Qaiser said the TTAP leadership, civil society, lawyers, mediapersons and other stakeholders will gather next week to formulate the future action plan. In a post on X, Qaiser said protesters criticised the government for “disfiguring the unanimous Constitution of 1973 through force and horse-trading”. “We do not accept any 26th or 27th Amendment passed through the back as they fundamentally aim to bring the judiciary under the executive,” he added. At the protest, Raja stressed that PTI lawmakers were the “representatives of the Pakistani public” and they rejected the new amendments, saying they were an “attack on the judiciary and the people”. “Your [and] my life, property, chaddor (honour), privacy — all has been taken away,” he claimed. Yesterday, PTI MPAs held a walk from the Punjab Assembly to Charing Cross on The Mall to record their protest against the passage of the 27th Amendment. Last week, the TTAP also said a resolution would be presented in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly against the 27th Amendment. The TTAP, formed in April last year, is a coalition of six opposition parties, including the PTI. Earlier in July, it formalised its organisational structure, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests.",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan calls for ending occupation of Palestine after UNSC adopts resolution on Gaza peace plan",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad stressed on Monday the need for ending the occupation of Palestinian territories and paving the way for Palestinian statehood through a credible political process. “We believe that in order to break the cycle of violence, it is absolutely necessary to end the occupation, and to have a political horizon, open the pathway to the Palestinian State through a credible, time-bound political process firmly anchored in the relevant UN resolutions,” he said while speaking at the UN Security Council (UNSC) after it adopt a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza. The plan also authorises an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for the Palestinian enclave. Thirteen UNSC members, including Pakistan, voted in favour of the resolution, while Russia and China abstained — notable given earlier signals that Moscow might veto the text. Israel and Hamas agreed last month to the first phase of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza — a ceasefire in their two-year war and a hostage-release deal — but the UN resolution approved by the Security Council is seen as vital to legitimising a transitional governance body and reassuring countries that are considering sending troops to Gaza. Pakistan said it voted in favour of the resolution in order to halt the fighting, protect civilians, and reinforce a ceasefire that could open the way to humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and a full Israeli withdrawal from the enclave. Ambassador Ahmad explained that Islamabad backed the plan with one overriding purpose: “To stop the bloodshed, to save the lives of innocent Palestinians, including women and children, to maintain the ceasefire, and to secure the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.” He said Pakistan’s vote was guided by the position of the Palestinians, the Arab Group, and the eight-nation Arab-Islamic grouping — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, and Türkiye — which endorsed Trump’s initiative earlier this year. “Our vote has been guided by the position of Palestine and the Arab Group,” he said, adding that the joint engagement was aimed at ending the conflict, ensuring humanitarian access, preventing displacement, and supporting “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. The ambassador noted that Pakistan worked actively during negotiations, supporting Arab amendments and proposing its own changes to ensure the text aligned with “international legitimacy” on the Palestinian question. He welcomed the inclusion of some proposals, such as the explicit call for maintaining the ceasefire and the requirement for regular reporting to the UNSC, but said several critical issues remained unaddressed. “A clear political path to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, the central role of the Palestinian Authority in governance and reconstruction, and enhanced involvement of the UN … are crucial aspects,” he said. “We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity,” he added. Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed Pakistan’s consistent policy that any peace initiative must lead to a sovereign, independent and contiguous Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. He underscored that existing UNSC resolutions “remain fully valid,” cautioning that the new resolution should not “alter or diminish” the body of established international law on the conflict. He stressed that the right to self-determination is “inherent and unconditional … and cannot be subjected to any conditions”. The ambassador said the proposed Board of Peace must remain a temporary oversight mechanism whose mandate expires in 2027 unless renewed. “Executive and administrative authority in Gaza must remain with the Palestinians through a Palestinian Committee,” he added. He insisted that the Palestinian Authority must play a central role in governance and reconstruction. “Peace cannot be achieved by bypassing the Palestinians. There must be an end to policies that undermine and weaken the Palestinian Authority,“ he said. Talking about the ISF, Ahmad said it could be stabilising only if it operated under a clear UN-consistent mandate. Disarmament, he said, must be carried out through a negotiated political process under a unified Palestinian National Authority. He warned that unilateral violations of the ceasefire could “threaten and thwart the entire process”, and emphasised that the ISF’s mandate would only be effective “once there is complete Israeli withdrawal”. Referring to the scale of devastation in Gaza, the ambassador said more than 69,000 Palestinians had been killed over the past two years. A “ray of hope,” he said, had emerged with the summit in Sharm-el-Sheikh in October — where Egypt, Qatar, Türkiye and the United States signed the peace agreement that underpins the current plan. The UN envoy urged the international community to uphold its responsibilities and support a credible, time-bound process towards Palestinian statehood. He stressed that there must be “no annexation and no forced displacement” and that the territorial contiguity of the West Bank and Gaza was essential for a viable state. Looking ahead, he said the UN, the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian people must play central roles in governance, reconstruction and institution-building. At the close of his address, the ambassador reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the Palestinian people. “Their suffering is our anguish; their resilience is our pride; their aspirations our cause,“ he said, adding that Pakistan’s support for their right to self-determination would remain “unwavering” until its full realisation. In a post on X afterwards, Ambassador Ahmad noted: “Looking ahead, the central roles of the United Nations, the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian people are vital in ensuring legitimate governance, reconstruction, and institution building in Gaza. “The international community must stand with them steadfastly and firmly.” Adoption of the resolution The text of the resolution says member states can take part in the Board of Peace, envisioned as a transitional authority that would oversee the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza. It also authorises the ISF, which would ensure a process of demilitarising Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure. Trump’s 20-point plan is included as an annexe to the resolution. Russia, which holds a veto on the UNSC, earlier signalled potential opposition to the resolution but abstained from the vote, allowing the resolution to pass. After the vote, US Ambassador Mike Waltz thanked UNSC members, calling the decision a “historic and constructive resolution” that sets a new direction for the region. “Thank you for joining us in charting a new course in the Middle East for Israelis and Palestinians and all the people of the region alike,” he said, adding that the adoption of the resolution represents “another significant step” toward a stable and prosperous Gaza and an environment in which Israel could live securely. He emphasised that the ISF and the new investment mechanisms would work in tandem: “The former will support a region free from Hamas’ grip, and the latter Gaza’s reconstruction and development.” Hamas rejects resolution Hamas, however, rejected the resolution, saying it failed to meet Palestinians’ rights and demands and seeks to impose an international trusteeship on the enclave that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose. “Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,” the group added. The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of Israel’s onslaught , sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct 7, 2023. The resolution’s text also says that “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform programme and Gaza’s redevelopment has advanced. That eventuality has already been firmly rejected by Israel. “Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory has not changed,” Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday.",

At the close of his address, the ambassador reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the Palestinian people. “Their suffering is our anguish; their resilience is our pride; their aspirations our cause,“ he said, adding that Pakistan’s support for their right to self-determination would remain “unwavering” until its full realisation. In a post on X afterwards, Ambassador Ahmad noted: “Looking ahead, the central roles of the United Nations, the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian people are vital in ensuring legitimate governance, reconstruction, and institution building in Gaza. “The international community must stand with them steadfastly and firmly.” Adoption of the resolution The text of the resolution says member states can take part in the Board of Peace, envisioned as a transitional authority that would oversee the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza. It also authorises the ISF, which would ensure a process of demilitarising Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure. Trump’s 20-point plan is included as an annexe to the resolution. Russia, which holds a veto on the UNSC, earlier signalled potential opposition to the resolution but abstained from the vote, allowing the resolution to pass. After the vote, US Ambassador Mike Waltz thanked UNSC members, calling the decision a “historic and constructive resolution” that sets a new direction for the region. “Thank you for joining us in charting a new course in the Middle East for Israelis and Palestinians and all the people of the region alike,” he said, adding that the adoption of the resolution represents “another significant step” toward a stable and prosperous Gaza and an environment in which Israel could live securely. He emphasised that the ISF and the new investment mechanisms would work in tandem: “The former will support a region free from Hamas’ grip, and the latter Gaza’s reconstruction and development.” Hamas rejects resolution Hamas, however, rejected the resolution, saying it failed to meet Palestinians’ rights and demands and seeks to impose an international trusteeship on the enclave that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose. “Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,” the group added. The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of Israel’s onslaught , sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct 7, 2023. The resolution’s text also says that “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform programme and Gaza’s redevelopment has advanced. That eventuality has already been firmly rejected by Israel. “Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory has not changed,” Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday.",

      "summary_orig": "The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Tuesday barred the police from harassing an Indian woman who had filed a petition against them. The woman, formerly Sikh, had come to Pakistan for religious purposes but had converted to Islam to marry the second petitioner, her now-husband. She complained that the police had conducted an “illegal raid on their house in Farooqabad, Sheikhupura district, and pressured her to end the marriage.” The petition was heard by Justice Farooq Haider, who ordered the police to stop harassing the petitioners. The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn , was filed on November 12 under Article 199 (jurisdiction of High Court) of the Constitution . It named both the woman and her husband as the petitioners and Punjab’s inspector general of police (IGP), the regional police officer of Sheikhupura, the district police officers (DPOs) of Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib, the station house officers (SHOs) of the same, and another resident of Farooq Abad as respondents. The petition alleged that, based on the woman’s former religion, this other resident had requested the SHOs to conduct an illegal raid on the petitioners’ home twice, on November 8 and 11. It said the SHOs caused “undue harassment towards them” and forced them to dissolve the marriage. The petition added, “The police functionaries are duty-bound to provide legal protection as guaranteed by Article 35 of the Constitution … the state is duty-bound to protect the life and liberty of spouses.” In addition to Article 35 (protection of family, etc), it also cited Article 9 (security of person) to argue that no person should be deprived of life or liberty except in accordance with the law. It also said that the husband was a citizen of Pakistan, while his wife had also approached the embassy to extend her visa and obtain Pakistani nationality. The petition submitted that the respondents’ actions were “against the law and fundamental rights” and severely infringed on the petitioners’ rights. It added that the petitioners would suffer “irreparable loss and injury” if the court did not issue a proper direction restraining the respondents from causing undue harassment. It requested the LHC to “graciously” direct the respondents not to cause undue harassment to the petitioners and “not to interfere [with] the matrimonial life of the petitioners”, as well as any other relief the court deemed fit. A report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) in August found an alarming rise in violence against religious minorities during the last year, including the targeted killing of Ahmadis and extra-judicial killings by the police of those accused of blasphemy. The HRCP underscored the urgent need for reform within law enforcement and accountability mechanisms.",

The woman, formerly Sikh, had come to Pakistan for religious purposes but had converted to Islam to marry the second petitioner, her now-husband. She complained that the police had conducted an “illegal raid on their house in Farooqabad, Sheikhupura district, and pressured her to end the marriage.” The petition was heard by Justice Farooq Haider, who ordered the police to stop harassing the petitioners. The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn , was filed on November 12 under Article 199 (jurisdiction of High Court) of the Constitution . It named both the woman and her husband as the petitioners and Punjab’s inspector general of police (IGP), the regional police officer of Sheikhupura, the district police officers (DPOs) of Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib, the station house officers (SHOs) of the same, and another resident of Farooq Abad as respondents. The petition alleged that, based on the woman’s former religion, this other resident had requested the SHOs to conduct an illegal raid on the petitioners’ home twice, on November 8 and 11. It said the SHOs caused “undue harassment towards them” and forced them to dissolve the marriage. The petition added, “The police functionaries are duty-bound to provide legal protection as guaranteed by Article 35 of the Constitution … the state is duty-bound to protect the life and liberty of spouses.” In addition to Article 35 (protection of family, etc), it also cited Article 9 (security of person) to argue that no person should be deprived of life or liberty except in accordance with the law. It also said that the husband was a citizen of Pakistan, while his wife had also approached the embassy to extend her visa and obtain Pakistani nationality. The petition submitted that the respondents’ actions were “against the law and fundamental rights” and severely infringed on the petitioners’ rights. It added that the petitioners would suffer “irreparable loss and injury” if the court did not issue a proper direction restraining the respondents from causing undue harassment. It requested the LHC to “graciously” direct the respondents not to cause undue harassment to the petitioners and “not to interfere [with] the matrimonial life of the petitioners”, as well as any other relief the court deemed fit. A report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) in August found an alarming rise in violence against religious minorities during the last year, including the targeted killing of Ahmadis and extra-judicial killings by the police of those accused of blasphemy. The HRCP underscored the urgent need for reform within law enforcement and accountability mechanisms.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States is the biggest recipient of China’s lending activities globally, according to a study that tracked Beijing’s credit activities and found it is increasingly lending to higher-income countries over developing countries. The report , published on Tuesday by AidData, a research lab at US university William & Mary, said China’s lending and grant giving totalled $2.2 trillion across 200 countries in every region of the world from 2000 to 2023. During this period, Pakistan received $74 billion, the report shows , ranking it as the fifth largest recipient. China has long been seen as a creditor to developing countries through its Belt and Road initiative , but is shifting toward lending to advanced economies — backing strategic infrastructure and high‑tech supply chains in areas such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence and clean energy. Beijing’s portfolio size is two-to-four times larger than previous estimates suggest, AidData said, adding that China remains the world’s largest official creditor. More than three-quarters of China’s overseas lending operations now support projects and activities in upper-middle-income countries and high-income countries. “Much of the lending to wealthy countries is focused on critical infrastructure, critical minerals and the acquisition of high-tech assets like semiconductor companies,” said lead author Brad Parks, AidData’s executive director. The United States received the most official sector credit from China, more than $200bn for nearly 2,500 projects and activities, the report said. Chinese state-owned entities are “active in every corner and sector of the US”, bankrolling the construction of liquefied natural gas projects in Texas and Louisiana, data centres in Northern Virginia, terminals at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport, the Matterhorn Express Natural Gas pipeline and the Dakota Access Oil pipeline, AidData said. Beijing has financed the acquisition of high-tech companies while Chinese state-owned creditors have provided credit facilities for many Fortune 500 companies, including Amazon, AT&T, Verizon, Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Boeing and Disney, the report said. The share of lending to low and lower-middle income countries fell to 12 per cent in 2023 from 88pc in 2000. Beijing has also cut lending for infrastructure projects in the “Global South”, under its Belt and Road Initiative. At the same time, it has ramped up its share that supports middle-income and high-income countries to 76pc in 2023 from 24pc in 2000. The United Kingdom, for instance, received $60bn, while the European Union got $161bn.",

He said that one of them died on the spot when the IED detonated prematurely while it was being installed. The other terrorist was injured and escaped the scene, he added. The spokesperson said police had reached the spot and were collecting evidence. Meanwhile, the process for the identification of the dead terrorist had also been initiated, he said. A search operation was also under way to track down the other terrorist, he added. Today’s incident comes around a month after law enforcers foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in Bannu. According to police, terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had tried to attack the Baka Khel police station from a distance in the October 19 incident. But, police personnel opened fire on them after detecting their movement, preventing the terrorists from coming near the police station. Eventually, the terrorists fled, a police statement said. In a similar incident on October 17 , three terrorists were killed after they attempted to attack a police checkpost in Bannu late at night. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.",

Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). First, an IBO was conducted by security forces in Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said. In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said. It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, asserting that the counter terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operations. In a statement, he said that work would continue on eliminating foreign-backed terrorists with national consensus. He attributed the killing of the terrorist ringleader to the successful strategy of the security forces. He further said that political moves to divert attention from the national consensus on terrorism would not be tolerated. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces. “Under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security forces are achieving great successes against terrorism,” he said in a statement. “We are determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country,” he said. Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.",
