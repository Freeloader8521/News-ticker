The abrupt cancellation of the meeting, which would have been the first of its kind among the three leaders in nearly five months, is likely to worsen bipartisan conflicts over various contentious issues. Jang said he was boycotting the luncheon in protest of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea’s (DPK) unilateral passage of two controversial judicial reform bills at the National Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee the previous evening.

      "summary_orig": "Bangladeshis lined up outside polling booths on Thursday as voting began for what many say is a pivotal election for the South Asian nation, marking a return to democracy after the 2024 ouster of long-time premier Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-driven uprising. Analysts say a decisive result is crucial for steady governance in the nation of 175 million, as the deadly anti-Hasina protests triggered months of unrest and disrupted key industries, including the garments sector, the worlds second-largest exporter. It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party leader Shafiqur Rahman reacts after casting his vote at a polling station during Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka on February 12, 2026. — AFP The contest pits two coalitions led by former allies, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, with opinion polls giving an edge to the BNP. In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008. “I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.” Hasina’s Awami League is banned, and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi deteriorate. Unlike previous elections marred by opposition boycotts and intimidation, more than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, are vying for 300 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The Trump administration’s point man for South and Central Asia has told Congress that Pakistan remains an important US partner in the region, with Washington seeking to expand trade, economic cooperation, and security ties with the country. Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Sub-committee on South and Central Asia on Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored Pakistan’s role in regional engagement and highlighted growing bilateral cooperation. “Pakistan is another important partner in the region. We are working together with Pakistan to realise the potential of its critical mineral resources , combining US government seed financing with private sector know-how would benefit both of our countries,” he told the sub-committee. Referring to broader economic engagement, Kapur said: “Our trade in energy and agriculture is expanding as well.” He also pointed to continued security cooperation between the two countries, adding: “And our ongoing counter-terrorism cooperation helps Pakistan combat internal security threats while addressing transnational dangers that can harm the US or our partners.” During the subsequent question-and-answer session, lawmakers raised issues related to militancy, Pakistan’s past security strategy and broader regional dynamics. Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States. Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups. When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere. The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect. The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests. He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific. Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence. At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said. Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people. She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute. Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable. Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces. “We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.",

Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States. Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups. When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere. The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect. The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests. He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific. Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence. At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said. Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people. She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute. Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable. Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces. “We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.",

      "summary": "WASHINGTON: The Trump administration’s point man for South and Central Asia has told Congress that Pakistan remains an important US partner in the region, with Washington seeking to expand trade, economic cooperation, and security ties with the country.

      "summary_orig": "THE UN Security Council Monitoring Team’s regular reports point to the threats terrorist groups continue to pose across the world. These reports have long painted a grim picture of the situation in Afghanistan vis-à-vis the permissive environment in that country for violent outfits. The latest document suggests that the banned TTP may potentially pose an extra-regional threat . Pakistan has been suffering from the brutality of TTP violence for nearly two decades. But if the warning is not heeded, the terrorist group may spread its tentacles to other states. The UN report also warns about the presence of IS-K terrorists at locations along the Pak-Afghan border. The latest document presents an unflattering yet unsurprising picture of the terrorist milieu in Afghanistan. For example, it says that the TTP is “one of the largest terrorist groups in Afghanistan”, while it is accorded “greater liberty and support from the de facto authorities” (the Afghan Taliban). The report also expresses apprehensions that the TTP may expand cooperation with Al Qaeda , which, too, enjoys cordial ties with the Kabul regime. And while IS-K is under “sustained counterterrorism pressure”, the violent outfit retains “significant operational and combat capability”. One bloodstained example of these capabilities was witnessed in the shape of the Feb 6 imambargah bombing in Islamabad. Notably, the UNSC report says that while the Afghan Taliban authorities say no terrorist groups are active in their country, “no Member State supported this view”. As the report illustrates, there is a need for immediate action where the terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan is concerned. Pakistan has borne the brunt of the TTP’s barbaric campaign, losing thousands of valuable lives to the group’s terrorist attacks. If the TTP is not stopped in its tracks immediately, other countries in the region may be next on the terrorist group’s hit list. That is why, as this paper has consistently argued, there is a need to address the problem of Afghanistan-based militancy collectively, with all of Kabul’s neighbours sending the same message to the Taliban: they must take action against violent groups on Afghan soil. Many would have thought that the Taliban would have learnt a lesson from hosting Al Qaeda during their first stint in power, thereafter paving the way for the US invasion following 9/11. But this is clearly not the case as Kabul’s rulers continue to host bloodthirsty militants, even as they fight IS-K — purely for ideological reasons since IS-K does not recognise the Taliban’s legitimacy. Afghanistan’s neighbours must be unambiguous in stating that if Kabul wants regional recognition, trade and integration, it must rein in terrorist groups. Further, Pakistan must stay alert and prevent the infiltration of IS-K terrorists and neutralise their cells and collaborators in the country. Published in Dawn, February 12th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "IF you are trying to follow the discussion around the government’s attempt to reduce net metering rates and find it too technical or too confusing, don’t worry. You’re not alone, and more importantly, as an ordinary consumer, you don’t need to get into the technicalities. All you need, as a user of electricity, is a clear and firm idea of where your specific interests lie. Around 10 years ago, the electricity in my bills cost me Rs20 per unit, including taxes and everything. Today, the same cost is around Rs60 and sometimes as high as Rs70. All of us have been hit by this tsunami of inflation. Some of us tried to cope with it by investing in a rooftop solar system in the hopes that once it pays itself off, it will provide us with some protection from the skyrocketing price of electricity. These prices did not skyrocket because of anything we did. They rose for two reasons. First, because the rupee fell against the dollar, and most of our electricity prices are indexed to the dollar since we rely on imported fuel and equipment in order to generate it. Second, the bureaucrats cannot run the power system and won’t let anyone else run it either. The most visible marker of their failure to operate the power system is the rise of the circular debt. So they kept taking the costs of their failures and passing them on to us. When their failures to run the power system led to the rise of the circular debt in the years since 2005, they moved to make the rest of us pay the interest cost of carrying this debt. In 2014, they succeeded, and we have had interest payments on the circular debt as part of our bills ever since. This is just one example, though a stark one. In 2016, they decided to make costs of raising a CPEC security force a ‘pass-through item’, meaning it would be part of the costs of a project that consumers pay through their bills. In 2023, they also started applying a withholding tax on income from net metering benefits. Good luck getting this refunded at the end of the year when you come around to filing your tax returns! Either way, we had no choice but to pay. We were prisoners inside this grid. The story goes on and on. Over the years, so many costs were bundled into the system — some visible in the bills but many tucked away as ‘pass-through’ items from generation companies which you cannot see but that are inside the variable charges of your bill — that the power system be­­came too large and too unwieldy for the bureaucrats and its losses mounted. In 2007, when I was covering the rise of the circular debt, it made headlines when it crossed Rs30 billion. By 2024, it had crossed Rs2 trillion . There were many contributing factors behind this rise, including system losses, but also larger macroeconomic mismanagement by the government, which led to devaluation of the rupee and hikes in dollar-indexed payments, as well as higher interest costs. None of this was our fault, yours or mine. But the costs of it all were billed straight to us. Then came the real killer: the devaluations of 2022 and 2023. As the rupee plummeted against the dollar, power bills skyrocketed. In rupee terms, my bills more than tripled in this period. In dollar terms, they barely rose a few cents. Either way, we had no choice but to pay. We were prisoners inside this grid. Look at your bills over the past decade and work out what percentage of your household income was going to pay for electricity. The sharply rising proportion is your prisoner tax, and left to its own devices, this would have continued indefinitely, forever. But the prison walls were breached at some point with the arrival of rooftop solar. At first, it moved slowly, between 2016 and 2020, as power utilities stonewalled people’s net metering licence applications. But once the stonewalling ended, a stampede ensued. The sheer scale with which solar adoption grew in Pakistan post-2020 made global headlines. The scale of the defection from the grid was like a prison break, with people fleeing in growing numbers as the price of electricity spiralled out of control in the inflationary fire of 2022 and 2023. The bureaucrats are angry because their best prisoners have found an alternative source of supply and can reduce their reliance on the grid. They are demanding that these people be rounded up and brought back and be made to buy the expensive electricity from the grid that has so many costs bundled into it that you need two separate Master’s degrees to be able to understand them, one in finance and the second in engineering. You don’t need to get into the technical issues to get this. You just need to know your own mind. Are you happy paying for all those ‘fixed costs’ the bureaucrats want to saddle you with in their grid? If not, then make your exit. The solar revolution has entered its next phase with the arrival of batteries. If the grid wants to pay me Rs11 for my electricity and charge me Rs60 for its electricity, I have a solution: simply store my electricity and use it myself. In the years ahead, more grid defections will take place and these will be permanent. The bureaucrats will probably try to halt these too, by adding sharp taxes and duties on batteries, but they will be unsuccessful because the local production of batteries has already begun. The grid is in terminal decline. It would be better to just admit that and start managing the transition rather than thrashing around like this to first spur solar adoption, then swivel around to try and stop it. The state looks rather foolish now, first announcing a solar policy, then grinding its teeth at those who opted for it.

      "summary_orig": "• Palestinian leader demands ‘firm response’ from US over international law violation • Berlin joins criticism, calling move a step towards ‘de facto annexation’ GENEVA: The United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday that Israel’s plans to tighten control over the occupied West Bank pave the way for further settlement expansion and represent a step toward consolidating “illegal annexation”. Israel’s security cabinet on Sunday approved measures allowing Jewish Israelis to buy West Bank land directly and extending greater Israeli control over areas where the Palestinian Authority exercises power. The plan further grants Israel the authority to administer certain religious sites located in areas under Palestinian Authority control. The plans, which have sparked international outrage, modify the administration established under the Oslo Accords in the 1990s. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said the decisions by Israel’s security cabinet were the latest in a string of measures to annex Palestinian lands. “This is yet another step by the Israeli authorities towards rendering a viable Palestinian state impossible, in violation of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” Turk said in a statement. “If these decisions are implemented, they will undoubtedly accelerate the dispossession of Palestinians and their forcible transfer, and lead to the creation of more illegal Israeli settlements.” Turk noted that these measures would further deprive Palestinians of natural resources and restrict their human rights. He stated the moves will “further cement Israel’s control and integration of the occupied West Bank into Israel, consolidating unlawful annexation”. The UN official warned that these policies are part of a wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers and security forces, alongside a pattern of evictions, home demolitions, and land grabs. “We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” Turk said. “These decisions must be overturned.” Meanwhile, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas called for a “firm response” from the United States and the international community. Speaking during a visit to Oslo on Wednesday, Abbas said he discussed the issue with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store. “These serious violations require a firm response from the US administration and the international community because they hinder President Donald Trump’s efforts and constitute a violation of international law,” Abbas said. Abbas also cited issues including Israeli settler violence and Israel’s freezing of funds intended for the Palestinian people. Germany joined the chorus of criticism on Wednesday, with the foreign ministry calling the move “a further step towards de facto annexation.” “Israel remains an occupying power in the West Bank, and as an occupying power it is a violation of international law to build settlements, including transferring certain administrative functions to civilian Israeli authorities,” a German foreign ministry spokesman said in Berlin.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: In a fresh round of ambassadorial appointments, the government posted envoys across Europe, Africa and Asia, with several senior diplomats reassigned and a few vacancies filled. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, while announcing the new appointments, emphasised economic diplomacy as a central focus of Pakistan’s external engagement. “Building on the momentum of the last two years of robust foreign policy engagement and international outreach, may our envoys carry this mission forward with clarity of purpose and wisdom, with a clear emphasis on economic diplomacy,” Mr Dar posted on X. In Europe, Saadia Altaf Qazi, Pakistan’s ambassador to Norway, has been posted as ambassador to Thailand. She will replace Rukhsana Afzaal in Bangkok. Her transfer created a vacancy in Oslo, where Asim Ali Khan will replace her. Salman Sharif, presently serving at the Prime Minister’s Office, has been named ambassador to Germany. He will take over from Saqlain Syeda in Berlin. Pakistan’s embassy in Sweden will be headed by Ahmed Amjad Ali, currently consul general in Los Angeles. He replaced Bilal Hayee in Stockholm. Dar says clear emphasis on economic diplomacy, terms it central to external engagement In the United Kingdom, where Pakistan maintains a high commission, Tipu Usman, currently chief of protocol at the Foreign Office, has been appointed high commissioner to London. He replaced Dr Mohammad Faisal, who will return to the FO. At the United Nations in Geneva, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, who is serving as Foreign Office spokesperson, has been appointed Pakistan’s permanent representative. He replaced Bilal Ahmed. In a corresponding move, Mr Ahmed has been appointed as ambassador to Kenya, replacing Ibrar Hussain Khan in Nairobi. In Central Asia, Irfan Ahmed, director general for Europe at the Foreign Office, has been posted as ambassador to Tajikistan. The position in Dushanbe had been vacant. Meanwhile, Mudassir Tipu, currently Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran, has been appointed ambassador to Uzbekistan, replacing Ahmed Farooq in Tashkent. His move cleared the way for Imran Ahmed Siddiqui, presently additional secretary at the Foreign Office, to take over as ambassador in Tehran. In Africa, Hasnain Yousaf, currently director general of the Special Investment Facilitation Council at the Foreign Office, has been appointed ambassador to Tanzania, replacing Siraj Ahmed Khan in Dar es Salaam. Ashar Shahzad, presently deputy consul in Houston, has been named ambassador to Uganda, replacing Hassan Wazir in Kampala. In South Asia, Mohammad Aamir Khan, director general for the Americas at the Foreign Office, has been appointed ambassador to Nepal, replacing Abrar Hashmi in Kathmandu. In addition to the ambassadorial postings, the government also announced appointments to several consul general posts. Ali Anser Zaidi has been posted to Frankfurt, Yasir Iqbal Butt to Guangzhou, Shahbaz Hussain to Kandahar, Siraj Ahmad Khan to Los Angeles, Awais Ahmad Khan to Mazar-e-Sharif, and Faisal Abro to Montreal.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) enabled the recovery of about Rs506 billion in disputed tax revenue over the past year by deciding hundreds of long-pending tax and revenue cases and lifting stay orders that had blocked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from collecting dues, according to the court’s Annual Report 2025-26. The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation. To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC). A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes. Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog. LHC strikes down PRA sales tax case against Fauji Wind Energy on jurisdiction grounds Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn. According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn. The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn. The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years. The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives. The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”. Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records. Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction. A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025. Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority. The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million. The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog. LHC strikes down PRA sales tax case against Fauji Wind Energy on jurisdiction grounds Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn. According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn. The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn. The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years. The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives. The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”. Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records. Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction. A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025. Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority. The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million. The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

      "title": "Rs506bn unlocked as IHC clears  tax backlog",
      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) enabled the recovery of about Rs506 billion in disputed tax revenue over the past year by deciding hundreds of long-pending tax and revenue cases and lifting stay orders that had blocked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from collecting dues, according to the court’s Annual Report 2025-26. The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation. To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC). A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes. Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas.

      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday appreciated efforts for easing tensions and promoting regional peace, warning that any military escalation involving Iran could destabilise the Gulf region, South and Western Asia. He said this while addressing a ceremony hosted by the Iranian embassy in Islamabad on the 47th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “Any instability involving Iran, or any attempt to resolve issues through military means, carries grave risks. Such actions could … undermine global peace, and cause serious harm to the global economy. The stakes are far too high for confrontation,” President Zardari said. He further stated that Pakistan opposed unilateral sanctions and coercive measures, including against Iran, and believed that “peaceful engagement best serves regional and global security”. “Pakistan welcomes efforts aimed at easing tensions and encourages continued dialogue among relevant parties in a constructive spirit, with the objective of promoting peace and stability in the region,” he added. Earlier, the president requested the participants of the ceremony to observe one minute of silence in the memory of victims of the recent blast in Islamabad , and the tragedies in Iran. “Let’s pray that wars never come to us,” he said. Referring to ongoing conflicts, terrorism, external interference and unresolved regional flashpoints in the region, the president said Pakistan firmly believed that such challenges could not be addressed through force or unilateral actions. He also emphasised that Pakistan and Iran shared responsibilities as neighbouring countries and remained committed to cooperating on border management, counter-terrorism and “turning the shared frontier into a zone of cooperation, lawful trade and development”. The president stressed that Pakistan valued balanced relations globally and was ready to play a constructive role in promoting restraint, dialogue and regional peace. He extended his warm congratulations to the leadership and people of Iran. “May our partnership continue to grow, and may our region move towards security, stability and shared prosperity,” he said. The president added Pakistan and Iran were not just neighbours, but also “civilisational partners”. “Our shared border reflects centuries of interaction, coexistence and mutual respect,” he stated. “Our relationship is rooted in faith, history and enduring cultural bonds that continue to shape our region.” He noted that the Persian language and its great literary tradition had profoundly influenced Pakistan’s intellectual life, adding that for hundreds of years, it was the official language of some of the regions that were now a part of Pakistan. “Its influence remains deeply embedded in our national consciousness. Pakistan’s national anthem itself reflects the deep imprint of the Persian language on our collective identity,” he stated. The president remembered Sachal Sarmast, a renowned 18th-century poet in Sindh, on the occasion, saying that he composed poetry in Persian, which reflected “a shared spiritual and philosophical space”. “Poets and thinkers such as Rumi, Hafiz, Saadi and Ferdowsi are widely respected in Pakistan, while Iqbal, who wrote much of his work in Persian, remains a shared symbol of dignity and renewal for both our societies,” he added. In his welcome address, Iranian Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam said that despite facing various external pressures and challenges, Iran had made remarkable progress in key sectors, including technology, defence, science and the economy. He noted that the Iranian nation had “consistently demonstrated resilience and self-reliance”, turning challenges into opportunities and continuing its journey of development with determination. Moghadam said that Iran did “not seek war and believes in resolving disputes through dialogue and diplomacy”. However, he made it clear that if a war broke out, Iran would “fully retaliate in defence of its sovereignty”. The ambassador appreciated the government and people of Pakistan for their support, particularly during “Israeli aggression against Iran”.",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least four policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), were martyred on Wednesday as armed terrorists attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area, police said. According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation. The operation was conducted in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Nawab police station following intelligence reports about militants’ presence in the area, it said, adding that the area was cordoned off before the search operation was initiated. While the police party was returning, militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire, the statement said. Four policemen were martyred in the attack and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire. The officers who lost their lives included SHO Faheem Mumtaz, Constable Irfan Khan, Constable Ghulam Subhani, and Constable Wajahat, the statement said. Paharpur Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police Hafiz Adnan and Assistant Sub-Inspector Tariq were injured in the attack. A police spokesperson earlier said that the martyrs and the wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Teaching Hospital for treatment. Following the incident, the spokesperson said, a heavy contingent of police, led by District Police Officer Sajad Ahmed Sahebzada, reached the scene and launched clearance a search operation to apprehend the militants. The police statement said that the area had been sealed off and the search and clearance operation was under way. It added that efforts were being made to recover the bodies of the slain militants from the forest area, while security in nearby localities has been further tightened. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack. “Eliminating the cancer of terrorism sponsored from abroad from the country is the topmost priority,” the president was quoted as saying. The statement added that he extended his prayers to the martyrs’ families and wished the wounded a swift recovery. Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took notice of the incident and strongly condemned it. In a statement, he paid tribute to the sacrifices of the martyred personnel. “The provincial government will provide all possible assistance to the affected families,” he said. He further said that the KP police were at the frontline in the fight against terrorism. “Terrorism is a common challenge for the entire country. Actions against elements hostile to peace will be further intensified in the province,” he said. He said police morale could not be dampened by such cowardly acts. CM Afridi said that a comprehensive and effective strategy was essential for the complete eradication of terrorism. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi expressed deep sorrow over the attack.

      "summary_en": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least four policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), were martyred on Wednesday as armed terrorists attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area, police said. According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation. The operation was conducted in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Nawab police station following intelligence reports about militants’ presence in the area, it said, adding that the area was cordoned off before the search operation was initiated. While the police party was returning, militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire, the statement said. Four policemen were martyred in the attack and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire. The officers who lost their lives included SHO Faheem Mumtaz, Constable Irfan Khan, Constable Ghulam Subhani, and Constable Wajahat, the statement said. Paharpur Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police Hafiz Adnan and Assistant Sub-Inspector Tariq were injured in the attack. A police spokesperson earlier said that the martyrs and the wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Teaching Hospital for treatment. Following the incident, the spokesperson said, a heavy contingent of police, led by District Police Officer Sajad Ahmed Sahebzada, reached the scene and launched clearance a search operation to apprehend the militants. The police statement said that the area had been sealed off and the search and clearance operation was under way. It added that efforts were being made to recover the bodies of the slain militants from the forest area, while security in nearby localities has been further tightened. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack. “Eliminating the cancer of terrorism sponsored from abroad from the country is the topmost priority,” the president was quoted as saying. The statement added that he extended his prayers to the martyrs’ families and wished the wounded a swift recovery. Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took notice of the incident and strongly condemned it. In a statement, he paid tribute to the sacrifices of the martyred personnel. “The provincial government will provide all possible assistance to the affected families,” he said. He further said that the KP police were at the frontline in the fight against terrorism. “Terrorism is a common challenge for the entire country. Actions against elements hostile to peace will be further intensified in the province,” he said. He said police morale could not be dampened by such cowardly acts. CM Afridi said that a comprehensive and effective strategy was essential for the complete eradication of terrorism.

Speaking on the occasion, PM Shehbaz said, “These terrorists have no religion, and they have crossed all the limits of cruelty.” Talking to the affected families, he said the entire nation was in a state of grief and saddened over the tragic incident, which resulted in the martyrdom of elders and kids while scores of others were injured. He termed the incident the “worst kind of barbaric act”. PM Shehbaz said that all religious leaders had strongly condemned the incident with unity and praised them for foiling the nefarious designs of the enemies with solidarity.
