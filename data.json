But the proposal has sparked protests by Korean students and raised concerns that similar conflicts could emerge at other campuses. Earlier this month, the school announced that its 1,812-bed dormitory, which accounts for more than 37 percent of total housing capacity, would be reserved exclusively for international students starting in the spring semester. According to the student council, the move would have forced thousands of Korean students to compete for barely two-thirds of the remaining on-campus accommodation, with no gradual phase-in and little prior consultation. Strong backlash ensued. Student leaders accused the university of “infringing on the housing rights of local students” as it moves to improve living conditions for international students. This eventually forced the administration to backtrack on the plan. The school’s decision came against the backdrop of shrinking enrollment and new policy incentive",

It reflects the authorities’ understanding of the seriousness of the virus and their aim to act without feeding unnecessary alarm. This balance must be carefully maintained. Nipah is not an unfamiliar threat. Since its identification in the late 1990s, outbreaks have appeared intermittently across South and Southeast Asia, usually contained but often deadly. With a fatality rate that can exceed 70pc and with no approved vaccine or cure, the WHO has rightly classified it as a priority pathogen. These facts alone justify vigilance. But they do not justify panic. Health authorities and experts agree that the immediate risk to Pakistan remains minimal. The current outbreak in India is localised, with limited confirmed cases. Transmission dynamics, too, remain relatively constrained. Nipah does not spread as easily as airborne viruses such as Covid-19 or influenza. The virus spreads between people through direct exposure to bodily fluids such as saliva, respiratory secretions, or blood, which is why outbreaks usually remain limited to specific settings. That said, infectious diseases do not respect borders, and our porous frontiers, high population density and uneven health infrastructure make preparedness essential. The Border Health Services’ advisory mandating 100pc screening, verification of 21-day travel histories, thermal checks and immediate isolation of suspected cases is a necessary first line of defence. However, airport screening alone is not a foolproof shield. As experts have pointed out, the incubation period — often up to two weeks — means infected travellers may show no symptoms on arrival. Surveillance must therefore extend beyond entry points. Provincial health departments should ensure designated tertiary hospitals are ready, isolation facilities are functional, and laboratory staff is trained in safe sample handling. Rural areas, where human-animal contact is more common and health access weaker, deserve particular attention. Public communication is equally important. Authorities must resist sensationalism while providing clear, factual guidance. Citizens should be informed about basic precautions — avoiding close contact with sick individuals, practising hand hygiene, and reporting symptoms early. Calm preparedness, coordinated planning and transparent communication offer the best defence against a virus that is dangerous, but not uncontrollable. Published in Dawn, January 30th, 2026",

When asked if he would have talks with Iran, Trump told reporters: “I have had and I am planning on it.” “We have a group headed out to a place called Iran, and hopefully we won’t have to use it,” the US president added, while speaking to media at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania. As Brussels and Washington dialled up their rhetoric and Iran issued stark threats this week, UN chief Antonio Guterres has called for nuclear negotiations to “avoid a crisis that could have devastating consequences in the region”. An Iranian military spokesman warned Tehran’s response to any US action would not be limited — as it was in June last year when American planes and missiles briefly joined Israel’s short air war against Iran — but would be a decisive response “delivered instantly”. Brigadier General Mohammad Akraminia told state television US aircraft carriers have “serious vulnerabilities” and that numerous American bases in the Gulf region are “within the range of our medium-range missiles”. “If such a miscalculation is made by the Americans, it will certainly not unfold the way Trump imagines — carrying out a quick operation and then, two hours later, tweeting that the operation is over,” he said. An official in the Gulf, where states host US military sites, told AFP that fears of a US strike on Iran are “very clear”. “It would bring the region into chaos, it would hurt the economy not just in the region but in the US and cause oil and gas prices to skyrocket,” the official added. ‘Protests crushed in blood’ Qatar’s leader Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian held a call to discuss “efforts being made to de-escalate tensions and establish stability,” the Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported. The European Union, meanwhile, piled on the pressure by designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a “terrorist organisation” over a deadly crackdown on recent mass protests. “‘Terrorist’ is indeed how you call a regime that crushes its own people’s protests in blood,” said EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, welcoming the “overdue” decision. Though largely symbolic, the EU decision has already drawn a warning from Tehran. Iran’s military slammed “the illogical, irresponsible and spite-driven action of the European Union”, alleging the bloc was acting out of “obedience” to Tehran’s arch-foes the United States and Israel. Iranian officials have blamed the recent protest wave on the two countries, claiming their agents spurred “riots” and a “terrorist operation” that hijacked peaceful rallies sparked over economic grievances. In Tehran on Thursday, citizens expressed grim resignation. “I think the war is inevitable and a change must happen. It can be for worse, or better. I am not sure,” said a 29-year-old waitress, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. “I am not in favour of war. I just want something to happen that would result in something better.” Another 29-year-old woman, an unemployed resident of an upscale neighbourhood in northern Tehran, told AFP: “I believe that life has highs and lows and we are now at the lowest point.” Trump had threatened military action if protesters were killed in the anti-government demonstrations that erupted in late December and peaked on January 8 and 9. But his more recent statements have turned to Iran’s nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb. On Wednesday, he said “time is running out” for Tehran to make a deal, warning the US naval strike group that arrived in Middle East waters on Monday was “ready, willing and able” to hit Iran. Iranian authorities acknowledge that thousands were killed during the protests, giving a toll of more than 3,000 deaths, but say the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by “rioters”.

The operation, which continued from morning till evening, was launched in the Sperka and Kotka Akbar Ali Khan areas of the tehsil and at least seven militants were inju­red in the heavy shootout. The security forces targeted the terrorists’ hideouts with more than 25 quadcopter strikes, while a heavy exchange of fire continued throughout the clashes, sources claimed. The slain commander was identified as Zewaran alias Al-Badri, who was wanted in several cases. Following the operation, continuous surveillance by drones and helicopters was being carried out in the region to round up the remaining terrorists trying to flee the area. According to locals, the operation also resulted in the death of three civilians, including two women, whose bodies were retrieved from a house in the afternoon. A local resident told Dawn that the deceased included Naeemullah, his mother, and his grandmother. The deceased’s son, wife, sister and cousin also sustained injuries and were taken to a hospital. Separately, Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital spokesperson Muhammad Noman told Dawn that four injured persons were brought to the hospital, including two women and two children. Sources said the operation started in the morning and heavy contingents of police and security forces reached the area, while the residents were told to stay inside their houses. The operation was supervised by Bannu RPO Sajjad Khan, DPO Yasir Afridi, and other senior security officials. They remained present in the field and personally monitored the action. Earlier this week, two terrorists were killed in a shootout with police in Domel. On January 13, armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee in the district.

Prior to this, Israel had never officially accepted the tally and described the numbers issued by Gaza’s Health Ministry as “misleading and unreliable”, even though the UN considered them reliable. The IDF noted the casualty count excludes missing persons likely buried under rubble and only count those killed by military fire, excluding deaths from starvation or disease due to the conflict. Over 90 per cent of casualties have been identified by name and ID number. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, 71,667 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since Oct 7, 2023. 2 killed; prisoners swapped Meanwhile on Thursday, Israeli forces killed at least two Palestinians in Gaza, even as Hamas and Israel move to implement the second phase of a US-brokered peace plan. Medics said two men were killed by Israeli fire in eastern Khan Younis, in an area adjacent to where the army operates. According to the Gaza health ministry, Israeli airstrikes, tank shelling and gunfire have killed at least 490 people since the truce took effect in October. Israel said four soldiers have been killed by Palestinian groups in the coastal territory over the same period. By advancing to phase two, the US and mediator partners Egypt and Qatar must confront the contentious issue of Hamas disarmament, which the group has long rejected.

Speaking at a Security Council open debate, Pakistan’s Permanent Repres­entative to the United Nations Asim Iftikhar Ahmad emphasised that the unresolved question of sovereignty lies at the heart of Middle East instability. Mr Ahmad strongly condemned Israeli actions against UN facilities, including the recent demolition of a UN compound in Sheikh Jarrah, stressing that such acts undermine stabilisation efforts.

      "summary_orig": "• Iranian ambassador to Pakistan says his country will only accept dialogue if it leads to ‘win-win outcome’ • Insists peaceful protests were hijacked by ‘conspirators’, admits ‘some Iranians’ were involved ISLAMABAD: Iran’s ambassador to Pakistan, Dr Reza Amiri Moghaddam, has said that Tehran would accept dialogue only if it results in a win-win outcome. He also acknowledged that Iran was ready for talks ‘if approached’, but warned that if war was imposed, “the Islamic Republic would respond in the same coin against any enemy”. The ambassador was briefing the media at the Iranian Embassy on Thursday about the official findings related to the recent protests in the country. He said peaceful protests were hijacked by conspirators and acknowledged that some Iranians were also involved in the conspiracy. The envoy emphasised that the extensive imposition of unilateral sanctions and coercive measures has a direct and adverse impact on the economic, social and cultural rights of the Iranian people. Detailing the background of the situation, he said that on Sunday, December 28, 2025, sector-based protest gatherings began in Tehran’s Bazaar following an increase in foreign exchange rates. The primary demand of the protesters was the restoration of stability in the market, he said, adding that the agents of the US and Israel later infiltrated the gatherings, resorted to violence and carried out arson by mingling with traders and peaceful demonstrators. “The Zionist regime seeks to exploit every opportunity to sow division within Iranian society and undermine national cohesion,” he added. The ambassador said statements and actions by the prime minister of the Zionist regime, as well as certain extremist and hardline American officials, were aimed at inciting violence, terrorism and criminal acts. He said at the same time dissenters exploited the protests through foreign interference to create turmoil and unrest in the country. “Some organised gangs and groups, along with foreign-backed terrorist and secessionist elements, diverted the protests into violent and armed clashes with law-enforcement forces and civilians,” he said, adding that these acts had no connection with the legitimate economic demands of the protesters and were neither endorsed nor supported by the majority of the population. The briefing also referred to a message posted on X by former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo stating: “Happy New Year to every Iranian in the streets, also to every Mossad agents walking beside them.” The ambassador said that the Iranian people became aware of the true intentions behind the acts of arson and sabotage, and citizens of Islamic Republic came out on Monday, January 12, 2026 to demonstrate in support of the government. ‘Iran is an open country’ Meanwhile, responding to a query about the recurring resurgence of foreign saboteur networks in Iran, an Iranian diplomat told Dawn that Iran is an open country with a large number of tourists and a sizeable diaspora, adding that some individuals abroad fall prey to conspirators in Western countries. Details of the damages caused during the unrest were also shared, including destruction of two churches, 200 schools, 15 libraries, 350 mosques, hundreds of ambulances, and numerous government and private buildings and properties. The Iranian ambassador said the government had taken tangible and positive steps to address the root causes of economic and social concerns. He added that support packages for vulnerable groups had been implemented and consultative meetings held with representatives of guilds, bazaar unions and business communities in major cities.

Details of the damages caused during the unrest were also shared, including destruction of two churches, 200 schools, 15 libraries, 350 mosques, hundreds of ambulances, and numerous government and private buildings and properties. The Iranian ambassador said the government had taken tangible and positive steps to address the root causes of economic and social concerns. He added that support packages for vulnerable groups had been implemented and consultative meetings held with representatives of guilds, bazaar unions and business communities in major cities.

      "summary": "• Iranian ambassador to Pakistan says his country will only accept dialogue if it leads to ‘win-win outcome’ • Insists peaceful protests were hijacked by ‘conspirators’, admits ‘some Iranians’ were involved ISLAMABAD: Iran’s ambassador to Pakistan, Dr Reza Amiri Moghaddam, has said that Tehran would accept dialogue only if it results in a win-win outcome. He also acknowledged that Iran was ready for talks ‘if approached’, but warned that if war was imposed, “the Islamic Republic would respond in the same coin against any enemy”. The ambassador was briefing the media at the Iranian Embassy on Thursday about the official findings related to the recent protests in the country. He said peaceful protests were hijacked by conspirators and acknowledged that some Iranians were also involved in the conspiracy. The envoy emphasised that the extensive imposition of unilateral sanctions and coercive measures has a direct and adverse impact on the economic, social and cultural rights of the Iranian people. Detailing the background of the situation, he said that on Sunday, December 28, 2025, sector-based protest gatherings began in Tehran’s Bazaar following an increase in foreign exchange rates. The primary demand of the protesters was the restoration of stability in the market, he said, adding that the agents of the US and Israel later infiltrated the gatherings, resorted to violence and carried out arson by mingling with traders and peaceful demonstrators. “The Zionist regime seeks to exploit every opportunity to sow division within Iranian society and undermine national cohesion,” he added. The ambassador said statements and actions by the prime minister of the Zionist regime, as well as certain extremist and hardline American officials, were aimed at inciting violence, terrorism and criminal acts. He said at the same time dissenters exploited the protests through foreign interference to create turmoil and unrest in the country. “Some organised gangs and groups, along with foreign-backed terrorist and secessionist elements, diverted the protests into violent and armed clashes with law-enforcement forces and civilians,” he said, adding that these acts had no connection with the legitimate economic demands of the protesters and were neither endorsed nor supported by the majority of the population.

      "summary_orig": "• PM speaks to Iranian president; FO says region cannot afford war • Diplomacy the ‘only viable way forward’, Dar tells Araghchi • Iranian army chief warns of ‘crushing response’ to any attack • Turkiye offers mediation; Russia cautions use of force will ‘fuel chaos’ ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday opposed the use of force and coercive measures against Iran, stressing that disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy as Western pressure on Tehran intensified with a continuing US naval build-up in the Gulf and fresh European designations and sanctions. The Pakistani position was articulated across official engagements and public statements, including a telephone call bet­ween Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Iranian President Masoud Pezesh­kian, con­­tacts between the two foreign ministers, and remarks by the Foreign Off­ice spo­kesperson at the media briefing. In a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz “underscored the importance of sustained dialogue and diplomatic engagement for promoting peace, security and development in the region”. Separately, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi, conveying concern over the evolving situation and reiterating Pakistan’s position. Mr Dar “expressed concern over the evolving regional situation and underscored that dialogue and diplomacy remain the only viable way forward”, the Foreign Office said in a statement. At the weekly media briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Andrabi expanded on Islamabad’s stance, linking it explicitly to opposition to force, sanctions and external pressure. “Pakistan has always advocated for peace and diplomacy to settle all outstanding issues. Our advocacy for peace diplomacy continues and this remains our stated position,” he said. “This region cannot afford war, turmoil because this in essence stops the economic development and prosperity. So, we hope that peace and diplomacy will prevail. We oppose the use of force. We are against coercive measures against Iran and interference in its internal affairs,” he added. Referring to the nuclear issue and multilateral diplomacy, the spokesman said Pakistan supported efforts anch­ored in international law, citing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and subsequent UN Security Council resolutions, including resolutions presented at the Council in September last year. He also cited a recent UN Human Rights Council resolution on Iran that opposed the use of force and called for upholding the UN Charter, noting that “we subscribe to these positions, and we will continue to do so”. Islamabad’s emphasis on dialogue came as the European Union significantly hardened its stance on Iran and the build-up of US forces in the Gulf continued. EU foreign ministers on Thursday unanimously agreed to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation. At the same time, the Council of the European Union adopted a fresh sanctions package over human rights violations and Iran’s military support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, adding 15 individuals and six entities to its blacklist. Moreover, a significant American military build-up in the Middle East is underway, which has been described by analysts as the largest since the 2025 strikes. The US has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, accompanied by three destroyers and more than 5,000 troops, joining existing assets including F-15E Strike Eagles and THAAD and Patriot missile systems, raising total US forces in the region to around 50,000 by late January. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is hosting senior defence and intelligence officials from Israel and Saudi Arabia for talks on Iran this week, American news website Axios reported on Thursday. ‘Crushing response’ Iran’s army chief Amir Hatami on Thursday vowed a “crushing response” to any attack, according to state television, which reported 1,000 “strategic drones” had joined the combat regiments. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman have pressed for dialogue while signalling they will not allow their airspace, territory or waters to be used for military action against Iran, because of fears of retaliation and economic disruption. Turkiye on Thursday said it would offer to mediate between Washington and Tehran during an upcoming visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, after Ankara’s top diplomat urged Washington to start nuclear talks with Tehran. “It’s wrong to attack Iran. It’s wrong to start the war again. Iran is ready to negotiate on the nuclear file again,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Al-Jazeera. Nato member Turkiye is also weighing contingency plans along its 530-kilometre border with Iran should the dispute escalate, a senior official told AFP. Iran ally Russia on Thursday also said that “the potential for negotiations is not exhausted”. “Any use of force can only create chaos in the region and lead to very dangerous consequences,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty in a call with his French counterpart Jean-Noel Barrot stressed the need for “the resumption of dialogue between the United States and Iran regarding the Iranian nuclear file”, Cairo said.

      "summary_orig": "After a 14-year hiatus, the first direct flight between Pakistan and Bangladesh landed at Jinnah International Airport on Thursday night, as Biman Bangladesh Airlines completed its inaugural flight from Dhaka to Karachi. In a statement, the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said that the Bangladeshi carrier returned to Karachi after 14 years and was given a traditional water cannon salute upon landing. The authority hailed the flight as “a new chapter” in the relationship between the two countries. Data from FlightRadar24 showed Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight BG341 landed in Karachi at 11:03pm, having departed Dhaka at 8:15pm. Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori spoke to the press at the airport, stating that cooperation with Bangladesh would not be limited to aviation but would extend to other sectors. “I absolutely want to say that today, after several years, the conspiracies have died,” Tessori said, holding India responsible for “driving a wedge” between the people of Pakistan and Bangladesh. He further said that India was responsible for terrorism in Pakistan and was also “conspiring against Bangladesh”. “I congratulate the people of Bangladesh, for they have not only defeated the Indian conspiracies but also exposed them,” he said. The governor added that India had been unfair to Bangladesh in cricket as well, saying it was “out in the open”. “The love between Pakistan and Bangladesh will grow because I know that the Bangladeshi people love Pakistanis,” Tessori stated. “This love will transform through trade and cooperation, and we will fight these Indian extremists together.” Earlier in the day, Pakistan’s High Commission in Dhaka had released a statement, saying that the “fully packed” inaugural flight had departed from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Dhaka. The flight was seen off by Bangladesh Civil Aviation and Tourism Adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, High Commissioner of Pakistan to Bangladesh Imran Haider and other officials, the statement said. “The resumption of direct flight after a hiatus of 14 years marks a significant milestone in strengthening connectivity and bilateral engagement,” it said. Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Bangladesh’s adviser for civil aviation and tourism underscored the importance of the Dhaka–Karachi route in “enhancing connectivity, promoting tourism and strengthening people-to-people links”. The statement quoted him as saying, “Bangladesh Airlines will gradually increase flight frequency and reduce airfares to make travel more affordable for the people.” He expressed hope that people of Bangladesh will visit Pakistan and explore its natural beauty, cultural heritage and diverse cuisines, it added. During the ceremony, Pakistan’s high commissioner recalled the vision of Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh’s interim leader, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “aimed at enhancing connectivity between Pakistan and Bangladesh”. “In view of the vision of the leadership and aspirations of the people of our two countries, during the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar to Dhaka in August last year, both sides agreed to take immediate measures for the resumption of direct flights,” the statement quoted him as saying. He also expressed gratitude to the government of Bangladesh, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, and the Civil Aviation Authority for making the launch of the flight possible, the statement said. “Passengers travelling on the inaugural flight expressed happiness and enthusiasm over the restoration of the direct air link, describing it as a milestone towards bringing the two countries closer,” the statement added. Earlier this month, it was announced that both countries would resume direct flight operations after a 14-year hiatus.",

It looks like they’re going to disarm,” Trump told a cabinet meeting. Trump hailed cooperation with Hamas after Israeli forces brought back the remains of the last captive held in Gaza, Ran Gvili. “They did help us with those bodies, getting them back, and that family is so grateful,” Trump said. Trump had asked for an update on the Middle East from his roving special envoy Steve Witkoff, sitting in the side of the room as cabinet members and media listened. An upbeat Witkoff voiced high confidence in Hamas following through. “We’ve got the terrorists out of there and they’re going to demilitarise. They will because they have no choice,” Witkoff said. “They’re going to give it up. They’re going to give up the AK-47s,” he told Trump. Hamas has said that the return of Gvili’s body showed its commitment to the ceasefire, but it has so far not surrendered its weapons. The group has repeatedly said disarmament is a red line, but it has also suggested it would be open to handing over its weapons to a Palestinian governing authority. Disarmament is a key part of the second phase of the ceasefire plan sealed in October. A Palestinian technocratic committee has also been set up to take over governance in the battered Gaza Strip.",

      "summary_orig": "RAWALPINDI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, who reached a police picket near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Thursday afternoon, announced that he, along with PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and other party members and supporters, would be camping at the spot overnight. Afridi, who has been seeking a meeting with the incarcerated prime minister since he assumed office of the provincial chief executive in October last year, but to no avail. He again reached Factory Naka — a police picket near the Adiala jail — today in yet another attempt to meet Imran, with Thursday and Tuesday being court-mandated dates for meeting with the former prime minister. However, he, as well as Imran’s sisters and lawyers, have been barred from meeting him for the past several weeks — a restriction that has made sit-ins and protests near the prison a usual occurrence. On several occasions, police have also used force to disperse the protesters, who often camp at Factory Naka. Speaking to the media on Thursday, Afridi announced his plans for an overnight stay and said “most of [PTI] parliamentarians have also reached the spot and some others will be arriving in some time”. Standing alongside Raja, he added, “This is about our leader’s life. We will not let this get normalised. We will spend the entire night here. We are waiting for a meeting between Imran Khan sahib and his family and personal physician.” He also said that if deliberate attempts were being made to worsen the situation for no reason, “we cannot do anything about this. All responsibility then lies with the government. Those who are not allowing the meeting will be responsible.” The KP CM said if Imran’s sisters were allowed to meet him, the situation could be prevented from worsening. CM Afridi’s visit comes after the PTI on Tuesday raised concerns about Imran’s health. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed earlier in the day that the PTI founder had undergone a medical procedure for an eye ailment at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on Saturday night. Referring to Tarar’s statement, Afridi said he had “serious reservations” about the former premier’s health. For his part, Raja said they had sent a list of names of those who were supposed to meet Imran to the prison administration as per the directions of the Islamabad High Court. “All those who have been mentioned in the list are present here,” he said. Raja mentioned that they would not return without meeting the PTI founder today, calling the meeting Imran’s “human right”. Referring to the former premier’s brief visit to Pims for a procedure, he said, “The PTI founder was taken to Pims secretly on Saturday night. It was certainly a situation where the party founder could not receive treatment in prison.” “It was the prison administration’s responsibility to inform his family members so that they, along with his personal physician, were present.” Rawalpindi police had made strict security arrangements ahead of Afridi’s expected arrival on Thursday, with personnel at the prison and in the adjoining areas on high alert. Police pickets were established near the prison’s gate, at Shaigan Healthcare factory, and in Dahgal and Gorakhpur areas, while female cops were also deployed on pickets on Adiala Road. Police checkpoints were also set up on the toll plazas of the M1 (Islamabad–Peshawar) and M2 (Lahore-Islamabad) motorways. Other places where police personnel were deployed included Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh, GPO Chowk, Chungi No. 22, Khawaja Corporation Chowk, Gulshanabad Chowk, Thalian and Chakri Interchange.",

Afridi, who has been seeking a meeting with the incarcerated prime minister since he assumed office of the provincial chief executive in October last year, but to no avail. He again reached Factory Naka — a police picket near the Adiala jail — today in yet another attempt to meet Imran, with Thursday and Tuesday being court-mandated dates for meeting with the former prime minister. However, he, as well as Imran’s sisters and lawyers, have been barred from meeting him for the past several weeks — a restriction that has made sit-ins and protests near the prison a usual occurrence. On several occasions, police have also used force to disperse the protesters, who often camp at Factory Naka. Speaking to the media on Thursday, Afridi announced his plans for an overnight stay and said “most of [PTI] parliamentarians have also reached the spot and some others will be arriving in some time”. Standing alongside Raja, he added, “This is about our leader’s life. We will not let this get normalised. We will spend the entire night here. We are waiting for a meeting between Imran Khan sahib and his family and personal physician.” He also said that if deliberate attempts were being made to worsen the situation for no reason, “we cannot do anything about this. All responsibility then lies with the government. Those who are not allowing the meeting will be responsible.” The KP CM said if Imran’s sisters were allowed to meet him, the situation could be prevented from worsening. CM Afridi’s visit comes after the PTI on Tuesday raised concerns about Imran’s health. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed earlier in the day that the PTI founder had undergone a medical procedure for an eye ailment at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on Saturday night. Referring to Tarar’s statement, Afridi said he had “serious reservations” about the former premier’s health. For his part, Raja said they had sent a list of names of those who were supposed to meet Imran to the prison administration as per the directions of the Islamabad High Court. “All those who have been mentioned in the list are present here,” he said. Raja mentioned that they would not return without meeting the PTI founder today, calling the meeting Imran’s “human right”. Referring to the former premier’s brief visit to Pims for a procedure, he said, “The PTI founder was taken to Pims secretly on Saturday night. It was certainly a situation where the party founder could not receive treatment in prison.” “It was the prison administration’s responsibility to inform his family members so that they, along with his personal physician, were present.” Rawalpindi police had made strict security arrangements ahead of Afridi’s expected arrival on Thursday, with personnel at the prison and in the adjoining areas on high alert. Police pickets were established near the prison’s gate, at Shaigan Healthcare factory, and in Dahgal and Gorakhpur areas, while female cops were also deployed on pickets on Adiala Road. Police checkpoints were also set up on the toll plazas of the M1 (Islamabad–Peshawar) and M2 (Lahore-Islamabad) motorways. Other places where police personnel were deployed included Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh, GPO Chowk, Chungi No. 22, Khawaja Corporation Chowk, Gulshanabad Chowk, Thalian and Chakri Interchange.",

      "title_orig": "Trump weighs Iran strikes to inspire renewed protests, sources say",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, multiple sources said, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the government. Two US sources familiar with the discussions said Trump wanted to create conditions for “regime change” after a crackdown crushed a nationwide protest movement earlier this month. To do so, he was looking at options to hit commanders and institutions that Washington holds responsible for the violence, to give protesters the confidence that they could overrun government and security buildings, they said. One of the US sources said the options being discussed by Trump’s aides also included a much larger strike intended to have a lasting impact, possibly against the ballistic missiles that can reach US allies in the Middle East or its nuclear enrichment programmes. The other US source said Trump has not yet made a final decision on a course of action, including whether to take the military path. The arrival of a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East this week has expanded Trump’s capabilities to potentially take military action, after he repeatedly threatened intervention over Iran’s crackdown. Four Arab officials, three Western diplomats, and a senior Western source whose governments were briefed on the discussions said they were concerned that instead of bringing people onto the streets, such strikes could weaken a movement already in shock after the crackdown. Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute, said that without large-scale military defections, Iran’s protests remained “heroic but outgunned.” The sources in this story requested anonymity to talk about sensitive matters. Iran’s foreign office, the US Department of Defense and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The Israeli Prime Minister’s office declined to comment. Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons, warning that any future US attack would be more severe than a June bombing campaign against three nuclear sites. He described the ships in the region as an “armada” sailing to Iran. A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was “preparing itself for a military confrontation, while at the same time making use of diplomatic channels.” However, Washington was not showing openness to diplomacy, the official said. Iran, which says its nuclear program is civilian, was ready for dialogue “based on mutual respect and interests” but would defend itself “like never before” if pushed, Iran’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on X on Wednesday. Trump has not publicly detailed what he is looking for in any deal. His administration’s previous negotiating points have included banning Iran from independently enriching uranium and restrictions on long-range ballistic missiles and on Tehran’s network of armed proxies in the Middle East. Limits of air power A senior Israeli official with direct knowledge of planning between Israel and the United States told Reuters that Israel does not believe airstrikes alone can topple the Islamic Republic, if that is Washington’s goal. “If you’re going to topple the regime, you have to put boots on the ground,” he said, noting that even if the United States killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran would “have a new leader that will replace him.” Only a combination of external pressure and an organised domestic opposition could shift Iran’s political trajectory, the official said. The Israeli official said Iran’s leadership had been weakened by the unrest but remained firmly in control despite the ongoing deep economic crisis that sparked the protests. Multiple US intelligence reports reached a similar conclusion: that the conditions that led to the protests were still in place, weakening the government, but without major fractures, two people familiar with the matter said. The Western source said they believed Trump’s goal appeared to be to engineer a change in leadership, rather than “topple the regime,” an outcome that would be similar to Venezuela, where US intervention replaced the president without a wholesale change of government. Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand deaths during the protests. He blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel and what he called “seditionists.” Khamenei retains control but less visible At 86, Khamenei has retreated from daily governance, reduced public appearances and is believed to be residing in secure locations after Israeli strikes last year decimated many of Iran’s senior military leaders, regional officials said. Day-to-day management has shifted to figures aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including senior adviser Ali Larijani, they said. The powerful Guards dominate Iran’s security network and big parts of the economy. However, Khamenei retains final authority over war, succession and nuclear strategy — meaning political change is very difficult until he exits the scene, they said. Iran’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about Khamenei. In Washington and Jerusalem, some officials have argued that a transition in Iran could break the nuclear deadlock and eventually open the door to more cooperative ties with the West, two of the Western diplomats said. But, they cautioned, there is no clear successor to Khamenei. In that vacuum, the Arab officials and diplomats said they believe the IRGC could take over, entrenching hard-line rule, deepening the nuclear standoff and regional tensions. Any successor seen as emerging under foreign pressure would be rejected and could strengthen, not weaken the IRGC, the official said. Across the region, from the Gulf to Turkey, officials say they favour containment over collapse — not out of sympathy for Tehran, but out of fear that turmoil inside a nation of 90 million, riven by sectarian and ethnic fault lines, could unleash instability far beyond Iran’s borders. A fractured Iran could spiral into civil war as happened after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, two of the Western diplomats warned, unleashing an influx of refugees, fueling Islamist militancy and disrupting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a global energy chokepoint. The gravest risk, analyst Vatanka warned, is fragmentation into “early-stage Syria,” with rival units and provinces fighting for territory and resources. Regional blowback Gulf states — long‑time US allies and hosts to major American bases — fear they would be the first targets for Iranian retaliation that could include Iranian missiles or drone attacks from the Tehran-aligned Houthis in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt have lobbied Washington against a strike on Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran. “The United States may pull the trigger,” one of the Arab sources said, “but it will not live with the consequences. We will.” Mohannad Hajj-Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre said the US deployments suggest planning has shifted from a single strike to something more sustained, driven by a belief in Washington and Jerusalem that Iran could rebuild its missile capabilities and eventually weaponise its enriched uranium. The most likely outcome is a “grinding erosion — elite defections, economic paralysis, contested succession — that frays the system until it snaps,” analyst Vatanka said. EU set to add Iran’s Guards to terror list after France U-turn Meanwhile, the European Union is poised to include Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist organisations after France said on Wednesday it would now support the move. EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests. “France will support the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X. With France, Italy and Germany now on board, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday, although it does need unanimity among the bloc’s 27 members. Earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU’s terrorist organisation list, joining the United States. “The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain,” Barrot said. The French presidency had earlier announced the decision. Set up after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes. Cutting ties, fears for citizens in Iran While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU’s terrorist list, others, led by France, have been more cautious. They feared such a move could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran, impacting diplomatic missions, and also hurting negotiations to release European citizens held in Iranian prisons. Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year. Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal, given the IRGC’s role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said were tantamount to terrorist activity. “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck, and it’s good to call that out,” said one senior EU diplomat.",

He blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel and what he called “seditionists.” Khamenei retains control but less visible At 86, Khamenei has retreated from daily governance, reduced public appearances and is believed to be residing in secure locations after Israeli strikes last year decimated many of Iran’s senior military leaders, regional officials said. Day-to-day management has shifted to figures aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including senior adviser Ali Larijani, they said. The powerful Guards dominate Iran’s security network and big parts of the economy. However, Khamenei retains final authority over war, succession and nuclear strategy — meaning political change is very difficult until he exits the scene, they said. Iran’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about Khamenei. In Washington and Jerusalem, some officials have argued that a transition in Iran could break the nuclear deadlock and eventually open the door to more cooperative ties with the West, two of the Western diplomats said. But, they cautioned, there is no clear successor to Khamenei. In that vacuum, the Arab officials and diplomats said they believe the IRGC could take over, entrenching hard-line rule, deepening the nuclear standoff and regional tensions. Any successor seen as emerging under foreign pressure would be rejected and could strengthen, not weaken the IRGC, the official said. Across the region, from the Gulf to Turkey, officials say they favour containment over collapse — not out of sympathy for Tehran, but out of fear that turmoil inside a nation of 90 million, riven by sectarian and ethnic fault lines, could unleash instability far beyond Iran’s borders. A fractured Iran could spiral into civil war as happened after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, two of the Western diplomats warned, unleashing an influx of refugees, fueling Islamist militancy and disrupting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a global energy chokepoint. The gravest risk, analyst Vatanka warned, is fragmentation into “early-stage Syria,” with rival units and provinces fighting for territory and resources. Regional blowback Gulf states — long‑time US allies and hosts to major American bases — fear they would be the first targets for Iranian retaliation that could include Iranian missiles or drone attacks from the Tehran-aligned Houthis in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt have lobbied Washington against a strike on Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran. “The United States may pull the trigger,” one of the Arab sources said, “but it will not live with the consequences. We will.” Mohannad Hajj-Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre said the US deployments suggest planning has shifted from a single strike to something more sustained, driven by a belief in Washington and Jerusalem that Iran could rebuild its missile capabilities and eventually weaponise its enriched uranium. The most likely outcome is a “grinding erosion — elite defections, economic paralysis, contested succession — that frays the system until it snaps,” analyst Vatanka said. EU set to add Iran’s Guards to terror list after France U-turn Meanwhile, the European Union is poised to include Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist organisations after France said on Wednesday it would now support the move. EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests. “France will support the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X. With France, Italy and Germany now on board, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday, although it does need unanimity among the bloc’s 27 members. Earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU’s terrorist organisation list, joining the United States. “The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain,” Barrot said. The French presidency had earlier announced the decision. Set up after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes. Cutting ties, fears for citizens in Iran While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU’s terrorist list, others, led by France, have been more cautious. They feared such a move could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran, impacting diplomatic missions, and also hurting negotiations to release European citizens held in Iranian prisons. Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year. Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal, given the IRGC’s role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said were tantamount to terrorist activity. “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck, and it’s good to call that out,” said one senior EU diplomat.",
