      "summary_orig": "LNER’s Samir Zitouni, known as Sam, was seriously injured in mass stabbing and is credited with saving multiple lives A train crew member who was seriously injured while protecting passengers during a mass stabbing onboard a train in Cambridgeshire has been discharged from hospital, police have said. Samir Zitouni, known as Sam, was working onboard the London North Eastern Railway (LNER) high-speed train from Doncaster to London when the attack happened on 1 November. LNER said the 48-year-old, who has worked for the company for more than 20 years, has been credited with helping to save multiple lives after passengers came under threat in Huntingdon. British Transport police said Zitouni was now able to continue his recovery at home. The force said on Saturday: “Samir Zitouni had been in a critical condition having suffered multiple injuries, and thanks to the efforts of NHS medical staff he’s been able to be discharged from hospital today.” His family said: “We are so grateful for the outpouring of support from the public, and very touched by all the kind words about Sam’s brave actions on the night of the attack. “While we are really happy to have him home, he still has a significant recovery ahead and we would now like to be left in privacy to care for him as a family.” Zitouni’s job is customer experience host, which largely involves providing onboard catering. He was among 11 patients treated in hospital for injuries sustained during the attack, which is understood to have started shortly after the train left Peterborough station. Among the injured was Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, a Scunthorpe United footballer who was treated for non-life-threatening injuries, and Stephen Crean, 61, who sustained stab injuries. Anthony Williams, 32, was remanded into custody at Peterborough magistrates court on 3 November charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a bladed article and one count of actual bodily harm. One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident at a London station. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirmed on Saturday that they had seized an oil tanker in the Gulf as it sailed away from a UAE port, a day after security companies determined they were likely responsible. “Yesterday morning at 7:30, after a judicial authority ordered the seizure of the cargo of an oil tanker with the trade name Talara and the flag of the Marshall Islands, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) rapid reaction units of the naval forces monitored its movements and intercepted and seized it,” said the IRGC. “The tanker was found to be in violation of the law by carrying unauthorised cargo,” the statement continued, adding it “was carrying 30,000 tonnes of petrochemical cargo and was heading to Singapore”. The Iranian news agency Fars said that action was not taken as a measure against any other nation, but was a purely local matter. The seized cargo, the report said, was made up of Iranian-produced petrochemicals being illegally exported and “the main culprit was an Iranian individual or business”. The vessel had departed from Ajman in the United Arab Emirates and was heading south through the Strait of Hormuz when it was approached by three small boats, after which it made a “sudden course deviation”, maritime security company Ambrey said. The US Navy had earlier said it was “actively monitoring the situation”. “Commercial vessels are entitled to largely unimpeded rights of navigation and commerce on the high seas,” said the US 5th Fleet, which patrols the region. The Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for global oil and liquefied natural gas, has previously been the scene of similar incidents. Last year, the Revolutionary Guards seized a container ship, saying it had links to Israel, following a deadly attack on Iran’s consulate in Syria blamed on Israel.",

      "summary_orig": "Multiple Indian accounts on social media platform X since Thursday shared an image of a Pakistani Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC), claiming it belonged to the wife of a primary suspect in the Nov 10 Delhi attack. However, the image does not show the CNIC of the suspect’s wife. A car explosion near Delhi’s iconic Red Fort rocked the national capital on Monday evening. Twelve people died in the incident. Investigators alleged that the explosion was executed by a terror cell linked to Jaish‑i‑Mohammed (JeM), operating through a cell based around Faridabad and Pulwama. On Thursday, an X user, who appears to be a pro-Indian based on his previous posts, shared an image of a Pakistani CNIC belonging to a woman. The post was captioned: “Big breaking: Her name is Afeera Bibi, she is a Pakistani citizen, and she is also the wife of Delhi blast terrorist Muhammad Umar. She works for Jaish-i-Mohammed and is also connected to Dr Shaheen, who used to recruit members for JeM in India! Pakistan should start counting their last days.” The image gained 434,000 views and 5,700 reshares. Another Indian propaganda account shared the image and claim as well, with the post garnering over 475,000 views. The image and claim were soon also shared by other Indian accounts, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here , collectively gaining more than 372,000 views. Several users on Facebook also widely shared the image with a similar claim, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and allegations of Pakistan’s link to the attack. To investigate the viral image, a reverse image search was conducted, which yielded an August 25, 2020, X post of the editor of Indian news outlet CNN-News 18 that included multiple pictures of individuals accused in the Pulwama attack , including the viral CNIC image. The post was captioned: “More proof that Pakistan can not deny. Not just Umar Farooq, NIA India presents his wife’s ID card too as evidence. Issued by Pakistan. Afeera Bibi, wife of Muhammad Umar (Farooq).” It also used the hashtag “Pulwama”. A suicide bomber had rammed a car into a bus carrying Indian paramilitary police in Pulwama on February 14, 2019, killing 40 of them in the deadliest attack in decades on security forces in the occupied region. The X post described Afeera Bibi as the wife of Muhammad Umar Farooq, the primary accused in the Pulwama attack. Further investigation did establish a link between Afeera Bibi and the current Delhi attack. She is currently being investigated by the Indian authorities in connection with the Delhi attack. A keyword search to corroborate the identity of Afeera Bibi yielded a YouTube video shared by Indian media outlet Times Now dated November 13, 2025. The video was titled: “Delhi Car Blast Probe: Afeera Bibi, Wife of Masood Azhar’s Nephew & Pakistan Resident, Under Lens.” It reiterated the fact from 2020 that Afeera was the wife of Muhammad Umar Farooq, but also said that she was in touch with Dr Shaheen Saeed, the “mastermind” of the Delhi car blast at the Red Fort. Multiple other Indian media outlets such as, Republic World , RTV English , India Today , and News X also reported that Afeera Bibi was in touch with Dr Shaheen during the Red Fort car blast in New Delhi. However, they all established that she was the wife of the accused in Pulwama and none mentioned her as the wife of the primary accused in the Delhi attack. Furthermore, the investigation also revealed that the CNIC of Afeera identified her husband as Muhammad Umar Farooq, who was the suspect in the Pulwama attack. According to mainstream Indian media outlets such as NDTV , ANI and Hindustan Times , the name of the primary accused in the Delhi blast is Dr Umar Un Nabi, due to which social media users could perhaps be establishing the connection. Meanwhile, the CNIC of the Pulwama attack suspect mentions the name as Muhammad Umar Farooq, according to multiple Indian media outlets . The viral CNIC of Afeera Bibi mentions her husband’s name as Muhammad Umar. The woman is not the wife of the Delhi attack’s prime suspect; she is being investigated in connection with the attack. Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral image of a Pakistani CNIC shows the wife of the Delhi attack’s primary suspect is false . The woman in the viral CNIC image is not the wife of the Delhi attack’s prime suspect. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

A group of lawyers at the convention, held at the Sukkur District Bar, began shouting slogans against President Asif Ali Zardari, whereas another group of lawyers began chanting in the president’s favour. The disorder intensified with the involvement of plainclothes individuals when a verbal altercation and scuffle broke out between them and lawyers. Meanwhile, some of the protesting lawyers reportedly held five outsiders, who were in plainclothes and entered the lawyers’ convention, and began beating them up. Advocate KB Laghari said the five individuals were apprehended and handed over to the police. He asserted that “lawyers are brothers, and no one can make us fight”. Laghari added that Sukkur District Bar Association President Qurban Ali Malano felt unwell during the unrest and was moved to the hospital due to his deteriorating condition. PPP workers allegedly caused disruption The outsiders who caused the clash and disorder during the lawyers’ convention were said to be PPP workers. The central figure of the conflict was reported to be Mairaj Gopang, a worker of the PPP’s Shaheed Benazir Division and an office-bearer of the Peoples Students Federation (PSF). According to lawyers, the disturbance began when Karachi Bar General Secretary Rehman Korai mentioned the name of Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar during his speech. Upon hearing this, the alleged PPP workers attacked the lawyers’ leadership, including Aamir Nawaz Waraich, Malano, Laghari, Haseeb Jamali and Shafqat Raheem, during the speech. Although other lawyers present tried to protect their leadership, the senior lawyers received minor injuries and were taken to the hospital. The individuals then began chanting slogans of “Long Live Bhutto” when police brought them to the C-Section Police station. Syed Zain Shah, president of the Sindh United Party and convener of the Save Sindh River Movement, strongly condemned the attack. He asserted that this action was not only an attack on the legal fraternity but also a clear assault on the Constitution, law, democratic values and freedom of expression. Lanjar takes notice Lanjar took a strong notice of the incident. In a strongly-worded statement, the home minister expressed regret over the incident and termed the attack on lawyers as highly condemnable. He stated that those involved in the assault would face strict legal action in accordance with the law. Lanjar emphasised that lawyers were his own community, akin to family, and urged the legal fraternity to avoid internal disputes and maintain unity and discipline. The minister further said that the government would take every possible step to ensure the safety and protection of lawyers. The home minister added that a full investigation was already ordered and responsibility would be determined following the inquiry. Lanjar said restoring a peaceful environment remained a top priority of the government, and all necessary measures were being taken in this regard.",

      "summary_orig": "Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza on Saturday tendered his resignation as a judge of the Lahore High Court (LHC), becoming the first judge to resign from any high court after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was enacted into law. According to family sources, his resignation letter stated that in light of the latest amendment to the Constitution, he could not continue in good conscience. Justice Mirza was appointed as an additional judge of the LHC in March 2014, and his superannuation was due on March 6, 2028. He is the son of late Justice Zia Mehmood Mirza , a former Supreme Court judge who delivered the famous and only dissenting opinion among seven judges in the case pertaining to the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto’s government by then-president Farooq Ahmad Khan Laghari in 1996. The judge had held that Laghari’s move was unjustified and there was no evidence suggesting there was a breakdown of constitutional order to justify exercising his powers under Article 58(2)(b), which allowed the president to dismiss the elected government and which was ultimately removed in the 18th Amendment. A press release from the LHC Bar Association (LHCBA) said its officeholders paid tribute to the judge for his resignation and criticised the 27th Constitutional Amendment for having “divided the higher judiciary into pieces” and being responsible for the “burial of the Constitution”. The LHCBA called on other judges who took oath under the Constitution to also resign from their posts, saying the entire legal community would respect them for the move. The association also announced observing a strike on Monday, saying that lawyers would completely boycott court proceedings after hearings of urgent cases. Justice Mirza’s resignation comes two days after the passage of the contentious 27th Amendment, which has been assailed as a “ flagrant attack ” on judicial independence by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ). The move also follows the resignations of the Supreme Court’s senior puisne judge, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, and Justice Athar Minallah, both of whom wrote strongly worded resignation letters censuring the 27th Amendment. Amid speculation about possible transfers of high court judges, Justices Mohsin Akhtar Ka­­­yani and Saman Rafat Imtiaz of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) have hinted they might not be available to hear cases in the federal capital from next month. 27th Amendment and its impact on judiciary The 27th Amendment, besides bringing changes in other domains , alters the judiciary’s functioning in two areas — constitutional matters and the transfer of judges. The legislation empowers the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan to transfer high court judges without their consent — a provision that has raised concerns with­­in sections of the judiciary. The most notable decision made by the ruling coalition is the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which experts say has dethroned the Supreme Court as the country’s highest judicial forum. The reason for those concerns is that the FCC will now deal with crucial constitutional matters and its decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil. Additional reporting by Rana Bilal.",

      "summary_orig": "The PTI claimed on Saturday that the report by The Economist , widely circulated on social media, was nothing more than recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary. The report covered PTI founder Imran Khan’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as prime minister. Imran married Bushra in February 2018. An official response, issued by the party’s media wing, claimed that co-writer Bushra Taskeen was a known critic of PTI and the “so-called” analysis published in the report was to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and stolen elections. The party said it had the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and publication, if they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology. “We have seen this narrative play out before. Half-truths, innuendo, selective outrage, all packaged and presented as ‘objective analysis’. This attempt to misrepresent facts is not intended to inform Pakistan or its people, but rather to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and systematically stolen elections,” it claimed. “What is most striking is the convenient targeting of Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, who have been incarcerated for two years and three months, while the article remains silent on what has been happening in Pakistan for the last three years and seven months. There is no mention of human rights violations, the rigged elections confirmed even by the Commonwealth observers , the hundreds of PTI supporters who have recently been convicted to 10-year sentences in fabricated cases, or the systematic political persecution the party has faced. “Instead, the writers chose to focus on the personal lives of the country’s most popular and courageous leader, a man revered by millions of Pakistanis, while ignoring the glaring injustices inflicted on ordinary citizens, party members, and the democratic system itself.” The party further claimed that the Al Qadir Trust case, frequently cited in the article, was ongoing and had not been “fixed” as implied. “PTI has consistently sought transparency and judicial resolution. The Constitution itself has been repeatedly tampered with, in fear of Imran Khan, undermining the rule of law. One must ask the writers why they did not highlight these grave concerns and instead chose to sensationalise the personal life of the PTI leader? Furthermore, co-writer Bushra Taskeen is a known critic of PTI, demonstrating clear bias against Imran Khan and favouring the PML-N, calling into question the objectivity of this analysis,” the party stated. “Imran Khan’s own trials are far from open and fair. They are being conducted inside prison, denying him his basic rights, including meetings with family, friends, and legal counsel, despite explicit court orders. This systematic denial of due process exposes the politically motivated nature of these proceedings, yet the article conspicuously omits these facts.“ The PTI added that they “reserve the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and The Economist , should they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology for this baseless, reckless, and defamatory personal attack on the leader of 240 million Pakistanis and the millions of devoted supporters of Imran Khan worldwide”. “The people of Pakistan know the truth. They see through these attempts to malign their leader and continue to revere Imran Khan for his courage, integrity, and steadfast commitment to the nation. His moral leadership and dedication to justice remain a beacon of hope for millions, despite the relentless political persecution he and his family have endured,” the response concluded.",

      "summary_orig": "At least nine people were killed and 32 injured in an “accidental explosion” at the Nowgam police station in India-occupied Kashmir’s Srinagar when confiscated explosives detonated late last night, authorities said on Saturday. Most of those killed were policemen and forensic team officials who were extracting samples from a large cache of explosives seized earlier this week in Haryana state, the Press Trust of India ( PTI ) said. The Ministry of Home Affairs confirmed the casualties, PTI reported . The ministry’s joint secretary, Prashant Lokhande, said the cause of the incident was being investigated and any other speculation into the cause of the blast was unnecessary. Both Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and Director General of Police Nalin Prabhat termed the incident “accidental”. The governor said he has ordered a “probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion”, while the police chief also stressed that “any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary”. “Due to the sensitive and unstable nature of the recovered material, the sampling and examination were being carried out with extreme caution. Despite all precautions, an accidental blast occurred last night,” the police officer was quoted as saying by The Hindu . “The building of the police station has been severely damaged and the adjacent buildings have been affected,” he added. “Small successive explosions” prevented immediate rescue operations by the bomb disposal squad, the PTI reported. Indian security forces arrive near the site of an explosion inside a police station in Srinagar, India-occupied Kashmir on Nov 15, 2025. — Reuters The local police also dismissed reports of the People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) claiming responsibility or of any other foreign link as “patently false, baseless and mischievous”. According to the PTI , those killed in the incident included three people from the Forensic Science Laboratory, two from the revenue department, two police photographers, a member of the State Investigation Agency and a tailor. At least 24 police personnel and three civilians were admitted to various hospitals in Srinagar, PTI quoted officials as saying. Some of the bodies had been “completely burnt”, a police source told Reuters . “The intensity of the blast was such that some body parts were recovered from nearby houses, around 100-200 metres away from the police station.” Raids in IoK following Delhi blast The blast comes four days after a deadly car explosion in Delhi, which killed at least eight people in what India has called a “ terror incident ”. India’s anti-terrorism National Investigation Agency is leading the probe into the blast, but so far,  officials have given little further information on who the perpetrators might be — and whether it was a homegrown group or had links from abroad. Indian media have widely connected the November 10 blast with a string of arrests just hours before, when they claimed to have seized explosive materials and assault rifles. Indian police have carried out sweeping raids in occupied Kashmir since Wednesday. There has been no confirmation that the searches this week are connected to the New Delhi explosion, but the raids represent a renewed effort by police to tighten security after the incident. Officers also raided Al-Falah University in Faridabad, while security forces on Friday demolished a house in occupied Kashmir’s Pulwama district.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday paid a visit to the Cadet College in Wana, where an attack was thwarted earlier this week, saying that elements from “across the border” were responsible for terrorist incidents. In remarks which were televised, Naqvi told tribal elders gathered at the college during his visit that several officials from Pakistan — including himself, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Defence Minister Asif Khawaja — had spoken to Afghanistan about the issue of terrorism. “We repeatedly told them one thing: terrorism should be stopped. Do not destroy the peace in our country,” he said. The minister further said that Pakistan’s economic indicators and its relations with other countries were headed in the right direction. However, elements from “across the border” came to the country to carry out attacks, he said. He also referred to the suicide blast in Islamabad on Tuesday, saying that elements from “across the border” were involved. Naqvi has previously said that both the Wana and Islamabad incidents had Afghan involvement . The Cadet College had come under attack on November 10. While all students and teachers were safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed , the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals. “Our local people are not used [in carrying out these attacks],” Naqvi said. “For some time now, you can see none of the attacks have been carried out by a local citizen,” he added. According to a handout issued by the interior ministry, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Frontier Corps (South) Inspector General Major General Mehr Omar Khan had welcomed the minister at the college. During his visit, Naqvi met officers and soldiers from the Pakistan Army, who had participated in foiling the attack, and also met students and faculty members from the college. The statement said that Naqvi also announced that the college would be renovated, adding that the Pakistan Army and FC had set a remarkable example of bravery and professionalism by safely rescuing all students and teachers.\n‎\n“The enemy wanted to execute an Army Public School -like attack, but our brave soldiers foiled the attempt, sending the terrorists to hell and defeating the conspiracy,” he was quoted as saying. “These are savages who have no link with humanity. No faith permits targeting children, and these beasts have no religion. Calling them human is an insult to humanity,” he said. Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. In November 2022 , the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.",

According to official sources, the task force comprises 13 special teams each having four personnel, one detective foot constable and one official each from the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), security branch and the Special Branch field staff.

Likewise, Mohammad Faizan will be heading the team of police station Dhamial, Yasir Iqbal Chontra team, Naeem Raj Wali police station Chakri and Mohammad Rizwan police station Naseerabad. Team incharges asked to submit reports to chief security officer of their respective division on daily basis In a directive, the senior superintendent of police operations said in line with the government’s orders, the police crackdown against illegal Afghan nationals was continuing, but the police performance regard was disappointing. Keeping in view this, the police have established a task force tasked with apprehending illegal Afghan nationals and shifting them to the holding centres on a daily basis. The concerned police officials (Muharrars) have been directed not to assign any other duty to those selected as members of the special units. A pro forma was also distributed among the special team in-charges regarding arresting illegal Afghan nationals and submitting their findings by 9pm to the chief security officer of their respective division on a regular basis. During the last two days, the Rawalpindi police along with Special Branch, CTD and City Traffic Police conducted search and strike operations to arrest Afghan nationals illegally residing in the garrison city. As many as 92 Afghan nationals illegally residing in the garrison city were detained, while eight cases were registered against landlords and tenants who did not register their tenancy details with the concerned police station. Police on Friday conducted search operations in different areas and checked 1,123 houses, 336 shops, 49 hotels, two inns and the particulars of a total of 1,524 people, a police spokesman said. He said that during the search operations, 92 illegal Afghan residents were detained. Eight cases were registered against landlords and tenants who failed to register their tenancy details. The search operations were conducted in the areas of Kallar Syedan, Rawat, Gujar Khan, Chontra, Dhamial, Mandra, Kahuta, Chakri, Pirwadhai, Ratta Amral, Ganjmandi, City, Waris Khan, Banni, New Town and Sadiqabad. The operations were aimed at establishing peace and order and rooting out crime. The police spokesman said that all resources were being used to establish the rule of law and maintain peace and order. Meanwhile, a man was gunned down by two unidentified motorcycle riders in the RA Bazaar Police Station area on Friday night, police said. Initial police reports suggested that Adalat Khan, a resident of Tehsil Havelian, Abbottabad, had booked a ride for Ghaziabad. While he was travelling on a motorcycle and reached the PSO Pump on Ghaziabad Street, two unknown individuals arrived on another motorcycle and opened fire with a pistol. As a result, Adalat Khan was critically injured and died on the spot. The attackers managed to escape from the scene. Police have launched an investigation into the murder.

After the firing stopped, law enforcement personnel searched the area and found the body of a terrorist identified as Suleman alias Akram, a resident of Kohat. He was wanted in several terrorism cases, including attacks on SNGPL installations. Girl killed Meanwhile, a girl was killed and eight people were injured in two separate bombing incidents in Tirah valley over the past two days. Sources said the eight-year-old girl died in Bar Qambarkhel when a mortar shell struck a house on Wednesday night. In another incident, eight persons were injured when an explosive device dropped from a quadcopter struck a wedding ceremony in the Shalobar area. The injured were taken to Mishti hospital in Orakzai district and later referred to Peshawar for further treatment. It could not be confirmed who operated the quadcopter, though security forces have previously accused militants of using such devices to target their positions. Meanwhile, unidentified gunmen abducted an engineer and two dam workers from the Mamanrry dam area in Bara on Thursday night. Sources said no group had claimed responsibility and the motive was unclear. The engineer had been hired by a private firm to conduct a survey. In Landi Kotal, a man was injured when a pistol accidentally discharged in the Ziyarrhai area on Friday. He was taken to Landi Kotal Hospital, where his condition was stated to be out of danger.

The terrorists killed in Bazid Khel village of Darra Adam Khel on Thursday late night were identified as Muhammad Qasim, Shahid and Sahir alias Pata, all belonging to the Saad alias Shah Gul group, the officials said, adding that they were involved in attacks on police, including the killing of Constable Younis on Sept 17. Sahir was also involved in an attack on a police check post in Tor Chappar on Oct 6, in which Constable Bahadar was martyred. District Police Officer Shehbaz Elahi said the SHO of Muhammad Riaz Shaheed police station was on routine patrol when unknown gunmen opened fire at 1:22am. Police retaliated, leading to an intense exchange of fire that resulted in the killing of the three terrorists. Weapons were recovered from them.

      "summary_orig": "• Global watchdog ranks country 27th out of 100 • India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh fared better • China, Iran and Russia at bottom ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked 27th out of 100 — ‘Not Free’ — in terms of internet freedom by a global democracy watchdog in a recent report, which cited government measures to expand censorship practices. During June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025, the report issued by the US-based Freedom House noted that the authorities threatened to block virtual private networks (VPNs) and adopted amendments to the country’s cybercrime law that rights groups said could be abused. On the other hand, countries like India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh are markedly more open, classified as ‘Partly Free’, with much higher freedom scores of 51, 53, and 45, respectively. The watchdog was unable to track Afghanistan’s score. The countries placed at the bottom are China, Myanmar, Iran and Russia with scores of 9, 9, 13¸and 17, respectively. The watchdog noted that governments in the countries that suffered the most extreme declines over the 15 years of global deterioration in internet freedom — Pakistan, Egypt, Russia, Turkiye, and Venezuela — intensified their control over the online environment in response to challenges to their rule. Between 2011 to 2015, Pakistan’s internet freedom deteriorated sharply, plunging from 55 to 69. From 2012 onwards, the status moved from ‘Partly Free’ to ‘Not Free’, reflecting increasing restrictions. “Pakistanis reported periods of poor internet quality and disruptions to their access to WhatsApp, Signal, and other platforms throughout the coverage period,” the report noted. “Researchers found that the connectivity disruptions were likely linked to the deployment of new website monitoring and blocking technology,” it added. It noted that in November last year, the authorities restricted internet services across Islamabad as widespread protests in support of former prime minister Imran Khan took place. “[Imran] Khan was imprisoned throughout the coverage period.” It continued that the platform became accessible during a four-day military conflict between Pakistan and India , which followed a terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. It maintained that “the military establishment sought to curtail the influence” of the PTI founder and his party. VPNs The report noted that in May this year, Pakistani officials unblocked X (formerly Twitter), which had been restricted since February 2024. “Authorities repeatedly threatened to block VPNs operating in Pakistan without registration. Registration requirements released in Nov 2024 required the disclosure of information identifying customers; however, at the end of the month authorities said they would not block unregistered VPN connections,” the report noted. “The development reportedly came after the law ministry found that the government lacked legal standing to block VPNs.” The watchdog noted that amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) signed into law in January 2025 contained ambiguous language rights groups said could be used to remove online speech deemed undesirable by authorities. It added that at least five people were sentenced to death during the coverage period after being convicted of blasphemy in connection with material posted online. The report noted that Pakistan held regular elections under a competitive multiparty system. “However, the military exerts enormous influence over the conduct of elections, government formation, and policies; intimidates the media; and enjoys impunity for indiscriminate or extralegal use of force,” it added. Of the 72 countries assessed in Freedom on the Net 2025, conditions deteriorated in 28, while 17 countries registered overall gains. “The authorities often impose selective restrictions on civil liberties. Militants conduct terrorist campaigns against the state and also regularly carry out attacks on members of religious minority groups and other perceived opponents.” Global situation Overall, it noted that the global internet freedom decli­ned for the 15th consecutive year. Kenya experienced the most severe decline of the coverage period, after authorities responded to nationwide protests over tax policy in June 2024 by shutting down internet connectivity for around seven hours and arresting hundreds of protesters.

      "summary_orig": "• Asia suffered 47pc of total losses over 33 years • Floods in Pakistan affected 9m people, destroyed crops on large scale ISLAMABAD: Disasters have caused an estimated $3.26 trillion in agricultural losses worldwide over the past 33 years — an average of $99 billion annually, or roughly four per cent of global agricultural GDP — according to a new report released by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) on Friday. The report, titled Impact of Disasters on Agriculture and Food Security 2025 , highlights how digital technologies are transforming the way farmers, governments and communities monitor risks, anticipate impacts and protect livelihoods. “The global agricultural sector stands at a critical juncture, facing an unprecedented convergence of disasters, while simultaneously witnessing remarkable advances in digital technologies that offer new possibilities for understanding, predicting and managing disaster risks,” it added. Between 1991 and 2023, disasters wiped out 4.6bn tonnes of cereals, 2.8bn tonnes of fruits and vegetables, and 900m tonnes of meat and dairy. These losses translate to a daily per capita reduction of 320 kilocalories — 13-16pc of average energy needs, the report estimated. The FAO report said Asia accounts for the largest share of global losses of 47pc, totaling $1.53tr, reflecting both the scale of agricultural production and the region’s high exposure to floods, storms and droughts. In Pakistan, monsoon floods affected over 9m people and destroyed 849,000 hectares of crops, coming just one year after the catastrophic 2022 floods from which the country is still recovering. The consecutive flooding events have fundamentally altered Pakistan’s agricultural landscape, with soil erosion, salinisation and infrastructure destruction creating long-term challenges for agricultural recovery. The report identified digital transformation as a game-changer for agricultural disaster risk reduction. Emerging tools such as artificial intelligence (AI), remote sensing, mobile connectivity, drones and sensors are now enabling hyperlocal, real-time insights that improve early warning, advisory services, risk transfer mechanisms and anticipatory action. “Digital technologies are already revolutionising how we monitor risks, deliver early warnings and support farmers’ decision-making. From the 9.1m farmers now accessing parametric insurance through digital platforms to the communities using our early warning systems to evacuate 90pc of at-risk populations before disasters strike, we are witnessing a fundamental shift from reactive response to proactive risk reduction,” said FAO Director General QU Dongyu. Losses in production resulting from disasters correspond to a reduced availability of 320 kcal per person per day globally, with iron losses corresponding to 60pc of requirements for men and critical shortfalls in essential vitamins and minerals that have the potential to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. According to the report, disaster impacts on agriculture extend far beyond immediate production losses to include infrastructure damage, market disruptions, financial system failures and ecosystem service degradation that can persist for years after initial events. Current assessment tools must be extended to systematically capture both direct and indirect impacts and take into consideration non-economic values, differentiated effects on vulnerable groups, biodiversity losses and long-term ecosystem disruptions, it said. Marine heatwaves alone are estimated to have caused $6.6bn in fisheries losses (1985-2022), with 15pc of global fisheries affected and production losses exceeding 5.6m tonnes, demonstrating the severe yet largely unmeasured impacts on aquatic food systems.

Current assessment tools must be extended to systematically capture both direct and indirect impacts and take into consideration non-economic values, differentiated effects on vulnerable groups, biodiversity losses and long-term ecosystem disruptions, it said. Marine heatwaves alone are estimated to have caused $6.6bn in fisheries losses (1985-2022), with 15pc of global fisheries affected and production losses exceeding 5.6m tonnes, demonstrating the severe yet largely unmeasured impacts on aquatic food systems.
