      "summary_orig": "Pakistani security forces captured 19 Afghan border posts as they responded to unprovoked cross-border attacks by the Afghan Taliban, state media reported on Sunday, citing security sources. “So far, Pakistan has captured 19 Afghan posts on the Afghan border from where attacks were being launched on Pakistan,” state broadcaster PTV News said on X, citing security sources. Security sources further said the “Afghan Taliban present at the posts have been killed and the rest have fled for their lives“, adding that fire had erupted at some posts. “The Pakistani army also completely destroyed Taliban’s Manojba camp battalion headquarters, Jandusar Post, Turkmenzai camp and Kharchar Fort,” Radio Pakistan reported , citing security sources. “The firing from Afghanistan side was aimed at getting the khawarij formations crossed into the border of Pakistan. However, Pakistani posts, which were alert and ready, responded swiftly and forcefully,” the security sources added. They further said that “dozens of Afghan soldiers and khwarij ” were killed in the action, while “Taliban have fled from the area after abandoning several of their posts”. In a statement today, President Asif Ali Zardari noted that there were United Nations’ reports that “proved” terrorist attacks were carried out from the Afghan soil. However, he also stressed that bilateral respect and joint counterterrorism efforts were the key to long-term regional peace. “Pakistan is committed to protecting its national interests, regional sovereignty and security,” the president asserted. In his statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the “provocation by Afghanistan in Pakistan’s border areas”. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi lauded the security forces for their “prompt” response. “Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,” Naqvi said on X. “Pakistan’s forces are alert and Afghanistan is being answered with stones for bricks. The people of Pakistan stand with the brave armed forces like a lead wall. Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India.” PTV News also shared several videos of firing on the Afghan posts, some of which were in flames, and in one video, Afghan soldiers surrendering to Pakistani forces in Kurram. Late last night, state-run Radio Pakistan issued the following statement on X, quoting security sources: “Unprovoked firing from the Afghan side at Pak-Afghan border, a strong, intense response from Pakistan Army.” It said “Afghan forces carried out unprovoked firing at several locations”, Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Bahram Chah in Balochistan along the Pak-Afghan border. Radio Pakistan further said Pakistan was “targeting terrorist camps and hideouts of khawarij (terrorists), ISIS located near the Pak-Afghan border inside Afghanistan with great precision. Afghan forces have retreated from several areas”. In the early hours of Sunday, security sources said there were reports of significant damage inflicted on multiple Afghan posts and militant formations, security officials added. They said artillery, tanks, light and heavy weapons were used in the retaliatory action. State-run Radio Pakistan also shared footage of what it said were “ kharjis and Afghan soldiers being taken out”. Separately, the Torkham border crossing has been closed for all kinds of traffic after the overnight firing exchanges at various locations, according to locals on the Pakistani side. Afghan official Qureshi Badloon also confirmed the closure to *Dawn.*com from Nangarhar. Clashes break out after Kabul blames Islamabad The clashes broke out after Kabul accused Islamabad of carrying out air strikes on the Afghan capital earlier this week, according to Taliban border forces. “In retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces“, Taliban border forces in the east are “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas”, the Afghan military said in a statement earlier. Taliban officials from the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika, Khost, and Helmand — all located on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan — confirmed the clashes. Islamabad did not confirm that it was behind the attacks, but called on Kabul “to stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on its soil”. Security sources said Afghan posts failed to provide covering fire to the militants and there were reports of “heavy losses” among Afghan border posts and militants. “Kharijites and Daesh hideouts inside Afghanistan, operating under the patronage of the interim Afghan government, are being effectively targeted. Pakistan is using artillery, tanks, light, and heavy weapons. In addition, air resources and drones are also being used to target Daesh and kharijite hideouts. The headquarters of Afghan forces, which have been sheltering Daesh and Fitna al-Khawarij , are also being targeted.” The Afghan Ministry of Defence confirmed earlier that Afghan forces launched “retaliatory operations against Pakistani security forces” tonight. “The operations ended at midnight. If the opposing side violates Afghanistan’s territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly,” said the statement. Infiltration attempts in Pishin, Zhob Pakistani posts also came under attack in the Baramcha area of Chagai district, which borders Afghanistan’s Helmand province. “Afghan forces opened indiscriminate fire at Pakistani border posts with heavy weapons late on Saturday night,” a senior official said. He added that Afghan border posts were destroyed and casualties were taken by the other side. “Heavy exchange of fire continued for two hours.” Security sources stated that Afghan forces also tried to infiltrate into Pishin and Zhob districts. However, the attempts were defeated by Pakistani forces in the area. Calls for restraint Iranian top diplomat Abbas Araghchi called on Afghanistan and Pakistan “to exercise restraint” amid ongoing clashes. “Our position is that both sides must exercise restraint,” Araghchi said during a live interview with state television, adding that “stability” between the countries “contributes to regional stability”. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, with which Pakistan recently signed a mutual defence deal, expressed concern at the skirmishes. “The kingdom calls for restraint, avoiding escalation, and embracing dialogue and wisdom to contribute to reducing tensions and maintaining security and stability in the region. “The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security, which will achieve stability and prosperity for the brotherly Pakistani and Afghan peoples.” Qatar’s foreign ministry urged both sides to prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint, and to work towards containing differences in a manner that helps to reduce tension and avoid escalation, in order to achieve regional security and stability. The foreign ministry reiterated Qatar’s support for all regional and international efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security, and affirmed its commitment to ensuring security and prosperity for the people of the two countries. Deterioration in bilateral relations The past week saw heightened tensions, with both sides exchanging sharp statements. Pakistan suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out,” Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly. Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups.\nAfghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan a day ago. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.” Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited India earlier this week, marking India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. Speaking about the Thursday night explosion in Kabul during a press conference in New Delhi a day ago, Muttaqi had condemned the incident and Pakistan for its alleged role in it. Earlier, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry did not directly respond when questioned whether Pakistan was responsible for the attacks. “To safeguard Pakistani lives and properties, what measures need to be taken will be taken,” he told reporters. The Foreign Office had avoided directly acknowledging strikes in Kabul, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil. Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, the ISPR DG also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.",

      "title_orig": "Twin cities under lockdown for second day as TLP protest looms",
      "summary_orig": "• Over 1,200 FC personnel moved to Gujrat, Lahore • Few road blockades removed in Islamabad ISLAMABAD/RAWALPINDI: The twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad remained under lockdown for the second consecutive day on Saturday in anticipation of a Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) protest. In a significant move, the federal government moved over 1,200 paramilitary personnel to Punjab to intercept protesters , who have been marching on the capital from Lahore via GT Road. Meanwhile, the Islamabad Police registered separate cases against TLP activists for taking out rallies at different places. Around 90 protesters were arrested in Tarnol, and 54 in Kati Pahari. The cases were registered under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Amplifier Act. On Saturday night, the police also decided to lift blockades from a few roads. The Tarnol case was registered after a rally at Tarnol Railway Crossing, about half a kilometre from the police station. Police said a gathering of 300 people, carrying TLP flags, posters, and banners reached the crossing from Dhoke Abbasi and surrounding areas. The rally chanted anti-government slogans and delivered speeches, provoking people to join the TLP protest. The protesters also blocked the GT Road and refused to clear it when asked by the police. In response, police used force, arrested 90 protesters, and seized sound systems, while others escaped. Another case was registered over a rally of 120 protesters who arrived from Taxila and surrounding areas at Kati Pahari, near Nicholson Monument. They were carrying TLP flags, batons, salt, and slingshots, along with posters and banners of party leaders. The group shouted anti-government slogans and delivered provocative speeches. Police used force and arrested 54 participants during a crackdown as they prepared to move toward Faizabad for the protest. Sources told Dawn that about 110 FC personnel were dispatched to Lahore, while the remaining force, supervised by a senior superintendent of police (SSP), was sent to Gujrat to assist the local police under the district police officer in blocking the TLP rally’s advance. Meanwhile, Islamabad remained cut off from the rest of the country for the second day as all entry and exit points, along with main internal routes, were sealed. Authorities had already imposed a near-complete lockdown in the capital, even though the TLP rally was still hundreds of miles away. Large parts of the city remained isolated due to massive road closures. The sealing of entry and exit points, along with motorway blockages, disrupted the supply of groceries, dairy, and poultry products. Many dairy shops ran out of milk, while vegetable and fruit supplies dwindled, leading to sharp price hikes. Poultry shop owners also complained of meagre supplies on Saturday. Traders expressed hope that supplies would be restored by Sunday to prevent further price escalation. Most educational institutions and businesses remained closed. Activity in open commercial centres was much lower than usual, and public transport services, including metro and CDA electric buses, were suspended. Only limited ride-hailing services were available. About 500 containers were used to seal the city’s entry-exit points and internal roads. Late Friday night, deployed personnel were given rest, and between 11pm Friday and 11am Saturday, only 250 police officials remained on duty. By late afternoon Saturday, a stand-down order was issued, though 250–300 officers continued performing duties at key points. Police decided to ease a few blockades to provide citizens some relief. Entry and exit roads toward the airport, Zero Point, Srinagar Highway, Murree Road (Bara Kahu exit) and Expressway (Koral side) were reopened. In the Red Zone, an additional entry via the Marriott Gate will open alongside the existing Margalla Road route from Monday. For the second day, no protest of TLP was held in Rawalpindi and the situation remained peaceful. However, the closure of roads and entry-exit points caused severe difficulties for residents. Shortages of wheat flour and sugar were reported, while traders warned that continued closure of the Grand Trunk Road would worsen the food crisis. Grocery shops took advantage of the situation, increasing prices of vegetables and essential goods, while the district administration remained inactive. For the last two days, containers were placed on Murree Road and adjoining routes as part of administrative measures to prevent protest rallies from entering densely populated areas. Rawalpindi Merchant Association President Saleem Pervaiz told Dawn that grain supplies from central and southern Punjab had been halted due to the road closures. He said traders had already informed the administration about the issue, but no action was taken. Supplies could improve within a day if the roads were reopened, he added. “There is a shortage of wheat flour and sugar in the main retail markets,” he said, adding that wheat supplies from Islamabad flour mills were also suspended because connecting roads were closed. Muhammad Anwar, a resident of Tipu Road, said he could not complete his weekly shopping from Raja Bazaar due to road blockages. With intercity bus services suspended, railway stations were overcrowded. Trains became the only means of connecting Rawalpindi and Islamabad with other cities. “I came from Pirwadhai to go to Lahore, as there was no bus available due to the closure of GT Road and Motorway,” said Muhammad Saleem. “I had to walk because city roads were also blocked.” Published in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",

      "summary_en": "• Over 1,200 FC personnel moved to Gujrat, Lahore • Few road blockades removed in Islamabad ISLAMABAD/RAWALPINDI: The twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad remained under lockdown for the second consecutive day on Saturday in anticipation of a Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) protest. In a significant move, the federal government moved over 1,200 paramilitary personnel to Punjab to intercept protesters , who have been marching on the capital from Lahore via GT Road. Meanwhile, the Islamabad Police registered separate cases against TLP activists for taking out rallies at different places. Around 90 protesters were arrested in Tarnol, and 54 in Kati Pahari. The cases were registered under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Amplifier Act. On Saturday night, the police also decided to lift blockades from a few roads. The Tarnol case was registered after a rally at Tarnol Railway Crossing, about half a kilometre from the police station. Police said a gathering of 300 people, carrying TLP flags, posters, and banners reached the crossing from Dhoke Abbasi and surrounding areas. The rally chanted anti-government slogans and delivered speeches, provoking people to join the TLP protest. The protesters also blocked the GT Road and refused to clear it when asked by the police. In response, police used force, arrested 90 protesters, and seized sound systems, while others escaped. Another case was registered over a rally of 120 protesters who arrived from Taxila and surrounding areas at Kati Pahari, near Nicholson Monument. They were carrying TLP flags, batons, salt, and slingshots, along with posters and banners of party leaders. The group shouted anti-government slogans and delivered provocative speeches. Police used force and arrested 54 participants during a crackdown as they prepared to move toward Faizabad for the protest. Sources told Dawn that about 110 FC personnel were dispatched to Lahore, while the remaining force, supervised by a senior superintendent of police (SSP), was sent to Gujrat to assist the local police under the district police officer in blocking the TLP rally’s advance. Meanwhile, Islamabad remained cut off from the rest of the country for the second day as all entry and exit points, along with main internal routes, were sealed. Authorities had already imposed a near-complete lockdown in the capital, even though the TLP rally was still hundreds of miles away. Large parts of the city remained isolated due to massive road closures. The sealing of entry and exit points, along with motorway blockages, disrupted the supply of groceries, dairy, and poultry products.

      "summary_orig": "WHETHER it is a comprehensive peace or a mere pause in the genocide to secure the release of Israeli hostages will become apparent in the coming days. What is clear is that the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Gaza and their backers have learnt a lesson about the significance of the war of narratives. And they aren’t wasting any time, given the speed with which they are moving to capture control over the means of propagating and controlling the narrative. A cursory glance at social media platform ownership and control abundantly demonstrates this. A day into the ceasefire has already seen a massive flood of pro-Israel content on all timelines. With the use of algorithms and AI, the course of discussions is being altered to favour one side and the visibility of the other is being severely restricted. How do those on the other side, despite their staggering numbers, counter this? The surge in support for the just Palestinian cause and the outpouring of outrage in Western cities at the Gaza genocide have been a characteristic response to the Israeli Occupation Forces’ (IOF) two-year brutal genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip. It’s difficult to say how any new conflict or renewed genocide will see content freely make its way to social media platforms. Protesters have also found reprehensible the Israeli settler violence against the Palestinians, their displacement, the destruction of their infrastructure and their means of livelihood in the West Bank. These protesters have braved often ruthless police violence (as in Germany ) and hundreds of arrests, as we saw in Britain , including of the infirm and elderly, for simply demonstrating with placards in support of an organisation designated ‘terrorist’, at the behest of the Labour touts of an Israeli arms manufacturer. These street protests have shown how the genocidal Israeli apartheid state has lost the war for the moral high ground after decades of finding many a sympathetic ear for its victimhood narrative. This change in the public sentiment created a chasm between the genocide-supporting Western European governments and their people. Perhaps for Israel, even worse was the change in mood in America where the apartheid state has always enjoyed unrivalled precedence owing in no insignificant measure to the funding of politicians — from White House incumbents to Congress members — by billionaire ‘friends of Israel’ and organisations such as the AIPAC. In addition to the Israeli ban on foreign journalists reporting from Gaza, the legacy media itself may have covered the Gaza genocide with the necessary filters and censorship in place to offer a sanitised view of the murders of thousands of people, including some 20,000 children, following the Oct 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel in which some 800 civilians and nearly 400 security personnel were killed. It is not clear how many fell to Hamas and how many became victims of the Hannibal Directive of the IOF whereby the authorities prefer to kill their own citizens rather than have them fall into ‘enemy’ hands and become hostages and a bargaining chip. A few segments of the Israeli media that remain independent have carried gunship pilot testimonies about this. As social media images continued to paint a picture of the brutally disproportionate IOF response in Gaza with the number of dead or amputee children running into several thousands, public opinion started to change in the US. Several recent opinion polls support this suggestion. A majority of young Democrats started looking at Israel negatively and supporting the occupied Palestinian cause. But even more ominously for Israel and its unshakeable pillar of support, President Donald J. Trump, the genocide created a split within the latter’s MAGA movement. With leading MAGA figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens beginning to question the wisdom of blind US support to Israel, and its psychopathic leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the game was beginning to turn. Trump could neither ignore nor attack this influential segment of his diehard support base. This split, along with the Trump family’s business ties with the mega rich Arab Gulf states, whose initial indifference to the Gaza genocide changed dramatically after Israel’s missile attack on Qatari soil, may have guided his hand to eventually ask Israel to pause its ruthless genocidal military campaign against Gaza’s Palestinians. While X was already in the hands of one of Israel’s uncompromising supporters, Elon Musk, and with Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) controlled by the evil manipulator Mark Zuckerberg (whose track record of being pro-Israel and also backing right-wing causes is exactly like Musk’s), the very influential TikTok was the only social media platform that represented all user opinion regardless of who it favoured. Brandishing the threat of shutting it down, Trump forced the Chinese owners to sell off TikTok US operations to Larry Ellison, the Oracle’s multibillionaire owner, whose son also owns/controls Paramount and, therefore, all the content on the influential CBS News in the US. Ellison is a diehard friend/funder of Israel and IOF. With the wealth and social media empires owned by three of the richest men in the world — their collective worth surpassing a trillion and a half dollars — now firmly in the control of the genocidal Zionists’ sympathisers and supporters, it will be difficult to say how any new conflict or renewed genocide in Gaza will see content freely making its way to these platforms. Loopholes that existed earlier and afforded more openness will surely be plugged now. Israel killed over 200 journalists in Gaza and blocked foreign media from the Strip to stop news trickling out to shape public opinion. It failed mainly because of social media images. Will this tightening of the grip via algorithms on social media change the flow of information and its impact on global public opinion? Or can the sheer numbers of users force these commercial enterprises not to censor at will? The writer is a former editor of Dawn. abbas.nasir@hotmail.com Published in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",

With leading MAGA figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens beginning to question the wisdom of blind US support to Israel, and its psychopathic leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the game was beginning to turn. Trump could neither ignore nor attack this influential segment of his diehard support base. This split, along with the Trump family’s business ties with the mega rich Arab Gulf states, whose initial indifference to the Gaza genocide changed dramatically after Israel’s missile attack on Qatari soil, may have guided his hand to eventually ask Israel to pause its ruthless genocidal military campaign against Gaza’s Palestinians. While X was already in the hands of one of Israel’s uncompromising supporters, Elon Musk, and with Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) controlled by the evil manipulator Mark Zuckerberg (whose track record of being pro-Israel and also backing right-wing causes is exactly like Musk’s), the very influential TikTok was the only social media platform that represented all user opinion regardless of who it favoured.

With the wealth and social media empires owned by three of the richest men in the world — their collective worth surpassing a trillion and a half dollars — now firmly in the control of the genocidal Zionists’ sympathisers and supporters, it will be difficult to say how any new conflict or renewed genocide in Gaza will see content freely making its way to these platforms.

      "title": "Peace or genocide pause?",
      "summary": "WHETHER it is a comprehensive peace or a mere pause in the genocide to secure the release of Israeli hostages will become apparent in the coming days. What is clear is that the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Gaza and their backers have learnt a lesson about the significance of the war of narratives. And they aren’t wasting any time, given the speed with which they are moving to capture control over the means of propagating and controlling the narrative. A cursory glance at social media platform ownership and control abundantly demonstrates this. A day into the ceasefire has already seen a massive flood of pro-Israel content on all timelines. With the use of algorithms and AI, the course of discussions is being altered to favour one side and the visibility of the other is being severely restricted. How do those on the other side, despite their staggering numbers, counter this? The surge in support for the just Palestinian cause and the outpouring of outrage in Western cities at the Gaza genocide have been a characteristic response to the Israeli Occupation Forces’ (IOF) two-year brutal genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip. It’s difficult to say how any new conflict or renewed genocide will see content freely make its way to social media platforms. Protesters have also found reprehensible the Israeli settler violence against the Palestinians, their displacement, the destruction of their infrastructure and their means of livelihood in the West Bank. These protesters have braved often ruthless police violence (as in Germany ) and hundreds of arrests, as we saw in Britain , including of the infirm and elderly, for simply demonstrating with placards in support of an organisation designated ‘terrorist’, at the behest of the Labour touts of an Israeli arms manufacturer. These street protests have shown how the genocidal Israeli apartheid state has lost the war for the moral high ground after decades of finding many a sympathetic ear for its victimhood narrative. This change in the public sentiment created a chasm between the genocide-supporting Western European governments and their people. Perhaps for Israel, even worse was the change in mood in America where the apartheid state has always enjoyed unrivalled precedence owing in no insignificant measure to the funding of politicians — from White House incumbents to Congress members — by billionaire ‘friends of Israel’ and organisations such as the AIPAC. In addition to the Israeli ban on foreign journalists reporting from Gaza, the legacy media itself may have covered the Gaza genocide with the necessary filters and censorship in place to offer a sanitised view of the murders of thousands of people, including some 20,000 children, following the Oct 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel in which some 800 civilians and nearly 400 security personnel were killed. It is not clear how many fell to Hamas and how many became victims of the Hannibal Directive of the IOF whereby the authorities prefer to kill their own citizens rather than have them fall into ‘enemy’ hands and become hostages and a bargaining chip. A few segments of the Israeli media that remain independent have carried gunship pilot testimonies about this.

      "summary_orig": "ALTHOUGH the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan represent two contrasting shades of religiously inspired violent extremism in Pakistan, they share at least one characteristic: both soft and coercive measures have failed to work against them. The TTP, aligned with the Afghan Taliban and global terrorist networks such as Al Qaeda, fully exploited the government’s attempts at mainstreaming them and used the process to restructure and expand its network inside the country. On the other hand, the TLP, once a banned extremist organisation, exploits the state and violates its writ whenever it feels the need to mobilise its workers and bring them onto the streets. While the TTP is a terrorist group directly confronting the state and its security forces, the TLP is an adversary of the state and society in disguise. It operates through narratives that weaken state authority, create diplomatic friction and damage Pakistan’s international standing. The group has already caused such strains in the past, particularly vis-à-vis European countries, most notably France. It has now announced a march on the US embassy in Islamabad at a time when Pakistan-US relations are stabilising after two decades of mistrust. Any protest targeting the US diplomatic mission inevitably evokes memories among American and Pakistani security officials of the incident in November 1979, when the Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT), the radical student movement of the time, attacked the US embassy in Islamabad following false rumours that the US was involved in the assault on Masjid al-Haram in Makkah. A decade later, in February 1989, the IJT again resorted to violent protest, this time against a controversial novel. The TLP carries the same menacing potential that the IJT once possessed. Both enjoyed, in their respective times, a degree of patronage from state institutions, a factor that encouraged them to push far beyond the limits set by their patrons, believing themselves to be autonomous and emboldened by their perceived bargaining power with the state. The state now intends to eliminate the threat through coercive means, whatever the cost. The state’s calculus has remained tricky. It remains puzzling why it so often surrenders to extremists under the pretext of maintaining peace and order through non-violent means. In certain instances, particularly during periods of political turmoil, the state has even allowed such groups the freedom to act, or worse, subtly encouraged them to do so. The purpose seems nothing more than to suppress political opponents. Though the state institutions regard the TTP as an enemy, in the past, they have tried to deal with it in much the same way as they have handled the TLP in Punjab and Karachi, alternating between appeasement and accommodation. For now, however, the state has completely abandoned its earlier approach and intends to eliminate the threat through coercive means, whatever the cost. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently warned Kabul to choose between supporting Pakistan or siding with the outlawed TTP, accusing militants of crossing from Afghanistan to carry out deadly attacks. He issued this warning during a visit to Bannu, where he was accompanied by Field Marshal Asim Munir and Peshawar Corps Commander Lt-Gen Omer Bukhari, following clashes in which 19 soldiers were martyred and 45 militants killed in KP. Pakistan has, in recent months, pursued a calibrated strategy to pressure the Afghan Taliban to curb support for anti-Pakistan militant groups such as the TTP, the Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, and Baloch insurgent leaders. This effort has combined diplomatic engagement with public exposure of cross-border militant activity. The recent aerial strikes reportedly inside Afghanistan on TTP hideouts and moving targets, conducted during Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Muttaqi’s visit to India, are seen as a message, both to the TTP, underscoring Pakistan’s zero tolerance for terrorism within its borders, and the Taliban leadership, reminding it that it cannot bypass Pakistan and must address its concerns. These developments have also reinforced the view within Pakistan’s security institutions that the TTP continues to receive backing from India. The TTP problem becomes more complex because of its deep-rooted ties with the Afghan Taliban. The latter are unwilling to entirely abandon the TTP, as they view it in much the same way as the Pakistan establishment once viewed the Afghan Taliban — potential proxies in a complicated border security environment. A segment within the Taliban leadership believes that if they sever ties with the TTP, Pakistan will become more assertive towards Afghanistan, particularly on issues of trade, border management and, most importantly, the long-standing border demarcation dispute. They continue to regard the Durand Line as a contested boundary between the two countries. In this context, Pakistan’s options are limited, and the quickest course may be to rely on coercive measures, a choice that could provoke anger in Afghanistan. Islamabad already lacks a favourable public opinion there, particularly since the large-scale repatriation of Afghan refugees began. Obviously, the TLP is not an armed militia like the TTP and therefore requires a different approach. Yet, its potential to harm national harmony, disrupt law and order, and create chaos has enormous consequences, clearly detrimental to the economy, political stability and the image Pakistan needs to project to attract foreign investment. The TLP issue can be managed through a mix of measures: re-imposing the ban if necessary, taking control of its madressahs and mosques, as was done with the banned Jamaatud Dawa’s assets under UN Security Council and FATF pressure, and, most importantly, appointing moderate imams in its affiliated mosques. However, this would pose a significant challenge for the state. The religious radicalism it has nurtured over the past four or more decades has produced very few moderate or reasonable religious scholars. Many of those who do exist have already left the country, while others are preparing to do so. The writer is a security analyst. Published in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "New Delhi: India’s opposition Congress party criticised the Narendra Modi government on Saturday over the absence of women journalists from a press conference addressed by visiting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asking the prime minister to clarify his position on the matter. “Mr Modi, when you allow the exclusion of women journalists from a public forum, you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them. In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space. “Your silence in the face of such discrimination exposes the emptiness of your slogans on Nari Shakti,” Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, said in a post on X. Mr Gandhi’s post followed Priyanka Vadra’s earlier message, in which she asked whether the prime minister’s recognition of women’s rights was “just convenient posturing from one election to another”, and questioned how such an “insult to some of India’s most competent women” could have been permitted. “Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India,” she said on X. The press conference, addressed by the Afghan foreign minister on Friday was restricted to a limited group of male journalists, with women reporters conspicuously absent. Mr Muttaqi held the interaction at the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, hours after holding wide-ranging talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Taliban decision While there has been no official comment from the government of India, it is learnt that the decision on media invitations was taken by Taliban officials accompanying the visiting minister. Sources said the Indian side had suggested to the Afghan delegation that women journalists be included among the invitees. “(Tali)ban on female journalists in India. Shocking and unacceptable that the govt of India agreed to it — and that too in New Delhi on the eve of the Inter­na­ti­onal Day of the Girl Child,” Con­g­ress communications chief Jai­ram Ramesh said in a post on X. Former finance minister P. Chidambaram, expressing his personal view, said: “The men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited).” Communist Party of India general secretary D. Raja, tagging External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in his X post, asked: “Was it just Taliban misogyny or a tacit endorsement of it on Indian soil? The Republic of India is built on equality. We are the nation which gave women voting rights from day one, when many Western countries lagged behind. “To allow such exclusion here is blasphemy to our constitutional spirit.” Mr Raja urged the ministry of external affairs to explain how it agreed to “permit this discriminatory spectacle”. “This is not a diplomatic nuance. This is nourishment to patriarchal ideology that wants to erase half the world from public life. We must call it out, without hesitation,” he added. The high-profile visit has stirred strong reactions, including from Pakistan. Mr Jaishankar used the visit to push India’s agenda in Kabul. While the countries have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity, Mr Jaishankar told Mr Muttaqi: “These are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We appreciate your sensitivity towards India’s security concerns. “Your solidarity with us in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack was noteworthy. India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghan­is­tan. Closer cooperation between us contributes to your national development, as well as regional stability and resilience. To enha­nce that, I am pleased to anno­u­nce today the upgrading of India’s technical mission in Kabul to the status of embassy of India.” Published in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",

We are the nation which gave women voting rights from day one, when many Western countries lagged behind. “To allow such exclusion here is blasphemy to our constitutional spirit.” Mr Raja urged the ministry of external affairs to explain how it agreed to “permit this discriminatory spectacle”. “This is not a diplomatic nuance. This is nourishment to patriarchal ideology that wants to erase half the world from public life. We must call it out, without hesitation,” he added. The high-profile visit has stirred strong reactions, including from Pakistan. Mr Jaishankar used the visit to push India’s agenda in Kabul. While the countries have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity, Mr Jaishankar told Mr Muttaqi: “These are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We appreciate your sensitivity towards India’s security concerns. “Your solidarity with us in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack was noteworthy.

      "title": "Furore over absence of women journalists from Afghan FM Muttaqi’s presser in India",
      "summary": "New Delhi: India’s opposition Congress party criticised the Narendra Modi government on Saturday over the absence of women journalists from a press conference addressed by visiting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asking the prime minister to clarify his position on the matter. “Mr Modi, when you allow the exclusion of women journalists from a public forum, you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them. In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space. “Your silence in the face of such discrimination exposes the emptiness of your slogans on Nari Shakti,” Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, said in a post on X. Mr Gandhi’s post followed Priyanka Vadra’s earlier message, in which she asked whether the prime minister’s recognition of women’s rights was “just convenient posturing from one election to another”, and questioned how such an “insult to some of India’s most competent women” could have been permitted. “Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India,” she said on X. The press conference, addressed by the Afghan foreign minister on Friday was restricted to a limited group of male journalists, with women reporters conspicuously absent. Mr Muttaqi held the interaction at the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, hours after holding wide-ranging talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Taliban decision While there has been no official comment from the government of India, it is learnt that the decision on media invitations was taken by Taliban officials accompanying the visiting minister. Sources said the Indian side had suggested to the Afghan delegation that women journalists be included among the invitees. “(Tali)ban on female journalists in India. Shocking and unacceptable that the govt of India agreed to it — and that too in New Delhi on the eve of the Inter­na­ti­onal Day of the Girl Child,” Con­g­ress communications chief Jai­ram Ramesh said in a post on X. Former finance minister P. Chidambaram, expressing his personal view, said: “The men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited).” Communist Party of India general secretary D. Raja, tagging External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in his X post, asked: “Was it just Taliban misogyny or a tacit endorsement of it on Indian soil? The Republic of India is built on equality.

      "summary_orig": "• Emergency crew restore power to many parts of Ukraine after attack on grid • US, UK, and Nato conduct air patrol along Russia’s border KYIV: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged US President Donald Trump on Saturday to use the diplomatic success he achieved in the Middle East as a model to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, saying that if Trump could stop one war, “others can be stopped as well.” The appeal came during a phone call between the two leaders, just a day after Moscow launched what Ukrainian officials described as a large-scale attack targeting critical energy facilities across 10 regions, including the capital Kyiv. “If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well, including the Russian war,” Zelen­sky wrote on Facebook, describing what he characterised as a “very positive and productive” conversation with Trump. The timing of the appeal underscores Ukraine’s growing concern that its nearly three-year conflict with Russia has slipped down the international agenda, overshadowed by the Gaza crisis and other global flashpoints. Diplomatic momentum has stalled in recent months, with both sides accusing the other of undermining potential negotiations. Relations between the two leaders have warmed dramatically since Febru­ary, when they sparred during a now infamous televised meeting at the White House. Trump has since grown more hostile towards Moscow while expressing sympathy for Ukraine. In September, he wrote on Truth Social that Kyiv should try to “take back” all its occupied territory with Europe’s and Nato’s help. US First Lady Melania Trump said Friday she had secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia after establishing an extraordinary back channel of communication with Putin. Power restored Meanwhile, emergency crews restored power to many parts of Ukraine after an overnight Russian drone and missile attack on Friday struck energy facilities, plunging large districts of Kyiv and other areas into darkness and cutting water supplies. Friday’s strikes, which Ukrainian officials said killed at least five people and disrupted power supplies in the southern Odesa region. Moscow has targeted Ukraine’s energy grid each winter since it invaded in 2022, cutting power and heating to millions of households and disrupting water supply in what Kyiv says is a brazen war crime. Russia denies targeting civilians and says Ukraine uses the energy sites to power its military sector. Ukrainian drone attacks meanwhile killed two people in Russia, according to regional officials. Both countries have accused each other of frustrating progress towards a peace deal in recent months. Russia blames Kyiv and its European allies for the impasse, accusing them of undermining peace negotiations with Washington. Ukraine and Europe accuse Russia of playing for time so it can seize more Ukrainian territory. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, describing it as a “special military operation” to demilitarise the country and prevent the expansion of NATO. Kyiv and its European allies say the war is an illegal land grab that has resulted in tens of thousands of civilian and military casualties and widespread destruction. Jets fly near Russian border Britain said on Saturday that two Royal Air Force aircraft flew a 12-hour mission earlier this week alongside US and Nato forces to patrol the border of Russia, amid a series of recent Russian drone and aircraft incursions into Nato airspace. “This was a substantial joint mission with our US and Nato allies,” defence minister John Healey said. “Not only does this provide valuable intelligence to boost the operational awareness of our Armed Forces, but sends a powerful message of Nato unity to Putin and our adversaries,” Healey added.

      "title_orig": "TLP protesters set up overnight camp in Muridke; dozens injured during clashes",
      "summary_orig": "Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) supporters have camped at Muridke for the night as they continued attempts to reach Islamabad to stage a protest in ‘solidarity with Palestinians’. Punjab Police, in an attempt to stop the march towards the federal capital, have reportedly dug a trench on the road. Earlier in the day, clashes between supporters of the religious party and police were reported in the Shahdara area of Lahore earlier today. At least 40 police personnel have been injured today, while the TLP claims that more than 10 of its workers have been killed in clashes with law enforcers. TLP began its protests in Lahore on Thursday and announced plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to voice its opposition to the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after two years of conflict in Gaza. The demonstrations turned violent on Friday, with police launching baton charges and firing tear gas at protesters who had pelted\nthem with rocks, AFP journalists saw. Arrests in Karachi Police in Karachi arrested over a dozen TLP workers on Saturday in a bid to break up their protest at the Karachi Press Club (KPC). Roads leading to JPC were blocked earlier in the day. DIG South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that 18 TLP workers were apprehended when they arrived at Regal Chowk in Saddar. A spokesperson for the religious party, Mohammad Rehan Khan, told Dawn.com that as part of the country-wide protest, they had planned to demonstrate outside the KPC against the Punjab government’s action against their protest rally in Lahore. He said since all roads leading to the KPC were blocked, they could not reach the venue and confirmed that some party workers were detained by the police. ‘Cleared them from Lahore’ Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran, addressing the media, said some police personnel were still admitted in hospitals and undergoing treatment, while others have been discharged. He added that TLP protesters have also damaged government property. “We have records of 15 calls from citizens stating that the protesters have stolen their vehicles. You have seen how this group behaves in the past. The common citizen is the one who is suffering the most, roads are blocked, and property has been damaged,” said the senior police officer. He elaborated that the police station in Shahdara was also ransacked by TLP supporters. “The frontline force for internal security is the police, and state institutions are backing us. We have cleared them from Lahore and the situation has settled somewhat. We are trying to make sure there is as little damage as possible.” Offering the religious party an olive branch, Kamran said that they are open to talks. “But if you continue to inconvenience the public and vandalise property, then the state is ready to deal with the situation.” Giving an overview of the situation, he said 112 police personnel have been injured since the start of the protest and added that some police personnel are also missing. “They [the TLP] are showing footage of where they are taking the abducted policemen,” said the DIG. Punjab Police question TLP’s motives Punjab Police posted a lengthy statement on X questioning the TLP’s motives behind the march. Video footage attached to the post showed policemen being beaten and cars with shattered windshields. “A peace agreement has been reached in Gaza, the Muslims there are celebrating and thanking Allah for the establishment of peace; why are the TLP demonstrators representing by wreaking havoc in Pakistan?” the police asked in the statement. “It is clear from such actions that the TLP people are also saddened by the establishment of peace in Gaza and this anarchist group is actively supporting the mission of Israeli Jews,” the statement added. The police questioned how kidnapping police personnel and engaging in widespread vandalism displayed loyalty to the people of Gaza. “Some anarchist groups from the TLP are misleading the public in the name of religion and trying to disrupt the peace,” the statement read. “Attacks on police officers and road closures will not be tolerated under any circumstances.” Punjab Police warned that people who take the law into their own hands would be dealt with an iron fist and urged the public to avoid supporting “mischievous elements”, be mindful of misinformation and cooperate with the authorities. Residents in twin cities face disruptions Residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have complained of road closures, traffic jams, and mobile network disruptions. Activities across the twin cities remained disrupted for the second consecutive day amid security measures and traffic restrictions, with authorities also suspending mobile internet connections and closing major roads. Shipping containers were being placed as barriers across major roads in the capital in anticipation of the arrival of the protesters. Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi told Dawn.com that no TLP protesters have entered the city, nor have any within the capital taken to streets to demonstrate. “With the exception of Faizabad, all roads in Islamabad are open,” he said in a voice note. “There are no issues. Some containers have been placed on certain roads, but traffic is still able to move.” According to an earlier notification issued by the Islamabad Traffic Police, “entry of all types of heavy vehicles into the capital will remain suspended until further notice.” “Traffic diversions are being implemented due to the law and order situation in Islamabad’s Faizabad area, and commuters are advised to use alternative routes to avoid inconvenience,” the notification added. Residents of the twin cities voiced frustration over the severe traffic disruptions. Shazia Tahir, a resident of Islamabad, told Dawn.com that her usual 20-minute commute to work took more than an hour due to multiple road closures. “I went to Radio Pakistan [office] this morning — the highway from Khanna was closed, and all connecting streets to Rawalpindi were blocked. Faizabad was also sealed. From the highway near Khanna Bridge, I had to take the service road through Sohan, then pass Margalla Town, take the road between Aabpara and F-6 to finally reach the Red Zone via Margalla Road. It took us one hour and fifteen minutes to get there,” she said. Others reported communication disruptions alongside traffic issues. Fauzia Kulsoom, a journalist from Rawalpindi, told Dawn.com that mobile services in Islamabad’s Blue Area remained suspended from 2pm to 5pm the previous day. “The Internet has been down for two days,” she said, adding that her work has been severely disrupted because of that. Some residents described partial closures and heavy congestion in several areas. Riaz Ali, a resident of Bahria Town, Islamabad, told Dawn.com that while containers had been placed and certain routes blocked, movement elsewhere remained possible. “Containers exist, some roads are blocked — Faizabad and GT Road — but things are otherwise open. I haven’t travelled over the past couple of days, but data services are still off,” he said. He added that on GT Road, near City Grammar School, containers had been placed on both sides, causing severe traffic jams. “There were large trucks, and only a few bikers managed to pass through the narrow gaps between the containers. Police presence was minimal, just a couple of officers. At the entrance to Bahria Phase 7, traffic was also backed up. In short, traffic was choked badly in this part of Bahria yesterday,” he said. Meanwhile, citizens in other parts of the country trying to travel to Islamabad also voiced frustration over the road closures and communication outages. Ramna Saeed, an Islamabad resident currently in Gujranwala, said she was unable to travel to the capital for her final LLB exam due to road closures. “All main entry points — Chanda Qila, Sadoki, Kamoki — were shut since morning, and trenches were dug overnight. We haven’t seen such measures here before,” she said. Ramna added that students and commuters were left stranded, with little information on when routes would reopen. “Mobile internet has also been disrupted, and although calls work, 3G and 4G services are barely functioning,” she said. Key intersections, including Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh Turn, DAV College Chowk, MH Chowk, and Naz Cinema, were closed to traffic. In the Saddar area, Haider Road, Suzuki Stand, and Murree Chowk were also blocked, while access roads leading to Kachehri Chowk remained inaccessible, per the traffic police notification. It said partial traffic movement resumed at Sawan Bridge and New Gulzar-i-Quaid, but major interchanges such as Chakri, Thalian, Brahma, and Mandara stayed closed, severing Rawalpindi’s access from major highways. The situation was similar at rural entry points, with Dholtala Mor, Misa Kaswal, Bai Khan Bridge, and GT Road near Gujar Khan all shut down. Meanwhile, motorway authorities said M-1 was open only towards Peshawar, while M-2 remained closed in both the Rawalpindi and Lahore directions. Friday clashes following protest call As many as 50 police officers were injured in Friday’s clashes, a senior police official told AFP , while TLP’s claims that some of its members had been killed could not be verified independently. The TLP said the protests had originally been organised to oppose the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Pakistan backed, but was now intended to express solidarity with Palestinians. “We have no demands, apart from showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad. “We have no idea when we will reach Islamabad, but the government is being brutal with us. We are not negotiating with the government at all,” Irfan said. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry vowed on Thursday not to let the protesters enter Islamabad. “There is no room for any radical activity in Islamabad,” he told reporters. “Why is an agreement that is acceptable to Hamas and Palestine not acceptable to you?” Israel declared a ceasefire and began pulling back its troops at around noon on Friday, as tens of thousands of Palestinians began walking back towards their devastated homes. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the deal on Thursday as a “historic opportunity to secure lasting peace”. “We will continue to work with partners, friends and the leaders of brotherly nations to ensure that peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people are established,” he said.

The TLP said the protests had originally been organised to oppose the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Pakistan backed, but was now intended to express solidarity with Palestinians. “We have no demands, apart from showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad. “We have no idea when we will reach Islamabad, but the government is being brutal with us. We are not negotiating with the government at all,” Irfan said. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry vowed on Thursday not to let the protesters enter Islamabad. “There is no room for any radical activity in Islamabad,” he told reporters. “Why is an agreement that is acceptable to Hamas and Palestine not acceptable to you?” Israel declared a ceasefire and began pulling back its troops at around noon on Friday, as tens of thousands of Palestinians began walking back towards their devastated homes. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the deal on Thursday as a “historic opportunity to secure lasting peace”. “We will continue to work with partners, friends and the leaders of brotherly nations to ensure that peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people are established,” he said.

      "summary": "Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) supporters have camped at Muridke for the night as they continued attempts to reach Islamabad to stage a protest in ‘solidarity with Palestinians’. Punjab Police, in an attempt to stop the march towards the federal capital, have reportedly dug a trench on the road. Earlier in the day, clashes between supporters of the religious party and police were reported in the Shahdara area of Lahore earlier today. At least 40 police personnel have been injured today, while the TLP claims that more than 10 of its workers have been killed in clashes with law enforcers. TLP began its protests in Lahore on Thursday and announced plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to voice its opposition to the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after two years of conflict in Gaza. The demonstrations turned violent on Friday, with police launching baton charges and firing tear gas at protesters who had pelted\nthem with rocks, AFP journalists saw. Arrests in Karachi Police in Karachi arrested over a dozen TLP workers on Saturday in a bid to break up their protest at the Karachi Press Club (KPC). Roads leading to JPC were blocked earlier in the day. DIG South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that 18 TLP workers were apprehended when they arrived at Regal Chowk in Saddar. A spokesperson for the religious party, Mohammad Rehan Khan, told Dawn.com that as part of the country-wide protest, they had planned to demonstrate outside the KPC against the Punjab government’s action against their protest rally in Lahore. He said since all roads leading to the KPC were blocked, they could not reach the venue and confirmed that some party workers were detained by the police. ‘Cleared them from Lahore’ Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran, addressing the media, said some police personnel were still admitted in hospitals and undergoing treatment, while others have been discharged. He added that TLP protesters have also damaged government property. “We have records of 15 calls from citizens stating that the protesters have stolen their vehicles. You have seen how this group behaves in the past. The common citizen is the one who is suffering the most, roads are blocked, and property has been damaged,” said the senior police officer. He elaborated that the police station in Shahdara was also ransacked by TLP supporters. “The frontline force for internal security is the police, and state institutions are backing us. We have cleared them from Lahore and the situation has settled somewhat. We are trying to make sure there is as little damage as possible.” Offering the religious party an olive branch, Kamran said that they are open to talks. “But if you continue to inconvenience the public and vandalise property, then the state is ready to deal with the situation.” Giving an overview of the situation, he said 112 police personnel have been injured since the start of the protest and added that some police personnel are also missing. “They [the TLP] are showing footage of where they are taking the abducted policemen,” said the DIG. Punjab Police question TLP’s motives Punjab Police posted a lengthy statement on X questioning the TLP’s motives behind the march. Video footage attached to the post showed policemen being beaten and cars with shattered windshields. “A peace agreement has been reached in Gaza, the Muslims there are celebrating and thanking Allah for the establishment of peace; why are the TLP demonstrators representing by wreaking havoc in Pakistan?” the police asked in the statement. “It is clear from such actions that the TLP people are also saddened by the establishment of peace in Gaza and this anarchist group is actively supporting the mission of Israeli Jews,” the statement added. The police questioned how kidnapping police personnel and engaging in widespread vandalism displayed loyalty to the people of Gaza. “Some anarchist groups from the TLP are misleading the public in the name of religion and trying to disrupt the peace,” the statement read. “Attacks on police officers and road closures will not be tolerated under any circumstances.” Punjab Police warned that people who take the law into their own hands would be dealt with an iron fist and urged the public to avoid supporting “mischievous elements”, be mindful of misinformation and cooperate with the authorities. Residents in twin cities face disruptions Residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have complained of road closures, traffic jams, and mobile network disruptions. Activities across the twin cities remained disrupted for the second consecutive day amid security measures and traffic restrictions, with authorities also suspending mobile internet connections and closing major roads. Shipping containers were being placed as barriers across major roads in the capital in anticipation of the arrival of the protesters. Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi told Dawn.com that no TLP protesters have entered the city, nor have any within the capital taken to streets to demonstrate. “With the exception of Faizabad, all roads in Islamabad are open,” he said in a voice note. “There are no issues. Some containers have been placed on certain roads, but traffic is still able to move.” According to an earlier notification issued by the Islamabad Traffic Police, “entry of all types of heavy vehicles into the capital will remain suspended until further notice.” “Traffic diversions are being implemented due to the law and order situation in Islamabad’s Faizabad area, and commuters are advised to use alternative routes to avoid inconvenience,” the notification added. Residents of the twin cities voiced frustration over the severe traffic disruptions. Shazia Tahir, a resident of Islamabad, told Dawn.com that her usual 20-minute commute to work took more than an hour due to multiple road closures. “I went to Radio Pakistan [office] this morning — the highway from Khanna was closed, and all connecting streets to Rawalpindi were blocked. Faizabad was also sealed. From the highway near Khanna Bridge, I had to take the service road through Sohan, then pass Margalla Town, take the road between Aabpara and F-6 to finally reach the Red Zone via Margalla Road. It took us one hour and fifteen minutes to get there,” she said. Others reported communication disruptions alongside traffic issues. Fauzia Kulsoom, a journalist from Rawalpindi, told Dawn.com that mobile services in Islamabad’s Blue Area remained suspended from 2pm to 5pm the previous day. “The Internet has been down for two days,” she said, adding that her work has been severely disrupted because of that. Some residents described partial closures and heavy congestion in several areas. Riaz Ali, a resident of Bahria Town, Islamabad, told Dawn.com that while containers had been placed and certain routes blocked, movement elsewhere remained possible. “Containers exist, some roads are blocked — Faizabad and GT Road — but things are otherwise open. I haven’t travelled over the past couple of days, but data services are still off,” he said. He added that on GT Road, near City Grammar School, containers had been placed on both sides, causing severe traffic jams. “There were large trucks, and only a few bikers managed to pass through the narrow gaps between the containers. Police presence was minimal, just a couple of officers. At the entrance to Bahria Phase 7, traffic was also backed up. In short, traffic was choked badly in this part of Bahria yesterday,” he said. Meanwhile, citizens in other parts of the country trying to travel to Islamabad also voiced frustration over the road closures and communication outages. Ramna Saeed, an Islamabad resident currently in Gujranwala, said she was unable to travel to the capital for her final LLB exam due to road closures. “All main entry points — Chanda Qila, Sadoki, Kamoki — were shut since morning, and trenches were dug overnight. We haven’t seen such measures here before,” she said. Ramna added that students and commuters were left stranded, with little information on when routes would reopen. “Mobile internet has also been disrupted, and although calls work, 3G and 4G services are barely functioning,” she said. Key intersections, including Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh Turn, DAV College Chowk, MH Chowk, and Naz Cinema, were closed to traffic. In the Saddar area, Haider Road, Suzuki Stand, and Murree Chowk were also blocked, while access roads leading to Kachehri Chowk remained inaccessible, per the traffic police notification. It said partial traffic movement resumed at Sawan Bridge and New Gulzar-i-Quaid, but major interchanges such as Chakri, Thalian, Brahma, and Mandara stayed closed, severing Rawalpindi’s access from major highways. The situation was similar at rural entry points, with Dholtala Mor, Misa Kaswal, Bai Khan Bridge, and GT Road near Gujar Khan all shut down. Meanwhile, motorway authorities said M-1 was open only towards Peshawar, while M-2 remained closed in both the Rawalpindi and Lahore directions. Friday clashes following protest call As many as 50 police officers were injured in Friday’s clashes, a senior police official told AFP , while TLP’s claims that some of its members had been killed could not be verified independently.

      "title_orig": "Deflecting responsibility can’t absolve Afghan govt of obligations towards regional peace: FO",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday night censured Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for remarks during his visit to India and said “deflecting” the responsibility of controlling terrorism could not absolve the Afghan authorities of their responsibilities towards regional peace. Muttaqi visited India earlier this week, marking India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. Speaking about a Thursday night explosion in Kabul during a press conference in New Delhi a day ago, Muttaqi had condemned the incident and Pakistan for its alleged role in it, saying: “Whatever the problems are in each country should be solved by themselves.” He said there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan. “If other countries achieve peace themselves as we did in Afghanistan, then there will be peace in the entire region. Since the last eight months, there has not been even a small incident in Afghanistan. In four years, no one has been harmed from Afghanistan’s soil. So this is the best proof that we have presented.” In a statement issued today, the FO said Pakistan’s strong reservations on the elements of the India-Afghanistan joint statement were conveyed to Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan by the additional foreign secretary (West Asia & Afghanistan) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. “Pakistan also strongly rejected the Afghan acting foreign minister’s assertion that terrorism is Pakistan’s internal problem,” the FO said, adding that Pakistan had repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan terrorist elements “operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan”. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “It was emphasised that by deflecting the responsibility of controlling terrorism towards Pakistan cannot absolve the Interim Afghan Government of its obligations towards ensuring peace and stability in the region and beyond,” the FO said. Elaborating on reservations regarding the joint statement, the FO said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The joint statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self-determination.” The FO said that Pakistan had “generously” hosted nearly four million Afghans for over four decades “in the spirit of good neighbourliness and Islamic brotherhood”. It said that with peace gradually returning to Afghanistan, it was time for unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan to return to their country. “Like all other countries and in line with international norms and practices, Pakistan has the right to regulate the presence of foreign nationals residing inside its territory. At the same time, along with the repatriation of Afghan nationals, Pakistan has also been generously issuing medical and study visas to address the medical and educational needs of Afghan nationals. In the spirit of Islamic brotherhood and good neighbourly relations, Pakistan will continue to extend humanitarian support to the people of Afghanistan.” “Pakistan is desirous of seeing a peaceful, stable, regionally connected and prosperous Afghanistan. Accordingly, Pakistan has extended all possible trade, economic and connectivity facilitation to Afghanistan. Such measures are aimed at promoting cooperation and socio-economic development of the two countries,” the FO added. At the same time, it said the government had the responsibility to “take all possible measures for the safety and security of its people”. The FO concluded by saying that Pakistan “expects the interim Afghan government to play its due role in supporting Pakistan to achieve this noble objective by taking concrete measures to prevent its territory from being used” by terrorist elements against Pakistan. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said earlier that Afghanistan’s export of terrorism would vitiate the atmosphere and cause a fissure in bilateral relations that Pakistan did not desire. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. The past week was particularly charged with statements to and fro from both sides as Pakistan suffered a string of martyrdoms of security forces in intelligence-based operations, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. Addressing the matter in an interview with Geo News , Asif said: “The terrorism they’re exporting to Pakistan, there will be a fissure created in relations in this environment, which is not our desire. We want our relations to continue respectfully.” The defence minister also called on people to monitor and take notice of any suspicious activity in their midst and take action as a community against any terrorist facilitators. “If you remain silent due to fear or any other reason, then I think it is understood as agreement.’’ Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out,” Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly. Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups. Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan a day ago. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.” Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "A session of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly was summoned for October 13 to elect the next chief minister, as Governor Faisal Karim Kundi confirmed the receipt of Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation from the top provincial slot on Saturday. KPA Speaker Babar Saleem Swati posted the schedule for Monday’s session on his X account. It said the election for the next chief minister would be held on the date. On Wednesday, Gandapur said that he resigned from his role as the provincial chief executive, while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the CM’s role. However, his resignation letter, which was shared with the media the previous night, had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s house denying having ever received it. “Today at 2:30 pm, the handwritten resignation advice of the CM Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was duly received and acknowledged by Governor House,” Kundi posted on X earlier today. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he added. ‘PTI will eradicate terrorism under KP’s new leadership’ PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said during a press conference today that under the leadership of incoming CM Sohail Afridi, the party will eradicate terrorism in KP. “Any complaints that have arisen recently from the government will be resolved,” he said. “On Monday, Sohail Afridi will be sworn in as the new KP chief minister.” “Afridi will be the first CM to hail from the tribal areas. He is young and determined,” Raja added. “This province will progress greatly under his leadership. We hope for an end to bloodshed through diplomacy, so we can eradicate terrorism in the region.” The PTI secretary general also noted that under Article 130(8) (the chief minister may, by writing under his hand addressed to the president, resign his office) of the Constitution, a chief minister can resign from office and does not require the acceptance or approval of the governor. Responding to a question about why no notification was issued for CM Gandapur’s resignation, Raja said that notifications “are just for information” and serve no purpose. Meanwhile, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in an interview on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan reiterated Raja’s point about the constitution granting the CM freedom to resign from their post. “It’s written in the constitution that if the governor accepts the resignation, then the house will select its leader and CM,” he said. “It is shameful that a local rivalry with the governor is being played upon like this “He (CM Gandapur) wants his resignation accepted immediately so that Sohail Afridi, [PTI founder] Imran Khan’s pick for CM, can sit in the seat. This cannot be left up in the air.” When asked to confirm if there would be a session at the KP assembly on Monday, Akram replied in the affirmative. “We have the numbers,” he said. “There is a clear majority if there is no misadventure.” When asked if the PTI will consult with the federal government about an alternative candidate, the party spokesperson replied: “We do not have to consult with the government about who we nominate. It is the PTI’s and Imran Khan’s mandate. Did the government consult us on bringing Maryam and Bugti in as CMs? “He (Afridi) has been a cabinet member for one and a half years. If he were a facilitator, then why did nobody say anything then?” The PTI information secretary reiterated that the PTI stands against terrorists but believes that collateral damage in military operations could create an insurgency and make the population vengeful and vindictive. “Khan sahib says we are against terrorism, but for the long-term benefit, you cannot mire the country in insurgencies,” he said. Earlier, Gandapur left for Dera Ismail Khan after saying farewell to his staff at the chief minister’s house. In his first media interaction after resi­g­ning, Gandapur had pressed for the swift acceptance of his resignation on Thu­rsday night. He said any delay in the process would be detrimental to the province.",

      "summary_orig": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a large military parade displaying its new intercontinental ballistic missile in front of visiting international dignitaries, state media KCNA said on Saturday. The parade, which began late on Friday, marked the 80th anniversary of the foundation of its ruling Workers’ Party and followed celebrations on Thursday. Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev, as well as Vietnam’s Communist Party chief To Lam, were seen at Kim’s side at the parade, while other foreign dignitaries looked on. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watches a military parade celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers Party, in Pyongyang, North Korea, in this picture released on October 11, by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency. —KCNA via Reuters In the military parade, nuclear-armed North Korea displayed its most advanced Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, described by KCNA as the country’s “strongest nuclear strategic weapon system.” The Hwasong series of ICBMs has given North Korea the capacity to target anywhere on the US mainland, but questions remain over the sophistication of its guidance system to reach a target, and the ability of a warhead it carries to withstand atmospheric re-entry. “The Hwasong-20 represents, for the moment, the apotheosis of North Korea’s ambitions for long-range nuclear delivery capabilities. We should expect to see the system tested before the end of this year,” said Ankit Panda of the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The system is likely designed for the delivery of multiple warheads… Multiple warheads will increase stresses on existing US missile defence systems and augment what Kim sees as necessary to achieve meaningful deterrence effects against Washington.” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends a military parade celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK), in Pyongyang, North Korea, picture released October 11, by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency. —KCNA via Reuters Other weapons on display included hypersonic ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, a new type of multiple rocket launcher and a launcher for suicide drones, said Hong Min, North Korea analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification. At the military parade, Kim gave a speech in which he expressed “warm encouragement” for North Korean troops in overseas operations, adding its military’s heroism will not only be seen in the defence of North Korea but also in “outposts of socialist construction,” KCNA said. “Our army should continue to grow into an invincible entity that destroys all threats,” Kim said. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam To Lam, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council and leader of the United Russia political party Dmitry Medvedev and China’s Premier Li Qiang attend a military parade celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. —via Reuters Kim held talks earlier on Friday with Medvedev, who said the sacrifice of North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia in its military campaign in Ukraine proved the trust in relations between the two countries. Kim told Medvedev he hopes to continue strengthening cooperation with Russia and to closely engage in diverse exchanges to achieve common goals, KCNA said. Vietnam and North Korea also signed agreements of cooperation in various fields, including between their defence, foreign and health ministries, KCNA said without elaborating.",

      "title_orig": "Info Minister Tarar assails PTI-led KP govt for ‘facilitating terrorists, sowing division’",
      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday assailed the PTI-led KP government for “facilitating terrorists, sowing division, and undermining national security,” stressing that the sacrifices of Pakistanis in the fight against terrorism will not be in vain. The information minister’s remarks come a day after the spokesperson for the military’s media wing, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, without naming anyone, said the “state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of a single person deemed most responsible for bringing terrorism back to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.” “In the past week alone, there have been several terrorist attacks which were bravely and courageously repelled by officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Army,” Tarar said. Referring to PTI, he said during this time, there remains only one party, “Tehreek-i-Inteshaar” (movement of chaos) which has no concern for the sacrifices of our martyrs, no concern for the integrity of the country, and whose only interest is in “further dividing KP, worsening the situation, and creating safe havens for terrorists within the province.” “This is not a story of today,” the minister continued. “For decades, Imran Khan and his party have followed this pattern, showing sympathy for terrorists at the local, regional, and even international levels, and acting as their facilitators.” “This nation has sacrificed so much. Pakistan is the only country whose children have also given their lives,” he said. “How can we forget the students of the APS Peshawar attack , those children who wrote a legendary chapter of sacrifice in blood, a story that will live forever in history. [How] can we forget the children martyred recently in Khuzdar , those who were attacked on a bus. How can we forget their sacrifices?” He said he had personally visited Khuzdar and Quetta.  “When we spoke to the parents of those children, they were such brave and remarkable people. One man, whose three sons were martyred, stood with complete courage and resolve and said, ‘My own life is also ready to be sacrificed for Pakistan.’” He said the province had borne the brunt of militancy for decades, yet its citizens had remained steadfast. “You will find countless examples of how the brave people of KP have rendered immense sacrifices for this country, whether they are from the armed forces, civilians, tradesmen, doctors, engineers, or shopkeepers and children; every segment of society has sacrificed for Pakistan,” Tarar said. “And when the entire country expressed its resolve to eradicate terrorism through the implementation of the National Action Plan, everyone saw how the armed forces, the federal government under Nawaz Sharif, and the provincial governments defeated terrorism through operations such as Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad .” Recalling the years when terrorism gripped the country, Tarar said it was a time when fear overshadowed daily life. “This was the time when our cricket grounds had become deserted, every city would witness a terrorist incident every other day; this was the time when our ulema, our citizens, our children were sacrificing their lives,” he added. He said the nation could not forget the Parade Lane mosque attack , in which retired officers, children, and citizens were martyred, adding that the terrorists have no caste, creed, or colour. “They only believe in violence and promoting terror. They have no god or prophet. They have nothing to do with any religion or Islam.” The minister said the State of Pakistan exists in the name of the Kalima; the whole world views it as a strong Islamic country. To attack the mosques of that state, to attack its armed forces, to attack the law enforcers of that state, to carry out terrorist activities inside that state; this is not permissible in any way, not by any standard, and Islam also does not permit it. He said the ulema have already issued fatwas (edicts) stating that no jihad can be waged against the state of Pakistan. “These terrorists do not spare even mosques,” he said, adding that the sacrifices of those people [against terrorism] will never go in vain. Criticising Imran, Tarar said there was one person in jail who believed the sacrifices of the nation held no value. “If there is respect, it is for how politics can be polished, and in that sense those people who chant the slogan ‘Khan Nahi, To Pakistan Nahi’ [we] regard such politics as a curse in which, by favouring a personality, you push Pakistan backwards and bring the personality forward,” he said. He added that no political party had ever resorted to such slogans before, recalling that when Benazir Bhutto was martyred, PPP workers chanted, ‘Pakistan khappay’ (long live Pakistan). “The leadership of the PML-N has always spoken for this country even in the most difficult circumstances,” he said, questioning, “What slogan have you [Imran Khan] given to your Pakistan? Is your personality the greatest, and everyone else below it?” Talking about Operation Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad, he asserted that peace was established in 2017, but in 2018, when the KP government took over, it invited and resettled terrorists in the province. He alleged there was a reason behind this — an illegal spectrum through which the KP government promotes smuggling, illegal trade, and an undocumented economy. “This includes non-custom-paid cars business, oil smuggling, food smuggling, tobacco and timber business, in which terrorists and the KP PTI government have a nexus. The KP govt, the PTI benefits through these,” he said, adding that these people also fund Imran. He said they settled the militants in populated areas, helped them establish businesses, and entered formal trade partnerships with them. That “successful scheme,” he remarked, is now haunting the nation as “we pick up bodies every day.” He added that this would not be allowed to continue. “The state of Pakistan will never permit any person or group to support these terrorists. The state of Pakistan has decided that it will defeat the terrorists. “When history is written, on one side will be our brave people and on the other the Tehreek-i-Inteshaar (PTI), which believed there was an advantage in supporting terrorists.” Talking about the newly appointed Chief Minister of KP, Sohail Afridi , he said that when it came to selecting a CM, they chose someone who has cases against him, “who is known to be involved in drug peddling and drug business”. Tarar added that this was part of the same black economy through which PTI gains benefits. The minister asserted that “there have been speculations that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was becoming the militant wing of PTI”. “I hope this is not true, but this is being speculated”, he said. ‘We stand for the blood of martyrs’: PTI Meanwhile, PTI leadership held a press conference in Islamabad today in response to DG ISPR’s presser, asserting that the party stands for the blood of the martyrs and warning that misrepresenting PTI would not erase the people’s love for Imran. “Yesterday, a very emotional press conference was held. We will not respond to it word for word, but we know that we are loyal to Pakistan, and ninety per cent of the country’s people stand with Imran Khan,” said PTI’s Secretary General, Salman Akram Raja. “Khan Sahib has always made us a nation; we were raised on Allama Iqbal’s ideals. We stand for the blood of the martyrs. Calling us traitors is a misunderstanding that will harm this country,” he said. “For God’s sake, come to your senses. The nation stands with Imran Khan and PTI. You cannot remove the love for Imran Khan from the hearts of the people. The Pakistani nation knows who is truly loyal to this country and this nation.”",

Pakistan is the only country whose children have also given their lives,” he said. “How can we forget the students of the APS Peshawar attack , those children who wrote a legendary chapter of sacrifice in blood, a story that will live forever in history. [How] can we forget the children martyred recently in Khuzdar , those who were attacked on a bus. How can we forget their sacrifices?” He said he had personally visited Khuzdar and Quetta.  “When we spoke to the parents of those children, they were such brave and remarkable people. One man, whose three sons were martyred, stood with complete courage and resolve and said, ‘My own life is also ready to be sacrificed for Pakistan.’” He said the province had borne the brunt of militancy for decades, yet its citizens had remained steadfast. “You will find countless examples of how the brave people of KP have rendered immense sacrifices for this country, whether they are from the armed forces, civilians, tradesmen, doctors, engineers, or shopkeepers and children; every segment of society has sacrificed for Pakistan,” Tarar said. “And when the entire country expressed its resolve to eradicate terrorism through the implementation of the National Action Plan, everyone saw how the armed forces, the federal government under Nawaz Sharif, and the provincial governments defeated terrorism through operations such as Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad .” Recalling the years when terrorism gripped the country, Tarar said it was a time when fear overshadowed daily life. “This was the time when our cricket grounds had become deserted, every city would witness a terrorist incident every other day; this was the time when our ulema, our citizens, our children were sacrificing their lives,” he added. He said the nation could not forget the Parade Lane mosque attack , in which retired officers, children, and citizens were martyred, adding that the terrorists have no caste, creed, or colour. “They only believe in violence and promoting terror. They have no god or prophet. They have nothing to do with any religion or Islam.” The minister said the State of Pakistan exists in the name of the Kalima; the whole world views it as a strong Islamic country. To attack the mosques of that state, to attack its armed forces, to attack the law enforcers of that state, to carry out terrorist activities inside that state; this is not permissible in any way, not by any standard, and Islam also does not permit it. He said the ulema have already issued fatwas (edicts) stating that no jihad can be waged against the state of Pakistan. “These terrorists do not spare even mosques,” he said, adding that the sacrifices of those people [against terrorism] will never go in vain. Criticising Imran, Tarar said there was one person in jail who believed the sacrifices of the nation held no value. “If there is respect, it is for how politics can be polished, and in that sense those people who chant the slogan ‘Khan Nahi, To Pakistan Nahi’ [we] regard such politics as a curse in which, by favouring a personality, you push Pakistan backwards and bring the personality forward,” he said. He added that no political party had ever resorted to such slogans before, recalling that when Benazir Bhutto was martyred, PPP workers chanted, ‘Pakistan khappay’ (long live Pakistan). “The leadership of the PML-N has always spoken for this country even in the most difficult circumstances,” he said, questioning, “What slogan have you [Imran Khan] given to your Pakistan? Is your personality the greatest, and everyone else below it?” Talking about Operation Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad, he asserted that peace was established in 2017, but in 2018, when the KP government took over, it invited and resettled terrorists in the province. He alleged there was a reason behind this — an illegal spectrum through which the KP government promotes smuggling, illegal trade, and an undocumented economy. “This includes non-custom-paid cars business, oil smuggling, food smuggling, tobacco and timber business, in which terrorists and the KP PTI government have a nexus. The KP govt, the PTI benefits through these,” he said, adding that these people also fund Imran. He said they settled the militants in populated areas, helped them establish businesses, and entered formal trade partnerships with them. That “successful scheme,” he remarked, is now haunting the nation as “we pick up bodies every day.” He added that this would not be allowed to continue. “The state of Pakistan will never permit any person or group to support these terrorists. The state of Pakistan has decided that it will defeat the terrorists. “When history is written, on one side will be our brave people and on the other the Tehreek-i-Inteshaar (PTI), which believed there was an advantage in supporting terrorists.” Talking about the newly appointed Chief Minister of KP, Sohail Afridi , he said that when it came to selecting a CM, they chose someone who has cases against him, “who is known to be involved in drug peddling and drug business”. Tarar added that this was part of the same black economy through which PTI gains benefits. The minister asserted that “there have been speculations that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was becoming the militant wing of PTI”. “I hope this is not true, but this is being speculated”, he said. ‘We stand for the blood of martyrs’: PTI Meanwhile, PTI leadership held a press conference in Islamabad today in response to DG ISPR’s presser, asserting that the party stands for the blood of the martyrs and warning that misrepresenting PTI would not erase the people’s love for Imran. “Yesterday, a very emotional press conference was held. We will not respond to it word for word, but we know that we are loyal to Pakistan, and ninety per cent of the country’s people stand with Imran Khan,” said PTI’s Secretary General, Salman Akram Raja. “Khan Sahib has always made us a nation; we were raised on Allama Iqbal’s ideals. We stand for the blood of the martyrs. Calling us traitors is a misunderstanding that will harm this country,” he said. “For God’s sake, come to your senses. The nation stands with Imran Khan and PTI. You cannot remove the love for Imran Khan from the hearts of the people. The Pakistani nation knows who is truly loyal to this country and this nation.”",

      "summary_orig": "Six policemen, including trainees, were martyred and 13 others — 12 policemen and a civilian — were injured in a terrorist attack on the Police Training School in Dera Ismail Khan district, which security forces and law enforcement personnel successfully repelled, the military’s media wing said on Saturday. According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), on the night of October 10–11, assailants attempted to breach the perimeter of the Police Training School, but “their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response of law enforcement personnel deployed on duty.” In their desperation, the attackers rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the gate of the complex, the statement added. “Displaying unwavering courage and professional excellence, police personnel engaged the intruders, eliminating three Khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij, the ISPR said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “While cornering the remaining two intruding Khwarij in a building complex, they were later neutralised by security forces in a deliberate clearance operation with precision,” the statement read. The military’s media wing said that during the intense exchange of fire, six brave policemen, including trainees, “embraced martyrdom after putting up a heroic fight”, while 12 policemen and one civilian were injured. “During this heinous attack, Khwarij attacked the mosque inside the school complex and not only desecrated the holy place of worship but also barbarically killed the imam [of] the masjid, an innocent civilian who was performing the duties of Imam at the school,” the statement read. ISPR said the sanitisation operation is continuing in the area, and the perpetrators of the “heinous and cowardly act will be brought to justice.” “The security forces, alongside law enforcement agencies of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain steadfast in their resolve to eradicate Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further strengthen our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the statement said. Earlier in the day, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) had also issued a statement, saying that the police had repulsed the attack. At the time, officials had said that at least three terrorists, including a suicide bomber, were killed in retaliatory fire by police forces. A report issued by the CTD, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , showed that seven cops were martyred while another 13 were injured in the incident. Dera Ismail Khan Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Hamid Siddiqui also confirmed the casualties to Dawn.com . According to the CTD report, the attack took place at 8:30pm on Friday within the limits of the Shorkot Police Station. “A National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) office near the training centre was also burnt down by terrorists,” Dera Ismail Khan AC told Dawn.com. The initial attack left one police officer dead, the police statement said. It further said that militants then proceeded to enter the school and started firing with heavy weapons and hand grenades, adding that police forces “retaliated bravely” and the exchange of fire went on for about five hours. “As soon as the news of the attack reached District Police Officer (DPO) Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmed, he rushed to the site with a heavy contingent of police,” the statement read. Regional Police Officer Syed Ashfaq Anwar was present as well, it said, adding that police were then joined by security forces. “The police and security forces jointly set an example of courage and bravery in the five-hour-long operation, killing five terrorists and recovering suicide jackets, explosives and ammunition from them,” as per the police statement. The area has been cleared of the terrorists, and a search operation was underway, the statement said. Lauding the efforts of the forces in thwarting the attack, KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed was quoted as saying, “The unparalleled bravery of the officers on the frontline has proven that the KP police is committed to eradicating terrorism.” Announcing compensation for the martyred, he assured that “their sacrifices will not go in vain”. The KP IG also announced special rewards for all those who participated in the operation. Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel. A senior army officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the DI Khan a day ago. A cop was martyred in the district after a police checkpoint came under attack from multiple sides by terrorists late on Wednesday. Last month, 13 terrorists were killed during an IBO in the district’s Daraban area. According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.",
