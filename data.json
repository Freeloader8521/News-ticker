      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Tuesday accused PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan of creating a divide within the party and alleged that she was being facilitated by the Military Intelligence (MI) and “establishment”. In a video statement, Gandapur said: “Imran Khan is my leader, I am loyal to him. It is my right to convey the truth to him … I made him aware of all that has been happening [during my meeting with him yesterday].” He said that initially he was not being given the permission to meet Imran in jail and his messages were conveyed to the public only through his sisters. “So there is a big divide in the party now,” he continued. Gandapur said his provincial government had presented KP’s budget as otherwise the PTI government would have been “disqualified”. And since there were no instructions from Imran to the effect of not presenting the budget, it was presented, he added. “But after that, campaigns that were launched declaring me and parliament traitors were highly inappropriate. And we repeatedly asked [Imran’s] sisters to bring some clarity on it but to no avail. So an impression was created that we were going against you (Imran). But it was not the case. “And when the time came to pass the budget, the situation was same. They were not allowing us to meet (Imran). Mirza Saif was eventually able to meet him after great difficulty in which Khan sahib was informed of the situation …  We eventually passed the budget after making it clear to Khan sahib that he could make any changes he wanted.” Gandapur also claimed that he had told Imran that he had the authority to stop them from passing the budget and they would comply. “But my MPAs and party members were accused that we committed treachery passing this budget … They are running these campaigns.” He said he had also been accused of applying the “minus Imran Khan” formula. “But I [told Imran] that nobody could think or have the courage to do so.” The KP CM added that he had conveyed to the party founder that “Aleema Khan had a big role in dividing the party. Because some party members are being discredited. And the party is losing hope. That steps were not being taken for your release. Instead there is groupism in party which some people are using to serve their own interests”. He further alleged that Aleema was in contact with “vloggers” working to create divide in the party. “And instead of stopping them … she is provoking them. And Hafeezullah Niazi sahib refers to Aleema Khan as the prime minister in his articles. He writes that she should become the party chairperson,” he alleged. He alleged that campaigns were being carried out to declare Aleema the chairperson of the party. Gandapur said he told Imran that the party was being harmed by these campaigns and agendas. “If you (Imran) want to elect a chairperson then go ahead … whoever you nominate will be acceptable but do it,” he said, referring to his conversation with Imran. Gandapur said that petty issues were being created within the party and no work was being done on getting Imran out of jail. He alleged that instead of standing united, “our trajectory is such that complies with the objectives of the institutions and establishment, and Aleema is playing a direct role in this”. “I clearly told him that institutions are working to weaken us … I told him that the MI was facilitating Aleema Khan in this process, according to my knowledge … It is supporting Aleema Khan in weakening us.” Gandapur’s statement came after Aleema spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, where Imran is incarcerated, earlier in the day. During the interaction , Aleema was asked about Gandapur’s meeting with Imran. To that, she said the KP CM had alleged during the meeting that she was working with the MI, was behind “all” the attacks directed towards Gandapur on social media and that she wanted to become the PTI chairperson. According to Aleema Imran shared with us. “He was laughing while telling us.” “Remember that Imran Khan is PTI’s chairman. Only he is the chairman and no one else,” she asserted. “We will do everything for Imran Khan, we will tolerate everything for him. But we will not leave him [alone] no matter what they do.” She maintained that Imran conveyed his messages to the outside world through his family only when a party member was not available. “He also specifies what has to be told publicly and what privately.”",

      "title_orig": "Pentagon chief slams ‘fat generals,’ says US officers should resign if they don’t support his agenda",
      "summary_orig": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth slammed “fat generals” and diversity initiatives that he said led to decades of decay in the military and told a rare gathering of commanders on Tuesday they should resign if they don’t support his agenda. “Foolish and reckless political leaders set the wrong compass heading and we lost our way. We became the ‘Woke Department,’” Hegseth said as he kicked off the event in Quantico, Virginia. “But not anymore,” he said. Addressing a room full of America’s top generals and admirals, summoned from around the world without explanation last week, Hegseth defended his firings of flag officers, which include the top US general, who is Black, and the Navy’s top admiral, who is a woman. He said the officers he relieved were part of a broken culture. He promised sweeping changes to how discrimination complaints are handled and how accusations of wrongdoing are investigated at the Pentagon, saying the current system has top brass walking on “egg shells.” “If the words I’m speaking today are making your hearts sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign,” Hegseth said. “I know the overwhelming majority of you feel the opposite. These words make your hearts full.” Hegseth criticised the look of overweight troops, saying: “It’s completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon.” He said all fitness tests would be set to male benchmarks only and emphasised the importance of grooming standards. “The era of unprofessional appearance is over. No more beardos,” Hegseth told the audience, which sat in silence. Trump tells commanders: I have your backs US President Donald Trump, as he departed for the event, told reporters on Tuesday that he would fire military leaders on the spot if he did not like them. Trump then opened with a joke as he took the stage for a speech that lasted more than an hour, saying: “If you don’t like what I’m saying, you can leave the room, of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future.” But he then spoke warmly of the military, in sometimes-wandering remarks that touched on issues like the prowess of US nuclear submarines but also included fierce criticism of the media, former President Joe Biden and Venezuela. He echoed Hegseth when he turned his attention to his opposition to diversity initiatives. “Merit. Everything’s based on merit. You’re all based on merit. We’re not going to have somebody taking your place for political reasons, because they are politically correct and you’re not,” Trump said. “I am with you. I support you, and as president, I have your backs 100 per cent,” Trump said. The auditorium was filled with senior uniformed officials, seated in front of a stage with a large American flag, a lectern and boards that read: “Strength. Service. America.” As Trump spoke, several officers sat looking expressionless, and the room was far quieter than the crowds at Trump’s usual gatherings. A naval officer took notes. The US military is meant to be apolitical, loyal to the US Constitution and independent of any party or political movement. That creates pressure on the commanders to avoid reacting to overtly political comments, by Trump or Hegseth. Revamp of Defence priorities The Pentagon has undergone eight months of blistering changes since Trump took office, including firings, banning books from academy libraries and ordering lethal strikes on suspected drug boats off Venezuela. “If you try to poison our people, we will blow you out of existence,” Trump told the audience. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defence the “Department of War,” reverting to a title it held until after World War Two when officials sought to emphasise the Pentagon’s role in preventing conflict. The name change will require congressional approval. The administration has announced a plan to send National Guard deployments to Chicago, the latest US city where Trump aims to deploy US troops despite objections from local authorities. Trump announced plans to send National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, over the weekend and sent Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles earlier this year, despite protests from local officials. He acknowledged discomfort among his opponents for deploying the military on US streets, but said America was in the grips of what he described as a war from within waged by illegal immigrants who his administration is seeking to deport. “America is under invasion from within. We’re under invasion from within, no different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways, because they don’t wear uniforms,” Trump said. Trump speaks about COAS Munir During his address, Trump also mentioned Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, saying he was in the US along with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “He is a very important guy in Pakistan … and I didn’t even realise it, as beautiful as he said it to a group of people who were with it … he said this man (Trump) saved millions of lives. “I was very honoured, I loved the way he said it” the US president said. He also maintained that Pakistan downed seven Indian jets during the May escalation between the two countries. Shakeups at Pentagon Amid speculation over reasons for gathering all the top brass in one place, Vice President JD Vance insisted it was “actually not unusual at all,” and told reporters “it’s odd that you guys have made it into such a big story”. The Pentagon only said last week that Hegseth “will be addressing his senior military leaders,” and the lack of clarity over what would occur fed speculation that a major announcement. In May, Hegseth ordered major cuts to the number of general and flag officers in the US military, including at least a 20 per cent reduction in the number of active-duty four-star generals and admirals. That came after the Pentagon announced in February that it aimed to reduce the number of its civilian employees by at least five per cent. Since beginning his second term in January, Trump has also purged top officers, including chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff general Charles “CQ” Brown, whom he fired without explanation in February. Other senior officers dismissed this year include the heads of the Navy and Coast Guard, the leaders of the National Security Agency and the Defence Intelligence Agency, the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, a Navy admiral assigned to Nato, and three top military lawyers. Hegseth defended the firings on Tuesday, saying: “it’s nearly impossible to change a culture with the same people who helped create — or even benefited from — that culture.” US forces carried out a nearly two month-long campaign of strikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels earlier this year and also hit three nuclear sites that were a key part of Tehran’s nuclear programme. And US troops have also been deployed in Los Angeles and Washington — allegedly to combat civil unrest and crime — while similar moves are planned for Portland, Memphis and potentially other cities.",

      "summary_orig": "At least 10 people were martyred and 32 injured on Tuesday when a bomb blast ripped through a busy street near Quetta’s Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters, officials said. Speaking to Dawn.com , Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar confirmed the death and injury toll. He said, “Ten people have been killed while 32 were injured in the blast. The injured have been taken to the Civil Hospital and Trauma Centre.” Separately, he told Reuters that those martyred in the blast also included paramilitary personnel. @dawn.today At least 10 people, including soldiers, were martyred and 32 were injured on Tuesday after a bomb blast ripped through a busy street near Quetta’s Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters, officials said. “The death toll so far is 10 people who have been martyred, five are critically injured and 26 injured are admitted here at the Civil Hospital. We are also checking with other hospitals whether any injured have been admitted there,\" Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar told Reuters. \"It was certainly a cowardly act and the target was the headquarters of the Frontier Corps.\" Several gunmen stormed the headquarters after the bombing, triggering a gun battle with the paramilitary, provincial Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said in televised remarks, adding the suicide bomber was driving a pickup truck and security forces killed four further attackers. Via Reuters.  DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com In a Reuters video, where he was speaking to the media, Kakar said the attack “definitely targeted the FC headquarters”. Meanwhile, Civil Lines Police Station House Officer (SHO) Ameen Jaffar told Dawn.com that “eight bodies were brought to the Civil Hospital after the blast”. According to the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Special Operations Quetta Muhammad Baloch, the “blast took place when a vehicle turned from Model Town towards Hali Road, close to the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters”. Television and social media footage captured the moment when the powerful explosion ripped through the street. @dawn.today At least 10 people were killed and 32 were injured on Tuesday after a bomb blast ripped through a busy street in Quetta, Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar told Dawn.com. “Thirty-two injured have been taken to the Civil Hospital and Trauma Centre,” Kakar said. Following the explosion, the Balochistan Health Department imposed an emergency in hospitals across the capital, according to Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman. “An emergency has been declared at the Quetta Civil Hospital, Balochistan Medical College (BMC) Hospital Quetta, and the Trauma Centre,” a statement from Rehman said. DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the incident, calling it a “terrorist attack”. “Following the incident, security forces gave a swift and effective response, eliminating four terrorists,” a post from the Balochistan government’s X account quoted him as saying. “The terrorists cannot weaken the nation’s resolve through cowardly acts. The sacrifices of the people and security forces will not go in vain. We remain committed to making Balochistan peaceful and secure. I express solidarity with the families of the martyrs, pray for the elevation of their ranks, and for the speedy recovery of the injured.” Later, speaking during an event in Quetta, he said that “an operation against the terrorists is underway”. President Asif Ali Zardari termed the incident a “suicide attack”. “The president has strongly condemned the suicide attack in Quetta carried out by the Fitna-al-Khawarij , the misguided extremists acting on India’s agenda,” a statement from the President’s Secretariat said. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “The president said that the elements serving the interests of Fitna-al-Khawarij and India cannot undermine Pakistan’s peace and stability. He commended the security forces for their timely and effective response, which foiled the malicious designs of the terrorists.” According to the statement, the president “prayed for the swift recovery of the injured FC personnel and lauded the courage and resolve of the country’s security forces in defending the motherland”. Later, an X post by the Pakistan government said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had commended the security forces for killing the “terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan ” who carried out the attack. The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The government statement said the PM also prayed for the quick recovery of the injured citizens and security personnel. He expressed the resolve to defeat the nefarious designs of elements causing harm to citizens and their properties. “We will mete out exemplary punishment to elements trying to harm the security of the country,” the statement quoted him as saying. Six injured in critical condition, emergency declared in hospitals Following the explosion, the Balochistan Health Department imposed an emergency in hospitals across the capital, according to Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman. “An emergency has been declared at the Quetta Civil Hospital, Balochistan Medical College (BMC) Hospital Quetta, and the Trauma Centre,” a statement from Rehman said. “All consultants, doctors, pharmacists, staff nurses, and paramedical staff have been directed to remain present in the hospitals.” Speaking to the media later during a visit to the Civil Hospital, Health Minister Kakar said that the condition of six injured people was critical. “A major terrorist plot was planned. I strongly condemn the blast near FC headquarters,” he said, adding that most of the injured were civilians. The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency , have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) , in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.

      "title_orig": "‘Why make it Sindh vs Punjab?’: PPP takes exception to Maryam’s remarks, walks out of NA session",
      "summary_orig": "The rift between the PPP and PML-N escalated on Tuesday when PPP lawmakers walked out of the National Assembly in protest against remarks made a day earlier by Punjab Chief Minister and PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz. The war of words, which began over flood compensation through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), had expanded to water rights on the Indus River a day earlier as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. At a Faisalabad event on Monday, Maryam defended a controversial canal project on the Indus, rejecting Sindh’s objections and warning the PPP against criticising Punjab’s development — comments that triggered a PPP walkout from the National Assembly today. Taking the floor of the lower house of Parliament, PPP’s Naveed Qamar said: “Right now, our country is going through a severe flood situation. As we speak, there is a medium-level flood ongoing in my constituency. The onsluaght that came from Punjab has more or less subsided but many rural areas are still submerged. Standing crops were also submerged.” He added that people were looking toward the country’s leadership during this time, highlighting that a recent report released by the Food and Agric­u­lture Organisation (FAO) stated that the floods would also affect upcoming Rabi cultivation. “Unfortunately, people have not seen rescue efforts following the floods but have seen a lot of politics,” he lamented. “When it comes to it, we can also make fiery speeches. We can also make something an inter-provincial issue but we have mercy on the people of whose responsibility rests on ours shoulders. “We cannot absolve ourselves by saying ’it was because of nature’ and leave people to fend for themselves.” He continued: “In the past few days, there have been statements — and I accept some were from our side — but the escalation that followed and the level to which things went is in no way appropriate.” Qamar maintained that when PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari visited flood-hit areas, the first thing he did was to praise the Punjab government. “He said that in Punjab, the chief minister and the Punjab government did good work in dealing with the flood situation.” He added that some people from their camp did not like this but then the “escalation” went in another direction. “In Punjab, a flood of this size has occurred for the first time. But Sindh has suffered this repeatedly […]. We have gone through this experience, and we have learnt from our mistakes,” he said. “We learnt that instead of sending flour or sacks, give people cash directly so that they can rebuild their lives,” Qamar said. “We are your allies, we can give you suggestions. The government is yours, you have to make decisions […] but if we give you advice based on our experiences from the past then why do you turn it into criticism? Why make it a Sindh versus Punjab issue?” he asked. “‘Our water, our money, our will’ — what does that mean? What does that imply? This is our country and it belongs to all of us […]. Consider our suggestions; if you don’t like them, don’t accept them, but the response should not be what it has been,” he said, mentioning Maryam’s words. He said he was very “saddened” by the remarks made by her a day prior. “The Indus is the lifeline of Pakistan. If the Indus exists, Pakistan exists; if the Indus does not exist, Pakistan will not exist. It connects the whole country […] it is neither Sindh’s water nor Punjab’s nor any other province’s. It passes through all and benefits everyone,” he added. “In such a situation, it is becoming very difficult for us to sit on the treasury benches,” he said. “This is not a partnership. We are not getting a fee to sit with you. If you give us respect, we are with you in national interest. We don’t want ministries or anything else,” he said as other members of the House pounded on their desks. “Think of the people and look at how partnerships work. We cannot take part in House proceedings until things improve. We are walking out,” he said. Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said he was apologetic if the PPP was distressed over the comments made by Maryam and called for a dialogue between the two sides. The NA session was subsequently adjourned till 11am on Friday. ‘Better for provinces to share issues’ Meanwhile, PPP leader Sherry Rehman, in a video posted on the PPP’s X account, said that this matter should be taken up in both Houses of Parliament. “Whether it is the floods, the canals issue or regarding water reservoirs, we have never adopted an attitude towards Punjab where anyone could point fingers,” she said. “We have always spoken within the bounds of decency and acted with responsibility. So it is better that both the provinces share their issues with each other,” she said. She further said that the BISP was globally acknowledged and there was “no comparison”. “It has been recognised at an international level among social protection programmes,” she said, adding that if it was employed effectively then four million people would not currently be in distress. She questioned how the PPP could be part of such an alliance under the current circumstances and said that the war of words was not the way forward. “The people are watching all of us and they are looking toward us. Chairman Bilawal has also made it clear that the people should be given effective and complete relief. There is nothing here for anyone to be offended about,” she emphasised, adding that in such an environment it had become difficult to continue supporting the government with consistency.",

According to the ISPR, the launch was witnessed by the chief of general staff, senior officers from Pakistan’s armed forces, scientists and engineers. @dawn.today A successful training launch of the newly developed Fatah-4, Ground Launched Cruise Missile, was conducted today by the Pakistan Army at a range of 750 Kilometers, PTV reported.  Today’s launch was witnessed by the Chief of General Staff, Senior officers from the Pakistan Armed Forces, dedicated scientists and engineers. The President, Prime Minister of Pakistan, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and Services Chiefs have also congratulated the participating troops, scientists and engineers on the successful conduct of Fatah-4’s training fire. DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com Moreover, the president, prime minister, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, and services chiefs have congratulated the participating troops, scientists and engineers on the successful conduct of Fatah-4’s training fire. “[The] successful test of Fatah-4 missile is a milestone in Pakistan’s defense system,” read a statement issued by President Asif Ali Zardari’s Secretariat. “Indigenously developed modern missile is proof of Pakistan’s scientific self-reliance,” it quoted the president as saying. “Fatah-4 missile will further strengthen Pakistan’s defense capabilities.” The president further said that the nation is “proud of the hard work and determination of its scientists and engineers”, adding that Pakistan’s defence “is and will remain impregnable”. Last month, it was reported that Pakis­tan has added a new arm to its military — the Army Rocket Force Command — tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India. In May, Pakistan conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah Series surface-to-surface missile with a range of 120km as part of “Ex Indus”, the Inter-Services Public Relations had said in a statement.

      "title_orig": "‘Two-state surrender’: PM’s endorsement of Trump’s Gaza plan draws strong reactions from political sphere",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday unveiled a 20-point plan for Gaza, seeking to broker a ceasefire, a hostage exchange, demilitarisation, and a transitional governance structure. The two leaders have warned that Israel would “finish the job” against Hamas if the Palestinian group rejects the deal. Key Muslim nations have thrown their weight behind the plan while Washington’s European allies have urged Hamas to accept it. For its part, Pakistan, which was personally thanked by Trump while announcing the deal, has hailed the 20-point plan; Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has welcomed it and called for implementation of the two-state solution. “I am also convinced that durable peace between the Palestinian people and Israel would be essential in bringing political stability and economic growth to the region,“ he said in a post on X on Sunday night. The prime minister’s remarks, however, have sparked strong reactions at home, with politicians, analysts, journalists, and activists criticising his endorsement of the Trump plan and terming it a “surrender”. Author and former diplomat Abdul Basit said: “This is a complete surrender by the Muslim world. They can’t even mention a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.” He added that it would be a “huge mistake” for Pakistan to join the Abraham Accords before the establishment of the State of Palestine. As part of the Abraham Accords, signed during Trump’s first term in office , four Muslim-majority countries had agreed to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel after US mediation. He also questioned why the premier was supporting the plan “knowing full well that it is literally ruling out any possibility of creating state of Palestine”. Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir termed Trump’s plan a “flawed and unjust proposal that disregards the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people”. “This secretive plan, crafted without open dialogue, excludes Palestinians and imposes a US-centric solution that prioritises Israeli interests over Palestinian justice,” he said. He said that the plan sidelined key Palestinian voices, demanded the dissolution of Hamas without addressing its support base and was vague on the issue of Palestinian statehood. It also ignored critical matters such as the status of Jerusalem and Gaza’s humanitarian crisis, he said. “No solution can succeed without the meaningful participation of the Palestinian people and all stakeholders. A top-down dictate from Washington stands no chance,” he said. He added that PM Shehbaz’s “hasty endorsement of this plan — betraying both the Palestinian cause and Pakistan’s historic solidarity with it — is surprising”. “His support for a US-driven framework, without consulting the Pakistani people, who share a deep emotional attachment to the Palestinian cause, or ensuring Palestinian inclusion, undermines that very cause. Only a transparent, inclusive peace process that centres Palestinian voices and delivers true sovereignty can bring peace — not a plan that perpetuates occupation under the guise of peace,” he said. “There is one issue on which there is complete consensus in Pakistan and that is the issue of Palestine,” said human rights activist Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir. “This Zionist slave and his masters will never be forgiven by the people of Pakistan for this,” she said. Author and activist Fatima Bhutto said that her Pakistani passport prohibited her from entering Israel as the country she belonged to had a “duty” to the Palestinian people. “A Pakistan that forsakes that moral and sacred obligation is an embarrassment and a humiliation,” she said. She said that the Pakistani people would never accept a “two-state surrender”. “There is only one Palestine and it is occupied by Israel, a criminal genocidal entity,” she said. “To speak of normalisation during Israel’s live-streamed Holocaust of our Palestinian brothers and sisters is a shattering betrayal. Why does Pakistan exist? It’s a state to protect Muslims. It should do so,” she said. Journalist Talat Hussain also criticised the plan, saying “The Plan: No Palestinian state; No Palestinian Authority in Gaza; Hamas goes to dustbin of history after releasing all prisoners; Netanyahu becomes the peace maker after killing 64,000 Palestinians; Trump runs Gaza as real estate bonanza in a land soaked in fresh blood.” In a thread on X, journalist Zarrar Khuhro said: “Standing next to a war criminal, Trump has presented a ‘plan’ that can never really work and which Israel will itself sabotage in no time while blaming Palestinians.” He noted that the official line had always been a two-state solution, not just from Pakistan, but from a majority of nations. He said that all the plan would likely be was a way to “whitewash Israel and provide an alternative target for the anger of Palestinians. Should stay away from any such proposals given the ground realities and the nature of genocidal Israel.” “Whatever the ‘incentives’, the government of Pakistan must not endorse the whitewashing of Israel or join in a security arrangement that amounts to further oppression of Palestinians. This will be absolutely unacceptable to all Pakistanis,” he said. “In any case, as of yet, there has been no response from Hamas or any other Palestinian group as yet. We know that Israel sets impossible conditions exactly so that they are rejected and they can carry out their agenda of extermination. This new ‘plan’ will likely end the same,” he said. Activist Ammar Ali Jan reacted to the premier’s post, saying, “Shame on you for talking about ‘peace’ with the Zionist entity at a time when it is committing a genocide of Palestinians. “The people of Pakistan will never forgive those who join Trump’s plan for normalising these genocidal maniacs. Don’t dare cross this red line,” he said. Veteran politician Javed Hashmi said that Quaid-i-Azam’s stance was clear that Israel was a “bastard state”. “Shame on you, your masters, and those puppets whose hands drip with the blood of Palestinians. History won’t forgive you,” he said. Jamaat-i-Islami central emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that his party categorically rejected the premier’s statement. “The United Nations Charter is clear: every nation has the right to armed struggle if its land is occupied, and no power can forcibly deny this right. To praise any so-called peace proposal built upon the bodies of 66,000 martyred Palestinians is to stand with the oppressors,” he said. “Without the will and consent of the Pakistani nation, how can any individual dare to speak in the voice of Donald Trump?” he asked. Former finance minister Asad Umar said that PM Shehbaz had “overturned a cornerstone of Pakistan policy for decades regarding Palestine, by supporting the Trump plan”. “He has done this without any national debate and mandate from the nation,” he said, adding that there were seven questions the premier needed to answer. “The plan says Gaza will be deradicalised and become a terror-free zone. Why does it not say the same about Israel, which is the most radical country in the world and a threat to world peace?” he asked. “Israeli hostages will be released immediately but Israel will withdraw in an undefined future time in phases. With Israeli history of breaking every peace accord, why is it being trusted and not withdrawing immediately?” he continued. “How can you support only 600 trucks per day [of] relief goods for a population of more than two million, many on brink of starvation? Even this level agreed in the Jan 2025 accord has not been allowed by Israel,” he pointed out. He also took issue with the implementation of a technocratic government in Gaza being supervised by the US. “Why lectures of democracy for the rest of the world and an effectively colonised technocracy for Gaza?” “Hamas will not have any role in Gaza but Netanyahu, who has attacked five sovereign nations in last year and killed more than 66,000 Gazans, including 20,000 children, allowed to continue?” Umar continued. “When redevelopment is advanced, conditions may be in place for a pathway to Palestinian statehood!!! In other words no two-state solution for decades and probably never. How can you support this treachery?” he questioned. “Why is there no word about stopping and evacuating the illegal Israeli settlements?” Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar termed the joint statement issued by Muslim countries a “surrender”. “Netanyahu goes scot-free after committing genocide!” he said.",

Former finance minister Asad Umar said that PM Shehbaz had “overturned a cornerstone of Pakistan policy for decades regarding Palestine, by supporting the Trump plan”. “He has done this without any national debate and mandate from the nation,” he said, adding that there were seven questions the premier needed to answer. “The plan says Gaza will be deradicalised and become a terror-free zone. Why does it not say the same about Israel, which is the most radical country in the world and a threat to world peace?” he asked. “Israeli hostages will be released immediately but Israel will withdraw in an undefined future time in phases. With Israeli history of breaking every peace accord, why is it being trusted and not withdrawing immediately?” he continued. “How can you support only 600 trucks per day [of] relief goods for a population of more than two million, many on brink of starvation? Even this level agreed in the Jan 2025 accord has not been allowed by Israel,” he pointed out. He also took issue with the implementation of a technocratic government in Gaza being supervised by the US. “Why lectures of democracy for the rest of the world and an effectively colonised technocracy for Gaza?” “Hamas will not have any role in Gaza but Netanyahu, who has attacked five sovereign nations in last year and killed more than 66,000 Gazans, including 20,000 children, allowed to continue?” Umar continued. “When redevelopment is advanced, conditions may be in place for a pathway to Palestinian statehood!!! In other words no two-state solution for decades and probably never. How can you support this treachery?” he questioned. “Why is there no word about stopping and evacuating the illegal Israeli settlements?” Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar termed the joint statement issued by Muslim countries a “surrender”. “Netanyahu goes scot-free after committing genocide!” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The Asia Cup may have ended, but the controversy kicked up by the Indian cricket team refuses to die down. Players, pundits and politicians from both sides continued to trade barbs on Monday, following team India’s refusal to accept the winning trophy from Asian Cricket Council president Mohsin Naqvi — who also serves as Pakistan’s interior minister and head of the cricket board. Pakistan captain Sal­m­an Agha said India had “disrespected cricket”, whe­­­r­­eas his counterpart Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup, which has been overshadowed by ill-will on both sides. The two teams did not shake hands for the third straight match, a thriller that India won by five wickets in Dubai on Sunday. With ties between the two neighbours at their lowest ebb, India and Pakistan now only meet on neutral territory in international tournaments. Emotions have been running high between the sides, following a military conflagration between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May, when New Delhi attacked Pakistan after accusing it of being a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir, without any evidence . On Sunday, the start of the presentation ceremony was delayed by more than an hour and then cut short just before the winner’s trophy was to be handed out with ACC chief Naqvi among those left waiting on the dais. Subsequently, the Indian players celebrated retaining their regional crown by mimicking holding an imaginary trophy. Devajit Saikia, secretary of the Indian cricket board confirmed their players had refused to accept the trophy from Mr Naqvi, and threatened to lodge a complaint with cricket’s governing body. “There is an ICC conference in November in Dubai. In the next conference, we are going to launch a very serious and very strong protest against the act of the ACC chairperson,” he said in a statement, accusing Mr Naqvi of taking the trophy away. In Suryakumar’s words, the Indian side felt as if they were “denied a trophy”, even though in the same breath, he stated that: “We took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy. But Salman Agha said India’s actions during the tournament had been “bad for cricket”. “I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing,” he told reporters. “If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket. Political barbs Hobbled by punishing US tariffs and dumbfounded by Islamabad’s successes on the diplomatic circuit, Indian PM Narendra Modi turned India’s cricket victory over Pakistan in Dubai into a xenophobic event for potentially small stakes: Bihar elections. His tweet, “Operation Sindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same - India wins! Congrats to our cricketers”, was criticised by some, but they were few and far between. In response, Mohsin Naqvi continued the battlefield imagery: “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands. No cricket match can rewrite the truth. Dragging war into sports only exposes your desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he wrote on X. The Indian National Congress, for once, also spoke up against mixing military symbols with sport, with its spokesman Pawan Khera telling the prime minister: “It is not right to compare a cricket match to a battlefield”. Other Indian leaders praised the cricket win but comments reflected India’s characteristic regionalist pride as well. A tweet by Indian Home Minister Amir Shah, whose son is now the ICC boss, clearly explained the current thrust of Indian cricket. “A phenomenal victory. The fierce energy of our boys blew up the rivals again.  Bharat is destined to win no matter which field,” he wrote on X. Old-school cricketer Kapil Dev was not pleased with the mixing of cricket with a battlefield symbol, either. “Shaking hands is not a big thing, it doesn’t matter… you already announced you don’t want to take the trophy from that man, that’s also fine, but you can’t linger on with these things. You have to finish you have to move on,” he told India Today during an interview. “We should look into the sports side rather than looking into the politics side. Yes, the media has the responsibility to bring everything to the table, but as a sportsman, I would like to see that we should stick to sports,” he said, adding that sportsmen should stick to the game, and let politicians and the cricket board decide what they needed to do. Former Pakistan keeper Rashid Latif also made no bones about this contempt for the Indian cricket team’s conduct, saying that the move warranted punitive action. “In any other sport, this would have been an open and shut case,” he said, but noted that this was not likely. “Ugly day for cricket as India once again breached the spirit and essence of the gentleman’s game, that too in broad daylight,” Latif concluded.

The Indian National Congress, for once, also spoke up against mixing military symbols with sport, with its spokesman Pawan Khera telling the prime minister: “It is not right to compare a cricket match to a battlefield”. Other Indian leaders praised the cricket win but comments reflected India’s characteristic regionalist pride as well. A tweet by Indian Home Minister Amir Shah, whose son is now the ICC boss, clearly explained the current thrust of Indian cricket. “A phenomenal victory. The fierce energy of our boys blew up the rivals again.  Bharat is destined to win no matter which field,” he wrote on X. Old-school cricketer Kapil Dev was not pleased with the mixing of cricket with a battlefield symbol, either. “Shaking hands is not a big thing, it doesn’t matter… you already announced you don’t want to take the trophy from that man, that’s also fine, but you can’t linger on with these things. You have to finish you have to move on,” he told India Today during an interview. “We should look into the sports side rather than looking into the politics side. Yes, the media has the responsibility to bring everything to the table, but as a sportsman, I would like to see that we should stick to sports,” he said, adding that sportsmen should stick to the game, and let politicians and the cricket board decide what they needed to do. Former Pakistan keeper Rashid Latif also made no bones about this contempt for the Indian cricket team’s conduct, saying that the move warranted punitive action. “In any other sport, this would have been an open and shut case,” he said, but noted that this was not likely. “Ugly day for cricket as India once again breached the spirit and essence of the gentleman’s game, that too in broad daylight,” Latif concluded.

At a press conference on Monday alongside Netanyahu, who is visiting the White House, Trump said that he had worked together with many other countries and hoped that this is “how this situation gets solved”. Trump said that he was aiming for peace in the Middle East at large, not just the Gaza Strip. “This is part of the bigger picture, which is peace in the Middle East … let’s call it ‘eternal’ peace in the Middle East,” he said. During his remarks, President Trump thanked the leaders of Arab and Muslim nations for their support in developing the proposal, as well as US allies in Europe. “The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump said, referring to a statement issued on Monday by PM Shehbaz. “They back this 100 per cent,” he said. Earlier, in a post on X, PM Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US president’s “20-point” plan to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end. “I am … convinced that durable peace between the Palestinian people and Israel would be essential in bringing political stability and economic growth to the region. It is also my firm belief that President Trump is fully prepared to assist in whatever way necessary to make this extremely important and urgent understanding to become a reality,” he wrote. PM Shehbaz also lauded “Trump’s leadership and [his] special envoy Steve Witkoff for their efforts in bringing an end to the nearly two-year-long conflict… I also strongly believe that the implementation of the two-state proposal is essential to ensure lasting peace in the region,” he added. Help from Muslim bloc At the White House, the US president also thanked Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan. “If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages immediately, but in no case, more than 72 hours,” Trump said. “Under the plan, Arab and Muslim countries have committed … to demilitarise Gaza quickly, decommission the military capabilities of Hamas and all other terror organisations,” he said, indicating that other countries had committed to dealing with Hamas. Trump added that as part of the agreement, “terror infrastructure”, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, would be dismantled and local police forces would be trained in the Gaza Strip. “Working with the new transitional authority in Gaza, all parties will agree on a timeline for Israeli forces to withdraw in phases — no more shooting hopefully,” Trump stated. “Arab and Muslim nations need to be allowed a chance of fulfilling these commitments of dealing with Hamas. They are the one group I have not dealt with,” he added. “If Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible … I have a feeling that we’re going to have a positive answer, but if not, as you know Bibi (Netanyahu) you have my full backing to do what you have to do,” he said. Hamas, meanwhile, said that its officials had received the White House’s 20-point peace proposal. “Qatari and Egyptian officials have handed over the White House plan to end the war in Gaza to Hamas officials in Doha,” a Palestinian source told BBC News. Among other things, the proposal calls for the US, Arab states and other international partners to create a temporary International Stabili­sation Force (ISF), which will immediately deploy in Gaza to train law enforcement, which will serve as the long-term internal security force. The ISF will also be tasked with securing Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt, and will also work to prevent munitions from entering and keep aid and rebuilding materials flowing into the besieged Palestinian enclave. A joint statement issued by the Saudi foreign ministry, on behalf of the foreign ministers of Jordan, UAE, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkiye, Qatar and Egypt welcomes Trump’s leadership and sincere efforts to end the war in Gaza. The statement affirmed the Muslim bloc’s readiness to engage positive and constructively with all parties towards finalizing the agreement and ensuring its implementation. ‘Board of Peace’ “To ensure the success of this effort, my plan calls for the creation of a new international oversight body,” he said, calling it the ‘Board of Peace’ and stating that it would be led by Arab leaders, Israel and Trump himself. “We’re going to do it right, we’re going to put leaders from other countries on and leaders who are very distinguished,” Trump said. “One of the people who wants to be on the Board is the UK former prime minister Tony Blair.” More names would be announced in the coming days, he said. Trump added that the World Bank would be charged with training and recruiting a new government made up of Palestinians and “highly qualified experts from around the world”. “Hamas and other terror organisations will play no role in the governance of Gaza, at all,” he stated. “It’s time to get our hostages back and try to build something very great and very important.” However, Trump noted that Netanyahu remains opposed to a Palestinian state but said what he is doing today would be good for Israel. He added that the Israeli public wanted an end to the fighting and the return of the hostages. “Some other countries have foolishly recognised a Palestinian state … but I think they’re very tired of what’s [been] going on for so many decades,” he said. “I challenge the Palestinians to take charge of their destiny,” Trump added. “If the Palestinian Authority does not complete my reforms … they only have themselves to blame.” Apology to Qatar Earlier, Netanyahu also expressed regret for an Israeli attack in Doha to Qatar’s leader in a three-way call with Trump, the White House said. It added that Netanyahu also expr­essed regret for Israel violating Qatari sovereignty and “affirmed that Israel will not conduct such an attack again in the future“. Trump added that this agreement would bring a sustainable, long-term peace and added that “maybe Iran can even get in there”, in relation to the Abraham Accords. “They could be a member,” Trump added. “I long ago said that Iran would be a member of the Accords.” With input from AFP, Reuters and Anwar Iqbal in Washington Published in Dawn, September 30th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• At least one person killed, policeman among dozen injured • JKJAAC, ‘peace rally’ participants accuse each other of fomenting violence • Protest leaders call for another gathering at Lal Chowk today MUZAFFARABAD: At least one person was killed and over a dozen others were injured — including a policeman — in the Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) capital on Monday, as the region observed a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike amid a communications blackout. The strike, called by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) over the issue of its unfulfilled charter of demands, saw rival groups stage simultaneous protests, which accused each other of fomenting violence during an otherwise peaceful demonstration. Mobile and internet services have remained suspended in AJK since Sunday noon, and sources said the curbs could continue until Wednesday. The casualties occurred around Neelum Bridge after midday, when a ‘peace rally’ led by Muslim Conference leader Raja Saqib Majeed clashed with the JKJAAC protesters who were gathered there. The strike was announced last week, after JKJAAC-government negotiations remained deadlocked over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Witness accounts Witnesses claimed that participants of the peace rally fired upon peaceful JKJAAC demonstrators “without any provocation”. Ghulam Mustafa, a bystander, said one bullet hit Mohammad Sudheer, 30, who owned a crockery shop at Tahli Mandi Road. “By the time we reached CMH, he had lost consciousness due to excessive bleeding,” he said. An official at the Combined Military Hospital confirmed that Sudheer died during treatment. Mohammad Basharat, 50, a shopkeeper in Shokat Lines, was wounded by shrapnel. He claimed that demonstrators had tried to make space to let Mr Majeed’s convoy pass, but said that members of his posse came out of their vehicles and attacked them. According to another eyewitness, the peace rally was protected by police and paramilitary troops. Police lobbed tear-gas shell on JAC demonstrators, and fired at them. People at the hospital showed spent bullet casings, which they said they had collected them from the ground while trying to rescue injured people. “When the action committee had already given a call for lockdown for Sept 29, why was Mr Majeed allowed to hold a so-called peace march on the same day?” questioned 20-year-old shopkeeper Raja Safeer, who was among those in the emergency ward.

Another gathering today Later in the evening, hundreds of people gathered at Muzafarrabad’s Lal Chowk, where JAC leaders including Shaukat Nawaz Mir delivered charged speeches. Mr Mir alleged that some elements wanted to create a May 9- like situation in AJK for reasons best known to them, and urged the army chief to take stock of the situation. Mr Mir called on the charged crowd to reassemble at the same spot at 11am today (Tuesday) for the next course of action. All businesses and shops remained shuttered and street vendors away almost across the AJK, while roads also remained deserted. Reports also suggested that similar gatherings were staged in Rawalakot and Sudhnoti, while in Bhimber, a rally was led by PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq’s brother, Ehsanul Haq, who is associated with the PTI.

      "summary_en": "• At least one person killed, policeman among dozen injured • JKJAAC, ‘peace rally’ participants accuse each other of fomenting violence • Protest leaders call for another gathering at Lal Chowk today MUZAFFARABAD: At least one person was killed and over a dozen others were injured — including a policeman — in the Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) capital on Monday, as the region observed a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike amid a communications blackout. The strike, called by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) over the issue of its unfulfilled charter of demands, saw rival groups stage simultaneous protests, which accused each other of fomenting violence during an otherwise peaceful demonstration. Mobile and internet services have remained suspended in AJK since Sunday noon, and sources said the curbs could continue until Wednesday. The casualties occurred around Neelum Bridge after midday, when a ‘peace rally’ led by Muslim Conference leader Raja Saqib Majeed clashed with the JKJAAC protesters who were gathered there. The strike was announced last week, after JKJAAC-government negotiations remained deadlocked over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Witness accounts Witnesses claimed that participants of the peace rally fired upon peaceful JKJAAC demonstrators “without any provocation”. Ghulam Mustafa, a bystander, said one bullet hit Mohammad Sudheer, 30, who owned a crockery shop at Tahli Mandi Road. “By the time we reached CMH, he had lost consciousness due to excessive bleeding,” he said. An official at the Combined Military Hospital confirmed that Sudheer died during treatment. Mohammad Basharat, 50, a shopkeeper in Shokat Lines, was wounded by shrapnel. He claimed that demonstrators had tried to make space to let Mr Majeed’s convoy pass, but said that members of his posse came out of their vehicles and attacked them. According to another eyewitness, the peace rally was protected by police and paramilitary troops. Police lobbed tear-gas shell on JAC demonstrators, and fired at them. People at the hospital showed spent bullet casings, which they said they had collected them from the ground while trying to rescue injured people. “When the action committee had already given a call for lockdown for Sept 29, why was Mr Majeed allowed to hold a so-called peace march on the same day?” questioned 20-year-old shopkeeper Raja Safeer, who was among those in the emergency ward.

In South Waziristan, police officials claimed to have killed a commander from the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Official said that Qari Hussain was killed in a firing incident in a remote part of Birmal Tehsil, Lower South Waziristan on Monday. Police officials described the militant as a key figure in the TTP, having been involved in attacks on security forces, extortion, kidnapping, and targeted killings. Separately, a militant was killed in a fierce clash with local police — who were backed by armed locals — in the Wanda Amir area of Lakki Marwat district on Monday. A police official said that area police, with the help of armed villagers and members of the peace committee, launched an operation in the rural area on information about the presence of Fitna-al-Khwarij (the term used by the state to refer to TTP) terrorists there. He said that an intense exchange of fire took place within the limits of Saddar police station wherein a terrorist was eliminated. “The killed terrorist was identified as Hikmatullah, and he was wanted by police and Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in various terrorism-related cases”, he maintained. Lakki Marwat DPO Nazir Khan told Dawn that the Elite Force commandos, backed by armoured personnel carriers, also took part in the operation. He said that police and people would jointly launch actions against the menace to eliminate it from the district completely. Published in Dawn, September 30th, 2025",
