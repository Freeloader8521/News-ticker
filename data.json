      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Two policemen were martyred in a suicide blast at a checkpost in the jurisdiction of Punjab’s Bhakkar district on Tuesday evening, according to officials. Bhakkar District Police Officer (DPO) Shahzad Rafiq told Dawn that a suicide attack was carried out near the Dajil checkpost. He said that two policemen were martyred and one was injured, while three passersby were also injured in the blast. “The suicide attacker came near the check post and blew himself up, while we were conducting a search operation in the area to maintain law and order,” he added. The deceased policemen were identified as Muhammad Faheem and Muhammad Shehbaz, and the injured as Arshad. The identities of the injured passersby have not yet been ascertained. The injured were taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, DPO Rafiq said. In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the terrorist attack. He expressed grief at the deaths of the officials and offered his condolences to the bereaved families. He also prayed for the swift recovery of the police personnel injured in the attack. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep sorrow and grief over the martyrdom of police personnel in the attack, Radio Pakistan reported. He said the sacrifices rendered by the police in the war against terrorism would not be allowed to go in vain, and reiterated the government’s resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz strongly condemned the attack on the police checkpost. In a statement, she paid tribute to the martyred policemen and saluted their sacrifice in the line of duty. The chief minister expressed heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the bereaved families. She directed authorities to ensure the best possible medical treatment for the injured policeman and others wounded in the incident. The development comes on the same day six law enforcement personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police, were martyred after a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district. It is worth mentioning that the Dajil checkpost is at the border of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday that a nuclear deal was “within reach”, ahead of talks with the United States scheduled for later this week. “We have a historic opportunity to strike an unprecedented agreement that addresses mutual concerns and achieves mutual interests,” said Araghchi, in a post on the social media site X. He added that a deal was “within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority”. The talks are set to take place on Thursday in Geneva, a senior US official said on Monday, with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner slated to meet with an Iranian delegation for the negotiations. The two countries resumed negotiations earlier this month as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East. Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the region if it is attacked. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday Iran is ready to take any necessary steps to reach a deal with the US. “We are ready to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We will do whatever it takes to make this happen. We will enter the negotiating room in Geneva with complete honesty and good faith,” Takht-Ravanchi said in comments carried by state media. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s first option was always diplomacy but that he was willing to use lethal force if necessary. A senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Tehran would seriously consider a combination of sending half of its most highly enriched uranium abroad, diluting the rest and taking part in creating a regional enrichment consortium — an idea periodically raised during years of Iran-linked diplomacy. Iran would do this in return for US recognition of Iran’s right to “peaceful nuclear enrichment” under a deal that would also include lifting economic sanctions, the official said. “If there is an attack or aggression against Iran, we will respond according to our defence plans … A US attack on Iran is a real gamble,” Takht-Ravanchi added. Indirect talks between the two sides last year brought no agreement, primarily due to friction over a US demand that Iran forgo uranium enrichment on its soil, which Washington views as a pathway to a nuclear bomb. Iran has always denied seeking such weapons. The US joined Israel in hitting Iranian nuclear sites last June, with Trump saying its key nuclear sites were “obliterated”.",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The security detail provided to former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur has been withdrawn, it emerged on Tuesday. It is worth mentioning that while the security detail from Peshawar was withdrawn, the ex-CM has a police detail from his native Dera Ismail Khan district. It was not immediately clear who ordered the withdrawal of the security from Peshawar, with incumbent chief minister Sohail Afridi’s press secretary denying that orders to this effect were issued. According to the sources, a 16-member security squad assigned to Gandapur was recalled late last night. The contingent comprised two jammer operators, eight gunmen and six drivers, who had been working in shifts. All personnel belonged to the police department. Of them, 14 officials had been deployed for Gandapur’s security, while two were assigned to his brother, MNA Faisal Amin Gandapur. Sources close to the ex-chief minister said that one jammer and one pickup carrier had been returned to the provincial government. The sources said that Gandapur and his brother had personally spoken with the officer who had conveyed KP CM Afridi’s orders to confirm and authenticate the withdrawal of the police escort. In a statement, Gandapur said that at 11pm last night, Afridi’s deputy chief security officer (CSO) called his security personnel, saying that it was the CSO’s order to withdraw the security. “I had one jammer and one double-cabin vehicle provided by the provincial government,” he said, adding, “There were 14 personnel deployed with that vehicle.” “When these personnel informed me, I told them to pack up everything. This is the actual truth,” he said. He stated that even if this security were now restored, he would not accept it. “I want to tell the chief minister that there is no need to return this security to me now. I do not need it,” Gandapur said. Gandapur’s spokesperson, Faraz Ahmed Mughal, insisted that the withdrawal was initiated on the instructions of KP CM Afridi. He said the Chief Minister’s Office contacted the security in-charge and directed that the detail be withdrawn, adding that Gandapur followed the directives within minutes. Meanwhile, in a statement, the KP chief minister’s press secretary said that there was no truth in reports about Gandapur’s security detail being withdrawn by Afridi. “No such decision has been taken, nor have any instructions been issued to the relevant authorities in this regard,” he said. Further, an official at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat clarified that the former CM was asked to return two jammers and the associated personnel, which were required for the use of the incumbent chief minister. “Under the rules, the former chief minister was not entitled to retain the jammers. He was supposed to return the jammers and vehicle”, the official said, insisting that no security detail had been withdrawn from Gandapur. “He continues to retain a police escort,” the official maintained. Gandapur had previously faced multiple security threats, and a hand grenade attack also took place at his residence in the past. Official sources maintained that decisions regarding security deployment and withdrawal were made in accordance with threat assessments and administrative requirements. Political observers said that the development was also significant in the context of the recent differences between Gandapur and CM Afridi.",

      "title_orig": "Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing along Pak-Afghan border: PM’s spokesperson",
      "summary_orig": "Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, said on Tuesday said that the Afghan Taliban regime initiated unprovoked firing along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Torkham and Tirah. In a post on the social media platform X, he said, “Pakistan’s security forces responded immediately and effectively, silencing the Taliban aggression.” He said that any further provocation would be responded to “immediately and severely”. He said Pakistan would “continue to protect its citizens and guard its territorial integrity”. The development comes after Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year. According to an information ministry statement , issued in the early hours of Sunday, the strikes were carried out in res­ponse to a number of terrorist attacks inside Pakistan — such as the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad and a number of attacks in Bannu and Bajaur . “Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers,” it said. The information ministry said that in a retributive response, Pakistan carried out “intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban [ Fitna al Khw­arij ] and its affiliates, and [Islamic State-Khorasan] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghan border with precision and accuracy”. Fitna al Khwarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “Despite repeated efforts by Pak­istan to urge the Afghan Tali­ban Regime to take verifiable mea­sures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted. Souring relations There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire. Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast. Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault. Then, on Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district. In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”. “Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij , irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted. On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable. In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR. The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.",

Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire. Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast. Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault. Then, on Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district. In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”. “Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij , irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted. On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable. In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR. The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.",

      "summary": "Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, said on Tuesday said that the Afghan Taliban regime initiated unprovoked firing along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Torkham and Tirah. In a post on the social media platform X, he said, “Pakistan’s security forces responded immediately and effectively, silencing the Taliban aggression.” He said that any further provocation would be responded to “immediately and severely”. He said Pakistan would “continue to protect its citizens and guard its territorial integrity”. The development comes after Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year. According to an information ministry statement , issued in the early hours of Sunday, the strikes were carried out in res­ponse to a number of terrorist attacks inside Pakistan — such as the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad and a number of attacks in Bannu and Bajaur . “Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers,” it said. The information ministry said that in a retributive response, Pakistan carried out “intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban [ Fitna al Khw­arij ] and its affiliates, and [Islamic State-Khorasan] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghan border with precision and accuracy”. Fitna al Khwarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “Despite repeated efforts by Pak­istan to urge the Afghan Tali­ban Regime to take verifiable mea­sures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted. Souring relations There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Six law enforcement personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), were martyred after a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district on Tuesday. A senior police officer told Dawn that six police personnel — the DSP, an inspector and four constables — were martyred when the vehicle, which was transporting two individuals for a court appearance, was attacked. He added that one of the two individuals was also killed in the attack. The attackers also torched the vehicle after the ambush. Earlier in the day, state-run APP reported that heavy firing by armed assailants targeted the DSP of Lachi police station near Shakardara Road. Following the attack, additional police contingents were dispatched to the area, and a search operation was launched to apprehend the attackers. Authorities have cordoned off the area, while investigations into the incident have begun. Condemnations In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack. Paying tribute to the fallen police personnel, he expressed heartfelt sympathy and condolences to their families. KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also strongly condemned the terrorist attack. The governor paid glowing tribute to the DSP and other police officials who embraced martyrdom in the line of duty and prayed for their elevated ranks. He also extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and wished for the speedy recovery of the injured police personnel. Kundi noted that the law and order situation in KP’s southern districts had deteriorated significantly. He said the police were fighting on the front lines in the war against terrorism and rendering immense sacrifices. The governor termed the sacrifices of police officers and soldiers for establishing peace a source of pride for the nation. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack and expressed sorrow over the loss of lives, as per a statement issued via the PPP’s media cell. As per the statement, Bilawal paid tribute to the KP police for their “unwavering resolve and sacrifices in the war against terrorism”. KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. On Monday, three Federal Constabulary (FCN) men were martyred in a terrorist attack in KP’s Karak district, officials said. According to Karak police spokesperson Shaukat Khan, Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the site of the incident, but their ambulances were ambushed by the terrorists near Ghole Banda Dam. As a result, three FCN personnel were martyred, and three Rescue 1122 officials were injured, while the ambulances caught fire and were destroyed. Last week, a terrorist attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel. The military’s media wing said that an “innocent young girl” was also martyred during the incident, while another seven people were also injured, including women and children.

      "summary_orig": "The Israeli opposition has planned to boycott the address of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Knesset during his visit to the country, top Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Tuesday. The Indian prime minister will visit Israel from February 25 to 26, India’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday. It will be Modi’s second visit to Israel. According to the report, the opposition — led by Yair Lapid — is in a “standoff” with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana due to his decision not to invite the Israeli Supreme Court President Isaac Amit to attend a special session of the parliament “as is customary”. The report said that Lapid on Monday urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure Amit’s invitation. According to Haaretz , Lapid, in a post on X, said: “We want to be in the session, we need to be in the session. Prime Minister Netanyahu must instruct Ohana to allow us to participate in the session.” As per the report, Lapid, while speaking in the Knesset last week, warned that “boycotting Justice Amit is also a boycott of the opposition, and will not allow us to attend the session”. He further said that the opposition “does not want India to be embarrassed, with the leader of a nation of one and a half billion people standing here before a half-empty Knesset”. Haaretz quoted him as claiming that “the Indian embassy was ‘in a panic’”. “Knesset speaker Ohana, however, in response to the boycott, maintained that he plans to invite former lawmakers to fill the seats of boycotting opposition lawmakers,” Haaretz reported, citing Israel’s public broadcaster Kan. According to the report, Ohana also urged Lapid not to harm Israel’s foreign relations with “one of the most significant powers in the world,” terming the boycott an “illegitimate weapon in a political struggle”. The report further added that the decision came amid the Israeli government’s efforts to “advance legislation to overhaul the powers of Israel’s judiciary”. Additional input by Reuters.",

According to District Police Officer (DPO) South Waziristan Lower Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir, the explosion destroyed parts of the Government Middle School (GMS) Boys’ Sharif Khan Kot, including two classrooms, bathrooms, the main gate, and one side of the boundary wall. Initial reports confirmed no casualties were reported. The blast was so powerful that it was heard in distant areas. According to police sources, nearby houses were also affected. Solar panels, walls, and windows sustained partial damage from the blast. Following the explosion, police launched an investigation into the incident and began collecting evidence from the site. Local authorities reiterated their commitment to ensuring the safety of educational institutions and maintaining peace in the region. Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi strongly condemned the incident. In his statement, the governor said that those responsible for targeting an educational institution in South Waziristan are enemies of knowledge, development, and the younger generation. He added that the entire nation stands with the state and its institutions to thwart the malicious designs of Fitna al-Khawarij. The governor further stated that such cowardly attacks cannot weaken the nation’s resolve. Instead, these acts would only strengthen national unity against forces seeking to disrupt peace and progress, he said. In December, 2025, terrorists blew up a government primary school in the Mirali tehsil of North Waziristan district, spreading fear and anxiety among students. According to police, the incident occurred in Eppi village, where unknown assailants planted explosive material inside the building of the government girls’ primary school during the night, triggering a powerful blast that destroyed the structure.",

      "summary_orig": "• Rana Sana urges opposition to rejoin parliamentary panels; seeks end to political confrontation, deadlock • Senate opposition leader asks govt not to complicate PTI chief’s health matters; says Imran not looking for deal • Upper house approves criminal procedure code tweaks to prevent police from holding suspects incommunicado ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday extended an olive branch to the PTI to advance the ‘Charter of Democracy’, signed between the PPP and the PML-N in 2006, and asked opposition lawmakers to rejoin parliamentary standing committees to kick-start the political process for reconciliation. The offer was made by PML-N Senator and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah in his Senate address, while responding to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas. “Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the charter of democracy,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that the government was ready for a dialogue to strengthen democracy and avoid confrontation and deadlock. “We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the current ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks, even when the PTI was in power. This is not the first time the ruling coalition has invited the PTI for talks. In November and December last year, the government leaders made similar proposals to the opposition to break the political deadlock; however, these offers did not lead to anything substantial. Speaking in the upper house, Mr Sanaullah blamed the incarcerated PTI leader, Imran Khan, for the impasse, claiming that the former prime minister’s “stubbornness” was a major hurdle in talks. The PM’s adviser said the opposition wanted a dialogue with those who did not want to engage in talks with it. “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so,” he said, adding that the government was ready to move forward democratically. He said that the government wanted the PTI to become part of parliament by rejoining its standing committees, adding that the opposition was reluctant to become part of the political process. Referring to Raja Nasir Abbas, the PML-N senator said that the opposition leader was part of the committee which refused to talk to the government at the direction of the top leadership. He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations occur between political parties, not through external forces. To break the political deadlock, the government and the opposition had earlier engaged in a dialogue, following the formation of respective committees in December 2024. However, the talks collapsed after multiple rounds, as both sides refused to soften their stance. In these talks, the PTI had demanded the formation of two separate judicial commissions to probe the May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, incidents, as well as the release of jailed PTI leaders and workers. Imran’s health In his speech, Rana Sanaullah also touched upon the PTI’s concerns about the health of its jailed founder. The PML-N senator said that the matter was before the court and the government had implemented its directions regarding his treatment. He claimed that the government included an eye specialist in the medical board at the PTI’s request, who examined Mr Khan in Adiala jail. Commenting on the cases against the PTI founder, he said the courts were the appropriate forum and could grant relief in accordance with the law. He said entry to Parliament House was sealed during the opposition sit-in earlier this month for “security reasons”. He said that the opposition had given a call to its workers to reach the protest venue, which prompted the police to make security arrangements. ‘Peaceful sit-in’ Earlier, in his speech, Raja Nasir Abbas regretted that parliament was shut down to confine opposition lawmakers who had been staging a “peaceful” protest on the premises. “Is this not an insult to parliament,” he asked. He said that their only demand was that the PTI founder be provided treatment in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family. “The founding PTI chairman neither wanted to come out of jail nor did his family make such a demand,” he said, adding that they only sought a fair trial for him. Urging the need to restore confidence, the opposition leader requested that the government not transform this issue into a full-blown crisis and instead resolve the matter. He assured that the opposition would never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government on the dictation of any dictator, even though the legitimacy of the incumbent setup was questionable. He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions. The proceedings also witnessed an uproar by the PML-N lawmakers when PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz raised questions about the purchase of a luxury jet by the Punjab government, which cost about Rs10 billion. CrPC amendment The upper house also passed some key legislation, including a landmark bill seeking to prevent the police from keeping individuals in custody without informing their family members. The Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill moved by PPP lawmaker Shahadat Awan sought to insert a new section, 59-A, to the Code of Criminal Procedure which read: “When a person is arrested and held in custody in a police station or other premises, he shall be entitled to have a family member, friend or other person known to him (or likely to take an interest in his welfare) informed by the officer in charge of the police station about his arrest.” It read that a police officer not below the rank of the superintendent of police may authorise a delay only if he has reasonable grounds to believe that informing the named person will lead to interference. As per the bill’s statement of objects and reasons, the new section aimed to stop the abuse of process by the police officials who, in many cases, keep the suspect in custody without a formal arrest. It also said that an amendment to Section 431 and the insertion of 431A aimed to provide legal heirs the right to contest a case on behalf of the deceased to remove any kind of stigma. The house also passed a bill to include the Senate opposition leader in the National Security Council. This bill was moved by Shahadat Awan. Published in Dawn, February 24th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "KOHAT: Employees of the KDA Divisional Headquarters Hospital and members of the Young Doctors’ Association on Monday protested the murder of a woman doctor outside the hospital. Dr Mehwish Hasnain was killed late on Sunday as she was going home after performing duty at the KDA hospital. The police said they had registered an FIR against unidentified people for the murder. The protesters blocked the KDA Road and demanded the immediate arrest of the killer. They also called for tight security for themselves. The protesters insisted that Dr Mehwish was shot by an attendant whom she earlier asked to leave the space reserved for women patients. DPO says three teams formed to arrest killer Spokesman for the YDA’s provincial chapter Hafeez Orakzai said that the woman doctor left the hospital alone for home, considering the incident a minor one. “When Dr Mehwish was shot multiple times by the same visitor outside the hospital, she died on the spot,” he said. The spokesman said staff members had suspended all services at three major hospitals in the city, including KDA Hospital, Liaquat Women and Children’s Hospital and Dental Hospital, to protest the murder. “Only emergency care will be provided to visitors until the killer is arrested,” he said. However, the doctors resumed work at the emergency department at the request of district police officer Shahbaz Khan, to the relief of patients from Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu and Karak districts. Mr Hafeez said that it was the second such incident in Kohat. He insisted that hospital visitors often thrashed staff members in the emergency departments, wards and labs. When contacted, the DPO revealed the formation of three teams to arrest the killer(s) and said that he supervised the operation. The doctor’s funeral prayers were offered at Sava Lakh graveyard on Monday, with her colleagues and officials of civil and police administrations in attendance. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Pakistan condemned the murder and insisted it was not an isolated incident. “Repeated incidents of violence against women doctors in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa point to systemic gaps in workplace safety, security enforcement and institutional accountability. Such acts endanger healthcare workers and undermine public confidence in essential medical services,” the society said in a statement. It urged the government to ensure a transparent and time-bound investigation for early punishment of culprits, strict security measures at all public health centres and formulation of a policy on prevention of workplace violence in healthcare settings, with special focus on the protection of women health professionals. “Violence justified under the guise of ego or so-called honour has no place in a lawful society.” The society said authorities should ensure justice was delivered and meaningful staff protection was ensured.

      "summary_orig": "THE timing may be questioned, but the issue is not new. The PPP and the MQM-P are once again engaging in their old tug of war over who ‘owns’ Karachi, using bombast to stake their claims. The Sindh Assembly last Saturday passed a resolution, tabled by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, to condemn “any conspiracy aimed at the division of Sindh or the creation of a separate province comprising Karachi”. The resolution affirmed that Karachi shall “forever remain” an integral part of Sindh. The MQM leadership protested at the resolution during its passage, and convened especially to declare it an “attack on the federation”. “This [resolution] challenged Pakistan, its Constitution, its law and its state,” an MQM leader declared at the party’s press conference. It was remarkable that the leaders of the MQM’s component factions were able to come together on the matter, given the bitter infighting the party — whose years of rule in Karachi yielded little more than a few flyovers — has seen in recent months. The truth is that the Constitution does provide a route to creating new provinces, but this requires the approval of two-thirds of the respective provincial assembly. There seems to be no appetite within the Sindh Assembly for such a move, and, therefore, it is inexplicable why the PPP brought the matter up and why the MQM has taken umbrage to it. The latter may simply be using the matter to prop up its sagging relevance, as it is wont to do, but the Sindh government, too, must acknowledge why the ‘Karachi province’ issue keeps raising its head. Despite being Pakistan’s largest and arguably most important commercial centre, Karachi these days does not hold a candle to the country’s second-largest city, Lahore. Karachi is terribly neglected and misgoverned in comparison to the Punjab capital, for which the Sindh government is rightly blamed. Those who claim ‘ownership’ of Karachi merely wish to see it freed of the malicious systems that have entrapped it in the cycle of poor governance and urban decay. A better solution for the city lies in the implementation of a more robust local government system, but here, too, the Sindh government deserves blame for preventing such a system from taking root. Karachi is, indeed, an inseparable part and the jewel of Sindh. It is a shame that it does not look the part. Published in Dawn, February 24th, 2026",

It was remarkable that the leaders of the MQM’s component factions were able to come together on the matter, given the bitter infighting the party — whose years of rule in Karachi yielded little more than a few flyovers — has seen in recent months. The truth is that the Constitution does provide a route to creating new provinces, but this requires the approval of two-thirds of the respective provincial assembly. There seems to be no appetite within the Sindh Assembly for such a move, and, therefore, it is inexplicable why the PPP brought the matter up and why the MQM has taken umbrage to it. The latter may simply be using the matter to prop up its sagging relevance, as it is wont to do, but the Sindh government, too, must acknowledge why the ‘Karachi province’ issue keeps raising its head. Despite being Pakistan’s largest and arguably most important commercial centre, Karachi these days does not hold a candle to the country’s second-largest city, Lahore. Karachi is terribly neglected and misgoverned in comparison to the Punjab capital, for which the Sindh government is rightly blamed. Those who claim ‘ownership’ of Karachi merely wish to see it freed of the malicious systems that have entrapped it in the cycle of poor governance and urban decay. A better solution for the city lies in the implementation of a more robust local government system, but here, too, the Sindh government deserves blame for preventing such a system from taking root. Karachi is, indeed, an inseparable part and the jewel of Sindh. It is a shame that it does not look the part. Published in Dawn, February 24th, 2026",

      "summary": "THE timing may be questioned, but the issue is not new. The PPP and the MQM-P are once again engaging in their old tug of war over who ‘owns’ Karachi, using bombast to stake their claims. The Sindh Assembly last Saturday passed a resolution, tabled by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, to condemn “any conspiracy aimed at the division of Sindh or the creation of a separate province comprising Karachi”. The resolution affirmed that Karachi shall “forever remain” an integral part of Sindh. The MQM leadership protested at the resolution during its passage, and convened especially to declare it an “attack on the federation”. “This [resolution] challenged Pakistan, its Constitution, its law and its state,” an MQM leader declared at the party’s press conference. It was remarkable that the leaders of the MQM’s component factions were able to come together on the matter, given the bitter infighting the party — whose years of rule in Karachi yielded little more than a few flyovers — has seen in recent months.
