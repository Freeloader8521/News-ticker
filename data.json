      "summary_orig": "Five incarcerated senior leaders of the PTI urged the party to halt protest activities during the holy month of Ramazan, according to a joint letter sent to the media on Friday. The letter was written by Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed, all incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore. It was sent via their lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassar Umar. The letter also criticised President Asif Ali Zardari’s recent comments on incarcerated PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan. Last week, President Zardari had said it was the duty of leaders to fight and go to jail to protect their party and safeguard the people. Without naming Imran, he added that they had already started complaining about conditions in jail after an 18-month detention, while he himself had spent 14 years in prison without losing courage. “We strongly condemn Asif Ali Zardari’s recent rhetoric on the founder of the PTI,” the letter said, adding that Imran was currently serving his jail term “in difficult conditions” with dignity. “The government should stop politicising the health of the PTI founder,” it added. The letter further stated that Imran’s sisters and personal doctors should be taken into confidence and that he should be treated. The PTI leaders requested the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) to “fully engage in politics” in Parliament. The PTI leaders, in the letter, further said that “officials at all levels of PTI should reorganise the party”, taking the organisation to the grassroots level for local body elections across the country. The letter called for the issues of rising terrorism in the country, rising inflation, unemployment, out-of-school children and corruption to be highlighted “everywhere”. On February 12, Imran, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. The opposition alliance, TTAP, had staged a six-day sit-in at Parliament House over Imran’s health. It also doubled down on its earlier demands , including the PTI founder’s “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan and copies of his medical tests and diagnostic reports. In January, the five PTI leaders had written another open letter demanding that the government provide proper medical treatment to Imran when it was reported that he was suffering from an eye infection. The inmates also appealed to the chief justice to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment was given as soon as possible.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday, with the two sides discussing cooperation in critical minerals, energy, counter-terrorism and prospects for increased American investment, according to a State Department statement. Earlier Thursday, the Pakistani leader also addressed the inaugural session of a Gaza peace forum led by President Donald Trump. The State Department said the US secretary thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for joining the first meeting of the “Board of Peace” as a founding member. He also offered condolences over the Jan 31 attacks in Balochistan and the Feb 6 bombing in Islamabad and reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counter-terrorism. The talks covered Pakistan’s participation in the recent Critical Minerals Ministerial in Washington, with the United States welcoming Islamabad’s engagement and discussing cooperation in developing Pakistan’s energy and mineral resources, as well as commercial opportunities for American companies. In a post on X, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar thanked Secretary Rubio and said Pakistan values its “longstanding relationship with the United States”. The foreign minister added that the two diplomats had “meaningful discussions” on advancing peace, cooperation in fighting against terrorism, and expanding bilateral economic and trade ties. “We look forward to further strengthening our strategic partnership in all areas of shared interest,” said Dar. Earlier, addressing the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace — formally established last month after being proposed in September 2025 — Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for an end to ceasefire violations in Gaza, calling it “very important” for achieving durable peace in the war-torn territory. “The people of Palestine have long endured the illegal occupation and immense suffering. And, to achieve long-lasting peace, it is very important that ceasefire violations must end to preserve life and advance reconstruction efforts,” he said, adding that Palestinians must exercise full control over their land and future in line with UN Security Council resolutions. Praising Trump’s role, the prime minister said that through his “untiring support and great efforts, long-lasting peace in Gaza will be achieved” and that it would remain his legacy. Under its charter, the US government serves as the board’s depository and the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace has been designated as its headquarters. A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November last year authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to help establish an International Stabilisation Force in Gaza following the October ceasefire under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas. The truce, however, has remained fragile with repeated violations. In his remarks, Prime Minister Shehbaz also credited Trump with defusing the four-day Pakistan-India crisis in May 2025, saying his intervention had “potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people” and describing him as “a man of peace” and “a saviour of South Asia”. Speaking before the Pakistani leader, Trump recalled his contacts with both Islamabad and New Delhi during the conflict, saying he had warned the two countries that the United States would halt trade negotiations and could impose 200 per cent tariffs if the fighting continued. “I called them and said I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up,” he said, adding that the threat of economic consequences helped bring about a de-escalation. Trump also referred to his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, and praised the Pakistani leader for publicly acknowledging his role in stopping the conflict. The prime minister, in turn, lauded what he called Trump’s “bold diplomacy” and “dynamic leadership” in resolving international crises and bringing calm to global hotspots. The Washington engagements underscored Pakistan’s effort to expand economic cooperation with the United States — particularly in the energy and minerals sectors — while aligning with a US-led diplomatic initiative on Gaza and highlighting Trump’s mediation role in South Asia. PM Shehbaz meets global leaders The prime minister also held informal meetings in Washington with global leaders who had arrived to attend the inaugural session of the Board of Peace, said a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The premier met with the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, President of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and President of Indonesia Prabowo Subianto. The statement added that “important regional and global issues” were discussed during the meeting. “Pakistan’s participation in the Board of Peace reflects its efforts toward establishing peace in Gaza, reconstruction initiatives, global peace, and the growing success of Pakistan’s diplomatic policy,” said the statement.",

      "summary_en": "WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday, with the two sides discussing cooperation in critical minerals, energy, counter-terrorism and prospects for increased American investment, according to a State Department statement. Earlier Thursday, the Pakistani leader also addressed the inaugural session of a Gaza peace forum led by President Donald Trump. The State Department said the US secretary thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for joining the first meeting of the “Board of Peace” as a founding member. He also offered condolences over the Jan 31 attacks in Balochistan and the Feb 6 bombing in Islamabad and reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counter-terrorism. The talks covered Pakistan’s participation in the recent Critical Minerals Ministerial in Washington, with the United States welcoming Islamabad’s engagement and discussing cooperation in developing Pakistan’s energy and mineral resources, as well as commercial opportunities for American companies. In a post on X, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar thanked Secretary Rubio and said Pakistan values its “longstanding relationship with the United States”. The foreign minister added that the two diplomats had “meaningful discussions” on advancing peace, cooperation in fighting against terrorism, and expanding bilateral economic and trade ties. “We look forward to further strengthening our strategic partnership in all areas of shared interest,” said Dar.

      "title_orig": "King Charles’ brother Andrew released after arrest over misconduct relating to Epstein",
      "summary_orig": "King Charles’ younger brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was released from police custody on Thursday evening after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, had been questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police. Earlier this month, the police force said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy. The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times. “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement. A Reuters witness saw the former prince leaving a police station in Aylsham, eastern England, where he was met by a small group of photographers and television crews, just after 1900 GMT. A Reuters photograph taken after his release shows him seated inside a car, appearing visibly shaken. Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britainâ€™s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, leaves Aylsham Police Station on a vehicle, on the day he was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Aylsham, Britain, February 19, 2026. —Reuters Thames Valley Police said later on Thursday that “the arrested man” had been “released under investigation.” ‘The law must take its course’ Although Buckingham Palace was not informed in advance about the arrest, Charles said the authorities had the family’s “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”. “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” the monarch said in his statement. “Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” The king visited a fashion show in London on Thursday, making no further public comment. Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship. His office did not respond to a request for comment and he has not spoken publicly since the release of more than 3 million pages of documents by the US government relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Members of the media work outside the entrance to the Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate, which is reported to be serving as interim accommodation for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britain’s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, who was arrested this morning on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Norfolk, Britain, February 19, 2026. Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had in 2010 forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips as the government’s Special Representative for Trade and Investment. He was forced to step down from that role in 2011 after his close links to Epstein first emerged. “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement. “We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.” The arrest marks a new low for the former prince, who was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honours last October amid further revelations about their relationship. Unmarked police cars Earlier, six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothes officers were pictured at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England where Mountbatten-Windsor now resides. Thames Valley Police officers were also searching the mansion on the king’s Windsor estate where Mountbatten-Windsor lived until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations. While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt. A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which deal with the most serious criminal offences. Police have previously said misconduct in public office, which is a ‘common law’ offence and is not covered by written statute legislation, involved “particular complexities”. Giuffre lawsuit in 2022 The king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by the late Virginia Giuffre who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates. The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety. “Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” the family of Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, said in a statement. A van drives to enter the Royal Lodge, a property on the estate surrounding Windsor Castle and a former residence of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britainâ€™s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, in Windsor, Britain, February 19, 2026. —Reuters In response to Mountbatten-Windsor’s earlier arrest, US President Donald Trump said it was a “shame.” “I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family,” Trump told reporters. “It’s very, very sad to me… to see what’s going on with his (King Charles’) brother.” Were Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offences. His elder sister Princess Anne was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children. King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649 towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty and beheaded. The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking. Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic has reported him over allegations he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said it was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently. US lawmakers have also said he should testify before committees in the United States over what he knew about Epstein. Meanwhile former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein trafficking women without proper checks by the authorities through London’s Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mountbatten-Windsor. Essex Police said on Wednesday it was looking into the issue.",

So, as long as this demand is not met, whilst exercising patience, all options would obviously remain on the table,” FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said at the weekly media briefing. There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded. Attacks in Pakistan that were planned and directed from Afghanistan led to border clashes between the two sides last year. Various UN assessments have indicated that the TTP has benefited from Taliban tolerance and even active support, including access to safe houses such as guesthouses in Kabul for senior leaders, movement passes, weapon permits and logistical assistance. According to the assessments, these arrangements have persisted despite internal Taliban debates in which some factions viewed the TTP as a liability because of strained ties with Pakistan. Conservative estimates place the number of TTP fighters in Afghanistan at around 6,000, with recruitment from Afghan Taliban ranks and operational enhancements. More than 3,500 terrorist attacks were attributed to the TTP last year, according to Pakistani security officials. Mr Andrabi said it was a “fact that there is no positive response from Afghanistan.” Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire. Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast. Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) also described the assault as a “cowardly” act by the “Indian proxy” TTP. Mr Andrabi said those statements were “fully endorsed and comprehensible”. Earlier in the day, the FO summoned the Afghan deputy head of mission and delivered what it described as a strong demarche to the Afghan Taliban regime over the Bajaur attack. Mr Andrabi said “we cannot let our people be killed incessantly, mercilessly”. “We reserve the right to any action in our right to self-defence, which is given to us under Article 51 of the UN Charter,” Mr Andrabi said. “Any action that we take against these terrorists will be essentially under our right to self-defence and the imperative of protecting the lives of our innocent civilians and the lives of our security forces.” “When it comes to attacks against Pakistan, when it comes to killing of innocent civilians, a little child that was martyred in Bajaur, seven other women and children — in response to those attacks, what do you expect from us? Our patience is obviously not unlimited,” he said. The FO said, “The Afghan Taliban regime has been told to take immediate, concrete and verifiable measures against all terror groups operating from its territory, including their leadership.” Published in Dawn, February 20th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "GENEVA: Israel’s increased attacks and forcible transfers of Palestinians “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing” in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, the United Nations said on Thursday. The cumulative impact of Israel’s military conduct during the conflict in Gaza and blockade of the territory, has inflicted living conditions “increasingly incompatible with Palestinians’ continued existence as a group in Gaza”, said the UN human rights office. “Intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the denial of humanitarian assistance appeared to aim at a permanent demographic shift in Gaza,” the office said in a report. “This, together with forcible transfers, which appear to aim at a permanent displacement, raise concerns over ethnic cleansing in Gaza and the West Bank.” The report covered Nov 1, 2024 to Oct 31, 2025. It highlighted the Israeli security forces’ “systematic use of unlawful force” in the occupied West Bank and annexed East Jerusalem. The report also pointed to “widespread” arbitrary detention and the “extensive unlawful demolition” of Palestinian homes. The aim, it said, was to “systematically discriminate, oppress, control and dominate the Palestinian people”. These actions are altering “the character, status and demographic composition of the occupied West Bank, raising serious concerns of ethnic cleansing”, it added. ‘Inhumane choice’ In Gaza, the report condemned the continued killing and maiming of “unprecedented numbers of civilians”, the spread of famine, and destruction of the “remaining civilian infrastructure”. During the 12 months covered in the report, at least 463 Palestinians, including 157 children, had starved to death in Gaza, it said. “Palestinians faced the inhumane choice of either starving to death or risking being killed while trying to get food,” it added. The famine, the malnutrition and the “foreseeable and repeatedly foretold” deaths directly resulted from actions taken by the Israeli government, said the report. Any use of starvation of civilians as a method of war constitutes a war crime, it said — and depending on the intent, it could also constitute genocide. During the period covered by the report, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups continued to hold Israeli and foreign hostages seized during the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel — dead or alive — as “bargaining tools”. The rights office said the treatment of the hostages amounted to war crimes. “Israeli forces, Hamas, and other Palestinian armed groups committed serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza, gross violations and abuses of international human rights law, and atrocity crimes,” the report concluded. On Tuesday, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich vowed to encourage “emigration” from the Palestinian territories. The West Bank would form the largest part of any future Palestinian state, but many on Israel’s religious right view it as Israeli land. Published in Dawn, February 20th, 2026",

      "summary_en": "GENEVA: Israel’s increased attacks and forcible transfers of Palestinians “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing” in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, the United Nations said on Thursday. The cumulative impact of Israel’s military conduct during the conflict in Gaza and blockade of the territory, has inflicted living conditions “increasingly incompatible with Palestinians’ continued existence as a group in Gaza”, said the UN human rights office. “Intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the denial of humanitarian assistance appeared to aim at a permanent demographic shift in Gaza,” the office said in a report. “This, together with forcible transfers, which appear to aim at a permanent displacement, raise concerns over ethnic cleansing in Gaza and the West Bank.” The report covered Nov 1, 2024 to Oct 31, 2025. It highlighted the Israeli security forces’ “systematic use of unlawful force” in the occupied West Bank and annexed East Jerusalem. The report also pointed to “widespread” arbitrary detention and the “extensive unlawful demolition” of Palestinian homes. The aim, it said, was to “systematically discriminate, oppress, control and dominate the Palestinian people”. These actions are altering “the character, status and demographic composition of the occupied West Bank, raising serious concerns of ethnic cleansing”, it added. ‘Inhumane choice’ In Gaza, the report condemned the continued killing and maiming of “unprecedented numbers of civilians”, the spread of famine, and destruction of the “remaining civilian infrastructure”. During the 12 months covered in the report, at least 463 Palestinians, including 157 children, had starved to death in Gaza, it said. “Palestinians faced the inhumane choice of either starving to death or risking being killed while trying to get food,” it added.

      "summary_orig": "(LEFT) Iran and Russia carry out a joint military exercise; while (right) US Air Force planes are seen on the tarmac at the Sofia airport in Bulgaria.—Reuters • Trump says Tehran has ‘10 days’ to make a deal with Washington, or ‘bad things will happen’ • Kremlin urges restraint; Germany pulls troops out of Iraq; Poland tells citizens to leave Iran WASHINGTON: War clouds are looming over the Middle East, as US warplanes and aircraft carriers head toward Iran in preparation for possible military action. Renewing his threats towards Tehran, President Donald Trump indicated on Thursday that the country has around 10 days to reach a deal with Washington, or “bad things will happen”. CNN and CBS reported on Wednesday that the US military would be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet. White House Press Secretary Karoline Lea­vitt warned on Wednesday there were “many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran”. “Iran would be very wise to make a deal with Pre­sident Trump,” she said. Trump’s comments came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued his own warning to Iran saying, “If the ayatollahs make a mistake and attack us, they will receive a response they cannot even imagine”. The Wall Street Journal , meanwhile, reported that Trump had been briefed on his military options with “all of them designed to maximise damage”, including a campaign to “kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government”, unnamed US officials told the newspaper. The US has, meanwhile, been building up its military forces near Iran, incl­uding warships, fighter jets, and refuelling aircraft, laying the foundation for a potentially sustained campaign against Iran — should Trump give the order. Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed. Speaking at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting , Trump even praised the “magnificent” B-2 bombers that “totally decimated the nuclear potential” of Iran last summer, saying they helped bring peace to the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years. Iran has also sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps holding war games earlier this week in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran’s joint exercise with Russia came days into an extended series of Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, with Iranian state television showing special forces units deployed on helicopters and ships. Amid the escalating warnings, Poland on Thursday ordered all its citizens in Iran to “leave immediately”. Germany meanwhile moved troops out of northern Iraq, reducing its footprint to the minimum necessary to keep its base there functional, citing escalating regional tensions. Dozens of German soldiers have been relocated away from the base in Erbil, capital of Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan region. Russia has also called for restraint, with a Kremlin spokesperson saying, “We are currently witnessing an unprecedented escalation of tension in the region, but we still hope that political and diplomatic means and negotiations will continue to prevail in the search for a settlement”.
