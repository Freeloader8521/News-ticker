The Ministry of National Defense said Tuesday that parts of the media accounts were accurate but declined to provide further details, citing diplomatic sensitivity. The U.S. military also refused to confirm the reports. The reports said USFK staged large-scale aerial maneuvers from Osan Air Base on Feb. 18 and 19, during which Chinese aircraft also scrambled, creating a temporary standoff over the West Sea.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Six law enforcement personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), were martyred after a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district on Tuesday. A senior police officer told Dawn that six police personnel — the DSP, an inspector and four constables — were martyred when the vehicle, which was transporting two individuals for a court appearance, was attacked. He added that one of the two individuals was also killed in the attack. Earlier in the day, state-run APP reported that heavy firing by armed assailants targeted the DSP of Lachi police station near Shakardara Road. Following the attack, additional police contingents were dispatched to the area, and a search operation was launched to apprehend the attackers. Authorities have cordoned off the area, while investigations into the incident have begun. KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi strongly condemned the terrorist attack. The governor paid glowing tribute to the DSP and other police officials who embraced martyrdom in the line of duty and prayed for their elevated ranks. He also extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and wished for the speedy recovery of the injured police personnel. Kundi noted that the law and order situation in KP’s southern districts had deteriorated significantly. He said the police were fighting on the front lines in the war against terrorism and rendering immense sacrifices. The governor termed the sacrifices of police officers and soldiers for establishing peace a source of pride for the nation. KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. On Monday, three Federal Constabulary (FC) men were martyred in a terrorist attack in KP’s Karak district, officials said. According to Karak police spokesperson Shaukat Khan, Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the site of the incident but their ambulances were ambushed by the terrorists near Ghole Banda Dam. As a result, three FC personnel were martyred and three Rescue 1122 officials were injured, while the ambulances caught fire and were destroyed. Last week, a terrorist attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel. The military’s media wing said that an “innocent young girl” was also martyred during the incident, while another seven people were also injured, including women and children.",

      "title_orig": "PTI objects to ‘secrecy’ after Imran Khan undergoes follow-up eye treatment at Pims",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The PTI took exception to the government’s “secrecy” regarding ex-prime minister Imran Khan after it emerged that he underwent a follow-up eye treatment at an Islamabad hospital in the early hours of Tuesday. According to a doctor at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Imran was brought to the hospital for a second dose of anti-VEGF intravitreal injection on February 24. Imran’s eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January. His first medical procedure, which was carried out on January 24, was confirmed by the government five days later. Since then, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game , with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, of not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran, and of not allowing his personal physicians access to him. The government denies these allegations. The Pims doctor said: “Prior to the procedure, he was examined by a board of specialists: a consultant cardiologist who also performed echocardiography and ECG (result: normal) and a consultant physician. “After obtaining informed consent, and under standard monitoring, precautionary measures and protocols in the operation theatre, he was injected with a second dose of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF under the guidance of microscopy by consultant phthalmologist, and a consultant vitreo-retinal surgeon of Pims and Al-Shifa Eye Hospital.” It may be mentioned that Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital is located in Rawalpindi, whereas Shifa International Hospital — where Imran’s family and personal doctors want him to be taken — is in Islamabad. The procedure was performed as a day care surgery, the Pims doctor said about Imran’s treatment. During the course of his stay, Imran remained vitally stable before, during, and after the procedure, and was discharged along with instructions for care, follow-up advice, and the documents, the doctor stated. Another Pims doctor, wishing not to be quoted, told Dawn that security in the hospital was heightened on Monday night. “At 11:30pm, Imran was brought in the hospital and he was taken back at around 1:30am,” he added. Replying to a question, the doctor said Imran’s tests and physical examination were held to determine whether he was fit for the procedure. “The procedure was held in the same operation theatre in which he was brought last time. After the procedure, Khan sahib was shifted to the recovery room and finally, when it was confirmed that he was stable, he was allowed to be shifted to the Adiala jail,” he said. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, in a post on X, said it was “necessary to clarify that the government took him (Imran) to Pims under strict security arrangements while fulfilling all legal and humanitarian requirements”. He further said that the PTI founder would be administered a third injection on March 24. Chaudhry stated: “According to doctors’ instructions, there was an improvement in the eyesight after the first procedure, keeping in view which expert physicians recommended a second procedure. “Today’s process was completed successfully and after clearance from the medical team, he was shifted back to Adiala.” The minister reaffirmed that providing prisoners with medical facilities was the state’s responsibility, adding, “Even in this matter, all arrangements were transparent and according to the regulations.” PTI, family object to ‘clandestine actions’ Reacting to the development, the PTI’s official X account said: “The situation demands transparency, not secrecy.” The party said such “clandestine actions only give rise to more questions.” “What are they hiding?” the party asked, reiterating its demand that Imran be taken to Shifa International Hospital for “independent and transparent medical care”. The PTI re-shared a video showing a convoy passing through at night, in which a person can be heard saying the vehicles were “returning from Pims”. It could not be verified whether the convoy was carrying the former premier. In its statement, the TTAP reiterated that Imran be immediately shifted to Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, where his treatment should be conducted in the presence of his personal physicians and family members to end all concerns regarding his health. The party added: “We further demand an immediate explanation for this irresponsible conduct. Any future actions must strictly adhere to legal requirements and fundamental rights. “A transparent and credible mechanism must be adopted regarding the medical care of the party leader to restore public confidence.” In her statement on X, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said: “We do not trust the diagnosis or test reports from government medical facilities.” She said: “From the news, we found out that Imran Khan was taken to Pims again in the middle of the night, supposedly for his second injection in the eye. “When the law requires that family be informed before any medical procedure is conducted on a prisoner, why was the family not informed?” she asked. Expressing her lack of trust in the government-affiliated treatments, she claimed, “There are already reports coming from Pims that the doctors are being threatened with serious consequences if any information is leaked about Imran Khan.” Aleema further said, “Our family rejects their reports, even if they issue these doctored reports to the public. “We stand by our demand that Imran Khan be examined and treated in Shifa International (Islamabad) by specialists, under the supervision of Imran Khan’s personal doctors and in the presence of his family.” She contended that Pims was “not equipped to treat anyone for the alleged condition that has developed in Imran Khan’s eye”. “It is criminal what this government is doing, and they will be held accountable for each and every violation and crime they are committing against Imran Khan,” Aleema asserted. In a later post, Aleema claimed she was stopped by the police before reaching Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated. Tuesday and Thursdays are court-mandated days for Imran’s family members, lawyers and PTI leaders to meet him. Aleema questioned: “If they have nothing to hide, why are they refusing to allow us to meet our brother? “If they have nothing to hide, and if they expect us to believe that he is receiving proper medical treatment, why are his personal doctors not being allowed to examine him?” She contended that Imran has been “kept in solitary confinement for more than four months, with the exception of three 20-minute visits granted to our sister, Dr Uzma Khan, the last of which was on December 2, 2025 ”. Former PTI MNA Omar Ayub Khan termed it “totally unacceptable” that Imran was treated in the absence of his personal physicians. Addressing Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, he said, “Now is the time to stand and be counted. Issue orders to ensure PM Imran Khan’s treatment in the presence of his physicians and in the hospital of his choice (Shifa International Islamabad).” Opposition, family unaware of visit: TTAP Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, speaking to Dawn , said it was unfortunate that no one, especially Imran’s family, was aware of the hospital visit in advance. Yousafzai said, “Just after getting the information, I contacted Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai and then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, but both were unaware of the development. “Then I contacted PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and asked about it but he was also unaware,” he narrated. The TTAP spokesperson quoted Gohar as saying “let me check”, then said, “Later, he (Gohar) confirmed that Khan sahib was brought to Pims but has been shifted back to the Adiala jail.” Yousafzai asserted that it was the right of PTI founder’s family to know about the treatment. “Even if the law permits the government to keep it secret, the cultural traditions do not allow anyone to do what was done on Tuesday,” he argued. He contended: “This action reflects a non-transparent approach and constitutes a clear violation of the fundamental human and legal rights of a former premier and national leader. “Every person in custody — particularly a former prime minister — is entitled to have their family members and trusted personal doctors present during medical examinations and treatment to ensure transparency.” In his post on X, Gohar said, “At 2am today, I was informed this much in a message that Khan sahib was brought to Pims for administering an injection.” “I was not informed in advance,” he insisted. The PTI chairman stressed, “Our demand even today is the same that a complete checkup and treatment of Khan sahib be performed in Shifa International Hospital in the presence of his personal doctors and family members.” The government has said it had invited Gohar to be present during an examination of Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 15, but the PTI leader refused, citing party consultations. Gohar meets SC registar; TTAP protests outside court Separately, Gohar and MNA Ali Muhammad Khan met the Supreme Court (SC) registrar and requested the early fixation of Imran’s cases pending before the court. Gohar told the SC registrar the matter of the PTI founder’s health was “not political but humanitarian”, stressing that they have sought his access to personal physicians and family members. The SC registrar reportedly told Gohar to submit an application seeking the early fixation of cases and assured him of the same once the plea was received. Speaking to the media outside SC, Gohar said his party had only one demand: “Give justice to Imran.” He emphasised, “Our request is that a treatment of his choice be provided as per the jail manual.” Noting that the SC registrar told him to submit a plea for early fixation, Gohar said PTI lawyer Latif Khosa would file it. “Neither we nor his family was told about the PTI founder being brought to the hospital last night,” he said, adding that he was informed after the ex-premier had been taken back to prison. Ali Muhammad highlighted, “A former prime minister was brought and taken back in the dark of the night. “Smugglers operate in the night; not states,” the MNA quipped. “Our prayer is that the government report of Khan sahib recovering is true. The question is why is there so much secrecy if the report is true?” he wondered. Meanwhile, members of the TTAP staged a protest outside the SC for a second day. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi; senators Abbas, Faisal Javed Khan and Azam Swati; and MNAs Aamir Dogar, Shandana Gulzar and Shahid Khattak were among those present. They raised slogans calling for Imran’s release from jail. The TTAP leaders had also protested outside SC on Monday, demanding that Imran’s cases be immediately scheduled for hearing and that he be allowed to meet his family.",

He contended: “This action reflects a non-transparent approach and constitutes a clear violation of the fundamental human and legal rights of a former premier and national leader. “Every person in custody — particularly a former prime minister — is entitled to have their family members and trusted personal doctors present during medical examinations and treatment to ensure transparency.” In his post on X, Gohar said, “At 2am today, I was informed this much in a message that Khan sahib was brought to Pims for administering an injection.” “I was not informed in advance,” he insisted. The PTI chairman stressed, “Our demand even today is the same that a complete checkup and treatment of Khan sahib be performed in Shifa International Hospital in the presence of his personal doctors and family members.” The government has said it had invited Gohar to be present during an examination of Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 15, but the PTI leader refused, citing party consultations. Gohar meets SC registar; TTAP protests outside court Separately, Gohar and MNA Ali Muhammad Khan met the Supreme Court (SC) registrar and requested the early fixation of Imran’s cases pending before the court. Gohar told the SC registrar the matter of the PTI founder’s health was “not political but humanitarian”, stressing that they have sought his access to personal physicians and family members. The SC registrar reportedly told Gohar to submit an application seeking the early fixation of cases and assured him of the same once the plea was received. Speaking to the media outside SC, Gohar said his party had only one demand: “Give justice to Imran.” He emphasised, “Our request is that a treatment of his choice be provided as per the jail manual.” Noting that the SC registrar told him to submit a plea for early fixation, Gohar said PTI lawyer Latif Khosa would file it. “Neither we nor his family was told about the PTI founder being brought to the hospital last night,” he said, adding that he was informed after the ex-premier had been taken back to prison. Ali Muhammad highlighted, “A former prime minister was brought and taken back in the dark of the night. “Smugglers operate in the night; not states,” the MNA quipped. “Our prayer is that the government report of Khan sahib recovering is true. The question is why is there so much secrecy if the report is true?” he wondered. Meanwhile, members of the TTAP staged a protest outside the SC for a second day. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi; senators Abbas, Faisal Javed Khan and Azam Swati; and MNAs Aamir Dogar, Shandana Gulzar and Shahid Khattak were among those present. They raised slogans calling for Imran’s release from jail. The TTAP leaders had also protested outside SC on Monday, demanding that Imran’s cases be immediately scheduled for hearing and that he be allowed to meet his family.",
      "title": "PTI objects to ‘secrecy’ after Imran Khan undergoes follow-up eye treatment at Pims",
      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The PTI took exception to the government’s “secrecy” regarding ex-prime minister Imran Khan after it emerged that he underwent a follow-up eye treatment at an Islamabad hospital in the early hours of Tuesday. According to a doctor at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Imran was brought to the hospital for a second dose of anti-VEGF intravitreal injection on February 24. Imran’s eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January. His first medical procedure, which was carried out on January 24, was confirmed by the government five days later. Since then, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game , with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, of not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran, and of not allowing his personal physicians access to him. The government denies these allegations. The Pims doctor said: “Prior to the procedure, he was examined by a board of specialists: a consultant cardiologist who also performed echocardiography and ECG (result: normal) and a consultant physician. “After obtaining informed consent, and under standard monitoring, precautionary measures and protocols in the operation theatre, he was injected with a second dose of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF under the guidance of microscopy by consultant phthalmologist, and a consultant vitreo-retinal surgeon of Pims and Al-Shifa Eye Hospital.” It may be mentioned that Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital is located in Rawalpindi, whereas Shifa International Hospital — where Imran’s family and personal doctors want him to be taken — is in Islamabad. The procedure was performed as a day care surgery, the Pims doctor said about Imran’s treatment. During the course of his stay, Imran remained vitally stable before, during, and after the procedure, and was discharged along with instructions for care, follow-up advice, and the documents, the doctor stated. Another Pims doctor, wishing not to be quoted, told Dawn that security in the hospital was heightened on Monday night. “At 11:30pm, Imran was brought in the hospital and he was taken back at around 1:30am,” he added. Replying to a question, the doctor said Imran’s tests and physical examination were held to determine whether he was fit for the procedure. “The procedure was held in the same operation theatre in which he was brought last time. After the procedure, Khan sahib was shifted to the recovery room and finally, when it was confirmed that he was stable, he was allowed to be shifted to the Adiala jail,” he said. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, in a post on X, said it was “necessary to clarify that the government took him (Imran) to Pims under strict security arrangements while fulfilling all legal and humanitarian requirements”. He further said that the PTI founder would be administered a third injection on March 24. Chaudhry stated: “According to doctors’ instructions, there was an improvement in the eyesight after the first procedure, keeping in view which expert physicians recommended a second procedure. “Today’s process was completed successfully and after clearance from the medical team, he was shifted back to Adiala.” The minister reaffirmed that providing prisoners with medical facilities was the state’s responsibility, adding, “Even in this matter, all arrangements were transparent and according to the regulations.” PTI, family object to ‘clandestine actions’ Reacting to the development, the PTI’s official X account said: “The situation demands transparency, not secrecy.” The party said such “clandestine actions only give rise to more questions.” “What are they hiding?” the party asked, reiterating its demand that Imran be taken to Shifa International Hospital for “independent and transparent medical care”. The PTI re-shared a video showing a convoy passing through at night, in which a person can be heard saying the vehicles were “returning from Pims”. It could not be verified whether the convoy was carrying the former premier. In its statement, the TTAP reiterated that Imran be immediately shifted to Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, where his treatment should be conducted in the presence of his personal physicians and family members to end all concerns regarding his health. The party added: “We further demand an immediate explanation for this irresponsible conduct. Any future actions must strictly adhere to legal requirements and fundamental rights. “A transparent and credible mechanism must be adopted regarding the medical care of the party leader to restore public confidence.” In her statement on X, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said: “We do not trust the diagnosis or test reports from government medical facilities.” She said: “From the news, we found out that Imran Khan was taken to Pims again in the middle of the night, supposedly for his second injection in the eye. “When the law requires that family be informed before any medical procedure is conducted on a prisoner, why was the family not informed?” she asked. Expressing her lack of trust in the government-affiliated treatments, she claimed, “There are already reports coming from Pims that the doctors are being threatened with serious consequences if any information is leaked about Imran Khan.” Aleema further said, “Our family rejects their reports, even if they issue these doctored reports to the public. “We stand by our demand that Imran Khan be examined and treated in Shifa International (Islamabad) by specialists, under the supervision of Imran Khan’s personal doctors and in the presence of his family.” She contended that Pims was “not equipped to treat anyone for the alleged condition that has developed in Imran Khan’s eye”. “It is criminal what this government is doing, and they will be held accountable for each and every violation and crime they are committing against Imran Khan,” Aleema asserted. In a later post, Aleema claimed she was stopped by the police before reaching Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated. Tuesday and Thursdays are court-mandated days for Imran’s family members, lawyers and PTI leaders to meet him. Aleema questioned: “If they have nothing to hide, why are they refusing to allow us to meet our brother? “If they have nothing to hide, and if they expect us to believe that he is receiving proper medical treatment, why are his personal doctors not being allowed to examine him?” She contended that Imran has been “kept in solitary confinement for more than four months, with the exception of three 20-minute visits granted to our sister, Dr Uzma Khan, the last of which was on December 2, 2025 ”. Former PTI MNA Omar Ayub Khan termed it “totally unacceptable” that Imran was treated in the absence of his personal physicians. Addressing Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, he said, “Now is the time to stand and be counted. Issue orders to ensure PM Imran Khan’s treatment in the presence of his physicians and in the hospital of his choice (Shifa International Islamabad).” Opposition, family unaware of visit: TTAP Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, speaking to Dawn , said it was unfortunate that no one, especially Imran’s family, was aware of the hospital visit in advance. Yousafzai said, “Just after getting the information, I contacted Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai and then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, but both were unaware of the development. “Then I contacted PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and asked about it but he was also unaware,” he narrated.

According to an earlier Foreign Office (FO) statement, the bilateral meeting between PM Shehbaz and Sheikh Tamim will cover the “entire spectrum of relations, including political engagement, economic collaboration, energy partnership and people-to-people exchanges”. “The two sides will also explore new avenues of cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, energy, infrastructure development, and manpower export,” the FO said. The PMO statement further said that PM Shehbaz was expected to meet Qatar’s Deputy PM Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who also serves as the minister of state for defence affairs, and Minister for Foreign Trade Ahmad bin Mohammed Al-Sayed. A delegation from the Qatar Businessmen Association is also scheduled to call on PM Shehbaz during his stay in Doha. Upon his arrival at Hamad International Airport last night, the premier was received by Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Aamer and other senior officials. PM Shehbaz is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and his aide Tariq Fatemi as part of the official delegation.",

      "summary_orig": "In Ashutosh Gowariker’s Lagaan , most of the narratives are underpinned on an impossibility. It should not be possible for the villagers to beat the British — it is not their sport to begin with, and so the team of uninitiated villagers they assemble is haphazard, the equipment they use is makeshift. They had some tricks up their sleeve though — the type of craftsmanship in sport that can only truly be borne by people who haven’t been indoctrinated by the rules. An enigmatic captain, a mystery spinner in Kachra whose bowling action kept the British confused. But despite the zeal and the hours of training and the quirks of everyone involved, beating the British cavalry required a lot more than good cricket — it required not just this band of mismatched players to play out of their skins, but also for a certain level of divine intervention for things to go right. First-timers? Pakistan’s showing against India on the 15th of February was abysmal . The disparity when it comes to skill between the two sides, while not insurmountable, is still sizeable — so much so that Pakistan needed to be a livewire buzzing at a 100 per cent if they wanted to compete at any substantial level. Which they did not do. It is disingenuous to compare Pakistan to a band of people playing cricket for the first time, even if the opposition was, fittingly, a side with both superior skill and institutional leverage. But at points, it did feel like the team that showed up to play against India was playing the sport for the first time. When you know a side is better than you, you need to do absolutely everything right. Pakistan did not. The bowling was wayward and inconsistent, even from the likes of Abrar Ahmed, who are less susceptible to the waywardness than others. And even though fans have come to expect the batting to be as predictably fragile as it was, the state of affairs against India was particularly bad. Pakistan’s Babar Azam is bowled out by India’s Axar Patel at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 India v Pakistan match at the R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium, Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 15, 2026. — Reuters (It should be noted that like the team of villagers, Pakistan did have a mystery spinner that batters typically struggle to read, but the ‘outperforming expectations’ comparison ends here). In the team’s defence, Pakistan’s loss against India was massive and discouraging, but it wasn’t all-conclusive. A win against Namibia — which did end up coming — would secure them a spot in the next round, which it did. Pakistan beat Namibia by over a 100 runs, riding on the back of a clinical century by Sahibzada Farhan, making him only the second Pakistani to score one in a Men’s T20 World Cup. The bowling was sufficiently potent as well, with Usman Tariq claiming four wickets in a fielding effort that bundled the opposition out at a double digits score. The Namibia match, however, while sufficiently convincing, made one thing clear — that the Pakistan cricket team might still be operating as a mix-and-matched unit well into the tournament. The shuffle Pakistan’s XI against Namibia had a gaping Abrar Ahmed shaped hole. While his figures in the match against India were a dismal wicketless 38 runs conceded in his three overs, it is important to note that out of all unfortunate performances in the India match, his was the most anomalous. Since the start of 2025, Abrar has averaged 18 with the ball in T20 international cricket, with standout performances in the Asia Cup and the series preceding the World Cup. The matter of Babar Azam’s batting position was also one of the match’s major talking points, with him being moved down the order and eventually not needing to bat, as Pakistan put up a score of 199-3. “I think Babar is well aware that his strike rate in the power play in the World Cup is less than 100 and that’s clearly not the role we think we need,” said coach Mike Hesson after Pakistan’s final practice session before the team’s first Super 8 fixture was washed out last Friday. According to his explanation, the situation the team found themselves in didn’t warrant the specific (anchoring, conservative) role that Babar finds himself in the team to fulfill. Pakistan’s Mohammad Nawaz (R) celebrates with wicketkeeper Usman Khan after taking the wicket of Namibia’s Louren Steenkamp during the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match between Pakistan and Namibia at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) Ground in Colombo on February 18, 2026. — AFP Pakistan’s first Super 8 fixture against New Zealand fell victim to Colombo’s rain (as has much of Pakistan cricket, in retrospect). What was concerning about the match that was not, however, was that Pakistan’s pre-game decision-making was questionable at best. Decisions, decisions Abrar was not brought back into the side, dispelling the possibility that his exclusion in the playing XI against Namibia was possibly to rest or rotate him, and that it was potentially a performance-based decision for his bad showing against India. This does not bode particularly well for the management, as it could be seen as a possible overreaction to a bad day from a bowler who has generally, for all intents and purposes, been excellent. Another change that Pakistan made in the XI was to bring in Fakhar Zaman for Khawaja Nafay, who got his World Cup debut against Namibia, falling for a pedestrian 5 runs off 5 balls that did not necessarily sustain the promise of the glorious backfoot punch for 4 that he began his innings with. While this Pakistan side under Salman Ali Agha’s captaincy and Hesson’s management has been more proactive tactically than its predecessors, this indecisiveness and the nature of these decisions makes one wonder how much confidence is inspired in the players through them. Added to these was Pakistan’s decision to bat first at the toss, a questionable one considering the fact it is usually a wiser decision to opt to chase in a potential rain-affected game, keeping in mind possible DLS equations. Thankfully, to Pakistan’s benefit, the team drew a possible get-out-of-jail card with the match being washed out, and the consequences of what could have proven to be selection blunders never manifested. Of course, it should be said that all of this critique comes from the vantage point of the viewer and fan — people who can never be fully sure of a team’s motives and working logics when it comes to strategy and tact. It is entirely possible that the choices made before the match would have been successful during it, should it have happened. It is always a good idea for a fan to trust the process when it comes to supporting their team in an international tournament, mostly because a World Cup signifies a phase in a team’s metamorphosis where there isn’t much room for interpretation. At that point, all a team has to do is win, and all a fan has to do is watch. The uncertainty of it all That being said, what is unsettling about Pakistan’s run of form as they gear up to face England today, in what will hopefully be their first unblemished Super 8 Fixture, is the tepid sense of uncertainty that has threaded through it. There is speculation that an out-of-form Shaheen Shah Afridi might be replacing the in-form Salman Mirza, or maybe even the phenomenal Usman Tariq. There are passionate calls for Babar to be replaced by Nafay, and the fact that Naseem Shah is yet to play a game in this tournament is not forgotten by fans, and neither are the two unconvincing toss decisions against India and New Zealand. One might thus be compelled to compare Pakistan to at least a video game character that has made it this far in the game partially through skill but partially through hacking and bypassing the system, if not to a group of untrained villagers organising to defeat their colonial superiors. But as Pakistan gears up to face the actual, 21st century British team, there are no cheat-codes to revert to at this level of the tournament. No shortcuts or calculations that could see Pakistan home. With a possible point lost to a wash-out already, Pakistan’s remaining fixtures are must-wins. If Pakistan wants to mix things up at this level, it must make sure that they subsequently match. I still contend that the analogy to a sport-less village is still disingenuous for a team of the calibre I know Pakistan is capable of harbouring. But maybe it takes a village to win a World Cup.",

If Pakistan wants to mix things up at this level, it must make sure that they subsequently match. I still contend that the analogy to a sport-less village is still disingenuous for a team of the calibre I know Pakistan is capable of harbouring. But maybe it takes a village to win a World Cup.",

      "summary_orig": "• Rana Sana urges opposition to rejoin parliamentary panels; seeks end to political confrontation, deadlock • Senate opposition leader asks govt not to complicate PTI chief’s health matters; says Imran not looking for deal • Upper house approves criminal procedure code tweaks to prevent police from holding suspects incommunicado ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday extended an olive branch to the PTI to advance the ‘Charter of Democracy’, signed between the PPP and the PML-N in 2006, and asked opposition lawmakers to rejoin parliamentary standing committees to kick-start the political process for reconciliation. The offer was made by PML-N Senator and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah in his Senate address, while responding to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas. “Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the charter of democracy,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that the government was ready for a dialogue to strengthen democracy and avoid confrontation and deadlock. “We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the current ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks, even when the PTI was in power. This is not the first time the ruling coalition has invited the PTI for talks. In November and December last year, the government leaders made similar proposals to the opposition to break the political deadlock; however, these offers did not lead to anything substantial. Speaking in the upper house, Mr Sanaullah blamed the incarcerated PTI leader, Imran Khan, for the impasse, claiming that the former prime minister’s “stubbornness” was a major hurdle in talks. The PM’s adviser said the opposition wanted a dialogue with those who did not want to engage in talks with it. “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so,” he said, adding that the government was ready to move forward democratically. He said that the government wanted the PTI to become part of parliament by rejoining its standing committees, adding that the opposition was reluctant to become part of the political process. Referring to Raja Nasir Abbas, the PML-N senator said that the opposition leader was part of the committee which refused to talk to the government at the direction of the top leadership. He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations occur between political parties, not through external forces. To break the political deadlock, the government and the opposition had earlier engaged in a dialogue, following the formation of respective committees in December 2024. However, the talks collapsed after multiple rounds, as both sides refused to soften their stance. In these talks, the PTI had demanded the formation of two separate judicial commissions to probe the May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, incidents, as well as the release of jailed PTI leaders and workers. Imran’s health In his speech, Rana Sanaullah also touched upon the PTI’s concerns about the health of its jailed founder. The PML-N senator said that the matter was before the court and the government had implemented its directions regarding his treatment. He claimed that the government included an eye specialist in the medical board at the PTI’s request, who examined Mr Khan in Adiala jail. Commenting on the cases against the PTI founder, he said the courts were the appropriate forum and could grant relief in accordance with the law. He said entry to Parliament House was sealed during the opposition sit-in earlier this month for “security reasons”. He said that the opposition had given a call to its workers to reach the protest venue, which prompted the police to make security arrangements. ‘Peaceful sit-in’ Earlier, in his speech, Raja Nasir Abbas regretted that parliament was shut down to confine opposition lawmakers who had been staging a “peaceful” protest on the premises. “Is this not an insult to parliament,” he asked. He said that their only demand was that the PTI founder be provided treatment in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family. “The founding PTI chairman neither wanted to come out of jail nor did his family make such a demand,” he said, adding that they only sought a fair trial for him. Urging the need to restore confidence, the opposition leader requested that the government not transform this issue into a full-blown crisis and instead resolve the matter. He assured that the opposition would never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government on the dictation of any dictator, even though the legitimacy of the incumbent setup was questionable. He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions. The proceedings also witnessed an uproar by the PML-N lawmakers when PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz raised questions about the purchase of a luxury jet by the Punjab government, which cost about Rs10 billion. CrPC amendment The upper house also passed some key legislation, including a landmark bill seeking to prevent the police from keeping individuals in custody without informing their family members. The Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill moved by PPP lawmaker Shahadat Awan sought to insert a new section, 59-A, to the Code of Criminal Procedure which read: “When a person is arrested and held in custody in a police station or other premises, he shall be entitled to have a family member, friend or other person known to him (or likely to take an interest in his welfare) informed by the officer in charge of the police station about his arrest.” It read that a police officer not below the rank of the superintendent of police may authorise a delay only if he has reasonable grounds to believe that informing the named person will lead to interference. As per the bill’s statement of objects and reasons, the new section aimed to stop the abuse of process by the police officials who, in many cases, keep the suspect in custody without a formal arrest. It also said that an amendment to Section 431 and the insertion of 431A aimed to provide legal heirs the right to contest a case on behalf of the deceased to remove any kind of stigma. The house also passed a bill to include the Senate opposition leader in the National Security Council. This bill was moved by Shahadat Awan. Published in Dawn, February 24th, 2026",

      "title": "Govt seeks opposition buy-in for fresh ‘democracy pact’",
      "summary": "• Rana Sana urges opposition to rejoin parliamentary panels; seeks end to political confrontation, deadlock • Senate opposition leader asks govt not to complicate PTI chief’s health matters; says Imran not looking for deal • Upper house approves criminal procedure code tweaks to prevent police from holding suspects incommunicado ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday extended an olive branch to the PTI to advance the ‘Charter of Democracy’, signed between the PPP and the PML-N in 2006, and asked opposition lawmakers to rejoin parliamentary standing committees to kick-start the political process for reconciliation. The offer was made by PML-N Senator and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah in his Senate address, while responding to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas. “Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the charter of democracy,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that the government was ready for a dialogue to strengthen democracy and avoid confrontation and deadlock. “We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the current ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks, even when the PTI was in power. This is not the first time the ruling coalition has invited the PTI for talks. In November and December last year, the government leaders made similar proposals to the opposition to break the political deadlock; however, these offers did not lead to anything substantial. Speaking in the upper house, Mr Sanaullah blamed the incarcerated PTI leader, Imran Khan, for the impasse, claiming that the former prime minister’s “stubbornness” was a major hurdle in talks. The PM’s adviser said the opposition wanted a dialogue with those who did not want to engage in talks with it. “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so,” he said, adding that the government was ready to move forward democratically. He said that the government wanted the PTI to become part of parliament by rejoining its standing committees, adding that the opposition was reluctant to become part of the political process. Referring to Raja Nasir Abbas, the PML-N senator said that the opposition leader was part of the committee which refused to talk to the government at the direction of the top leadership. He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations occur between political parties, not through external forces. To break the political deadlock, the government and the opposition had earlier engaged in a dialogue, following the formation of respective committees in December 2024. However, the talks collapsed after multiple rounds, as both sides refused to soften their stance. In these talks, the PTI had demanded the formation of two separate judicial commissions to probe the May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, incidents, as well as the release of jailed PTI leaders and workers. Imran’s health In his speech, Rana Sanaullah also touched upon the PTI’s concerns about the health of its jailed founder. The PML-N senator said that the matter was before the court and the government had implemented its directions regarding his treatment. He claimed that the government included an eye specialist in the medical board at the PTI’s request, who examined Mr Khan in Adiala jail. Commenting on the cases against the PTI founder, he said the courts were the appropriate forum and could grant relief in accordance with the law. He said entry to Parliament House was sealed during the opposition sit-in earlier this month for “security reasons”. He said that the opposition had given a call to its workers to reach the protest venue, which prompted the police to make security arrangements. ‘Peaceful sit-in’ Earlier, in his speech, Raja Nasir Abbas regretted that parliament was shut down to confine opposition lawmakers who had been staging a “peaceful” protest on the premises. “Is this not an insult to parliament,” he asked. He said that their only demand was that the PTI founder be provided treatment in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family. “The founding PTI chairman neither wanted to come out of jail nor did his family make such a demand,” he said, adding that they only sought a fair trial for him. Urging the need to restore confidence, the opposition leader requested that the government not transform this issue into a full-blown crisis and instead resolve the matter. He assured that the opposition would never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government on the dictation of any dictator, even though the legitimacy of the incumbent setup was questionable. He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions. The proceedings also witnessed an uproar by the PML-N lawmakers when PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz raised questions about the purchase of a luxury jet by the Punjab government, which cost about Rs10 billion.

      "summary_orig": "KOHAT: Employees of the KDA Divisional Headquarters Hospital and members of the Young Doctors’ Association on Monday protested the murder of a woman doctor outside the hospital. Dr Mehwish Hasnain was killed late on Sunday as she was going home after performing duty at the KDA hospital. The police said they had registered an FIR against unidentified people for the murder. The protesters blocked the KDA Road and demanded the immediate arrest of the killer. They also called for tight security for themselves. The protesters insisted that Dr Mehwish was shot by an attendant whom she earlier asked to leave the space reserved for women patients. DPO says three teams formed to arrest killer Spokesman for the YDA’s provincial chapter Hafeez Orakzai said that the woman doctor left the hospital alone for home, considering the incident a minor one. “When Dr Mehwish was shot multiple times by the same visitor outside the hospital, she died on the spot,” he said. The spokesman said staff members had suspended all services at three major hospitals in the city, including KDA Hospital, Liaquat Women and Children’s Hospital and Dental Hospital, to protest the murder. “Only emergency care will be provided to visitors until the killer is arrested,” he said. However, the doctors resumed work at the emergency department at the request of district police officer Shahbaz Khan, to the relief of patients from Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu and Karak districts. Mr Hafeez said that it was the second such incident in Kohat. He insisted that hospital visitors often thrashed staff members in the emergency departments, wards and labs. When contacted, the DPO revealed the formation of three teams to arrest the killer(s) and said that he supervised the operation. The doctor’s funeral prayers were offered at Sava Lakh graveyard on Monday, with her colleagues and officials of civil and police administrations in attendance. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Pakistan condemned the murder and insisted it was not an isolated incident. “Repeated incidents of violence against women doctors in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa point to systemic gaps in workplace safety, security enforcement and institutional accountability. Such acts endanger healthcare workers and undermine public confidence in essential medical services,” the society said in a statement. It urged the government to ensure a transparent and time-bound investigation for early punishment of culprits, strict security measures at all public health centres and formulation of a policy on prevention of workplace violence in healthcare settings, with special focus on the protection of women health professionals. “Violence justified under the guise of ego or so-called honour has no place in a lawful society.” The society said authorities should ensure justice was delivered and meaningful staff protection was ensured.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s reported consideration of a limited military strike on Iran — intended to pressure Tehran into accepting his demands — has sparked intense debate among American and international analysts over the likelihood of conflict, the clarity of objectives, and the risk of a broader war. The discussion comes amid a major US force buildup in the region and conflicting signals about Washington’s goals, with many experts warning that military capability is outpacing strategic definition. Signaling through the media. A report in The New York Times suggesting Trump is weighing a near-term limited strike, with the possibility of a broader campaign later, is widely seen as part of a pressure strategy on Tehran. Vali Nasr, former senior advisor at the United States Department of State and professor at Johns Hopkins University, posted on X that “Trump is signaling Iranians via New York Times. He is trying to force a deal by threatening war.” Adrian Calamel, Vice President of Research at Viking Strategies, pushed back: “You honestly believe Trump is using the New York Times for signaling purposes?” The exchange reflects a broader uncertainty in Washington: whether these moves are part of a controlled coercive strategy or evidence of drift toward military conflict. Several analysts suggest Trump’s personal instinct is to avoid a major war while still using military pressure as leverage. William F. Wechsler, Senior Director of Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and counterterrorism, said everyone he has spoken with in Trump’s circles “has come away with the same conclusion: Trump does not want this war. He is, with good reason, extremely concerned with where it could lead.” Wechsler also highlighted operational limits of any regime-change scenario “I can’t imagine that any option will be presented to the president that would include US conventional ground forces.” Thomas Wright, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and former senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council, urged patience. “The United States does not need a comprehensive deal with Iran now … Nor is a war necessary. The clock is not ticking on America,” he wrote in The Atlantic . Vali Nasr warned: “If Iran concludes that even after a deal, economic pressure, isolation, and ‘mowing the lawn’ will continue, then they may take their chances with rejecting capitulation and prepare for war.” Ali Hashem, Middle East journalist and analyst, in a post on X quoted by Nasr, added: “Washington assumes military pressure buys diplomatic leverage. Tehran sees a challenge to ideological survival.” Danny Citrinowicz, fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, told the Atlantic Council: “Military action carries a high risk of regional escalation … and could draw the United States into yet another prolonged Middle Eastern conflict.” Jason M. Brodsky, member of the Atlantic Council’s Iran Strategy Project Working Group, suggested a “whole-of-government approach aimed at weakening the Iranian regime, using diplomatic, economic, military, kinetic, cyber, and covert tools.” Max Boot, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in The Washington Post “With Trump’s motives and objectives so unclear, it’s little wonder that talks aren’t working.” Gideon Rachman, Chief Foreign Affairs Commentator at the Financial Times, warned: “Vague or unachievable war aims increase the chances of a prolonged US military operation.” He added that past externally driven regime collapses in the Middle East produced prolonged conflict, mass casualties, refugee flows, and space for militant groups. Military scenarios From these assessments, three realistic pathways emerge: Limited coercive strike — aligns with Trump’s stated preference for short operations but still risks retaliation across the region. Sustained air campaign — a rolling effort to degrade Iranian capabilities, which could slide into a long war without decisive political results. Regime-change strategy without ground forces — widely seen as militarily implausible. Experts also urge Washington to consider the likely consequences: Regional: attacks on US forces and partners, maritime disruption, multi-front pressure on Israel. Iranian domestic politics: an external attack could consolidate, rather than weaken, the ruling system in the short term. US domestic politics: tension between war fatigue and presidential credibility. Global: energy market shocks, strain on alliances, and opportunities for rival powers. The emerging consensus is not that war is inevitable, but that the risk of miscalculation is high because military movement is not matched by strategic clarity.",

      "summary": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s reported consideration of a limited military strike on Iran — intended to pressure Tehran into accepting his demands — has sparked intense debate among American and international analysts over the likelihood of conflict, the clarity of objectives, and the risk of a broader war. The discussion comes amid a major US force buildup in the region and conflicting signals about Washington’s goals, with many experts warning that military capability is outpacing strategic definition. Signaling through the media. A report in The New York Times suggesting Trump is weighing a near-term limited strike, with the possibility of a broader campaign later, is widely seen as part of a pressure strategy on Tehran. Vali Nasr, former senior advisor at the United States Department of State and professor at Johns Hopkins University, posted on X that “Trump is signaling Iranians via New York Times. He is trying to force a deal by threatening war.” Adrian Calamel, Vice President of Research at Viking Strategies, pushed back: “You honestly believe Trump is using the New York Times for signaling purposes?” The exchange reflects a broader uncertainty in Washington: whether these moves are part of a controlled coercive strategy or evidence of drift toward military conflict. Several analysts suggest Trump’s personal instinct is to avoid a major war while still using military pressure as leverage. William F. Wechsler, Senior Director of Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and counterterrorism, said everyone he has spoken with in Trump’s circles “has come away with the same conclusion: Trump does not want this war. He is, with good reason, extremely concerned with where it could lead.” Wechsler also highlighted operational limits of any regime-change scenario “I can’t imagine that any option will be presented to the president that would include US conventional ground forces.” Thomas Wright, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and former senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council, urged patience. “The United States does not need a comprehensive deal with Iran now … Nor is a war necessary. The clock is not ticking on America,” he wrote in The Atlantic . Vali Nasr warned: “If Iran concludes that even after a deal, economic pressure, isolation, and ‘mowing the lawn’ will continue, then they may take their chances with rejecting capitulation and prepare for war.” Ali Hashem, Middle East journalist and analyst, in a post on X quoted by Nasr, added: “Washington assumes military pressure buys diplomatic leverage.

This needs to be based on sober analysis of the international situation,” he added. “Human rights are under a full-scale attack around the world,” he told the opening of the UN Human Rights Council’s annual session in Geneva. “The rule of law is being outmuscled by the rule of force.” The UN secretary-general stressed that “this assault is not coming from the shadows, or by surprise. It is happening in plain sight — and often led by those who hold the greatest power”. He did not mention specific situations, although he did voice outrage at Russia’s war in Ukraine, where he said more than 15,000 civilians had been killed in four years of violence. “It is more than past time to end the bloodshed,” he said. Guterres also highlighted the “blatant violations of human rights, hum­an dignity and international law in the occupied Palestinian territory”. He charged that the trajectory in the conflict-torn territories under Israeli occupation was “stark, clear and purposeful: the two-state solution is being stripped away in broad daylight”. “The international community can­­not allow it to happen,” he insisted. Rights attacked ‘deliberately’ In his final in-person address to the UN’s top rights body, Guterres said the worst conflict-hit areas were not the only places where rights were eroding. “We are living in a world where mass suffering is excused away, where humans are used as bargaining chips, where international law is treated as a mere inconvenience.” UN rights chief Volker Turk echoed the concerns. In a “deeply worrying trend”, he warned that “domination and supre­macy are making a comeback”. “A fierce competition for power, control and resources is playing out on the world stage at a rate and intensity unseen for the past 80 years,” he warned. “The use of force to resolve disputes between and within countries is becoming normalised.” Turk highlighted how “the gears of global power are shifting”, calling for people to band together to protect rights and create “a strong counterbalance to the top-down, autocratic trends we see today”. Turk lambasted leaders, without naming them, who seem to believe “that they are above the law, and above the UN Charter”. “They claim exceptional status, exc­eptional danger or exceptional moral judgement to pursue their own agenda at any cost,” he said, poi­nting to how “some weaponise their economic leverage”.

In a “deeply worrying trend”, he warned that “domination and supre­macy are making a comeback”. “A fierce competition for power, control and resources is playing out on the world stage at a rate and intensity unseen for the past 80 years,” he warned. “The use of force to resolve disputes between and within countries is becoming normalised.” Turk highlighted how “the gears of global power are shifting”, calling for people to band together to protect rights and create “a strong counterbalance to the top-down, autocratic trends we see today”. Turk lambasted leaders, without naming them, who seem to believe “that they are above the law, and above the UN Charter”. “They claim exceptional status, exc­eptional danger or exceptional moral judgement to pursue their own agenda at any cost,” he said, poi­nting to how “some weaponise their economic leverage”.

A group of 34 Australian women and children, assisted by their relatives, left al-Roj detention camp on Monday 16 February under a Kurdish military escort, with the aim of reaching Damascus before flying to Australia.

Kurdish forces de-facto control much of north-east Syria, including the area by the Iraqi border where al-Roj is located, and the convoy needed to “cross” a checkpoint controlled by the Syrian government to reach Damascus.

      "summary_orig": "Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry briefed the Senate on Monday on recent strikes targeting terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan, pointing out that they were carried out following multiple attacks by militants in Pakistan and saying that Islamabad “cannot tolerate this anymore”. Pakistan carried out airstrikes on Afghanistan in a retaliatory operation late on Saturday night, targeting groups responsible for recent attacks in its territory. The strikes were conducted in retaliation for a series of suicide attacks in Islamabad , Bajaur , and Bannu that had claimed the lives of Pakistani security personnel and civilians. Mentioning these incidents, Chaudhry said they were “linked” to Afghanistan-based actors, adding that it was subsequently decided to give a “decisive response” to the neighbouring country. “As a result, our Air Force carried out strikes in three Afghan provinces, Paktika, Nangarhar and Khost on February 21,” he said, adding that there were reports of  the deaths of over 100 militants who “controlled terrorist networks” in the operation. He said the February 21 strikes were “precise” and “intelligence-based”. The minister insisted that they only targeted terrorists’ hideouts and training camps. He dispelled what he described as “false propaganda of civilians, mosques and seminaries getting hit” during the strikes. Chaudhry warned that if terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil continued, Pakistan reserved the right to carry out strikes in its defence. “We are not supposed to just attend funerals. The civilian leadership and armed forces are resolute that this cannot be tolerated anymore,” he asserted. He said, “Every drop of blood of our martyrs, be they from the security forces or civilians, will be avenged. Every corner of the country will be defended.”",

      "summary": "Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry briefed the Senate on Monday on recent strikes targeting terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan, pointing out that they were carried out following multiple attacks by militants in Pakistan and saying that Islamabad “cannot tolerate this anymore”. Pakistan carried out airstrikes on Afghanistan in a retaliatory operation late on Saturday night, targeting groups responsible for recent attacks in its territory. The strikes were conducted in retaliation for a series of suicide attacks in Islamabad , Bajaur , and Bannu that had claimed the lives of Pakistani security personnel and civilians. Mentioning these incidents, Chaudhry said they were “linked” to Afghanistan-based actors, adding that it was subsequently decided to give a “decisive response” to the neighbouring country. “As a result, our Air Force carried out strikes in three Afghan provinces, Paktika, Nangarhar and Khost on February 21,” he said, adding that there were reports of  the deaths of over 100 militants who “controlled terrorist networks” in the operation. He said the February 21 strikes were “precise” and “intelligence-based”. The minister insisted that they only targeted terrorists’ hideouts and training camps. He dispelled what he described as “false propaganda of civilians, mosques and seminaries getting hit” during the strikes. Chaudhry warned that if terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil continued, Pakistan reserved the right to carry out strikes in its defence. “We are not supposed to just attend funerals. The civilian leadership and armed forces are resolute that this cannot be tolerated anymore,” he asserted. He said, “Every drop of blood of our martyrs, be they from the security forces or civilians, will be avenged. Every corner of the country will be defended.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The government invited the opposition on Monday to hold talks and “strengthen and take forward” the Charter of Democracy — a 2006 document signed by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and late Benazir Bhutto, with the commitment to struggle against dictatorship. “Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the Charter of Democracy”, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said while addressing a Senate session in response to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas. Sanaullah said the government was willing to hold dialogue with the opposition, which would strengthen democracy, rather than opting for confrontation and deadlock. “We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks even when the PTI was in power. However, PTI founder Imran Khan was not ready to talk to politicians, he said, saying that his “stubbornness is a big hurdle” in the way of talks. Without naming anyone but seemingly referring to the establishment, Sanaullah went on to say that the opposition wanted talks with those who did not want to talk to it. He added that the government wanted the PTI to “become a part of Parliament by rejoining its standing committees”. The PTI had resigned from the standing committees in September last year. Sanaullah criticised the party on Monday for what he described as its “reluctance to become a part of the political process”. Continuing his rebuke of the opposition, the PM’s adviser stated: “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so.” But, he added, the government was ready to move forward in a democratic manner. He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations were held between political parties and not “through external forces”. On Imran’s health, he said the matter was before the court, and the government had implemented court directives regarding the PTI founder’s treatment. “On the PTI’s request, even an eye specialist was included in the medical board that examined Imran,” he highlighted. The incarcerated ex-prime minister’s health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January. Meanwhile, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game , with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran and not allowing his personal physicians to access him. The government denies these allegations. Speaking before Sanaullah, Opposition Leader Abbas criticised the authorities in connection with a recent days-long sit-in at the Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health. He claimed that “Parliament was shut down to block the entry and exit of parliamentarians who were staging a peaceful protest”. “Is this not an insult to Parliament?” he questioned. Abbas said the protesters’ only demand was Imran’s medical treatment should be carried out in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family. He neither wanted a release from jail, nor his family made any such demand, Abbas said, adding that the PTI founder only sought a fair trial for himself. Calling for the need to restore confidence on both sides, he urged the government not to transform this issue into a “full-blown crisis” and move forward. He also gave the assurance that the opposition would “never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government at the dictation of any dictator, despite the legitimacy of the [incumbent] government being questioned”. But, he stressed, the government should address and resolve the issue of Imran’s eye ailment and treatment. He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions. While Sanaullah was responding to Abbas’ allegation of “shutting down Parliament”, he said the opposition’s call to its workers to reach the protest venue prompted the police to “make security arrangements”.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed nine terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to statements issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday. According to the military’s media affairs wing, an IBO in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan was conducted on Monday, on the “reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Khawarij” . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban. The ISPR said that security personnel “effectively engaged the khawarij location” during the operation, and after an intense exchange of fire, four terrorists were killed. It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from “Indian-sponsored killed khawarij , who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”. Earlier in the day, ISPR shared the details of the IBO in Balochistan’s Pishin in a separate statement. It said security forces had killed five terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during that IBO on Sunday. The military’s media wing said the terrorist tashkeel (formation) was engaged with multiple weapons. “After an intense fire exchange, suicide bomber kharji cowardly blew himself up and four other Indian sponsored khawarij were hunted down and sent to hell.” Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from the killed terrorists during the Pishin IBO as well, said the ISPR, and added that the militants were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”. Both statements by ISPR stated: “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i -Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.“ Separately, the spokesperson for Balochistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) also confirmed the IBO in Pishin and the losses suffered by the terrorists in an earlier statement. He said that the terrorists had “planned to attack the police lines and Cadet College Pishin”. President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists in Pishin, state-run Radio Pakistan reported . The president said the IBO “against the Indian-backed Fitna al Khawarij reflects the nation’s resolve in the fight against terrorism”. He said the war against terrorism will continue until the “complete eradication of this menace”. In his statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted that the security forces were making great progress against terrorist groups “every single day with courage, determination and strength”, Radio Pakistan reported. The premier reaffirmed that the entire nation stood with armed forces and law enforcement authorities in the war against terrorism. Last week, on February 18, the CTD said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts. These included eight armed men killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area and “six terrorists were killed” during an IBO in Barkhan, according to the CTD. A day later, ISPR said security forces had also killed four “Indian-sponsored” terrorists in an IBO in KP’s Lakki Marwat district. The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Additional reporting by Saleem Shahid.",
