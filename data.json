      "summary_orig": "LAKKI MARWAT: Three people, including a minor child, were killed and four suffered injuries in a quadcopter strike in the Sardikhel Janikhel area of Bannu district on Tuesday. A police official said the bodies and the injured were shifted to the district headquarters hospital. He identified the deceased as Habibullah, 5, a resident of Malikhel Janikhel, and Amjad Ali, 35, and Irfanullah, 35, residents of Sardikhel Janikhel, and said the injured included Rukhniaz, 35, Naheedullah, 24, Mohammad Rauf, 33, and Irshadullah, 35, all residents of Janikhel. Similar quadcopter attacks were carried out by terrorists against police installations and civilians in the district in the recent past. Terrorists kill police official; attack on police station repulsed On July 31, six security personnel were injured in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station amid an operation against terrorists in the Nurar area. In another quadcopter strike that took place four months ago, a woman was killed and three others were wounded in the Sra Bangla area of the district. Police said the Miryan police station had come under multiple quadcopter attacks in the last several months. They said that the attacks were being carried out by terrorists in the district. Meanwhile, a policeman was martyred when terrorists attacked him in the Walkhi Mammakhel area of Bannu district on Tuesday. A police official said the attack was reported within the limits of the Havaid police station. The deceased was identified as Ilyas, who was posted to the investigation wing at the Saddar police station. “Unidentified men opened fire on constable Ilyas near his house when he was coming to the Saddar police station to join his duty,” the official said, adding the assailants fled on motorcycles. He said that the body was transported to the district headquarters hospital to fulfil medico-legal formalities. The official said after the targeted killing of the constable, a large police contingent reached the area and launched a search for attackers. On Monday night, police repulsed a terrorist attack on a police station in the Ahmadzai area of Bannu district. The official said the terrorists carried out the attack with advanced light and heavy weapons in an attempt to breach the building, but the policemen foiled the bid. He added that in the retaliatory action, several terrorists were killed and injured but their accomplices took them away. According to a statement issued by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police director (public relations), Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi lauded policemen for their bravery and professionalism and said that the region’s police were in the frontline to protect their motherland and defeat terrorism. They said that the police were fully prepared and capable of countering any challenge effectively. Provincial Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed also praised the police for their quick and effective action against terrorists to protect the police station and said the police were always ready and alert for protecting people’s lives and properties. “Bannu police always showed excellent commitment to maintaining law and order and ensuring establishment of lasting peace in the region,” he said. The IGP announced cash rewards and appreciation certificates for the police team which foiled the terrorist attack. Separately, the terrorists torched the furniture in the government primary school in the Paharkhel Pacca area of Lakki Marwat district. The incident occurred at midnight within the limits of Ghaznikhel police station, according to an official. He said that unidentified armed men entered the school building and set the furniture and other goods on fire. The official said that the police had launched a search for culprits.

      "summary_orig": "Security sources said early on Wednesday that all the khawarij involved in the attack on Cadet College in Wana had been killed. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations, the college came under attack on Monday as terrorists rammed an explosives-laden vehicle against the main gate of the college, entered the educational facility and were then “cornered in the college’s administrative block”. Security sources on Tuesday had continued the clearance operation against the terrorists hiding inside the educational institute. Early on Wednesday, security sources said that one suicide bomber and four other khawarij were killed in a successful operation. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Security sources said that the college building was currently being cleared due to the threat of landmines. They asserted that no student or teacher at the college was harmed during the successful operation. View this post on Instagram Speaking to Geo News shortly after midnight, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar termed the operation a “huge achievement” of the Pakistan Army, adding that 550 students were safely evacuated. He said that the attack on the college could have been a bigger incident than the attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in 2014. “The lives of these students were successfully saved using perseverance and expertise,” he said. “This was a difficult task and a sensitive operation. And our army has proven once again that it is included among the world’s best,” he said. The minister said that Pakistan had “won two wars” against India and Pakistan, lauding security forces. The minister said that Pakistan had proven its worth in conventional warfare and was also doing the same in the “proxy war”. He reiterated Islamabad’s demand that Afghanistan’s soil not be used for carrying out terrorist attacks in Pakistan. He said that investigations would be carried out into the attack in Wana as well as the suicide attack in Islamabad on Tuesday. “Concrete evidence of the attacks will be shared with friendly countries and international forums,” he said. The minister asserted that Pakistan would uncover those involved in terrorist activities. He said that security forces were alert and ready to deal with any eventuality. “We are in good hands. Our security is in strong hands, so there is nothing to worry about,” he said, reiterating that the operation was a “huge success”. On Tuesday, a report from DHQ Hospital Wana confirmed that nine civilians, including men, women and children, sustained injuries when the explosion caused nearby structures to collapse. Hospital MS Dr Jan Muhammad said all injured individuals were receiving full medical treatment and necessary facilities. PM, president vow action against foreign-backed terrorism Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari met at the Presidency a day earlier, where they discussed the country’s security situation in the wake of the attacks in Wana and Islamabad. Condemning the incidents, the premier and the president had an “exchange of views on the country’s overall political and security situation”, state-run PTV said in a post on X. “Both leaders reaffirm their resolve that actions against foreign-backed terrorists and their facilitators will continue until the complete elimination of terrorism,” PTV added. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past few years, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel. ‘Clear Afghan involvement’ Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Tuesday that it was “clear” that Afghanistan was directly involved in the attack. Noting that the terrorists had been identified as Afghan, the interior minister said the attackers’ “communication with their people in Afghanistan also continued the entire night”. Referring to multiple visits carried out by top Pakistani leadership to Afghanistan, Naqvi said: “The foreign minister, deputy prime minister, defence minister — we all have gone numerous times and presented them with evidence and details on how they (terrorists) are being trained in Afghanistan, how they plan and then come here to carry out attacks.” “We are very clear in this that Afghanistan must stop them under all circumstances. In case of not stopping them, we will have no other option but to deal with the terrorists who are attacking our country,“ he asserted. Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Tuesday that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",

While the so-called peripheries — KP and Balochistan — had long been experiencing a deadly wave of militant violence, yesterday terrorists struck what is supposed to be one of the most secure cities in this country. And while in the ongoing wave of terrorism mostly security personnel and law enforcers have been targeted, in the latest tragedy a clearly civilian target was hit. The Islamabad bombing brings back painful memories of the last wave of militant violence that took a heavy toll of both security men and civilians before the monster of terrorism was neutralised. Tuesday also saw a clearance operation underway at the Cadet College Wana , another soft target, which had been stormed by militants on Monday. Speaking of both the Islamabad and Wana attacks, the prime minister said they bore the hallmarks of “Indian state terrorism in the region”, while linking Afghanistan to the incidents. Shehbaz Sharif further mentioned that ‘khawarij’ linked to the banned TTP and Baloch separatists were involved. Meanwhile, the defence minister sounded an ominous warning , saying that “we are in a state of war”. It is obvious that a full investigation is required to uncover the forces behind both acts of terrorism, and to bring the perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice. And if any evidence is found of the involvement of India and the Afghan Taliban in these attacks, the issue must be taken up immediately with both New Delhi and Kabul. But while possible foreign links to acts of terrorism must be probed, and those involved beyond our borders confronted, the state’s primary duty right now is to shore up the home front, and re-examine its counterterrorism strategy in the wake of the resurgence of militancy. For long, Pakistan’s major cities have been immune to mass-level terrorist attacks. The fact that a suicide bomber was able to strike in Islamabad indicates a major security lapse. Moreover, if we are indeed in a war-like situation, as the defence minister has claimed, then dealing with this crisis requires a national response. All stakeholders — the opposition, security experts, civil society — need to be taken on board to formulate a cohesive response to the threat of terrorist violence. Petty politicking and targeting of the opposition and all critical voices must stop. All shades of opinion must be heard so that Pakistan can emerge from this crisis stronger and defeat terrorism and extremism. The current strategy is not working, and has resulted in a high number of losses of men in uniform as well as civilians.

They also alleged that the false gods, created through the Amendment, have nefarious plans and that those who voted in its favour will suffer the most. Speaking at a press conference held at the National Press Club, the opposition alliance leaders said that the judiciary has been completely bulldozed and warned that there will be dangerous implications as some personalities have become above the law. They announced that they would step up their efforts to resist and repeal the controversial amendment. Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said that the Constitution of Pakistan makes it clear that sovereignty rests with Allah alone. However, through the amendment, human beings have been made gods. He said that the President of Pakistan has been granted complete impunity, while, on the other hand, the judiciary has been controlled. He alleged that by passing the amendment, the government has ignored public opinion. However, he announced that the TTAP will not remain silent over the amendment, which he described as nothing but an attack on the rule of law. Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Secretary General Salman Akram Raja condemned the passage of the amendment in haste and alleged that the senators were pressurised to vote in its favour. He claimed that the judiciary has become toothless because of the amendment. On the other hand, the President and the Army Chief have been given impunity, and they will not be accountable for any action, even in cases of human rights abuses such as the abduction of people, he explained. PTI leader Sardar Latif Khosa, who was once an activist of the Pakistan Peoples Party, criticised the priorities of the government, claiming that it was working on the amendment rather than mourning the demise of Senator Irfan Siddiqui. He alleged that the haste of the government showed that it had no regard for the Constitution and human dignity. Advocate Khosa claimed that the amendment will make the Chief Justice powerless and that political interference in the courts will further increase. He said that if judges decide cases against the government, they will be transferred, and those who follow government directives will be rewarded. Former Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that there is a general opinion among the masses against the 27th Amendment. He called upon the institutions to hear the voice of the people. He warned that the amendment will destroy the foundation of democracy and urged the judiciary to intervene and protect its own independence. Mr Khokhar said that the impunity given to the President and the Army Chief will set a dangerous precedent and will deprive people of their right to seek justice in cases of abuse of power. “So it is a threat to the Constitution and democracy,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "MANAMA: A de facto partition of Gaza between an area controlled by Israel and another ruled by Hamas is increasingly likely, multiple sources said, with efforts to advance US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war beyond a ceasefire faltering. Six European officials with direct knowledge of the efforts to implement the next phase of the plan told Reuters it was effectively stalled and that reconstruction now appeared likely to be limited to the Israel-controlled area. That could lead to years of separation, they warned. Under the first stage of the plan, which took effect on Oct 10, the Israeli military currently occupies 53 per cent of the Mediterranean territory, including much of its farmland, along with Rafah in the south, parts of Gaza City and other urban areas. Nearly all of Gaza’s 2 million people are crammed into tent camps and the rubble of shattered cities across the rest of Gaza, which is under Hamas control. Reuters drone footage shot in November shows cataclysmic destruction in the northeast of Gaza City after Israel’s final assault before the ceasefire, following months of prior bombardments. The area is now split between Israeli and Hamas control. The next stage of the plan foresees Israel withdrawing further from the so-called yellow line agreed under Trump’s plan, alongside the establishment of a transitional authority to govern Gaza, the deployment of a multinational security force meant to take over from the Israeli military, the disarmament of Hamas and the start of reconstruction. But the plan provides no timelines or mechanisms for implementation. Meanwhile, Hamas refuses to disarm, Israel rejects any involvement by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, and uncertainty persists over the multinational force. European officials say reconstruction appeared likely to be limited to Israel-controlled area, can lead to years of separation “We’re still working out ideas,” Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi said at a Manama security conference this month. “Everybody wants this conflict over, all of us want the same endgame here. Question is, how do we make it work?” Without a major push by the United States to break the impasse, the yellow line looks set to become the de facto border indefinitely dividing Gaza, according to 18 sources, among them the six European officials and a former US official familiar with the talks. The United States has drafted a UN Security Council resolution that would grant the multinational force and a transitional governing body a two-year mandate. But ten diplomats said governments remain hesitant to commit troops. European and Arab nations, in particular, were unlikely to participate if responsibilities extended beyond peacekeeping, and meant direct confrontation with Hamas or other Palestinian groups, they said. A State Department spokesperson said that while “tremendous progress” had been made in advancing Trump’s plan, there was more work to do, without responding to questions about whether reconstruction would be limited to the Israeli-controlled area. Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza City, said that the group was ready to hand over power to a Palestinian technocrat entity so that reconstruction could begin. “All the regions of Gaza deserve reconstruction equally,” he said. Gaza City resident Salah Abu Amr, 62, said that if no progress was made on disarming Hamas and redevelopment began across the yellow line, people might think of moving there. But the realities of a divided Gaza were hard to contemplate, he said. “Are we all going to be able to move into that area? Or Israel will have a veto over the entry of some of us,” he said. “Are they also going to divide the families between good people, bad people?” It remains unclear who would finance rebuilding parts of Gaza under Israeli occupation, with Gulf nations loath to step in without involvement of the Palestinian Auth­ority and a path to statehood, resisted by Israel. Reconstruction costs are estimated at $70 billion. Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin also rejected territorial division of Gaza, and said the Palestinian Authority was ready to assume “full national responsibility.” “There can be no genuine reconstruction or lasting stability without full Palestinian sovereignty over the territory,” she said in a statement in response to questions.

Six European officials with direct knowledge of the efforts to implement the next phase of the plan told Reuters it was effectively stalled and that reconstruction now appeared likely to be limited to the Israel-controlled area. That could lead to years of separation, they warned.

      "summary_orig": "• Justice Jawwad asks top court to set aside 27th Amendment • Argues certain constitutional commands can’t be altered in a way that destroys their essence ISLAMABAD: Former chief justice Jawwad S. Khawaja on Tuesday challenged the 27th Amendment , seeking a direction that the Supreme Court (SC) retains exclusive jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness and constitutionality of the proposed amendment. Filed through Advocate Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, the petitioner pleaded before the apex court to strike down or suspend any provisions in any Act of Parliament, including the 27th Amendment, which reduce or abolish any constitutional jurisdiction of the SC or which purport to vest any such jurisdiction in any other court or body. The petition also requested the apex court to set aside provisions of the 27th Amendment, which relate to transfer of high court judges with a request that until a final decision of this petition and as a matter of urgency. The ex-CJ explained that he has filed the petition to save the SC that he claimed was on the verge of being abolished as a constitutional court. By the time of hearing of this petition, the petition argued, the Constitution might have already been amended in a manner that purports to take away SC’s constitutional jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the terms of such amendment, it is the petitioner’s case that the country’s top court must hear this petition immediately, as at the date of filing of this petition, the apex cou­rt exists as a constitutional court. The petition seeks to enforce the command of the Consti­tution, which stipulates that “the independence of the judiciary shall be fully secured”. The petition contended the question before this court was whether the constitutional jurisdiction of the apex court could be abolished. The ex-CJ argued that he had “no personal interest” in this case, adding the relief sought was for the benefit of all citizens of Pakistan. “This petition and any adjudication will have an immediate impact on the fundamental rights of citizens,” he stated, adding that if SC’s constitutional jurisdiction was abolished, the people would be deprived of an independent apex forum to approach for enforcement of fundamental rights. Cornerstone of Constitution According to the petitioner, the constitutional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as an independent apex judicial body was a cornerstone of the 1973 Constitution. Any att­empt to abolish, diminish, or subordinate the apex court undermines the very architecture of the constit­utional order and is inconsistent with the will of the people as expressed in the 1973 Con­stitution, he argued. According to him, the independence and jurisdiction of the SC are constitutional commands and the parliamentarians act as fiduciaries of the people and cannot go against these constitutional commands as set out in the preamble of the Constitution. He was of the opinion that even a constitutional ame­ndment could not abr­ogate SC’s constitutional jurisdiction. Therefore, any attempt to abolish or und­e­rmine the SC’s constitutional aut­hor­ity would violate the foundational principles of Constitution and thr­eaten the continuity of the constitutional order itself, he added. The framers of the Constitution intentionally enshrined SC’s authority in a manner that underscored its independence and centrality to the constitutional system, he said. Its powers and jurisdiction were constitutional imperatives integral to the Con­s­titution, according to the former chief justice. The petitioner argued that the SC had already recognised that certain constitutional commands set out by the people, including judicial independence, could not be altered in a way that destroyed their essence.

      "title_orig": "Attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan ‘cannot be ruled out’, Asif says after attacks rock Pakistan",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after today’s incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At least 12 people were killed and 36 were injured in a suicide blast in the federal capital. The incident occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue, while a cricket match between the Green shirts and Sri Lanka was also being held in Pindi. Meanwhile, a clearance operation by security forces continues in Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan against terrorists hiding inside the educational institute. When asked during an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ if Pakistan would respond after today’s attacks and statements from the leadership linking them to Afghanistan, Asif said: “God willing”, adding that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan “could not be ruled out” and could definitely happen. The defence minister added that Pakistan was “compelled” to act after today’s attacks. The defence minister said that there should be no more illusions that the Afghan Taliban were sympathisers of Pakistan or were sincere in wanting peace. “Let’s not fool ourselves … there were three rounds of talks,” he said. He elaborated that there was no united government in Kabul and instead it was composed of various groups and factions with different interests and agendas. “Some are linked with India and some have their strings being pulled from elsewhere, so both of these incidents, I think, are a prelude to a coming aggression that could happen from the Afghan side, actually, it will be Indian aggression that is being waged in our country through the route of Afghanistan.” “There should be no misunderstanding about this, it is absolutely clear-cut that the enmity of our neighbour has come out in the open,” he added, saying that Pakistan had asked only one thing of the Afghan Taliban during the dialogue process and nothing else: to prevent terrorism from Afghan soil. “All these terrorists have come from there and their formations have penetrated into Pakistan over many months. They’ve been slowly stationing these groups here for the past year; they’ve sent around 2,500-3,000 people in the past year, and they’re present in various areas.” “Pakistan doesn’t have training camps or their sanctuaries so they come here and live with someone in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. You cannot ignore another factor: that around 55 per cent of terrorists killed were Afghans, not Pakistanis. So how can you deny this reality?” “We have the capacity, we can take care of them. But we don’t want to be bogged down in a war and for our attention to be diverted from our economic recovery and other issues. This is a natural wish of ours that we want peace in our country,” said Asif when asked about reports linking the terrorists involved in the Wana attack to Afghanistan. “If they want to disturb our peace, then we will have to respond in kind to them, there should be no doubt about it.” The minister added that Pakistan could not depend on verbal guarantees by the Afghan side, saying that no one trusted the word of Kabul’s rulers in the neighbouring country itself. Questioned about action against terrorists, the defence minister said there was no uncertainty about the matter. He said when terrorist groups were encountered during their attempts to cross the border, they were often chased in “hot pursuit” into Afghan territory with “physical and aerial retaliation and we will intensify this in the coming period”. Meanwhile, on the blast in New Delhi and the developing narrative from the Indian authorities on the situation, Asif said: “I won’t be surprised if in the next few hours or tomorrow India blames us for this.” Despite this, the defence minister stressed: “I want to assure our eastern and western neighbours that Pakistan is not interested in fighting with them. We are passing through a phase where we are consolidating our economic gains and this is a critical issue for us that we are slowly opening our economic shackles.” “During this period, it would be absolutely crazy for us to go somewhere and start engaging in terrorism. This is not in our interest, whether it is Pahalgam or Kabul or Delhi. This can never happen; logic cannot accept that we do such irresponsible adventures when the situation is in flux.” However, he clarified that the stance did not mean that Pakistan would not respond to any aggression against it. “I assure India. Afghanistan and the international community that Pakistan will never initiate any adventure or war or support any terrorist activity directly or indirectly, but side-by-side, I will say that we will pay back in the same coin if we are targeted,” Asif declared. He further added that any Indian adventure against Pakistan ahead of the second phase of the Bihar elections could not be ruled out, saying that there was a “stark possibility” of such a “drama” being staged. The defence minister reiterated that Pakistan had not lowered its guard since the May conflict between the two countries and was still on high alert to repel any “adventure or military initiative by India”.",

      "summary_orig": "A bomb attack in the Daraban tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan on Tuesday injured at least 14 security personnel. The attack, said to be a remotely controlled improvised explosive device (IED), targeted a security forces convoy, said security sources. The explosion heavily damaged a security forces vehicle. The injured were shifted to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) D.I Khan. The attack came at a time when security forces were battling terrorists who attacked Cadet College Wana in North Waziristan. While all teachers and students were reported on Tuesday evening to have been safely evacuated, a clearance operation remained underway to neutralise three terrorists who managed to infiltrate the building. Security forces added that three of the personnel were said to be in critical condition. Following the attack, a large contingent of police and security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area. A search operation was launched to sanitise the area. Earlier on Monday, security forces killed 20 terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBO) in KP — eight in North Waziristan and 12 in the Dara Adam Khel district. Another four were eliminated in Balochistan’s Kalat. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel. Attack on Bannu police station thwarted Separately, KP police said they thwarted a late-night attack on the Ahmadzai Police Station in the Bannu district. In a press release, KP Police said “miscreants attempted to attack the police station with small and big weapons” in the early hours of Tuesday, but it was foiled due to the cops’ timely response. The statement added that the policemen present inside the building thwarted the attack through their “swift and effective action”, with multiple terrorists killed and injured. The bodies were taken by the attackers, the police said. KP Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed hailed the policemen for their response and asserted that the personnel were “ready and alert at all times to protect the public”. IG Hameed also announced a cash reward and certificates of appreciation for the police team involved in repelling the attack. Pictures shared by KP Police showed multiple kinds of weapons, including hand grenades, lying on the ground in the wake of the attack. Some parts of the police station building were damaged. This photo combo shows weapons lying around the Ahmadzai police station in Bannu. — KP Police Cop gunned down in Bannu; school torched in Lakki Marwat Police on Tuesday night killed two terrorists in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Mamakhel Havaid area of Bannu. The operation was conducted by the police and counter-terrorism department (CTD) personnel following credible information about the presence of terrorists in the area. In a press release, KP police’s director public relations said that the law enforcement personnel swung into action when they received authentic reports that terrorists had come to the area with an intention of executing their nefarious plan. He added that an intense exchange of fire took place when the law enforcers came across the terrorists. “The gun battle lasted for half an hour, resulting in the elimination of two terrorists”, he claimed, adding the bodies of slain militants were found during a search operation launched soon after the gunfight. He identified the killed terrorists as Fazlullah alias Faizullah alias Hanzala and Saifur Rehman and said that they were involved in target killing of policemen and attacks on police stations. Among other acts, the two terrorists had killed a former police official and threw his body near the Naley Bridge in the Daud Shah area of Bannu district on Tuesday night. A police official said that a group of terrorists had kidnapped former ASI Abid Khan from the same area within the limits of the cantonment police station two days ago. Abid Khan, resident of Kurrum Garhi Mamandkhel, who also served as SHO in the Wazir subdivision, had been dismissed from service a week ago. In another incident in Bannu, a policeman embraced martyrdom when unknown terrorists targeted him in the Walkhi Mammakhel area today. The district police office’s (DPO) spokesman Bashir confirmed the incident, adding that it occurred within the limits of the Havaid police station. He identified the deceased cop as Ilyas and said that he was posted to the investigation wing at the Saddar police station. “Unknown gunmen opened fire on Constable Ilyas near his house when he was coming to the Saddar police station to join his duty,“ Bashir said, adding the assailants fled the place on their motorcycles. He said the martyred cop’s body was taken to the District Headquarters Hospital to complete medico-legal formalities. The spokesman added that after the targeted killing, a large police contingent reached the area and launched a search for the assailants.

      "title_orig": "A lesson for Pakistan in Indian sweet syrup death",
      "summary_orig": "When 23 children died in India’s Madhya Pradesh after consuming contaminated cough syrup in early September, the news barely registered across the border. In Pakistan — where self-medication is rampant and syrup bottles are household staples — the tragedy strikes dangerously close to home. Many in Pakistan remain unaware that those sweet, over-the-counter syrups can be fatal. In the recent Indian case, the children — all under six — died of kidney failure after consuming syrup laced with diethylene glycol (DEG), a toxic solvent found at 500 times the permissible limit. Investigations revealed the manufacturer, Sresan, had sourced industrial-grade propylene glycol from local chemical and paint dealers instead of certified pharmaceutical suppliers. With no qualified chemist overseeing production, the syrup went untested — and deadly. This isn’t the first such incident. In 2022, Indian-made syrups caused the deaths of at least 70 children in The Gambia and 18 in Uzbekistan . Between December 2019 and January 2020, at least 12 children died in Indian-held Kashmir after taking similarly contaminated syrup. The prescribing doctor in India was the first to be arrested, followed by the suspension of the drug inspector and deputy director. The manufacturer, who had been absconding since September, has now been caught . “It shows that even doctors can get caught in legal and ethical trouble, even when unaware of a drug’s quality issues,” said Professor Mishal Khan of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “The tragedy is a warning for Pakistan — weak regulation hurts everyone: doctors, pharma companies, and patients alike.” A 2024 study by Khan found that approximately 40 per cent of Karachi doctors accepted incentives in return for prescribing medicines from a fake pharmaceutical company without any checks on the company’s manufacturing standards or medicine quality. Antibiotics and cough syrups were among the medicines they agreed to promote. As Pakistan enters its flu season, Karachi’s hospitals are filling up. “Between 50 to 70pc of children who visit our clinics have respiratory tract infections,” said Dr Wasim Jamalvi of Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi. And with the flu comes a predictable companion: cough syrup. “If a child is brought for consultation for fever, cough and cold, parents feel a prescription is incomplete without a cough syrup,” said Dr DS Akram, a senior paediatrician, who stopped prescribing them two decades ago. “Cough syrups don’t work — they just make the children drowsy or irritable,” she said. Jamalvi agrees, “We don’t recommend syrups for under-fives, but parents still give them — they’re easily available over the counter.” Self-medication culture In Pakistan, cough syrups — often called sherbet — are viewed as harmless cures. “I swear by this syrup a doctor gave me years ago,” said Mohammad Yusuf, a 31-year-old houseboy. “One spoon at night and I sleep better.” Two weeks ago, when Rakhi Matan’s children, aged 10 and 13, came down with the flu, she reached for a bottle of leftover cough syrup from last year. “It saved me the doctor’s fee — he’d have prescribed the same thing,” she said. Such casual self-medication is common — and hard to control. Dr Qaiser Sajjad, former secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association, said regulating cough syrup sales is nearly impossible with thousands of quacks operating in the city. Medical store worker Majid Yusufzai agreed, admitting syrups are sold freely without prescriptions and “entire families share the same bottle”. Health experts say Pakistan’s culture of self-prescription — reinforced by weak enforcement and cheap access to medicines — makes the system vulnerable to similar disasters. Dr Obaidullah Malik, heading the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), told IPS that Pakistan imported the majority of the raw materials for several drugs, including cough syrups, from India and China. With over 100,000 drug manufacturing companies, India, referred to as the ‘pharmacy of the world’, is known for affordable generic drugs. But recent deaths have cast a long shadow on its safety standards. Tighter drug oversight “It is of great concern,” Malik said, adding that scrutiny of domestic quality control was enhanced after it received a global alert from the World Health Organisation on October 13, of three substandard cough syrups manufactured in India. “Thankfully, the contaminated syrups were never exported to Pakistan,” Malik confirmed. “There’s no evidence of illegal shipments either — but we’re staying vigilant to ensure a tragedy like India’s doesn’t happen here.” “Drap has made it mandatory for all pharmaceuticals, including herbal and nutraceutical manufacturers as well as importers, to pre-test additives such as glycerin, propylene glycol, and sorbitol — either in their own laboratories or through public sector facilities like the Central Drugs Laboratory in Karachi or the 12 provincial drug testing,” Malik said. The authority is double-checking vendor credentials and certifications and instructed field teams to step up sampling and testing — both of raw materials coming in and the finished syrups. Recently, it trained pharma company reps from Nepal, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Maldives and Sri Lanka on a quick detection method called Thin Layer Chromatography, which helps spot contamination early — saving time, cutting costs and improving safety checks nationwide. There are between 700 and 800 pharmaceutical companies across Pakistan, but only about 300 are members of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association — leaving much of the industry operating with little oversight. Yet, despite its fledgling state compared to India’s, Pakistan’s pharma sector is eager to expand into global markets. Khan cautioned that the recent scandal over unsafe medicines could jeopardise those ambitions before they even take off. To avoid a similar crisis and protect its reputation abroad, Pakistan’s regulator has stepped up oversight at home. “Since November 2023, Drap has recalled 63 finished products contaminated with DEG and ethylene glycol, identified 44 impurities, and issued 13 alerts about contaminated raw materials,” said Drap’s CEO. As Karachi’s clinics continue to fill up this flu season, syrup bottles are flying off shelves — often with no pharmacist in sight. “It’s just a syrup,” Yusuf said. He does not know, but for dozens of families across the border, that sweet bottle brought irreversible loss.

Jamalvi agrees, “We don’t recommend syrups for under-fives, but parents still give them — they’re easily available over the counter.” Self-medication culture In Pakistan, cough syrups — often called sherbet — are viewed as harmless cures. “I swear by this syrup a doctor gave me years ago,” said Mohammad Yusuf, a 31-year-old houseboy. “One spoon at night and I sleep better.” Two weeks ago, when Rakhi Matan’s children, aged 10 and 13, came down with the flu, she reached for a bottle of leftover cough syrup from last year. “It saved me the doctor’s fee — he’d have prescribed the same thing,” she said. Such casual self-medication is common — and hard to control. Dr Qaiser Sajjad, former secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association, said regulating cough syrup sales is nearly impossible with thousands of quacks operating in the city. Medical store worker Majid Yusufzai agreed, admitting syrups are sold freely without prescriptions and “entire families share the same bottle”. Health experts say Pakistan’s culture of self-prescription — reinforced by weak enforcement and cheap access to medicines — makes the system vulnerable to similar disasters. Dr Obaidullah Malik, heading the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), told IPS that Pakistan imported the majority of the raw materials for several drugs, including cough syrups, from India and China. With over 100,000 drug manufacturing companies, India, referred to as the ‘pharmacy of the world’, is known for affordable generic drugs. But recent deaths have cast a long shadow on its safety standards. Tighter drug oversight “It is of great concern,” Malik said, adding that scrutiny of domestic quality control was enhanced after it received a global alert from the World Health Organisation on October 13, of three substandard cough syrups manufactured in India. “Thankfully, the contaminated syrups were never exported to Pakistan,” Malik confirmed. “There’s no evidence of illegal shipments either — but we’re staying vigilant to ensure a tragedy like India’s doesn’t happen here.” “Drap has made it mandatory for all pharmaceuticals, including herbal and nutraceutical manufacturers as well as importers, to pre-test additives such as glycerin, propylene glycol, and sorbitol — either in their own laboratories or through public sector facilities like the Central Drugs Laboratory in Karachi or the 12 provincial drug testing,” Malik said. The authority is double-checking vendor credentials and certifications and instructed field teams to step up sampling and testing — both of raw materials coming in and the finished syrups. Recently, it trained pharma company reps from Nepal, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Maldives and Sri Lanka on a quick detection method called Thin Layer Chromatography, which helps spot contamination early — saving time, cutting costs and improving safety checks nationwide. There are between 700 and 800 pharmaceutical companies across Pakistan, but only about 300 are members of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association — leaving much of the industry operating with little oversight. Yet, despite its fledgling state compared to India’s, Pakistan’s pharma sector is eager to expand into global markets. Khan cautioned that the recent scandal over unsafe medicines could jeopardise those ambitions before they even take off. To avoid a similar crisis and protect its reputation abroad, Pakistan’s regulator has stepped up oversight at home. “Since November 2023, Drap has recalled 63 finished products contaminated with DEG and ethylene glycol, identified 44 impurities, and issued 13 alerts about contaminated raw materials,” said Drap’s CEO. As Karachi’s clinics continue to fill up this flu season, syrup bottles are flying off shelves — often with no pharmacist in sight. “It’s just a syrup,” Yusuf said. He does not know, but for dozens of families across the border, that sweet bottle brought irreversible loss.

      "title": "A lesson for Pakistan in Indian sweet syrup death",
      "summary": "When 23 children died in India’s Madhya Pradesh after consuming contaminated cough syrup in early September, the news barely registered across the border. In Pakistan — where self-medication is rampant and syrup bottles are household staples — the tragedy strikes dangerously close to home. Many in Pakistan remain unaware that those sweet, over-the-counter syrups can be fatal. In the recent Indian case, the children — all under six — died of kidney failure after consuming syrup laced with diethylene glycol (DEG), a toxic solvent found at 500 times the permissible limit. Investigations revealed the manufacturer, Sresan, had sourced industrial-grade propylene glycol from local chemical and paint dealers instead of certified pharmaceutical suppliers. With no qualified chemist overseeing production, the syrup went untested — and deadly. This isn’t the first such incident. In 2022, Indian-made syrups caused the deaths of at least 70 children in The Gambia and 18 in Uzbekistan . Between December 2019 and January 2020, at least 12 children died in Indian-held Kashmir after taking similarly contaminated syrup. The prescribing doctor in India was the first to be arrested, followed by the suspension of the drug inspector and deputy director. The manufacturer, who had been absconding since September, has now been caught . “It shows that even doctors can get caught in legal and ethical trouble, even when unaware of a drug’s quality issues,” said Professor Mishal Khan of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “The tragedy is a warning for Pakistan — weak regulation hurts everyone: doctors, pharma companies, and patients alike.” A 2024 study by Khan found that approximately 40 per cent of Karachi doctors accepted incentives in return for prescribing medicines from a fake pharmaceutical company without any checks on the company’s manufacturing standards or medicine quality. Antibiotics and cough syrups were among the medicines they agreed to promote. As Pakistan enters its flu season, Karachi’s hospitals are filling up. “Between 50 to 70pc of children who visit our clinics have respiratory tract infections,” said Dr Wasim Jamalvi of Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.

      "summary_orig": "A Turkish C-130 military cargo plane with at least 20 personnel on board crashed in Georgia on Tuesday after taking off from Azerbaijan, but the number of casualties and the cause of the incident were not immediately clear. Initial video from the scene near the Azerbaijan border showed chunks of twisted metal strewn across a grassy knoll, with parts of the fuselage still ablaze and dark smoke rising into a clear sky. Fire engines stood nearby and a helicopter whirred overhead. Footage circulating on social media appeared to show the plane corkscrewing towards the earth and then bursting into flames. Reuters could not immediately verify that footage. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan interrupted a speech in Ankara to offer condolences for “our martyrs” — a term he regularly uses to describe not only combat deaths but also service personnel killed in the course of their general duties. Erdogan, his office and the ministry did not say what caused the crash, and they did not provide a death toll. Local media said there were both Turkish and Azeri personnel on board the US-made aircraft but gave no numbers. View this post on Instagram In a post on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended his condolences to Erdogan and the families of those on board the aircraft. “[I am] saddened by the tragic crash of the Turkish C-130 aircraft in Georgia,” he wrote. Heartfelt condolences to my dear brother, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the families of those on board and to our Turkish brothers and sisters. Our thoughts and prayers are with them in this moment of grief.“ ‘Loss of servicemen’ After a call with Erdogan, Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev said, according to an official readout, that he had discussed “the tragic news of the loss of servicemen” in the crash. Turkey’s Defence Ministry said 20 Turkish personnel were on board, including the flight crew, but provided no additional details on possible passengers of other nationalities. Turkey and Georgia said they were working to reach the site in the Sighnaghi municipality of Kakheti, a border region of floodplain forests and rolling hills. In the Turkish capital Ankara, Erdogan was handed a note by his aides as he was finishing a speech. “God willing, we will overcome this crash with minimum hardships. May God rest the souls of our martyrs, and let us be with them through our prayers,” he said. Georgia’s Interpress news agency cited the country’s Interior Ministry as saying the incident was being investigated under a criminal code article covering air transport and the loss of life. Azerbaijan, a close ally of Nato member Turkey, said the plane had taken off from the city of Ganja. Lockheed Martin’s cargo, troop and equipment carrier American firm Lockheed Martin, which makes the widely used C-130 Hercules, expressed its condolences to those affected by the crash and to Turkey’s Air Force and citizens. “We are committed to supporting our customer in any way as they investigate,” said company spokesperson Chris Karns. The C-130 Hercules is a cargo, troop and equipment carrier aircraft. It is described as a four-engine, turboprop military transport aircraft that can make use of unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings. Its versatile airframe has enabled it to be used for other purposes as well, including as a gunship and for airborne assault and reconnaissance operations. It is now viewed as one of the main tactical airlifters for many militaries.",

      "title_orig": "Israeli parliament advances death penalty bill backed by Ben-Gvir",
      "summary_orig": "The Israeli parliament has advanced a bill that would mandate the death penalty for Palestinians convicted of killing Israeli citizens, with some lawmakers believing it would prevent future prisoner-release deals. In a vote held late on Monday — the first of four needed for the measure to become law — the bill passed with 39 in favour and 16 against, out of 120 lawmakers. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir had called on all political factions to back the bill, which he has said was aimed at creating deterrence against “Arab terrorism”. “This is how we fight terror; this is how we create deterrence,” he said in a statement after the initial vote. “Once the law is finally passed — terrorists will be released only to hell.” Some parties boycotted Monday’s vote The bill will now move to a parliamentary committee for further debate before a second and third vote. It is not guaranteed that it will become law, with several key political parties having boycotted Monday’s initial vote. Opposition leader Yair Lapid was quoted by Israeli media as saying that he would not vote in favour of the bill. The Palestine Liberation Organisation condemned the vote, with Palestinian National Council Speaker Rawhi Fattouh calling the draft law “a political, legal, and humanitarian crime”. The vote was also criticised by Hamas. Israel abolished the death penalty for murder in 1954, and the only person ever executed in Israel after a civilian trial was Adolf Eichmann, an architect of the Nazi Holocaust, in 1962. Ben-Gvir has argued that imposing the death penalty would deter anyone considering an attack similar to the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed nearly 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and resulted in 251 hostages being taken to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Israel’s devastating retaliatory offensive in Gaza killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to health officials in Gaza. A tenuous ceasefire was agreed last month that included the release of 20 remaining living hostages held in Gaza, plus the remains of deceased ones, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Prisoner release deals Israel has released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees since October 2023 in exchange for the release of the hostages that were being held by Palestinian fighters. Most of the hostages have been released except for the remains of three deceased Israelis and one foreigner. Tzvika Foghel, a member of Ben-Gvir’s Jewish Power party and chair of the parliamentary national security committee, where the bill will now be debated, said imposing the death penalty would mean no more prisoner deals. Palestinians who have been released have included some convicted of serious crimes, including murder. Many had not been convicted of any crime. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel, was released in 2011 as part of an exchange of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for one Israeli soldier held in Gaza. Far-right Israeli politicians such as Ben-Gvir have, during the fighting in Gaza, opposed the release of Palestinians who were involved in the killings of Israelis. Ben-Gvir handed out sweets to fellow lawmakers after the initial vote passed. In Gaza, some Palestinians had handed out sweets to the public after the October 2023 attack.",

      "title_orig": "PTI’s Gohar says govt attempting to create ‘another elite class’ as NA debates 27th Amendment",
      "summary_orig": "The National Assembly deliberated on the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment bill on Tuesday — a day after the government succeeded in manoeuvring it through the Senate — with PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan accusing the government of attempting to “create another elite class”. He made these remarks particularly in reference to a proposal under the 27th Amendment to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests. Speaking after Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, who presented the bill in the lower house of Parliament, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan condemned the 27th Amendment. He said that “with the passing of this amendment, democracy here will only exist in name”, adding that his party “will not accept” it. It was a disservice to the “constitutional oath”, he decried. “When you take the oath, you vow to exercise responsibility and honesty for the good of the people and democracy,” Gohar added. Speaking about the proposal to establish a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), he recalled that “this was also a part of the agenda for the 26th Amendment last year”. He claimed that the government had declared it “unconstitutional” back then. “The head of state was issuing orders from Baku and so we are labelling this the Baku amendment,” Gohar continued,  apparently referring to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif presiding over a federal cabinet meeting — which approved the amendment — via a video link from Baku. Barrister Gohar recalled that “when the current government first came into power, the first thing they did was amend the National Accountability Ordinance,” claiming that they got “rid of all corruption cases filed against them” by doing so. “Now, on their way out, they want to give themselves immunity and hold themselves above the law,” he alleged. The PTI chairperson stressed that “real democracy requires one to uphold the law and practice accountability”. He went on to question: “In what part of the world does the president have lifetime immunity? “Can you not appear in front of a court and prove your innocence?” View this post on Instagram Continuing his speech, Gohar said: “The day he (jailed PTI founder Imran Khan) gets free, when that man of steel is freed, whatever he says, his words will be declared as the Constitution.” Then, coming back to the matter of immunity for the president, the PTI chairman said, “We make the law, and then while calling ourselves the protectors of the said law, we decide to grant ourselves immunity.” “What face will you show to the people of Pakistan? People who have run out of patience, who do not have the means to eat, or pay hospital bills, people who do not have access to justice in courts,” he remarked. Barrister Gohar said that by trying to pass this clause under the proposed amendment, the government was attempting to “create another elite class on top of the one that already exists.” Tarar tables bill Earlier, Law Minister Tarar tabled the bill in the NA today for the house’s consideration. The bill needs a two-thirds majority in order to be passed by the NA, which the ruling coalition has in the 336-member house as compared to the opposition’s 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, the PPP has 74, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has 22, the  Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid has five, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party has four, and the PML-Z, the Balochistan Awami Party, and the National Peoples Party have one seat each. The NA session today began with a prayer for PML-N Irfan Siddiqui, who passed away yesterday. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then asked Tarar to move the bill for the constitutional amendment to be taken into consideration, as stated in the house’s agenda for today. The law minister moved the bill, recalling that when the legislation for the 26th Constitutional Amendment had landed in the house, “two main political parties, after much debate and discussion, made a few adjustments in the promises made to the public under the Charter of Democracy ”. “One of those key points was the establishment of a constitutional court […] Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman kept our friends from the opposition on board regarding this, and you all know that it was on their request that we agreed on establishing a constitutional bench instead of a constitutional court,” Tarar continued. Subsequently, he said, the amendment for establishing a constitutional bench was passed. However, he added, several objections were raised over it, with the critics saying that “you have formed a court within a court, and that this system will not continue”. Making a case for the constitutional court, Tarar said “some sensitive constitutional matters had surfaced in the past — and they will surface in the future as well — that took up most of the quality time of the court”. So, he continued, coalition partners were consulted, and it was agreed that a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) should be established. The minister said the salient features pertaining to the FCC in the amendment bill were the same as the points agreed in the Charter of Democracy. At this point, opposition members could be heard protesting in the background. Nevertheless, Tarar continued that an impression had been created that Article 184(3) of the Constitution — which elaborates on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court — was being abolished. But it was not the case, he clarified, adding that the powers granted under the clause would be transferred to the FCC and “a pari materia provision has been introduced after Article 175-B [in the Constitution], pertaining to the [court’s] jurisdiction”. He said in connection with Article 184 of the Constitution, the parliamentary committee that deliberated on the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment also discussed the matter of the court’s suo motu powers, “to which prime ministers, government employees, actors and even the country’s economic system had fallen victim”. In view of these past instances, he said the FCC was not being granted suo motu powers under the new proposed amendment. Instead, an application would have to be submitted and fulfil the criteria outlined under Article 184(3) — that the matter in question was of public importance and required the enforcement of fundamental rights — to exercise this power, elaborated. This power “will not be used to grill an individual”, he asserted. On the matter of transfer of judges, he said after discussion and deliberation, it had been decided that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) be given the authority to transfer judges. The initial draft of the bill stated that a judge would be deemed retired if he refused a transfer, Tarar said, adding that the clause had now been amended to provide judges an opportunity to present their stance to the JCP regarding their transfer. But after a decision regarding a judge’s transfer was finalised and the judge refused the transfer, the matter would be referred to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). The SJC would then decide whether a judge’s stance was valid, or not and warranted action. The minister pointed out that under the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, there were two courts at the apex level — the SC and FCC. The FCC, he said, had more or less the same powers as granted to the constitutional bench established under the 26th Amendment. “These powers include those granted under Articles 184 and 186, of deciding on matters among provinces, giving advice on presidential references, making decisions regarding the transfer of cases […] and deciding on writ petitions under Article 199 except in some cases,” he elaborated. The minister argued that this would reduce the SC caseload and the “Supreme Court will now have the time and energy to hear the cases of the common man”. He said the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi would continue to head the JCP and SJC under the new amendment on the basis of his seniority. Tarar added that the CJP would also continue to head any other body that he was currently heading. Moreover, he continued, it had been proposed that from among the top judges of the SC and FCC, the senior judge would head these bodies. “If they are appointed on the same day, seniority will be determined on the basis of the day they entered in the office in the high court or the Supreme Court,” Tarar explained. Another recommendation was that the five-judge panel of the JCP would comprise the top-most and senior puisne judges of the SC and FCC, Tarar said, adding that the two chief justices would decide who would be appointed as the fifth member of the panel. If they couldn’t nominate anyone, the matter would be referred to the commission, the law minister said. Tarar said it was also proposed in the bill that if an elected senator took their oath after a delay, the period of their term would be reduced accordingly. Speaking about Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces,  Tarar said the government decided after consultation to bestow the rank of Field Marshal upon Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir in light of the successes achieved during May conflict with India. He said it was also decided that under Article 243, “no individual will have the power to deprive a national hero of the title of Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force or Admiral of the Fleet. These titles will be for lifetime. But if there are valid grounds on the basis of which one is of the opinion that these titles should be withdrawn, Parliament will decide on it after deliberation”. On the matter of the president’s lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests, Tarar said a caveat had been added to the original proposal that the immunity would be waived for the period during which a former president would hold public office. He then urged the house to carry out a “fruitful discussion” on the proposed amendment. Speaker on opposition leader’s appointment At one point during the session, NA Speaker Sadiq made observations regarding the appointment of the leader of the opposition in the house. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub in August, and while the opposition party has requested the appointment of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party’s Mehmood Khan Achakzai in his place, the latter is yet to be notified as the opposition leader. Addressing the matter today, Sadiq said the matter was currently sub judice, and therefore, the house would await the court’s decision before taking any further steps on the issue. Referring to his meeting with PTI’s Asad Qaiser and Amir Dogar, the speaker said the matter of the opposition leader’s appointment had been referred back to the Peshawar High Court by the Supreme Court. The matter would be taken up in the assembly once the court delivered its verdict, he added. Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, from the MQM, also spoke during the session. He referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of local governments and to which his party had sought amendments. The matter, however, has not been included in the 27th Amendment. Kamal said the “matter is not dead yet” and will soon be discussed as part of a 28th constitutional amendment. Highlighting the importance of local governments, he said: “If you want to have rights and resources, good governance policies — of the federal as well as the provincial government — at people’s doorsteps, there’s no vehicle for that [at present].” Later, the session was adjourned until 11a, tomorrow. Bill sails through Senate The PML-N-led coalition government on Monday succeeded in manouvering the passage of the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill through the Senate, securing a two-thirds majority with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines. The bill, seeking crucial changes to several articles of the Constitution mostly dealing with the judiciary and the military leadership, was presented before the upper house of Parliament for a final vote by Law Minister Tarar amid a noisy protest by opposition senators. As soon as Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani started putting up the bill for a clause-by-clause vote, the opposition senators started gathering in front of his dais and chanted anti-government slogans. They tore up copies of the bill and agenda and some of them were seen hurling the documents towards the law minister, prompting the sergeants-at-arm to make a human wall at the aisle between the treasury and the opposition benches to prevent any possible physical clash. After staying in the house for a few minutes, the opposition senators belonging to the PTI and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) staged a walkout from the house, providing the government with an opportunity to proceed smoothly. After holding a vote on the bill by division, Senate Chairman Gilani announced that the 27th Amendment bill had been passed with 64 votes, which is not less than a two-thirds majority in the 96-member house. After casting his vote against the party line, PTI’s Saifullah Abro announced his resignation from the house. Speaking on the floor, Senator Abro said he had “voted only for [Field Marshal] Gen Asim Munir”, adding that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by defeating India in the May war. He added that during the [passage of the] 26th Amen­dment, “my 10 family members were abducted, but my party [PTI] did not come to the rescue. Interestingly, when he tendered his resignation, Senate Chairman Gilani said, “We will make you a senator again”. Meanwhile, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. Changes in the bill During yesterday’s Senate session, PPP Senator Farooq Naek presented the final report on the bill, approved by the standing committees on the law and justice of the two houses, highlighting three to four changes that had been suggested by members. About the changes incorporated into the bill on recommendation of the parliamentary committees, Senator Naek said the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) would have equal representation of all provinces besides a representative from the Islamabad High Court. He said the initial draft of the bill stated a judge having served for seven years in the high court could be nominated for the FCC, but this qualification merit has been curtailed to five years on the recommendation. Moreover, he said, the committees agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. On the other hand, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. However, he added, if multiple judges would take the oath the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age. Also, the parliamentary committees suggested a change in the nomination for the reconstituted Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), he said. The 26th Amendment had authorised the speaker to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate for the JCP, he explained. However, the committees proposed that the nominee should be a technocrat, he added. The PPP senator said the suo motu powers of judges had not been taken away, but the court would exercise these powers only when an application was submitted. “The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed,” he said. The PPP senator, who was part of the committee that examined the initial draft of the bill, said that an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided under Article 199 of the Constitution. Since this created a huge backlog, the amendment suggested that interim order would be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made, he explained. Referring to the procedure of judges’ transfer, Mr Naek said previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, the President could transfer judges with their consent and after consultation with the chief justices of both relevant high courts. However, this procedure has been amended, he said. “Now a judge refusing his transfer would be given an opportunity of presenting his reasons for the decline before the JCP. And if the JCP finds the reasons invalid, he would have to retire,” the senator explained. About the provision of lifetime immunity to the president from facing criminal trial or arrest under Article 248, he said it was suggested that this immunity would not be available if the President holds a public office after the end of his term, but as soon as he ceases that public office he would again be entitled to this immunity. According to a proposed amendment in Article 243, this type of lifetime immunity has also been provided to the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the navy.",

The PPP senator, who was part of the committee that examined the initial draft of the bill, said that an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided under Article 199 of the Constitution. Since this created a huge backlog, the amendment suggested that interim order would be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made, he explained. Referring to the procedure of judges’ transfer, Mr Naek said previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, the President could transfer judges with their consent and after consultation with the chief justices of both relevant high courts. However, this procedure has been amended, he said. “Now a judge refusing his transfer would be given an opportunity of presenting his reasons for the decline before the JCP. And if the JCP finds the reasons invalid, he would have to retire,” the senator explained. About the provision of lifetime immunity to the president from facing criminal trial or arrest under Article 248, he said it was suggested that this immunity would not be available if the President holds a public office after the end of his term, but as soon as he ceases that public office he would again be entitled to this immunity. According to a proposed amendment in Article 243, this type of lifetime immunity has also been provided to the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the navy.",
      "title": "PTI’s Gohar says govt attempting to create ‘another elite class’ as NA debates 27th Amendment",
      "summary": "The National Assembly deliberated on the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment bill on Tuesday — a day after the government succeeded in manoeuvring it through the Senate — with PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan accusing the government of attempting to “create another elite class”. He made these remarks particularly in reference to a proposal under the 27th Amendment to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests. Speaking after Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, who presented the bill in the lower house of Parliament, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan condemned the 27th Amendment. He said that “with the passing of this amendment, democracy here will only exist in name”, adding that his party “will not accept” it. It was a disservice to the “constitutional oath”, he decried. “When you take the oath, you vow to exercise responsibility and honesty for the good of the people and democracy,” Gohar added. Speaking about the proposal to establish a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), he recalled that “this was also a part of the agenda for the 26th Amendment last year”. He claimed that the government had declared it “unconstitutional” back then. “The head of state was issuing orders from Baku and so we are labelling this the Baku amendment,” Gohar continued,  apparently referring to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif presiding over a federal cabinet meeting — which approved the amendment — via a video link from Baku. Barrister Gohar recalled that “when the current government first came into power, the first thing they did was amend the National Accountability Ordinance,” claiming that they got “rid of all corruption cases filed against them” by doing so. “Now, on their way out, they want to give themselves immunity and hold themselves above the law,” he alleged. The PTI chairperson stressed that “real democracy requires one to uphold the law and practice accountability”. He went on to question: “In what part of the world does the president have lifetime immunity? “Can you not appear in front of a court and prove your innocence?” View this post on Instagram Continuing his speech, Gohar said: “The day he (jailed PTI founder Imran Khan) gets free, when that man of steel is freed, whatever he says, his words will be declared as the Constitution.” Then, coming back to the matter of immunity for the president, the PTI chairman said, “We make the law, and then while calling ourselves the protectors of the said law, we decide to grant ourselves immunity.” “What face will you show to the people of Pakistan? People who have run out of patience, who do not have the means to eat, or pay hospital bills, people who do not have access to justice in courts,” he remarked. Barrister Gohar said that by trying to pass this clause under the proposed amendment, the government was attempting to “create another elite class on top of the one that already exists.” Tarar tables bill Earlier, Law Minister Tarar tabled the bill in the NA today for the house’s consideration. The bill needs a two-thirds majority in order to be passed by the NA, which the ruling coalition has in the 336-member house as compared to the opposition’s 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, the PPP has 74, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has 22, the  Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid has five, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party has four, and the PML-Z, the Balochistan Awami Party, and the National Peoples Party have one seat each. The NA session today began with a prayer for PML-N Irfan Siddiqui, who passed away yesterday. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then asked Tarar to move the bill for the constitutional amendment to be taken into consideration, as stated in the house’s agenda for today. The law minister moved the bill, recalling that when the legislation for the 26th Constitutional Amendment had landed in the house, “two main political parties, after much debate and discussion, made a few adjustments in the promises made to the public under the Charter of Democracy ”. “One of those key points was the establishment of a constitutional court […] Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman kept our friends from the opposition on board regarding this, and you all know that it was on their request that we agreed on establishing a constitutional bench instead of a constitutional court,” Tarar continued. Subsequently, he said, the amendment for establishing a constitutional bench was passed. However, he added, several objections were raised over it, with the critics saying that “you have formed a court within a court, and that this system will not continue”. Making a case for the constitutional court, Tarar said “some sensitive constitutional matters had surfaced in the past — and they will surface in the future as well — that took up most of the quality time of the court”. So, he continued, coalition partners were consulted, and it was agreed that a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) should be established. The minister said the salient features pertaining to the FCC in the amendment bill were the same as the points agreed in the Charter of Democracy. At this point, opposition members could be heard protesting in the background. Nevertheless, Tarar continued that an impression had been created that Article 184(3) of the Constitution — which elaborates on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court — was being abolished. But it was not the case, he clarified, adding that the powers granted under the clause would be transferred to the FCC and “a pari materia provision has been introduced after Article 175-B [in the Constitution], pertaining to the [court’s] jurisdiction”. He said in connection with Article 184 of the Constitution, the parliamentary committee that deliberated on the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment also discussed the matter of the court’s suo motu powers, “to which prime ministers, government employees, actors and even the country’s economic system had fallen victim”. In view of these past instances, he said the FCC was not being granted suo motu powers under the new proposed amendment. Instead, an application would have to be submitted and fulfil the criteria outlined under Article 184(3) — that the matter in question was of public importance and required the enforcement of fundamental rights — to exercise this power, elaborated. This power “will not be used to grill an individual”, he asserted. On the matter of transfer of judges, he said after discussion and deliberation, it had been decided that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) be given the authority to transfer judges. The initial draft of the bill stated that a judge would be deemed retired if he refused a transfer, Tarar said, adding that the clause had now been amended to provide judges an opportunity to present their stance to the JCP regarding their transfer. But after a decision regarding a judge’s transfer was finalised and the judge refused the transfer, the matter would be referred to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). The SJC would then decide whether a judge’s stance was valid, or not and warranted action. The minister pointed out that under the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, there were two courts at the apex level — the SC and FCC. The FCC, he said, had more or less the same powers as granted to the constitutional bench established under the 26th Amendment. “These powers include those granted under Articles 184 and 186, of deciding on matters among provinces, giving advice on presidential references, making decisions regarding the transfer of cases […] and deciding on writ petitions under Article 199 except in some cases,” he elaborated. The minister argued that this would reduce the SC caseload and the “Supreme Court will now have the time and energy to hear the cases of the common man”. He said the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi would continue to head the JCP and SJC under the new amendment on the basis of his seniority. Tarar added that the CJP would also continue to head any other body that he was currently heading. Moreover, he continued, it had been proposed that from among the top judges of the SC and FCC, the senior judge would head these bodies. “If they are appointed on the same day, seniority will be determined on the basis of the day they entered in the office in the high court or the Supreme Court,” Tarar explained. Another recommendation was that the five-judge panel of the JCP would comprise the top-most and senior puisne judges of the SC and FCC, Tarar said, adding that the two chief justices would decide who would be appointed as the fifth member of the panel. If they couldn’t nominate anyone, the matter would be referred to the commission, the law minister said. Tarar said it was also proposed in the bill that if an elected senator took their oath after a delay, the period of their term would be reduced accordingly. Speaking about Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces,  Tarar said the government decided after consultation to bestow the rank of Field Marshal upon Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir in light of the successes achieved during May conflict with India. He said it was also decided that under Article 243, “no individual will have the power to deprive a national hero of the title of Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force or Admiral of the Fleet. These titles will be for lifetime. But if there are valid grounds on the basis of which one is of the opinion that these titles should be withdrawn, Parliament will decide on it after deliberation”. On the matter of the president’s lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests, Tarar said a caveat had been added to the original proposal that the immunity would be waived for the period during which a former president would hold public office. He then urged the house to carry out a “fruitful discussion” on the proposed amendment. Speaker on opposition leader’s appointment At one point during the session, NA Speaker Sadiq made observations regarding the appointment of the leader of the opposition in the house. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub in August, and while the opposition party has requested the appointment of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party’s Mehmood Khan Achakzai in his place, the latter is yet to be notified as the opposition leader. Addressing the matter today, Sadiq said the matter was currently sub judice, and therefore, the house would await the court’s decision before taking any further steps on the issue. Referring to his meeting with PTI’s Asad Qaiser and Amir Dogar, the speaker said the matter of the opposition leader’s appointment had been referred back to the Peshawar High Court by the Supreme Court. The matter would be taken up in the assembly once the court delivered its verdict, he added. Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, from the MQM, also spoke during the session. He referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of local governments and to which his party had sought amendments. The matter, however, has not been included in the 27th Amendment. Kamal said the “matter is not dead yet” and will soon be discussed as part of a 28th constitutional amendment. Highlighting the importance of local governments, he said: “If you want to have rights and resources, good governance policies — of the federal as well as the provincial government — at people’s doorsteps, there’s no vehicle for that [at present].” Later, the session was adjourned until 11a, tomorrow. Bill sails through Senate The PML-N-led coalition government on Monday succeeded in manouvering the passage of the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill through the Senate, securing a two-thirds majority with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines. The bill, seeking crucial changes to several articles of the Constitution mostly dealing with the judiciary and the military leadership, was presented before the upper house of Parliament for a final vote by Law Minister Tarar amid a noisy protest by opposition senators. As soon as Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani started putting up the bill for a clause-by-clause vote, the opposition senators started gathering in front of his dais and chanted anti-government slogans. They tore up copies of the bill and agenda and some of them were seen hurling the documents towards the law minister, prompting the sergeants-at-arm to make a human wall at the aisle between the treasury and the opposition benches to prevent any possible physical clash. After staying in the house for a few minutes, the opposition senators belonging to the PTI and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) staged a walkout from the house, providing the government with an opportunity to proceed smoothly. After holding a vote on the bill by division, Senate Chairman Gilani announced that the 27th Amendment bill had been passed with 64 votes, which is not less than a two-thirds majority in the 96-member house. After casting his vote against the party line, PTI’s Saifullah Abro announced his resignation from the house. Speaking on the floor, Senator Abro said he had “voted only for [Field Marshal] Gen Asim Munir”, adding that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by defeating India in the May war. He added that during the [passage of the] 26th Amen­dment, “my 10 family members were abducted, but my party [PTI] did not come to the rescue. Interestingly, when he tendered his resignation, Senate Chairman Gilani said, “We will make you a senator again”. Meanwhile, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. Changes in the bill During yesterday’s Senate session, PPP Senator Farooq Naek presented the final report on the bill, approved by the standing committees on the law and justice of the two houses, highlighting three to four changes that had been suggested by members. About the changes incorporated into the bill on recommendation of the parliamentary committees, Senator Naek said the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) would have equal representation of all provinces besides a representative from the Islamabad High Court. He said the initial draft of the bill stated a judge having served for seven years in the high court could be nominated for the FCC, but this qualification merit has been curtailed to five years on the recommendation. Moreover, he said, the committees agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. On the other hand, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. However, he added, if multiple judges would take the oath the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age. Also, the parliamentary committees suggested a change in the nomination for the reconstituted Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), he said. The 26th Amendment had authorised the speaker to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate for the JCP, he explained. However, the committees proposed that the nominee should be a technocrat, he added. The PPP senator said the suo motu powers of judges had not been taken away, but the court would exercise these powers only when an application was submitted. “The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed,” he said. The PPP senator, who was part of the committee that examined the initial draft of the bill, said that an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided under Article 199 of the Constitution. Since this created a huge backlog, the amendment suggested that interim order would be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made, he explained. Referring to the procedure of judges’ transfer, Mr Naek said previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, the President could transfer judges with their consent and after consultation with the chief justices of both relevant high courts. However, this procedure has been amended, he said. “Now a judge refusing his transfer would be given an opportunity of presenting his reasons for the decline before the JCP. And if the JCP finds the reasons invalid, he would have to retire,” the senator explained. About the provision of lifetime immunity to the president from facing criminal trial or arrest under Article 248, he said it was suggested that this immunity would not be available if the President holds a public office after the end of his term, but as soon as he ceases that public office he would again be entitled to this immunity. According to a proposed amendment in Article 243, this type of lifetime immunity has also been provided to the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the navy.",

      "title_orig": "Modi vows not to spare those behind New Delhi car blast",
      "summary_orig": "Indian police are investigating a deadly car blast in New Delhi under a law used to fight “terrorism”, an officer said on Tuesday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to bring to justice all those responsible. The explosion near the historic Red Fort on Monday evening killed at least eight people and injured 20. It was the first such blast in the heavily guarded city of more than 30 million since 2011. “Today, I have come to Bhutan with a very heavy heart,” Modi said in Thimphu, the capital of the neighbouring Himalayan nation, as he arrived on Tuesday for a scheduled visit. “The horrific incident that happened in Delhi last evening has deeply disturbed everyone,” Modi told a public meeting. “Our agencies will get to the very bottom of this conspiracy. The conspirators behind this will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice.” New Delhi’s deputy chief fire officer A.K. Malik told AFP shortly after the explosion that eight people had been killed. The Press Trust of India news agency reported on Tuesday that the death toll had risen to 12, although that figure has not been confirmed. Home Minister Amit Shah told reporters late on Monday that security forces were “keeping all angles open”, adding that it was “very difficult to say what caused the incident” until forensic samples had been analysed. The blast, if confirmed as an attack, would be the first significant security incident since April 22, when 26 mainly Hindu civilians were killed at the tourist site of Pahalgam in India-occupied Kashmir. India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also vowed today that those responsible for a deadly car explosion will face justice. “The country’s leading investigative agencies are conducting a swift and thorough inquiry into the incident — findings of the investigation will soon be made public,” Singh told a conference in New Delhi. “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice, and will not be spared under any circumstances.” The defence minister said agencies were carrying out a swift, thorough investigation, with the findings to be made public soon. Crime scene investigators scoured through the wreckage of a car early on Tuesday, hours after the intense explosion. Security was increased across New Delhi as both forensic and anti-terrorism agencies searched for evidence. Deputy Commissioner of Police Raja Banthia said Delhi police had registered a case under the anti-terrorism law, as well as the Explosives Act and other criminal laws. The law, called the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, is India’s main anti-terrorism law. It is used to investigate and prosecute acts related to “terrorism” and activities that threaten the sovereignty and integrity of the country. “Investigation is at a preliminary stage and any comment on it will be too premature,” Banthia told reporters. Near the site of the blast in the city’s old quarters, a busy market and tourist area, most shops that shut soon after the explosion were yet to open in the early hours of Tuesday. Forensic experts were seen scouring the site of the blast, which has been sealed since Monday night and enclosed in white cloth barriers. Security personnel and a member of the forensic team work at the site of an explosion near the historic Red Fort in the old quarters of Delhi, India, on Nov 11, 2025. — Reuters Delhi Metro said the Red Fort station had been shut for security reasons.\nPolice said a slow-moving car, which stopped at a traffic signal, exploded just before 7pm (6:30pm PKT). Nearby vehicles were also badly damaged. The explosion left behind mangled bodies and the wreckage of several cars on a congested street near a metro station in the old quarter of Delhi. There was no immediate information on the occupants of the car, who were presumed to have been killed. Police said they were tracing the owner of the car. Relatives of the victims gathered outside the nearby Lok Nayak hospital to identify the bodies of their loved ones. “We at least know that my cousin is here, whether he is injured or not or the extent of his injury, we don’t know anything,” said a distressed relative who did not want to be named. Before leaving for his state visit to Bhutan, Modi offered his “condolences to those who have lost their loved ones in the blast in Delhi”. “I understand the pain of the families. The whole nation stands with them,” he said. The Red Fort is one of India’s most well-known landmarks. Prime ministers address the nation from its ramparts on Independence Day, and its striking features appear on India’s largest banknote. ‘People were burning’ Eyewitnesses described to AFP how the car exploded in traffic and how people caught up in the surge of flames were set on fire. “I saw the car explode while it was moving,” said Dharmindra Dhaga, 27. “People were on fire and we tried to save them … Cars and people were burning — people inside the cars were burning,” he said. “I was telling the public to save them, rescue them, and get them out. The public was busy making videos and taking photos.” The emergency ward at Delhi’s LNJP hospital was chaotic after the explosion as wounded people streamed in and doctors rushed to treat them. A woman broke down outside the ward where her husband was being treated. “I can’t bear to see him like that,” she said as her brother tried to console her. The last significant attack in the Indian capital was in September 2011, when a bomb hidden in a briefcase ripped through a crowd outside New Delhi’s High Court , killing at least 14 people.",

      "summary_en": "Indian police are investigating a deadly car blast in New Delhi under a law used to fight “terrorism”, an officer said on Tuesday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to bring to justice all those responsible. The explosion near the historic Red Fort on Monday evening killed at least eight people and injured 20. It was the first such blast in the heavily guarded city of more than 30 million since 2011. “Today, I have come to Bhutan with a very heavy heart,” Modi said in Thimphu, the capital of the neighbouring Himalayan nation, as he arrived on Tuesday for a scheduled visit. “The horrific incident that happened in Delhi last evening has deeply disturbed everyone,” Modi told a public meeting. “Our agencies will get to the very bottom of this conspiracy. The conspirators behind this will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice.” New Delhi’s deputy chief fire officer A.K. Malik told AFP shortly after the explosion that eight people had been killed. The Press Trust of India news agency reported on Tuesday that the death toll had risen to 12, although that figure has not been confirmed. Home Minister Amit Shah told reporters late on Monday that security forces were “keeping all angles open”, adding that it was “very difficult to say what caused the incident” until forensic samples had been analysed. The blast, if confirmed as an attack, would be the first significant security incident since April 22, when 26 mainly Hindu civilians were killed at the tourist site of Pahalgam in India-occupied Kashmir. India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also vowed today that those responsible for a deadly car explosion will face justice. “The country’s leading investigative agencies are conducting a swift and thorough inquiry into the incident — findings of the investigation will soon be made public,” Singh told a conference in New Delhi. “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice, and will not be spared under any circumstances.” The defence minister said agencies were carrying out a swift, thorough investigation, with the findings to be made public soon. Crime scene investigators scoured through the wreckage of a car early on Tuesday, hours after the intense explosion. Security was increased across New Delhi as both forensic and anti-terrorism agencies searched for evidence. Deputy Commissioner of Police Raja Banthia said Delhi police had registered a case under the anti-terrorism law, as well as the Explosives Act and other criminal laws.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that Kabul must understand that lasting peace could only be achieved by reining in terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil. “Afghanistan must understand that lasting peace can only be realised by reining in Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory,” Shehbaz said while addressing the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference in Islamabad. In his remarks, the premier said that the theme of the conference, “Peace, Security and Development”, could not be more timely and relevant. He added that the theme was particularly resonant for Pakistan, saying that the country had always advocated for peace through dialogue and diplomacy. “We firmly believe that peace and security form the foundation of sustainable national and regional development,” he said. “The true value of peace is most profoundly understood when we are confronted with the conflicts that continue to plague our world,” he said. The premier especially called attention to the recent border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, calling Islamabad’s response “firm and decisive, teaching an unforgettable lesson”. He also deeply appreciated the efforts of Turkiye and Qatar in facilitating peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban regime. “A peaceful Afghanistan holds the key to regional connectivity, peace, and prosperity,” he said. “This peace has remained elusive for decades. However, Pakistan has never lost hope. We believe in a peaceful neighbourhood and have been striving hard for this purpose,” he asserted. He regretted that terrorist groups continued to “imperil peace”, both within Afghanistan and outside it. The premier also talked about the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. “In May, Pakistan faced unprovoked aggression from the eastern front. Our armed forces displayed remarkable preparedness and performed outstandingly on the battlefield,” he said. “Having won the war, we need to win peace, through sincere and honest efforts,” Shehbaz said. He added that Pakistan’s commitment to upholding peace and security was manifested by its constructive role at diplomatic forums including the United Nations ( UN ), Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ), Economic Cooperation Organisation ( ECO ) and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ). The prime minister’s remarks come days after a third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif insisted that the negotiations were “over” and had “entered an indefinite phase”. The defence minister also said that the fragile ceasefire agreed between the two countries stood for the time being but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”. Meanwhile, three top Turkish officials are due in Islamabad this week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkiye and Qatar have been acting as mediators between Islamabad and Kabul following an escalation of tensions between the two neighbours over the past weeks.",
