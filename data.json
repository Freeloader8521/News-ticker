An emergency was imposed in all government hospitals across the province on the directives of Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar and Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman. Kakar was supervising the provision of medical treatment to those “injured in the Quetta firing”, a statement from the provincial health department said. The health minister directed Quetta Trauma Centre Managing Director Dr Arbab Kamran and Quetta Civil Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Abdul Hadi Kakar to ensure the “immediate” provision of medical facilities. According to the statement, the operating theatres of the Quetta Trauma Centre and Civil Hospital have been put on alert, and additional doctors have been deployed.

      "summary_orig": "The executive director of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, revealed early on Saturday that the eye procedure of incarcerated former premier Imran Khan was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention. The video statement by the hospital’s head comes after the PTI approached the Supreme Court on Friday, seeking its assistance in arranging a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians, with the help of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP). Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had earlier confirmed that Imran underwent a “20-minute” medical procedure for an eye ailment on the night of January 24 at Pims in Islamabad. “It (the procedure) was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes. During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions and follow-up advice and documents,” said Sikander. The doctor said the former premier, aged 74, complained of “reduced vision in his right eye”, adding that a “qualified ophthalmologist” from the hospital conducted a “complete eye assessment at Adiala jail”. Sikander elaborated that the doctor dispatched to the prison conducted “strict lab examination, [ocular] endoscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, essential laboratory tests and OCT of the retina”. He added that based on the initial assessment, the diagnosis of right central vein occlusion was made and a hospital-based treatment was recommended. “Accordingly, Mr Niazi was brought to Pims on the night of last Saturday, Sunday for the advised procedure.” The head of the hospital said Imran, after arrival at Pims, was “explained in full” about the procedure. “Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure. The procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocol and monitoring,” said Dr Sikander. Imran’s eye condition and ‘secret transfer’ to Pims On January 28, the PTI said had raised concerns about Imran’s health, saying it had learned through credible reports that he had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye, which could cause permanent eyesight damage if not treated promptly. The party had alleged that the jail administration was insisting that the treatment be provided inside the prison, contrary to a medical expert’s advice to take him to a hospital. The next day, a report , quoting a senior doctor at Pims, said Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on the night of January 24 for a medical procedure, which was “completed when the time reached in the A.M.”. The doctor said there was “extraordinary movement” on Saturday night, and the operation theatres and the anaesthesia room were cordoned off ahead of Imran’s arrival at Pims. On Thursday, the information minister confirmed that the PTI founder underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment at Pims on the night of January 24. He said it was a “20-minute” procedure and that the ex-premier was “absolutely healthy”. Subsequently, the PTI condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians. The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also termed Imran’s transfer to the hospital without the knowledge of his family and personal physicians a “criminal negligence”. Imran’s sister, Noreen Niazi, who had earlier raised doubts about his brother’s ailment, reiterated concerns that his family and lawyers were not being kept informed and demanded that his medical reports be made public. Then on Friday, the PTI staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court, following which it said the ex-premier’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States on Friday approved multibillion-dollar weapons sales to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, at a point of high tensions with Iran. The State Department said it green-lighted a $3.8-billion sale of 30 Apache attack helicopters to Israel, which has agreed to a fragile ceasefire in Gaza. “The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability,” the State Department said in a statement. “This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” it said. Also in the package was a $1.8 billion sale of joint light tactical vehicles. The United States sends billions of dollars worth of military supplies per year to Israel, largely in aid rather than sales. Israel and Hamas reached a US-backed ceasefire in October that largely paused two years of war. Tensions are high elsewhere in the region as the United States deploys a major military contingent in waters near Iran. The State Department also approved a $9-billion sale to Saudi Arabia for 730 Patriot missiles, which are used to defend against incoming attacks. Israel last year carried out a major bombing campaign against nuclear and other military sites in Iran. Iran has faced growing pressure after major protests against the clerical state, which has responded by killing thousands of protesters. Saudi Arabia has voiced caution about an attack on Iran as Gulf monarchies fear instability that could jeopardise their reputation as business havens. The Trump administration has said that the Gaza ceasefire is now in its second phase, with a focus on disarming Hamas. Earlier in November, US President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia was being designated as a “ major, non-Nato ally ”. The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. The White House also announced the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the Kingdom, however, the jets will be less advanced than those operated by Israel, in line with a US law that guarantees Israel’s military edge in the region.",

      "summary_orig": "WHILE the US continues to mull a new attack against Iran, it is welcome that the upper echelons of the Pakistani state have made clear their stance against aggression targeting the neighbouring country. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Thursday, reaffirming the need for “sustained dialogue and diplomatic engagement” at this critical time. The foreign ministers of both states also had a phone conversation, with Ishaq Dar emphasising that diplomacy was “the only viable way forward”. Meanwhile, a Foreign Office statement correctly pointed out that “this region cannot afford war”, adding that Pakistan opposes “the use of force … against Iran” as well as interference in Iran’s internal affairs. Pakistan’s stance is in line with the regional consensus, as previously both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have stated that their soil and facilities will not be used against the Islamic Republic. Turkiye is similarly ramping up diplomatic efforts; the Turkish foreign minister hosted his Iranian counterpart on Friday in an effort to prevent the march towards a new, devastating regional war. Pakistan has a long border with Iran, and any instability in the region will directly affect this country. While there have been ups and downs, the Pakistan-Iran relationship has been largely cordial. Along with a joint frontier, both nations share historical, cultural and spiritual ties. Moreover, Pakistan has displayed moral clarity by opposing foreign intervention against a sovereign state. The Gulf monarchies are similarly wary of the fallouts of an American attack, mainly because senior Iranian officials have said US bases in the region will be targeted if Iran is attacked. However, there are media reports that suggest the Americans are trying to pressure Riyadh into quietly acquiescing to a US attack. The Saudi defence minister is currently in Washington. The US should abandon its threatening posture against Iran and come to the table while respecting Iran’s sovereignty. The Iranians say they have drawn lessons from last year’s US-Israeli aggression, and will hit back harder. Hence, the American presumption that this will be a short, clean campaign is erroneous; any war will be bloody and incredibly destructive for the global economy. Yet Iran must also make efforts to address the legitimate grievances of its people and improve the rights situation, though any change must be internal, and not orchestrated from abroad.

ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric emphasised that while recent prisoner exchanges allowed families to mourn or reunite, the civilian population remains in a desperate struggle for survival against harsh winter conditions and devastated infrastructure in the besieged territory. “States must harness the momentum generated by the first phase of the agreement between Israel and Hamas to urgently improve the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza,” Spoljaric said. For the past 15 weeks, the ICRC has worked with mediators to facilitate the return of prisoners and the remains of the deceased. Israeli kills three more Palestinians in Gaza However, Spoljaric stressed that humanitarian steps are irreplaceable on the path to peace. She explicitly called on Israel to ease its blockade on so-called “dual-use” materials — such as water pipes and generators — which remain essential for restoring basic services. “Many people in Gaza are still living in the rubble without basic services, struggling to stay warm amid harsh winter conditions,” Spoljaric said. Rafah partial reopening Following months of pleading from humanitarian organisations and Palestinians, Israel announced on Friday that it would reopen the Rafah crossing on the southern border with Egypt this Sunday on Feb 1. The crossing, a vital lifeline for aid, has been shuttered by Israeli forces since they seized control of the area. Israel said the crossing would open for the “limited movement” under the supervision of a European Union mission. Earlier, Hamas demanded the reopening of Rafah and the entry of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza in the territory.

      "summary_orig": "• Erdogan offers to help ease Tehran-Washington tensions • Trump softens threats, suggests openness to dialogue • UK PM Starmer, allies working to block Iran’s nuclear ambitions ISTANBUL: Turkiye intensified a diplomatic push to mediate between Tehran and Washington on Friday as US President Donald Trump appeared to cool his threats of a strike, though Iran warned that its missile capabilities would “never” be on the negotiating table. Turkish President Re­cep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan led regional efforts to de-escalate tensions that have soared since the US moved military assets to the Middle East following a deadly crackdown on protests in Iran. While the Pentagon said the military remained ready, Trump lowered the temperature late on Thursday, stating he hoped to avoid conflict and that talks were possible. Speaking during a visit to Turkiye, Iranian For­eign Minister Abbas Araghchi welcomed the potential for dialogue but drew a hard line regarding national defence. “I want to state firmly that Iran’s defensive and missile capabilities will never be subject to negotiation,” Araghchi said, adding that his country had no current plans to meet US officials. Araghchi emphasised that Tehran was “ready to begin negotiations if they take place on an equal footing, based on mutual interests and mutual respect.” Erdogan spoke by ph­one with Iranian President Masoud Pezes­hkian on Friday, telling his counterpart that Turkiye was “ready to assume a facilitating role between Iran and the United States to de-escalate the tensions”. Standing alongside Araghchi at a press conference in Istanbul, Fidan said restarting talks over Iran’s nuclear program was “vital for reducing regional tensions”. He urged Washington to “act with common sense” and resist pressure from Israel, which he said was pushing for a US attack. Fidan also noted he had held discussions with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and would keep lines open to prevent Iran’s isolation. Despite the diplomatic overtures, significant hurdles remain. The Axios reported on Monday that US officials said any deal must include a cap on Tehran’s long-range missile stockpile, the removal of enriched uranium, and a ban on independent enrichment. Meanwhile, international pressure on Tehran continues to mount. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the BBC on Friday that preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons was “hugely important.” While stopping short of explicitly supporting a US strike, Starmer condemned the “grotesque” repression of demonstrators. The European Union also urged against military action but condemned the crackdown by designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a “terrorist organisation”. Tehran quickly criticised the move. Iran’s judiciary chief called the designation “hostile”, warning that Europe “will suffer the consequences of their foolish act”. Araghchi echoed the sentiment in Istanbul, labelling the designation a mistake and describing Europe as a “continent in decline”. While diplomatic channels remain active, military readiness continues. Israel’s Ynet news website reported Friday that a US Navy destroyer had docked at the Israeli port of Eilat. Araghchi told reporters that while Iran has “never sought war,” it remains prepared for any scenario. “Iran has no problem with negotiations, but negotiations cannot take place under the shadow of threats,” Araghchi said. “They must certainly set aside their threats and change their approach toward a fair and equitable negotiation, as Mr Trump himself said in his post.” Pezeshkian, in a call with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, reinforced that success depended on the “abandonment of belligerent and threatening actions,” warning that any aggression against Iran would “receive an immediate and firm response”. Tensions initially spiked following protests that erupted in late December over economic grievances. The demonstrations faced a severe crackdown that peaked on Jan 8 and Jan 9. Iran has accused the United States and Israel of fuelling a “terrorist operation” that transformed peaceful rallies into “riots”. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) confirmed 6,479 people were killed in the demonstrations, including 6,092 protesters and 118 children. Internet restrictions imposed in early January continue to hinder information access. While rights groups estimate the toll is in the tens of thousands, Iranian authorities have acknowledged more than 3,000 deaths, claiming the majority were security forces or bystanders killed by rioters.

      "summary_orig": "After staging a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad, the PTI said on Friday that the family of incarcerated premier Imran Khan would be provided a copy of his medical report. PTI’s Salman Akram Raja made the remarks while speaking to the media outside the SC building, where the party, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, staged a day-long sit-in in an effort to facilitate a meeting between Imran and his personal physicians. The development comes a day after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed that Imran underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment last week at a hospital in Islamabad. According to the minister, the former premier was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24. Speaking outside the SC premises on Friday evening, Raja said, “As you know, we have been outside the SC building all day.” Afridi and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas were also present alongside Raja. He said PTI lawmakers were also present at the sit-in, adding that a similar sit-in was staged outside Adiala jail on Thursday night that lasted till 3am on Friday. “There is nothing more important for us than Imran Khan sahib’s health,” he said. He added that the reports that had emerged about the ex-premier’s health were “unsatisfactory”. He said that Imran was taken to a hospital, without the family’s knowledge. “And then lies are told. For five days, they say that no such incident has happened,” he said. Raja said that he had held conversations with the chief justice of Pakistan, his staff and the attorney general for Pakistan all day. However, he said that whatever was “achieved” after their day-long efforts was “unsatisfactory”. “It has been said that Imran Khan sahib’s medical reports — what happened in Pims hospital, the diagnosis in jail before that — that report will be given to Imran Khan sahib in a sealed envelope. And a copy of that report will be given to family, meaning his sisters, today,” he said. He said that this would now show what the doctors had diagnosed Imran with and what medical procedure was carried out. “When this report comes in front of us, then the family will decide whether the medical treatment being provided is satisfactory or not,” he said. He said that the decisions about further treatment would also be made by the family. However, he said that the “real matter” was that Imran was wrongly arrested, calling for him to be released. He said that the party would continue to protest for Imran’s visitation rights. He said that to decide the future course of strategy, the party’s political committee would meet later in the day. He said that the political party would also speak to the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai, respectively. “So with their consultation, the PTI’s political party will decide the future course of action. We do not accept this current situation. Reciving the medical report is necessary,” he said. However, no future course of action as such emerged after the PTI’s political party met with the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leadership. In a video statement released after the meeting, Achakzai said that the opposition considered reports about Imran’s health a “diversion” from the nationwide protest announced for Feb 8. “I can say for certain that Imran Khan’s health is not as bad as it is being portrayed. Propaganda is being carried out,” he said. He called on the TTAP parties and the PTI to not back away from their “mission”, calling on the nation to participate in the Feb 8 protest. PTI camps outside SC Earlier in the day, PTI workers and lawmakers had camped outside the apex court. The KP chief minister had reached the SC in the morning, after a sit-in outside Adiala jail, which had continued into the early hours of Friday. He had left for a short period of time to offer Friday prayer at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, before returning to the SC premises. Later, Senate opposition leader Abbas also joined the sit-in. Speaking to the media during the day, Afridi said, “The whole nation is concerned about the health of the country’s most popular leader, Imran Khan.” He had stated that he would try to arrange a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians with the help of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP). The KP chief executive said the party would announce its future course of action if its attempts to arrange a meeting with Imran did not bear fruit. He had also lamented that while the courts were issuing decisions on petitions, “we are not getting justice”. “Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi’s cases have not been listed for one year. If the cases are listed today and we are provided justice, Khan sahib and Bushra Bibi, along with other leaders, will be released from prison within half an hour,” he claimed. “We were left with no option, so we opted for the only one available,” he added. In response to a question on concluding the protest outside Adiala jail, where the KP chief minister, along with other lawmakers and party workers, had camped, he said, “I have come here.” PTI leaders meet AGP Following their arrival at the SC, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and party leader and lawmaker Sardar Latif Khosa had met the registrar of the apex court and the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP). During the meeting, Raja and Khosa had expressed the party’s concern regarding Imran’s eye ailment and requested that the medical report of the doctor who treated the former premier be provided. Addressing the media outside, Khosa said he reminded the registrar and the attorney general of Pakistan that the CJP should promote good practices before he retired as “this (Imran’s case) is not only a human rights issue, but he (Imran) is also being deprived of his basic rights.” “He (CJP) has taken an oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of the basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said. Khosa claimed that the procedure of retina rupture did not last “20-minutes” as shared by the information minister, but “it is 2.5 hours”. He said Imran’s health was PTI’s “red line” and any matter related to his health “will not be tolerated at any cost”. “This is his legal and constitutional right,” added Khosa. “I told the registrar to share our concerns with the CJP,” he said. Khosa also said that Imran was being deprived of his basic rights. “He (CJP) has taken oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said. ‘Secrecy is cancer to democracy’ PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan and party leader Babar Awan also addressed the media on Friday at KP House, saying that the “one-point agenda” for the press conference was Imran’s health. Referring to the former prime minister’s brief stay at Islamabad’s Pims hospital , he said, “Secrecy is cancer to democracy. His (Imran Khan’s) family is worried due to his health.” Gohar demanded that doctors from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be allowed to examine the former prime minister. “Dr Faisal and Dr Asim should be allowed to meet Khan sahib .” The party chairman added that neither the party nor Imran’s family was informed about his health or treatment. Awan, addressing the media, said if the report regarding Imran’s health is not made public, “it will have grave consequences” and added that the party and its supporters were anxious regarding the former premier’s health.

He said PTI lawmakers were also present at the sit-in, adding that a similar sit-in was staged outside Adiala jail on Thursday night that lasted till 3am on Friday. “There is nothing more important for us than Imran Khan sahib’s health,” he said. He added that the reports that had emerged about the ex-premier’s health were “unsatisfactory”. He said that Imran was taken to a hospital, without the family’s knowledge. “And then lies are told. For five days, they say that no such incident has happened,” he said. Raja said that he had held conversations with the chief justice of Pakistan, his staff and the attorney general for Pakistan all day. However, he said that whatever was “achieved” after their day-long efforts was “unsatisfactory”. “It has been said that Imran Khan sahib’s medical reports — what happened in Pims hospital, the diagnosis in jail before that — that report will be given to Imran Khan sahib in a sealed envelope. And a copy of that report will be given to family, meaning his sisters, today,” he said. He said that this would now show what the doctors had diagnosed Imran with and what medical procedure was carried out. “When this report comes in front of us, then the family will decide whether the medical treatment being provided is satisfactory or not,” he said. He said that the decisions about further treatment would also be made by the family. However, he said that the “real matter” was that Imran was wrongly arrested, calling for him to be released. He said that the party would continue to protest for Imran’s visitation rights. He said that to decide the future course of strategy, the party’s political committee would meet later in the day. He said that the political party would also speak to the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai, respectively. “So with their consultation, the PTI’s political party will decide the future course of action. We do not accept this current situation. Reciving the medical report is necessary,” he said. However, no future course of action as such emerged after the PTI’s political party met with the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leadership. In a video statement released after the meeting, Achakzai said that the opposition considered reports about Imran’s health a “diversion” from the nationwide protest announced for Feb 8. “I can say for certain that Imran Khan’s health is not as bad as it is being portrayed. Propaganda is being carried out,” he said. He called on the TTAP parties and the PTI to not back away from their “mission”, calling on the nation to participate in the Feb 8 protest. PTI camps outside SC Earlier in the day, PTI workers and lawmakers had camped outside the apex court. The KP chief minister had reached the SC in the morning, after a sit-in outside Adiala jail, which had continued into the early hours of Friday. He had left for a short period of time to offer Friday prayer at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, before returning to the SC premises. Later, Senate opposition leader Abbas also joined the sit-in. Speaking to the media during the day, Afridi said, “The whole nation is concerned about the health of the country’s most popular leader, Imran Khan.” He had stated that he would try to arrange a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians with the help of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP). The KP chief executive said the party would announce its future course of action if its attempts to arrange a meeting with Imran did not bear fruit. He had also lamented that while the courts were issuing decisions on petitions, “we are not getting justice”. “Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi’s cases have not been listed for one year. If the cases are listed today and we are provided justice, Khan sahib and Bushra Bibi, along with other leaders, will be released from prison within half an hour,” he claimed. “We were left with no option, so we opted for the only one available,” he added. In response to a question on concluding the protest outside Adiala jail, where the KP chief minister, along with other lawmakers and party workers, had camped, he said, “I have come here.” PTI leaders meet AGP Following their arrival at the SC, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and party leader and lawmaker Sardar Latif Khosa had met the registrar of the apex court and the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP). During the meeting, Raja and Khosa had expressed the party’s concern regarding Imran’s eye ailment and requested that the medical report of the doctor who treated the former premier be provided. Addressing the media outside, Khosa said he reminded the registrar and the attorney general of Pakistan that the CJP should promote good practices before he retired as “this (Imran’s case) is not only a human rights issue, but he (Imran) is also being deprived of his basic rights.” “He (CJP) has taken an oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of the basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said. Khosa claimed that the procedure of retina rupture did not last “20-minutes” as shared by the information minister, but “it is 2.5 hours”. He said Imran’s health was PTI’s “red line” and any matter related to his health “will not be tolerated at any cost”. “This is his legal and constitutional right,” added Khosa. “I told the registrar to share our concerns with the CJP,” he said. Khosa also said that Imran was being deprived of his basic rights. “He (CJP) has taken oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said. ‘Secrecy is cancer to democracy’ PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan and party leader Babar Awan also addressed the media on Friday at KP House, saying that the “one-point agenda” for the press conference was Imran’s health. Referring to the former prime minister’s brief stay at Islamabad’s Pims hospital , he said, “Secrecy is cancer to democracy. His (Imran Khan’s) family is worried due to his health.” Gohar demanded that doctors from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be allowed to examine the former prime minister. “Dr Faisal and Dr Asim should be allowed to meet Khan sahib .” The party chairman added that neither the party nor Imran’s family was informed about his health or treatment. Awan, addressing the media, said if the report regarding Imran’s health is not made public, “it will have grave consequences” and added that the party and its supporters were anxious regarding the former premier’s health.

      "title_orig": "Trump brands Minneapolis nurse killed by federal agents an ‘agitator’",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump walked back his conciliatory tone on Friday after outrage over the killings of two American citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents, branding one of them, Alex Pretti, an “agitator.” Footage shared online this week reportedly showed intensive care nurse Pretti in a scuffle with federal agents 11 days before he was shot dead on Saturday by officers enforcing an immigration crackdown. The White House has scrambled to stem widespread outrage over Pretti’s killing, which came weeks after Renee Good, another US citizen and mother of three, was fatally shot by agents in the same city. Trump claimed he wanted to “de-escalate a little bit” in the fallout of the killings and appointed a new point man in Minneapolis, border chief Tom Homan, who said on Thursday that some federal agents could be withdrawn from the city after weeks of protests against immigration raids. On Friday, the US president said Pretti, 37, was an “agitator and, perhaps, insurrectionist,” on his Truth Social platform. “Alex Pretti’s stock has gone way down with the just released video of him screaming and spitting in the face of a very calm and under control ICE Officer,” Trump wrote, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. The video reportedly shows Pretti kicking the taillight of the federal agents’ car, before they emerge and tackle him to the ground. AFP could not immediately verify the footage. Government shutdown Backlash over the deaths of Pretti and Good has landed in Congress, with the Senate edging closer to a vote on Friday on a funding deal to avert a government shutdown over the crisis. Democrats have drawn a red line around funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), demanding it be stripped out and renegotiated to impose new constraints on immigration enforcement agencies. Meanwhile, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman urged more tech figures to “speak out” on Thursday against the Trump administration’s “excesses” after the killings, which have had a global impact. “We in Silicon Valley can’t bend the knee to Trump. We can’t shrink away and just hope the crisis will fade,” Hoffman wrote in an opinion piece Thursday in The San Francisco Standard. Trump held a cabinet meeting that same day, but the Minnesota unrest did not come up while reporters were in the room, and he did not call on Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem when asking some officials to give remarks. Trump sent Homan to Minnesota to take control of immigration operations with orders to report directly to him, effectively sidelining Noem. Improvements needed Homan said at his first news conference in the Minnesota city on Thursday that “certain improvements could and should be made,” a marked difference from his predecessor Greg Bovino, who was removed. He urged Minnesotans to avoid “hateful rhetoric” against federal immigration officers. He said his staff was “working on a drawdown plan” for some of the more than 3,000 federal agents who have been taking part in “Operation Metro Surge.” One such measure, for example, would be notifying ICE agents about the release dates of incarcerated migrants considered “criminal public safety risks” so they could be detained by the agency, he said. “This is commonsense cooperation that allows us to draw down on the number of people we have here,” Homan said. Steven Gagner, a 41-year-old jewelry designer and “citizen observer” in Minneapolis, was skeptical about the drawdown. “This administration has proven time and time again that they just lie to us and they do not really hold themselves or anyone else accountable,” he told AFP . The two agents involved in Pretti’s shooting have been placed on leave, and Homan said any federal agents who breach standards of conduct “will be dealt with”.",

Trump held a cabinet meeting that same day, but the Minnesota unrest did not come up while reporters were in the room, and he did not call on Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem when asking some officials to give remarks. Trump sent Homan to Minnesota to take control of immigration operations with orders to report directly to him, effectively sidelining Noem. Improvements needed Homan said at his first news conference in the Minnesota city on Thursday that “certain improvements could and should be made,” a marked difference from his predecessor Greg Bovino, who was removed. He urged Minnesotans to avoid “hateful rhetoric” against federal immigration officers. He said his staff was “working on a drawdown plan” for some of the more than 3,000 federal agents who have been taking part in “Operation Metro Surge.” One such measure, for example, would be notifying ICE agents about the release dates of incarcerated migrants considered “criminal public safety risks” so they could be detained by the agency, he said. “This is commonsense cooperation that allows us to draw down on the number of people we have here,” Homan said. Steven Gagner, a 41-year-old jewelry designer and “citizen observer” in Minneapolis, was skeptical about the drawdown. “This administration has proven time and time again that they just lie to us and they do not really hold themselves or anyone else accountable,” he told AFP . The two agents involved in Pretti’s shooting have been placed on leave, and Homan said any federal agents who breach standards of conduct “will be dealt with”.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A local court in Islamabad has expunged a controversial observation regarding “terrorist states” from the verdict that sent lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her spouse, Hadi Ali Chattha, to prison in the social media posts case, official sources told Dawn . Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka removed the observation from the judgment and forwarded the amended version to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) registrar earlier this week in a sealed envelope, a senior court official confirmed. Sources said the judge had dictated the judgment to his stenographer, and during the first reading, expressly directed that the paragraph containing the observation be deleted. However, the stenographer inadvertently retained the paragraph and resubmitted the judgment, which was signed by the judge later in the evening. The issue came to light after the prosecution pointed out the paragraph and moved an application seeking its deletion. The judge subsequently expunged the observation, placed a corrected copy on the judicial record, and dispatched another sealed copy to the IHC registrar. According to sources, disciplinary proceedings have also been initiated against the stenographer, who has been served a show-cause notice. The deleted observation appeared in para 36 on page 18 of the verdict, where the court made remarks regarding the classification of certain countries as “terrorist states” while discussing the broader context of international conduct and security narratives. The paragraph had no direct nexus with the offences on trial, which related to alleged violations of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca). A day earlier, the Foreign Office distanced itself from the remarks , saying they did not reflect Pakistan’s policy and had no basis in international law. “We have seen the judgment. These are views of the learned judge,” Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said during a weekly media briefing, when asked about the conviction of Imaan and Hadi. “Pakistan, of course, does not subscribe to this opinion. This kind of designation of terrorist states does not exist either in UN parlance or under international law,” he added. Judge Majoka on Jan 24 convicted Imaan and Hadi under Peca for social media posts critical of state institutions. Both were sentenced to 17 years’ rigorous imprisonment each, along with heavy fines, over posts made between 2021 and 2025 that the court deemed anti-state.",
