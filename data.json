      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: As the TTAP’s sit-in entered its fifth day and the blocked routes to Parliament House were cleared, the party expressed hope on Tuesday that at least one family member of the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan or a party leader would be allowed to meet him today. The opposition on Monday decided to extend their sit-in, which began on Friday, for another day to “see the government’s response” to their demand for access to the former premier, whose health has recently been called into question by a medical report following his examination at the Adiala jail on Sunday. At around 5pm, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said the sit-in at Parliament House was continuing. Earlier in the day, TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai had told Dawn that as Tuesday was supposed to be a meeting day with Imran, two of the sit-in participants — Salman Akram Raja and Barrister Gohar Ali Khan — would be going to Adiala jail, as their names had been included in the list of those to meet the PTI founder. “Moreover, we are hoping that the meeting of all sisters or at least one of the family members will be allowed today,” he said. “It will end the rumours about the health of Imran Khan, as they will directly hear from him and will share Khan sahib ’s views regarding his health.” Responding to a question, Yousufzai said that the government should allow the meeting as it may help defuse the current tensions if the medical report regarding Imran was correct. “It is a fact that during the last two years we have been deceived a number of times, due to which the level of trust has been reduced,” he said. The spokesperson added that the family needed to meet Imran, after which the three sisters would hold a press conference. The spokesperson further said he met KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi last night, where it was decided to hold an evening meeting to determine the next course of action. “During the meeting, we will consider the next phase of our sit-in and movement,” he added. Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the Supreme Court’s (SC) intervention last week led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which quoted Imran as saying only 15 per cent vision was left in his right eye. This prompted a strong response from the opposition alliance, which began a sit-in at the Parliament House for the fulfilment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination. Meanwhile, another protest outside the Parliament Lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while KP CM Sohail Afridi led a demonstration at the KP House. Imran’s party, family ‘reject’ medical report Imran’s party and family have rejected the report issued by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday, sticking to their demand that he be taken to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital in the presence of his personal doctors. In a post on X, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram referred to the statement by Imran’s longtime personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf, who had spoken to the doctors currently treating the ex-prime minister. Akram noted that Dr Yusuf said “that he neither met Khan nor could he talk to him nor could he examine him or take care of him, therefore he can neither confirm nor deny” the report prepared. He stated that the PTI “rejects this report and strongly demands that Imran Khan sahib be immediately met by his family and personal physician and that he be immediately treated and examined at Al-Shifa International”. “To issue such a report by having doctors of one’s choice examine him shows that something is definitely being hidden and the only solution to avoid all this is to immediately have Imran Khan examined at Shifa International on the recommendation of his family and personal physician,” Akram contended. In her statement posted hours earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said: “We categorically REJECT all the medical reports circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan.” “[…] as Dr Asim Yousuf stated in his video, there is NO way for us to verify any of this,” she highlighted. “Now we are even more concerned and worried and our demand remains unchanged: Imran Khan must be urgently transferred to a proper medical facility (Shifa International Hospital Islamabad) where he shall be examined by qualified specialists under Dr Asim Yousuf’s supervision and in the presence of his family,” Aleema demanded. She added that she and others will be at the Adiala jail at 1:30pm today to attempt to meet Imran. “We expect the authorities to allow us to meet Imran Khan as this is his legal right. The family will also hold a press conference outside Adiala at 4pm after our meeting with Imran Khan,” the sister said.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: A Pakistani national was repatriated to his home country from India on Tuesday after spending 17 years in jail on charges of spying. “Muhammad Shahid Iqbal Bhatti, a Pakistani citizen imprisoned in India, was repatriated to Pakistan via the Wagah-Attari border today,” Pakistan’s High Commission in India said in a post on X. Separately, an official told Dawn that Bhatti was a resident of Kasur and was handed a 17-year sentence by an Indian court after he was accused of spying for Pakistan. Quoting Indian media reports , he said Bhatti was arrested in August 2008 by police in Indian Punjab. While in custody, he was interrogated for living in India allegedly without legal documents, the official said, adding that the then-chief manager of the State Bank of India had filed a complaint against him in November 2008. “Subsequently, Bhatti was sentenced by a court and sent to jail on charges of spying. He spent nearly 17 years of his life in prison,” the official said. He further said that as Bhatti’s prison term completed, Pakistani and Indian authorities held correspondence for his repatriation. “After the completion of legal formalities, he was escorted to the Wagah border, where he was handed over to Pakistani officials on Tuesday.” Meanwhile, Pakistan’s High Commission in India expressed its resolve to “continue to work towards the release and repatriation of all Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails”. Bhatti’s repatriation follows that of another three Pakistani prisoners from India in late November 2025. Among them, a man identified as Ramzan was arrested in 2010 by India on charges of illegally crossing the border and possessing narcotics. After receiving consular access, his status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in February 2011. Meanwhile, Muhammad Idrees from Narowal was arrested in 1995 for allegedly crossing the border illegally and was awarded 16 years of imprisonment. He was verified as a Pakistani national in 2005, 10 years after his arrest. Asghar Ali from Sadiqabad was arrested for allegedly crossing the border illegally in 2002. His status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in 2006.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday said the government did not want to “politicise” the matter of PTI founder Imran Khan’s health, while blaming the opposition for doing the same. The opposition, PTI and Imran’s family have voiced concerns over the former prime minister’s health after his eye ailment came to light late in January. Addressing the media in Lahore, Naqvi referred to the recent medical report prepared by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday. “The medical report also came forward yesterday and everything is clear as per it. Neither we nor the government want to politicise this,” he said, adding that there were certain “requests” which the authorities allowed but were not suitable to publicise at the moment. “Putting up such a show is extremely inappropriate, especially misleading people,” the minister said. “Still, we picked our best government and private doctors because it had been three days and the checkup had not taken place,” he insisted. Naqvi said he then invited PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan to reach Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday to witness Imran’s checkup but the former refused, citing party consultations. Detailing the communication between the authorities and the opposition, Naqvi said Gohar was given the time of 2:30pm. “We kept on waiting for an hour but Gohar sahib replied in the negative, that he has consulted with his party and would not be able to come.” “Our intention was that the checkup be performed in front of everyone,” he asserted, adding that the doctors were at the Adiala jail for about 1.25-1.5 hours for the examination. Naqvi stated that Gohar, along with the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders — Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — and their preferred doctors, was then invited to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad. There, the doctors who examined Imran briefed the opposition leaders as well as spoke on the phone to the “two doctors” named by the PTI, with each conversation lasting for about 45 minutes. “They asked each and everything,” Naqvi said about the PTI-recommended doctors. “Excellent. This is the best treatment. Even if we had to provide treatment, we would have done the same,” he quoted the doctors as saying. According to Naqvi, the opposition representatives also expressed satisfaction over the treatment and said they would inform their supporters about it. Asked about former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s claims that Naqvi made unmatched efforts for Imran’s release, the minister said, “One thing, which is not new, is that I have believed from the first day that dialogue is the solution to everything. “This is not my personal opinion; the prime minister has also said what I say, and we are following those instructions. […] If you ask about my personal view, I always say talks are the [answer],” he said. Responding to another question, he said there were “sensible people” in every party and if they had been listened to, the “PTI would not have been in the current situation, nor would have done the May 9 things”. On whether any action was being taken against the former Adiala jail superintendent whom the PTI holds responsible for aggravating Imran’s health issue, Naqvi stated: “We will check with the Punjab government what they are doing on it. But they are on it.” ‘Politicians onboard but Aleema vetoed everything’ However, the minister claimed, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum told the PTI that the “issue would die down” if the opposition accepted the government’s arrangements. “The medical checkup could not take place for three days just because of her. On one hand, they claim to have great empathy, relation and everything. On the other hand, politics has been done to the utmost over this.” The interior minister then questioned why roads were being blocked despite all the steps taken for Imran’s treatment. “If your intention was good, then you would have agreed on the first day. Almost all political leaders used to be on board but Aleema Khan sahiba vetoed them. She used to reject everything,” Naqvi said. “The problem is they want to cash this matter,” he contended. During his media talk, Naqvi recalled how the issue of Imran’s eye ailment came to light after the government confirmed that the PTI founder was taken to Pims for a minor procedure. He noted that the treatment was merely an injection that needed to be administered. The minister pointed out that “as a precaution, so there are no germs”, Imran was taken to the hospital, even though doctors suggested it could be done in jail. “I will tell you very clearly that when any prisoner needs treatment, it is our duty,” he affirmed, questioning whether all thousands of prisoners were accorded the same facilities as Imran was being provided. The interior minister said he believed that journalists should be provided with a tour of prisons so they could witness the facilities available there. Naqvi quipped that if the aim was political vendetta, then the first step would be to adopt a strict demeanour and restrict their facilities to what is provided to an ordinary prisoner as per the jail manual. On the topic of the ongoing road blockades due to PTI protests, the minister said: “Our duty is to tell people to be aware of whatever cells in your party that are doing this; they are enemies of your people that have different objectives and want to do their own politics. “[…] It is now clear to me about at least some individuals that they are more worried about their politics than his (Imran’s) health.” The interior minister affirmed that the government would ensure the implementation of the recent Peshawar High Court (PHC) order that has directed the KP government and its police to reopen the roads. Demand for 1-week hospital admission Recalling previous contacts between the government and the opposition with the mediation of NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Naqvi asserted: “We made one thing very clear that in the matter of treatment, we will provide whatever facility is available to any incarcerated person as per the Constitution and the law.” He stated that the government had sought the name of a “non-political” eye specialist for examining Imran, but the other side refused and insisted on a family member accompanying the doctor, which was also agreed to. “I am saying all this as it is on record and you can ask the PTI leaders about this,” the minister affirmed. He further said that the name of Kasim, who he said was a cousin, was also given by the party to come along, which was allowed. “When both things had taken place, they said ‘no, not like this, you must admit him to a hospital for a week and we will not accept anything else’,” Naqvi claimed. The minister said the authorities would “100 per cent” have Imran hospitalised for “even two weeks” given that the doctors recommended it. “But if the doctors do not recommend, then how can we have him admitted?” he asked. “It is not possible that just on your recommendation we admit him to hospital for one week.”",

      "summary_en": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday said the government did not want to “politicise” the matter of PTI founder Imran Khan’s health, while blaming the opposition for doing the same. The opposition, PTI and Imran’s family have voiced concerns over the former prime minister’s health after his eye ailment came to light late in January. Addressing the media in Lahore, Naqvi referred to the recent medical report prepared by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday. “The medical report also came forward yesterday and everything is clear as per it. Neither we nor the government want to politicise this,” he said, adding that there were certain “requests” which the authorities allowed but were not suitable to publicise at the moment. “Putting up such a show is extremely inappropriate, especially misleading people,” the minister said. “Still, we picked our best government and private doctors because it had been three days and the checkup had not taken place,” he insisted.

      "summary_orig": "Long overshadowed by his parents and heir to one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, the country’s new prime minister, Tarique Rahman has finally stepped into the spotlight. At 60, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) takes charge of the South Asian nation of 170 million, driven by what he calls an ambition to “do better”. A year-and-a-half after the deadly uprising that toppled previous prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s iron-fisted rule, the BNP won a “sweeping victory” in parliamentary elections on February 12. He was sworn in on Tuesday, leading a more than two-thirds majority in parliament. “This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy,” he said in a speech. His rise marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms. Widely known as Tarique Zia, he carries a political name that has shaped every stage of his life. He was 15 when his father, President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981. Tarique’s mother, Khaleda Zia — a three-time prime minister and a towering figure in Bangladeshi politics for decades — died aged 80 in December , just days after his return home. ‘My country’ Rahman, speaking to AFP just before the vote, vowed to build on their legacy. “They are them, I am me,” he said from his office, beneath gold-framed portraits of his late parents. “I will try to do better than them.” He described the “mixed feelings” that overwhelmed him when he arrived home in December — the joy of returning, swiftly eclipsed by grief at his mother’s death. Instead of celebrating, however, he had to bid farewell to his ailing mother, who had long been in intensive care. “When you come home after so long, any son wants to hug his mother,” he said. “I didn’t have that chance.” Within days of landing in Dhaka, the still grieving heir assumed leadership of the BNP. ‘Unnerves many’ Born when the country was still East Pakistan, he was briefly detained as a child during the 1971 war. His party hails him as “one of the youngest prisoners of war”. His father, Ziaur Rahman, an army commander, gained influence months after a 1975 coup when founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman — Sheikh Hasina’s father — was murdered. It entrenched a rivalry between the two families that would define the country’s politics for decades. Ziaur Rahman himself was killed in 1981. Rahman grew up in his mother’s political orbit as she went on to become the country’s first female prime minister, alternating power with Hasina in a long and bitter duel. “In her seats, I used to go and I used to campaign,” Rahman said. “So this is how slowly and gradually I started getting involved in politics.” But his career has also been shadowed by allegations of corruption and abuse of power. A 2006 US embassy cable said he “inspires few but unnerves many”. Other cables labelled him a “symbol of kleptocratic government and violent politics” and accused him of being “phenomenally corrupt”. Arrested on corruption charges in 2007, Rahman says he was tortured in custody. He fled to London the following year, where he faced multiple cases in absentia. He denied all charges and dismissed them as politically motivated. But he also told AFP he offered an apology. “If there are any mistakes which were unwanted, we are sorry for that,” he told AFP . After Hasina’s fall , Rahman was acquitted of the most serious charge against him — a life sentence handed down in absentia for a 2004 grenade attack on a Hasina rally — which he had always denied. Married to a cardiologist and father to a daughter, a lawyer, he led a quiet life in Britain. That changed with his dramatic return in December, accompanied by his fluffy ginger cat, Zebu, images of which went viral on Bangladeshi social media. He admits the task ahead is now “immense”, rebuilding a country he says was “destroyed” by the former government.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Tuesday it conducted a raid in the city’s Shah Latif Town, as a result of which four suspected terrorists died while two cops sustained injuries. According to information provided by CTD Deputy Inspector General Ghulam Azfar Mahesar, the encounter began when CTD personnel surrounded a house in Shah Latif Town based on the identification of previously arrested suspects. The men inside opened fire, leading to an exchange of gunfire, the CTD said. Additional police contingents were then called to the scene. The four alleged terrorists were injured by firing “from their own accomplices” during the crossfire and later died at a hospital, CTD claimed. Three of the suspects were identified as Jaleel alias Farid, Niaz alias King and Hamdan alias Farid, while efforts were underway to determine the identity of the fourth. A Kalashnikov and a hand grenade were recovered from the possession of one of the suspected terrorists. Two CTD officials — Head Constable Muhammad Yousuf and Constable Raja Junaid — were also wounded in the exchange and taken to a hospital for treatment. According to CTD, three already arrested suspects brought to the scene for pointation were injured during the crossfire as well. In a statement, the CTD said the suspects belonged to Fitna al-Hindustan’s Bashir Zeb network. The term ‘ Fitna al Hindu­stan ’ is a phrase coined by the state, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy. When CTD personnel entered the house after the fire exchange, some accomplices had managed to escape under the cover of darkness. A search operation was initiated to apprehend the fleeing suspects, with checkpoints set up in District Malir and other parts of the city. Suspecting the presence of explosives, the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) was summoned, which cordoned off and evacuated the surrounding area. The BDS confirmed the presence of explosive material inside the house and began neutralisation efforts. According to a BDS statement, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were being prepared in drums within the premises. Detonators, detonating wire and electrical circuits were also recovered. In early January, the CTD said it had foiled a major terrorist attack in Karachi, arresting three suspects and recovering 2,000 kilogrammes of explosives.",

      "summary_orig": "A terrorist attack, involving an explosive-laden vehicle, on a checkpost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On February 16, a cowardly terrorist attack was attempted on security forces and law enforcement agencies’ joint check Post in Bajaur District by Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij ” . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The statement added that 12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khwarij with precision”. “In their desperation, the attackers rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. Due to the blast impact infrastructure at check post collapsed resultantly eleven brave sons of soil, rendered the ultimate sacrifice and [embracing] martyrdom.” ISPR elaborated that the blast affected residential buildings in the area as well, “leading to the martyrdom of one innocent young girl”. Another seven people were injured, including women and children, the ISPR said. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as a relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision “ Azm e Istehkam ” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement added. “The sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further reinforce our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the statement concluded. President, PM condemn attack President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack and extended condolences to the families of martyrs, according to a statement issued via PPP’s media cell. “The sacrifice made by the martyrs for the country’s defence further strengthens our resolve,” the president was quoted as saying. He vowed that the complete elimination of terrorists operating in the country with external support remained the state’s “topmost priority.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed sorrow at the loss of lives and condemned the attack in the “strongest terms,” state broadcaster PTV reported. He extended condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the recovery of the injured, PTV said. “The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in this war against terrorism,” the premier was quoted as saying. He said the country remained determined to “root out terrorism from the country”. Noting the elimination of 12 terrorists, the prime minister lauded the security forces for their “timely action”. “Under the vision of Azm e Istehkam, security forces are gaining major success in the fight against terrorism,” the premier said. The attack comes days after an additional station house officer was martyred as terrorists attacked a police station in the War Mamund tehsil of Bajaur district. In December 2025, a major-ranked officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the district. KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and police to ensure the reopening of roads blocked by PTI supporters and protesters in recent days. The protesting PTI workers have blocked KP’s entry and exit points for the last four days , demanding that the federal government move incarcerated party founder Imran Khan from jail to a hospital for medical treatment . A two-member bench headed by Justice Ijaz Anwar and including Justice Farah Jamshed took up the set of petitions filed by MPA Sobia Shahid, lawyer Tariq Afghan, Swabi resident Yousaf Ali and Shaoor Khan. Upon the bench summoning them, KP Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed, Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah and Advocate General Shah Faisal Utmankhel appeared in court. At the outset of the hearing, Justice Anwar inquired about how many days it had been since the roads were blocked. “The roads have been shut for the past three days. Initially, 14 points were blocked, and now protests are underway at six points,” the KP IG replied. Justice Anwar wondered whether shutting roads was not a violation of the law, pointing out that lawyers for six cases were unable to reach the PHC from Islamabad. He remarked, “Such is the security situation in the province that even today, 14 have been martyred. These are the conditions, but despite this, there are protests and roads are closed.” The judge highlighted that the laws guaranteed citizens the right to freedom of movement, but they were still “facing difficulties”. He inquired about the number of first information reports (FIR) registered over the road blockades. “The traffic situation in Peshawar is the worst in the entire country. In fact, there is no traffic system in this province,” Justice Anwar observed, at which IG Hameed expressed his strong agreement. “We are now trying to streamline this, and are initiating e-challans,” the police chief assured the court. Justice Anwar quipped, “When the police want to take action against someone, they do. When they do not want to, then this happens.” At one point during the hearing, Justice Anwar said it was “unfortunate that the ruling party here is protesting [and] hurting the province’s people”. Utmankhel assured the bench that “no one would defend any wrong act.” IG Hameed sought two days for the police to “fix the situation”, but Justice Anwar declined the request, ordering that the roads be opened today. “Begin today, and do not let anyone block the roads,” he stressed. “The entire country is open, but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is shut. This is against our own people.” “The motorway should not be closed off under any circumstances,” he added, noting that people could not leave their houses due to the blocked routes. Protesters had blocked the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway (M-1) at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway. “Reopen the roads and ensure the same,” Justice Anwar ordered, telling the KP IG and the chief secretary to submit their reports regarding the matter by tomorrow. Subsequently, the bench adjourned the hearing till Wednesday. The closure of M-1 — the main artery connecting Peshawar with the rest of the country — has put the GT Road, the other major road, under immense strain as the neglected highway is unable to cater to the traffic diverted from the motorway. Also, the GT Road is facing closures by PTI activists, causing massive inconvenience to people travelling to attend urgent business meetings and exams, take international flights from Islamabad airport and seek treatment. The businessmen, whose supplies have got stuck along the road, are also distressed.",

Justice Anwar wondered whether shutting roads was not a violation of the law, pointing out that lawyers for six cases were unable to reach the PHC from Islamabad. He remarked, “Such is the security situation in the province that even today, 14 have been martyred. These are the conditions, but despite this, there are protests and roads are closed.” The judge highlighted that the laws guaranteed citizens the right to freedom of movement, but they were still “facing difficulties”. He inquired about the number of first information reports (FIR) registered over the road blockades. “The traffic situation in Peshawar is the worst in the entire country. In fact, there is no traffic system in this province,” Justice Anwar observed, at which IG Hameed expressed his strong agreement. “We are now trying to streamline this, and are initiating e-challans,” the police chief assured the court. Justice Anwar quipped, “When the police want to take action against someone, they do. When they do not want to, then this happens.” At one point during the hearing, Justice Anwar said it was “unfortunate that the ruling party here is protesting [and] hurting the province’s people”. Utmankhel assured the bench that “no one would defend any wrong act.” IG Hameed sought two days for the police to “fix the situation”, but Justice Anwar declined the request, ordering that the roads be opened today. “Begin today, and do not let anyone block the roads,” he stressed. “The entire country is open, but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is shut. This is against our own people.” “The motorway should not be closed off under any circumstances,” he added, noting that people could not leave their houses due to the blocked routes. Protesters had blocked the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway (M-1) at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway. “Reopen the roads and ensure the same,” Justice Anwar ordered, telling the KP IG and the chief secretary to submit their reports regarding the matter by tomorrow. Subsequently, the bench adjourned the hearing till Wednesday. The closure of M-1 — the main artery connecting Peshawar with the rest of the country — has put the GT Road, the other major road, under immense strain as the neglected highway is unable to cater to the traffic diverted from the motorway. Also, the GT Road is facing closures by PTI activists, causing massive inconvenience to people travelling to attend urgent business meetings and exams, take international flights from Islamabad airport and seek treatment. The businessmen, whose supplies have got stuck along the road, are also distressed.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: A suspected serial killer, accused of kidnapping and murdering at least four people, was reportedly killed by gunfire from his own accomplices during an alleged encounter with the Gujranwala police on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the Gujranwala police said that the suspect, who was caught while attempting to flee from Lahore to Karachi via train, had been in the custody of the Gujranwala police on physical remand. He claimed that the police team was taking the suspect to an area he had identified to recover the murder weapon, when unidentified armed accomplices of the suspect intercepted the police party. The police spokesperson further claimed that four armed accomplices opened fire on the police in an attempt to free the suspect from custody. “However, the suspect was killed by gunfire from his own accomplices while trying to flee,” the spokesperson added. The attackers fled the scene shortly afterward, he said. The police later moved the suspect’s body to the Gujranwala District Headquarters Hospital for an autopsy. The spokesman said that a case was being lodged against the attackers and that the police had started an investigation into the incident. Earlier on Monday, Gujranwala City Police Officer (CPO) Dr Ghias Gul told reporters at a news conference that police found two unidentified bodies of a 32-year-old woman and her five-year-old son along the bank of a canal near Citi Housing Society on Feb 10. Both the deceased, he said, had been slain with a sharp-edged weapon. They were later identified, and a case of double murder was lodged on the report of a police official. The CPO added that the suspect was nabbed by a special investigation team while attempting to flee. The suspect, he said, had confessed to killing the woman and her two children, including her eight-month-old daughter Mubara. The second child’s body was recovered from the canal after the suspect was identified. The suspect revealed that he had killed the three victims to steal the gold earrings the woman was wearing. The CPO added that the suspect had also confessed to killing a 13-year-old boy from Mado Khalil in the Ladhewala police precinct on December 20 last year.",

      "title_orig": "Trump says he will be involved indirectly in Iran talks",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would be involved “indirectly” in high-stakes talks between Iran and the US over Tehran’s nuclear program set for Tuesday in Geneva, adding he believed Tehran wanted to make a deal. “I’ll be involved in those talks, indirectly. And they’ll be very important,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. Tensions are soaring ahead of the talks, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East. The US military is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters. Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said Iran has long sought a tough posture in negotiations but learned the consequences of that approach last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites. Trump suggested Tehran was motivated this time to negotiate. “I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,” Trump said. Washington pushes Tehran to forego enrichment Prior to the US strikes in June, US-Iran nuclear talks had stalled over Washington’s demand that Tehran forgo enrichment on its soil, which the US views as a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon. “We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s,” Trump said, referring to the bat-winged US stealth bombers that carried out the bombings. “I hope they’re going to be more reasonable.” The remarks contrast with those by the US president on Friday, when he embraced potential regime change in Iran and lamented decades of failed talks. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday, saying in a post on X that he was in Geneva to “achieve a fair and equitable deal.” “What is not on the table: submission before threats,” Araqchi said. Questions about uranium stockpile The International Atomic Energy Agency has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440 kg of highly enriched uranium following Israeli-US strikes and let inspections fully resume, including in three key sites that were bombed in June last year: Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan. Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against any attack, which would choke a fifth of global oil flows and send crude prices sharply higher. Iran held a military drill on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states, which have been appealing for diplomacy to end the dispute. Despite Trump’s comments about Iran seeking a deal, the talks face major potential stumbling blocks. Washington has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues such as Iran’s missile stockpile. Tehran says it is only willing to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and won’t accept zero uranium enrichment. It says its missile capabilities are off the table. Speaking during a visit to Hungary on Monday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said reaching a deal with Tehran would be hard. “I think that there’s an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement … but I don’t want to overstate it either,” Rubio said. “It’s going to be hard. It’s been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we’re dealing with radical clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones.”",

Tehran says it is only willing to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and won’t accept zero uranium enrichment. It says its missile capabilities are off the table. Speaking during a visit to Hungary on Monday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said reaching a deal with Tehran would be hard. “I think that there’s an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement … but I don’t want to overstate it either,” Rubio said. “It’s going to be hard. It’s been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we’re dealing with radical clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones.”",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: The prolonged closure of the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway (M-1) by the PTI activists heaped misery on commuters, transporters and traders. The ruling party’s leaders and workers have closed M-1 at Swabi rest area since last Friday to demand early treatment of their incarcerated leader, Imran Khan, for “vision loss”. The closure of M-1, the main artery connecting Peshawar with the rest of the country, has put the Grand Trunk Road, the other major road, under immense strain as the neglected highway is unable to cater to the traffic diverted from the motorway. Also, the GT Road is facing closures by PTI activists, causing massive inconvenience to people travelling to attend urgent business meetings and exams, take international flights from Islamabad airport and seek treatment. The businessmen, whose supplies have got stuck along the road, are also distressed. Businessmen wonder why PTI govt troubling people of KP Jan Mulk, a businessman, who was travelling from Islamabad to Peshawar on Sunday evening, told Dawn that he left Islamabad at around 4:30pm and reached Attock at around 6:30pm before finding himself caught in a huge traffic jam at Attock crossing. “Hundreds of vehicles were stuck in a long traffic grid lock and there was not even any way to turn back,” he said. The businessman said that the Attock traffic gridlock forced him to return and spend the night in Islamabad before coming to Peshawar next morning. “There were women, children and elderly, with a large number of them being on foot due to road closure and unavailability of public transport,” he said. Mr Mulk said transporters in Attock were charging commuters Rs1,000 for a trip to Rawalpindi. Khan Zaman Afridi, president of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Transporters Association, told Dawn that road closures had made life difficult for transports. “Nearly 3,000 vehicles leave Peshawar General Bus Stand on a daily basis but the number has dropped to around 1500 due to road closures,” he said. Mr Afridi said almost all public transport used the M-1 and now its closure has diverted all the traffic to the GT Road and a usual trip of two to three hours on motorway was taking over 10 hours on GT Road. “GT Road is not old GT Road and is full of potholes and full of vans, Qingqi motorcycle-rickshaws and push carts, so it is very difficult to traverse and now, the entire motorway traffic has been diverted to it, causing massive traffic snarl,” he said. Mr Afridi said that due to the road closures, many people had stopped travelling, and commuter arrivals at bus stands had almost halved as only people who had to attend urgent business meetings travelled in compulsion. “It is ironic that the KP government is inflicting pain on its own people,” he said. A representative of Faisal Movers told Dawn that his transport company had stopped its Peshawar-Islamabad operations since the start of the M-1 closure. Junaid Altaf, president of KP Chamber of Commerce and Industry, questioned the rationale for the motorway closure. “Who are they troubling? Is it the people of KP or residents of Punjab and Sindh who are being affected due to the M-1 closure?” Mr Altaf said that KP chief minister and his cabinet had been sitting in Islamabad for the past many days, leaving their offices and official duties unattended. He said that the prolonged closure of Pak-Afghan border points had already ruined the province’s business community and now, the politicians didn’t understand that the trucks stranded on the road to KP carried raw material to factories in the province and prolonged closure was hurting the business community as well as the economy of the province. “If PTI thinks the people of KP deserve this for voting them to the powers, then it is ok and we deserve it,” he said. Malik Sohni, president of All Pakistan Agriculture Produce Traders Federation, told Dawn that road closures had resulted in an over 10pc increase in the vegetable prices in the provincial capital. He said that in the current season, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, okra, garlic, peas and leafy vegetables were transported from Punjab to Peshawar. Mr Sohni said that as vegetables were perishable, prolonged blockages not only caused spoilage but also drove the prices up. “Prices automatically go up when fresh supplies don’t reach on time,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "• Pakistan asks international community to reject provocative decision allowing takeover of occupied land as state property • EU calls annexation illegal, Arab nations denounce ‘threat to peace efforts’ • Israel imposes restrictions, deploys police around Al-Aqsa JERUSALEM / ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan denounced the latest Israeli move to convert areas of the West Bank into “state property”, the UN chief called upon Tel Aviv to reverse its new, “unlawful” policy allowing registration of the occupied land in the occupied territory as state property. Israel’s foreign ministry claimed the measure, approved late on Sunday, would enable “transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes” but the move drew strong condemnations from across the globe for its violation of international law. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said this new measure was destabilising and unlawful, according to a statement by his spokesman Stephane Dujarric. Pakistan also denounced the step as a clear violation of international law as well as relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Islamabad urged the international community to reject the decision, said a statement issued by the For­eign Office spokesperson. It added that the occupying power continued to disregard international law and its provocative actions undermined the prospects for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region. “Pakistan calls on the international community to take concrete measures to end Israeli impunity, and ensure respect for international law,” the spokesperson added. ‘Undermine peace efforts’ Arab nations Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan also criticised the move as illegal. The measure is “aimed at impo­sing a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank” that would undermine peace efforts in the region, Saudi Arabia’s foreign affairs ministry said in a statement. Jordan’s King Abdullah II said the actions “undermine efforts to restore calm and thr­e­aten to exacerbate the conflict,” according to a statement released by the royal court. The European Union called on Israel to reverse the move. “This constitutes a new escalation after recent measures already aimed at extending Israeli control,” EU foreign affairs spokesman Anouar El Anouni said. “We reiterate that annexation is illegal under international law.” The Ramallah-based Palest­inian Authority called for inte­r­national intervention to prevent the “de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state”. Israeli anti-settlement watc­­h­dog Peace Now called the measure a “mega land grab”. Jonathan Mizrachi, the NGO’s co-director, told AFP that the move would attribute new resources for land registration. “There was a lot of ambiguity regarding the land, and Israel decided now to deal with it,” Mizrachi said, adding that the grey area over Area C land ownership was likely to be used against Palestinians. “A lot of land that Palestinians consider theirs, they will find out it’s not theirs under this new registration process,” he said, believing the move would further the Israeli right’s annexation agenda. Changing demography Palestinians see the West Bank as foundational to any future Palesti­nian state, but many on Israel’s religious right want to take over the land. The latest Israeli initiatives come in the wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to rights groups. “We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a recent statement. US President Donald Trump has opposed Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, saying stability in the territory helps keep Israel secure. However, he has held off from dire­ctly criticising the new Israeli measures, despite the international outrage. Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, more than 500,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements and outposts, which are illegal under international law. Around three million Palestinians live in the territory, which Israel has occupied since 1967. Al-Aqsa restrictions Israeli police said Monday that they would deploy in force around the Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramazan, as Palestinian officials accused Israel of imposing restrictions at the compound. Over the course of the month of fasting and prayer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Islam’s third-holiest site. Arad Braverman, a senior Jerusalem police officer, said forces would be deployed “day and night” across the compound, adding that thousands of police would also be on duty for Friday prayers. Braverman said police had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem. The Palestinian Jerusalem Governorate said it had been informed that permits would again be restricted to men over 55. Published in Dawn, February 17th, 2026",
