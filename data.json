      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The Pakistani Consulate in Los Angeles issued a stern warning against a message circulating online and on messaging platforms that claims to be an “important notice” regarding Pakistan visas. Officials have confirmed that the message is false and is part of a pattern of phishing scams designed to collect sensitive personal and financial information from unsuspecting applicants. Upon accessing the consulate’s website, the following notice was prominently displayed. A screenshot of a notice from the Pakistani Consulate in Los Angeles warning about unauthorised visa applications. — Screengrab A statement issued by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington stated: “The Consulate General disassociates itself from all such unauthorised individuals, agents, or entities and shall not be responsible for any loss, delay, misrepresentation, or other adverse consequences arising from engagement with them.” The fraudulent message falsely purports to come from the consulate and directs visa applicants to submit information through links that are not authorised by the government of Pakistan. Such scams are designed to harvest passport details, social security numbers, bank account information, and credit card data, which can later be used for identity theft, unauthorised transactions, financial fraud and other criminal activities. The consulate strongly reiterated that Pakistani visa applications must be submitted only through the official government online portal: https://visa.nadra.gov.pk . Visa applicants were urged to avoid intermediaries, agents, or unauthorised websites, regardless of claims of faster processing or special access. They were also advised to be cautious when sharing personal or financial information online, with the consulate adding that requests for social security numbers, bank details, or other identity-related data in relation to visa applications should be treated as red flags. The public was urged by the consulate to verify all information directly through official channels and to report any suspicious messages or websites to the relevant authorities. “This advisory is being issued in the public interest to protect applicants from scams that can have devastating financial and personal consequences,” officials said. Applicants looking for updated guidance and official visa information were instructed to visit the consulate’s website at https://pakconsulatela.org/visa-services . The warning comes amid a sharp rise in online fraud globally. According to the US Federal Trade Commission , consumers in the United States reported losing more than $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, a sharp increase over previous years, as scammers increasingly exploit phishing, identity theft, and impersonation tactics online. Data also show a significant rise in credit card fraud and identity theft, with hundreds of thousands of cases reported in 2025 alone, highlighting how criminals misuse personal and financial information once it is obtained. Cybersecurity researchers have documented an 18 per cent increase in phishing attacks in Pakistan during 2024, as criminals increasingly target individuals with deceptive links and spoofed communication. Courts in the United States and other countries have sentenced individuals involved in multi-million-dollar phishing and fraud schemes, where victims — often targeted through impersonation and phishing — were defrauded of large sums. Officials noted that victims of similar scams have, in some cases, lost their entire life savings, as stolen data is used to gain access to bank accounts, obtain fraudulent loans, or conduct unauthorised transfers.",

      "summary": "WASHINGTON: The Pakistani Consulate in Los Angeles issued a stern warning against a message circulating online and on messaging platforms that claims to be an “important notice” regarding Pakistan visas. Officials have confirmed that the message is false and is part of a pattern of phishing scams designed to collect sensitive personal and financial information from unsuspecting applicants. Upon accessing the consulate’s website, the following notice was prominently displayed. A screenshot of a notice from the Pakistani Consulate in Los Angeles warning about unauthorised visa applications. — Screengrab A statement issued by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington stated: “The Consulate General disassociates itself from all such unauthorised individuals, agents, or entities and shall not be responsible for any loss, delay, misrepresentation, or other adverse consequences arising from engagement with them.” The fraudulent message falsely purports to come from the consulate and directs visa applicants to submit information through links that are not authorised by the government of Pakistan. Such scams are designed to harvest passport details, social security numbers, bank account information, and credit card data, which can later be used for identity theft, unauthorised transactions, financial fraud and other criminal activities. The consulate strongly reiterated that Pakistani visa applications must be submitted only through the official government online portal: https://visa.nadra.gov.pk . Visa applicants were urged to avoid intermediaries, agents, or unauthorised websites, regardless of claims of faster processing or special access. They were also advised to be cautious when sharing personal or financial information online, with the consulate adding that requests for social security numbers, bank details, or other identity-related data in relation to visa applications should be treated as red flags. The public was urged by the consulate to verify all information directly through official channels and to report any suspicious messages or websites to the relevant authorities. “This advisory is being issued in the public interest to protect applicants from scams that can have devastating financial and personal consequences,” officials said. Applicants looking for updated guidance and official visa information were instructed to visit the consulate’s website at https://pakconsulatela.org/visa-services . The warning comes amid a sharp rise in online fraud globally. According to the US Federal Trade Commission , consumers in the United States reported losing more than $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, a sharp increase over previous years, as scammers increasingly exploit phishing, identity theft, and impersonation tactics online. Data also show a significant rise in credit card fraud and identity theft, with hundreds of thousands of cases reported in 2025 alone, highlighting how criminals misuse personal and financial information once it is obtained. Cybersecurity researchers have documented an 18 per cent increase in phishing attacks in Pakistan during 2024, as criminals increasingly target individuals with deceptive links and spoofed communication.

      "summary_orig": "The PTI has said that it will not engage in negotiations with the federal government. Party Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. Later that day, Akram appeared on ARY News programme ‘The 11th Hour’, where he was asked if the PTI wants to negotiate with the government. He categorically said that the party was “not interested” in talks. “I met Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and he said that Imran instructed the party not to engage with the government in any way,“ Akram explained. “He also ordered that if anyone approaches Achakzai sahib or Allama Raja Nasir sahib for any matter, they have the authority to decide whether or not they want to talk,” he added, referring to Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leaders Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. Akram further said that the two opposition alliance leaders would decide how to respond to the government’s invitation. He added that, while speaking with the TTAP, he noted that other “friends” within the alliance are in favour of talks. “Since Imran Khan instructed the PTI against starting talks, under the directions of Salman Akram Raja, we rejected the offer,” he said. Asked if the party would announce a protest movement, Akram said that, unless a direct order is issued by Imran, Achakzai has the power to call a strike. “He called for a wheel-jam strike on February 8,” he added. “We have activities to carry out on our own; then we participate as part of an alliance.“ “When the alliance makes a call, we will be ready, but there must be mobilisation or preparedness. So he gave the KP chief minister the responsibility to start the street movement.” On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by TTAP, the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. They were of the opinion that in light of the ongoing national crisis, the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before. The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence. The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year. After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides commenced dialogue in the last week of December 2024 to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations , the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024 , and the release of PTI prisoners. The Shehbaz government once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February this year as National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped. However, a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the party.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: A police constable was killed on Wednesday during a crossfire between two rival groups at the busy Rustam Bazaar in Wana, officials said. The incident occurred when an exchange of fire erupted between the two sides during a confrontation, claiming the life of Constable Islamuddin Wazir, who was deployed on law-and-order duty in the local market. “He sustained critical injuries and succumbed on the spot,“ said police. “Constable Islamuddin Wazir was performing his official duties to maintain peace and public safety when he was hit by bullets during the crossfire,” said police officials. Following the incident, panic spread in the marketplace, prompting police to immediately cordon off the area and bring the situation under control. City Police Station Wana SHO Razaullah Wazir confirmed that two suspects involved in the firing had been arrested and taken to the station, where an FIR has been registered at the CTD South Waziristan police station. DSP Wana Imranullah stated, “Under the directives of the DPO, raids were underway to arrest other suspects and bring all those responsible to justice.” The funeral prayers of the martyred constable were offered with full state honours at Police Lines, Wana, attended by senior government and police officials, family members, and a large number of local elders. After the funeral prayers, the body of Constable Islamuddin Wazir was transported to his native village, Sanga in Tehsil Shakai, where he was laid to rest. Police in Lower South Waziristan paid tribute to the sacrifice of the martyred constable and reiterated their resolve that “the sacrifices of martyrs would not go in vain.” “Efforts to protect the lives and property of citizens and maintain peace in the district will continue with full commitment,” they stated. Meanwhile, local political and social circles expressed deep sorrow over the incident and called for a “strict ban” on the display and use of weapons in Rustam Bazaar and other markets to prevent similar incidents in the future. A few months ago, the residents had voiced their concerns against the open display of firearms and the free movement of armed men in the Rustam Bazaar area, an important commercial hub of Lower South Waziristan. They accused police and other law enforcement agencies of being mere spectators while influential and armed individuals enjoyed complete impunity. They said this environment had created a growing sense of insecurity and fear among the public. A shutter-down strike had also been observed in May, with hundreds of people taking to the streets in Wana against the deteriorating law and order situation, rising incidents of abductions for ransom, extortion, and bomb blasts.",

In today’s attack, a quadcopter released its explosive payload over a residential area. As a result, three boys and a girl sustained injuries, confirmed official sources. The injured minors were shifted to a nearby medical facility for medical treatment. Security sources condemned the attack, calling it “an act of violence against innocent civilians and children”. “Such incidents reflect a deliberate targeting of non-combatants and have nothing to do with religion or humanitarian values,” they added. An investigation into the incident is underway, while security in the area has been tightened following the attack. Last week, two women and two teenagers were injured in a quadcopter attack in the Janikhel area of Bannu district. A week before the Bannu attack, another attack in the same area injured four people, including two children. Earlier in the month, three boys were killed, and another was injured when a quadcopter crashed in a residential area of Mamand Khel in Bannu. Also in December, at least seven people, including minors, were injured in a quadcopter attack carried out by terrorists on a playground in Lakki Marwat.",

The DIG said that Bannu police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations across the district, resulting in the arrest of 105 terrorists and the elimination of 65 terrorists. Overall, successful action was taken against 170 terrorists, he said. He further stated that police and security forces jointly conducted successful operations in the areas of Miryan, Haved, Daud Shah, Mamand Khel and Domel. During these joint operations, one police constable was martyred while 11 police personnel and five civilians were injured, he said. As a result of these operations, 22 terrorists were killed and four were arrested, and several terrorist hideouts and houses were also demolished. He also said that terrorists had carried out 20 drone attacks targeting police installations and civilian populations, in which 19 police personnel were injured. Further, nine civilians were martyred and 33 were injured, he said. However, following the installation of an anti-drone system on July 18, a significant improvement was observed, with over 300 drone attacks thwarted and four drones neutralised. DIG Khan said that despite limited resources, various security measures were implemented to protect police installations, including the installation of barriers, bunkers, double boundary walls, bullet-proof gates and CCTV cameras. He said that work had also begun on the Safe City Project to further enhance the safety of both police personnel and the general public. He added that for coordinated action against terrorists, jirgas were held with local elders in different areas, yielding positive results, and peace committees were formed. With public cooperation, militant attacks on several police stations and checkposts were successfully thwarted, while effective operations were carried out in Kakki, Bharath, Khojri, Bargantu, Sheikh Landak, and other areas, he said. According to the DIG, in order to align Bannu police with modern requirements, the force had been equipped with drones, anti-drone guns, sniper rifles, armoured personnel carriers (APCs), thermal imaging systems, tactical helmets and bullet-proof vehicles. He reaffirmed his commitment that Bannu police would continue its struggle to maintain law and order in the district, efforts to eliminate terrorism, and ensure the protection of the lives and property of the public.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday said that the government was satisfied with the sale of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), adding that it had great “symbolic value”. He expressed these views on Geo News programme ‘Geo Pakistan’ when asked whether the government was satisfied with the process. “Yes, the government is satisfied. This is the first biggest transaction of our privatisation process. This transaction has a great symbolic value,“ he said, recalling that previously First Women Bank had also been privatised but that transaction was not as big. A consortium led by the Arif Habib group won the auction for a controlling stake in Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) on Tuesday with a bid of Rs135 billion after a competitive, televised process, marking the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades. The sale is a central plank of the government’s plan to offload loss-making state-owned enterprises and a key condition under Pakistan’s $7bn International Monetary Fund bailout programme. Speaking about the matter on ‘Geo Pakistan’ , Asif said the PIA sale had “symbolic value because of the history of this transaction“. Four years ago, he said, the country’s entire aviation sector had suffered following a statement by a then-minister from the PTI. He was apparently referring to former aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement in June 2020 during a parliamentary session. Khan had said investigations revealed that more than 262 of the country’s 860 active pilots either held fake licences or had cheated in their exams. Following the then-minister’s statement, European and UK authorities had ban­ned PIA from their territories, which were the airline’s most profitable routes. A number of foreign airlines had also grounded Pak­istani-origin pilots over concerns about their licences. The developments followed the crash of a PIA flight from Lahore near Karachi’s Jinnah Inter­national Airport in 2020, killing around 100 people. Asif said these events had led to PIA going “almost bankrupt”, adding that the government then restructured the company. “The government itself owned a big portion of its liability and only nominal liability remained,“ he said. “Against this backdrop, yesterday’s transaction is a very successful one.” He also credited the civil aviation department for its considerable contribution in the matter and seeing the transaction through. “We went through a painstaking process,” he said, adding that PIA was now operating flights to Manchester . The minister further stated that the airline now also had permission to operate flights to Birmingham and London, but it did not have aircraft for those flights. Similarly, he continued, PIA now also had permission to operate flights to New York and around 14-15 destinations in Europe. The defence minister also appeared to be defending the arrangement under which the government is to receive just 7.5 per cent — around Rs10bn — of the amount from the PIA sale, saying that investing a “bigger portion” back into the airline increased its value. He said the government still held 25pc of PIA’s shares and 92.5 of the amount from the sale being invested back into the airline was actually an investment into a national asset. “We did not give a handout to anyone,” he asserted, adding that the country had borne losses for 50-55 years following nationalisation of businesses. He also blamed the bureaucracy for state-owned enterprises’ losses, adding that politicians likely shared some responsibility for these losses as well. “We have to construct such transactions [as that of PIA‘s sale] to rid [the national exchequer] of these losses. We don’t have a choice. We are beggars, not the choosers,” Asif said, adding that several other transactions were to be carried out in the future. In this connection, he also mentioned that two power distribution companies in Sindh and one each in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan were facing severe losses. When the anchorperson pointed out that Asif had held Khan responsible for losses in the aviation sector in recent years and asked whether action would be taken over such matters, Asif said action would be taken. “There is no other option. These people should be held answerable,” he said. He said often retired bureaucrats would become part of boards of state-owned enterprises and earn in millions. “This is an orgy of loot and plunder of the public sector that has been going on in our country for the past 55 years,” he commented. “The existence of a sick public sector is actually supported or pushed by the bureaucracy […] The government is largely responsible for it, and they [bureaucrats] are the major beneficiaries of this loot and plunder.” Asked about over-staffing in PIA, he said even if a little more had to be paid to the employees than the actual payable amount to “get rid of them”, then it should be paid. “Because the purpose should be to stop the continuous bleeding.” Asked about the possibility of talks between the government and opposition, he said issues on which dialogue was to be held should be decided first.",

      "summary_orig": "The Libyan army’s chief of staff, Mohammed Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, died in a plane crash on Tuesday after leaving Turkiye’s capital Ankara as well as four others that were on the jet as well. “This followed a tragic and painful incident while they were returning from an official trip from the Turkish city of Ankara. This grave loss is a great loss for the nation, for the military institution, and for all the people,” Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah said in a statement. According to the Washington DC-based Stimson Centre , Libya has effectively split into two virtual quasi-states since 2014. The west is ruled by the Government of National Unity (GNU), of which Dbeibah is the prime minister, while the east is run by Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar’s Libyan Armed Forces. Dbeibah said the commander of Libya’s ground forces, the director of its military manufacturing authority, an adviser to the chief of staff, and a photographer from the chief of staff’s office were also on the aircraft. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X that the plane had taken off from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport at 1710 GMT en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost at 1752 GMT. He said authorities found the plane’s wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara’s Haymana district. He added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana, but that no contact was established. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said an investigation into the crash was under way. The Tripoli-based GNU said in a statement that the prime minister directed the defence minister to send an official delegation to Ankara to follow up on proceedings. Walid Ellafi, state minister of political affairs and communication for the GNU, told broadcaster Libya Alahrar that it was not clear when a crash report would be ready, but that the jet was a leased Maltese aircraft. He added that officials did not have “sufficient information regarding its ownership or technical history,” but said this would be investigated. Turkiye’s defence ministry had announced Haddad’s visit earlier, saying he had met with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and Turkish counterpart Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, along with other Turkish military commanders.",
