      "title_orig": "Pak-Afghan talks in Istanbul failed to bring about any workable solution, says information minister",
      "summary_orig": "Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said early on Wednesday that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”, adding that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. After days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, the two countries had come together for a dialogue in Doha which had resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks between the two sides had begun in the Turkish capital. In a post on social media platform X early on Wednesday, the information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by Indian-abetted Fitna al Khwarij and Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” he said. “Since the Taliban regime bears no responsibility towards the people of Afghanistan and thrives on a war economy, it desires to drag and mire the Afghan people into a needless war,” he said. The minister asserted that Pakistan had always desired, advocated, and sacrificed for the peace and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan. “In the same spirit, Pakistan has held countless rounds of talks and parleys with the Afghan Taliban regime but, unfortunately, they have always remained indifferent to Pakistan’s losses. Sadly, after sustaining such huge losses of men and material for four long years, Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” he said. He said that in an effort to “give peace a chance” and at the request of Qatar and Turkiye, Pakistan engaged with the Afghan Taliban earlier in Doha and then in Istanbul on a single-point agenda — soliciting action by the Afghan Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan soil by terrorist organisations as a “training-cum-logistics base and jump off point for terrorist activities in Pakistan”. He thanked Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating this dialogue and their efforts in convincing Kabul to “desist from the use of terror proxies as leverage against Pakistan”, but said that the neighbouring country repeatedly deviated from the core issue. “Over the last four days of dialogue, the Afghan Taliban delegation repeatedly agreed to Pakistan’s logical and legitimate demand for credible and decisive action against [militant] organisations and terrorists. “Sufficient and irrefutable evidence was provided by Pakistan which was acknowledged by Afghan Taliban and the hosts, however, regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurance,” the minister said. “The Afghan side kept deviating from the core issue, evading the key point upon which the dialogue process was initiated. Instead of accepting any responsibility, the Afghan Taliban resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses. The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution,” he said. The minister again thanked the government of Qatar, Turkiye as well as those of other friendly state for their efforts to “bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of terrorism, for the prosperity and security of the two countries and the region at large”. “The security of its people is of paramount importance to Pakistan. We will continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from the menace of terrorism and assure them that the government of Pakistan will continue to employ all the resources which are required in this regard to decimate the terrorists, their sanctuaries, their abetters and supporters,” he said. The statement from the information minister came hours after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedaled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath ’, the defence minister stated that negotiators had backpedaled on an agreement “four or five times” after receiving instructions from Kabul. “Whenever we got close to an agreement — either in the last four days or last week — when negotiators reported to Kabul, then there was intervention and the agreement was withdrawn,” he outlined. “I believe that the negotiations were sabotaged. We had an agreement, but then they called Kabul and backpedaled from the deal.” “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi,” he added. The defence minister believed that the Kabul government lacked authority, as it had been “penetrated” by India, which was using Afghanistan to stage a proxy war against Islamabad. “India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,” Asif said. “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.” When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out. “They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists,” he added. “There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for the terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said. Turkiye, Qatar step in to salvage talks On Tuesday, Turkish and Qatari mediators had tried to salvage negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban regime after the talks briefly collapsed over what officials described as “unbridgeable differences”. A Pakistani security source told reporters that the talks had “collapsed following the Afghan Taliban’s lack of commitment and seriousness to address terrorism-related issues, as well as their refusal to provide any written guarantees”. From the Afghan side, journalists were informed that the negotiations had ended “inconclusively”, with officials in Kabul accusing the Pakistani delegation of “improper conduct” and making “demands that are unacceptable to Afghanistan”. However, within hours of those reports emerging, the rupture had reportedly been repaired. By noon negotiators were back at the table following intense diplomatic efforts by Turkish and Qatari mediators, who pressed both sides to return for what officials described as a “final attempt” to achieve at least a limited agreement. “The negotiations in Istanbul have resumed at the insistence of the host country and the other mediator,” a Pakistani official confirmed, adding that talks continued late into the evening. Diplomatic sources said the Afghan Taliban delegation’s stance had shifted multiple times over the course of the four days, often due to fresh instructions from Kabul. “They came close to a deal four or five times,” one official said, “but each time, new guidance from Afghanistan scuttled the progress.” The divisions within the Taliban’s ranks, split among factions based in Kandahar, Kabul, and Khost were cited as another reason. “If the Kandahar group agrees at some point, the differences of the Kabul group come to the fore,” a source briefed on the negotiations said. Adding to the complications, the Afghan side reportedly introduced a new demand, insisting that Pakistan should prevent US drones from entering Afghan airspace from Pakistani territory. Observers noted the irony that many of those drones originated from Qatar, which itself is mediating the Istanbul dialogue. Despite the latest setback, Turkish and Qatari officials were said to have worked intensively to keep the process alive, warning both sides that the collapse of the talks could lead to renewed border tensions. Pak­istani officials reiterated their long-standing position that no agreement would be acceptable without verifia­ble guarantees that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against Pakistan. “Our stance has been consi­stent,” a senior security source said. “Without concrete assurances on counterterrorism, there can be no deal.”",

      "title_orig": "State & religious extremism",
      "summary_orig": "PAKISTAN has banned the TLP again. It is the second time in four years that the violent religio-political group has been outlawed. The action has been taken by the federal government after the group had turned Lahore into a virtual battlefield, destroying public property and attacking law-enforcement agencies. Several people, including policemen, were killed and wounded. It was the worst incident of violence perpetrated by a religious group in Lahore in recent times. The government says the state will not succumb to any kind of threat or blackmail this time. The crackdown on the group, which has strong mass support in Punjab, has been intensive. But given its past record of appeasement, there are still doubts over the seriousness of the latest government action. There is also the question of the policy dealing with violent extremism that is now so deeply entrenched in society. The TLP is just a symptom of a menace that threatens our social fabric and the state’s unity. The rise of religious extremism in Pakistan is, to a large extent, the result of the state’s own policies. In fact, the TLP is a product of the impunity allowed by the state to extremist ideology. Has there been a genuine shift in state policy towards religious extremism? Just banning the TLP won’t solve the problem of religious extremism in the country. There is no indication of the state willing to completely root out violent extremism. It is necessary to address the root causes of religious extremism in the country. A TLP ban in 2021 lasted for only a few months before the state caved in under pressure of the extremist group. Not only was the ban lifted, the party, which was accused of mutiny and killing policemen, was allowed to participate in the general elections. It emerged as the country’s fourth largest party in terms of the number of votes, with its main support in Punjab. That shows how deeply religious extremism has seeped into the mainstream. A party which was born of a movement in support of the killer of a governor of Punjab, who was accused falsely of blasphemy and murdered in 2011, has turned into a major political force in Pakistan’s biggest and most powerful province. It could not have happened without the state allowing it impunity. The group saw a meteoric rise after its infamous dharna in Islamabad in 2017 that left the federal capital paralysed for more than a month over a law passed by parliament. It is curious that the state appeared helpless before a mob of few hundreds challenging parliament and the government’s writ. The dharna ended after the administration accepted their demands. Interestingly, the agreement also had the signature of a senior ISI officer. A Supreme Court observation in the case questioned the role of the intelligence agency in the TLP protest. It became quite a scandal when a picture of a senior army officer distributing money among the dispersing crowds after the agreement appeared in the media. Most alarming was the role of the TLP in weaponising the blasphemy law. There has been a marked increase in mob lynchings on false blasphemy accusations. The lynching of a Sri Lankan employee at a garment factory in Sialkot some years ago, the burning to death of a man in Swat, as well as the shooting of a doctor by a police officer in Mirpurkhas are just a few examples of the misuse of blasphemy laws. There is also question about the Election Commission’s decision to not only register a group with a violent record as a political party but to also allow it to contest elections. The decision violated the law. With its more extremist religious ideology, the TLP managed to eat into the vote bank of other moderate mainstream religio-political parties. Now the government has decided to ban the TLP and delist it as a political party. The reference is being sent to the Supreme Court for its approval, and it could be that the court won’t object to the government’s action. But there is still the question of whether merely banning the party can tackle the issue of violent religious extremism. The government action against the TLP was in response to the group’s violent protests and not because of its extremist ideology and attacks on religious minorities and their places worship, which have become rampant particularly in Punjab. All that has been happening for a long time without any action by the administration against the perpetrators. Just banning a party will not be effective if the state is not fully committed to enforcing the law against all religious extremist forces. The real issue is not the group but the extremist ideology it espouses. We have many examples of banned outfits resurfacing under different names. That could also happen in the TLP’s case. It is necessary to address the root causes of religious extremism in the country. Support for the TLP and other extremist groups largely come from semi-educated and deprived sections of society, which are easily swayed. It does not mean, however, that other sections are not influenced as well by radical groups. A country where over 40 per cent of the population live below the poverty line and 25 million children are out of school provides fertile ground for extremist religious groups to mobilise support. Moreover, the TLP and other extremist groups try to legitimise their actions through some faulty provisions in the law. Exploitation of religion for political gains also provides sustenance to extremist groups. If the state is sincere about eradicating religious extremism, it needs to address socioeconomic issues. The growing population is adding to the ranks of the unemployed in the country, which means it is also providing easily swayed recruits to extremist groups. Our education system itself creates extremist mindsets. Just banning the TLP without addressing these issues is not going to solve the problem of religious extremism.

Several people, including policemen, were killed and wounded. It was the worst incident of violence perpetrated by a religious group in Lahore in recent times. The government says the state will not succumb to any kind of threat or blackmail this time. The crackdown on the group, which has strong mass support in Punjab, has been intensive. But given its past record of appeasement, there are still doubts over the seriousness of the latest government action. There is also the question of the policy dealing with violent extremism that is now so deeply entrenched in society. The TLP is just a symptom of a menace that threatens our social fabric and the state’s unity. The rise of religious extremism in Pakistan is, to a large extent, the result of the state’s own policies. In fact, the TLP is a product of the impunity allowed by the state to extremist ideology. Has there been a genuine shift in state policy towards religious extremism? Just banning the TLP won’t solve the problem of religious extremism in the country. There is no indication of the state willing to completely root out violent extremism. It is necessary to address the root causes of religious extremism in the country. A TLP ban in 2021 lasted for only a few months before the state caved in under pressure of the extremist group. Not only was the ban lifted, the party, which was accused of mutiny and killing policemen, was allowed to participate in the general elections. It emerged as the country’s fourth largest party in terms of the number of votes, with its main support in Punjab. That shows how deeply religious extremism has seeped into the mainstream. A party which was born of a movement in support of the killer of a governor of Punjab, who was accused falsely of blasphemy and murdered in 2011, has turned into a major political force in Pakistan’s biggest and most powerful province. It could not have happened without the state allowing it impunity. The group saw a meteoric rise after its infamous dharna in Islamabad in 2017 that left the federal capital paralysed for more than a month over a law passed by parliament. It is curious that the state appeared helpless before a mob of few hundreds challenging parliament and the government’s writ. The dharna ended after the administration accepted their demands. Interestingly, the agreement also had the signature of a senior ISI officer. A Supreme Court observation in the case questioned the role of the intelligence agency in the TLP protest. It became quite a scandal when a picture of a senior army officer distributing money among the dispersing crowds after the agreement appeared in the media. Most alarming was the role of the TLP in weaponising the blasphemy law. There has been a marked increase in mob lynchings on false blasphemy accusations. The lynching of a Sri Lankan employee at a garment factory in Sialkot some years ago, the burning to death of a man in Swat, as well as the shooting of a doctor by a police officer in Mirpurkhas are just a few examples of the misuse of blasphemy laws. There is also question about the Election Commission’s decision to not only register a group with a violent record as a political party but to also allow it to contest elections. The decision violated the law. With its more extremist religious ideology, the TLP managed to eat into the vote bank of other moderate mainstream religio-political parties. Now the government has decided to ban the TLP and delist it as a political party. The reference is being sent to the Supreme Court for its approval, and it could be that the court won’t object to the government’s action. But there is still the question of whether merely banning the party can tackle the issue of violent religious extremism. The government action against the TLP was in response to the group’s violent protests and not because of its extremist ideology and attacks on religious minorities and their places worship, which have become rampant particularly in Punjab. All that has been happening for a long time without any action by the administration against the perpetrators. Just banning a party will not be effective if the state is not fully committed to enforcing the law against all religious extremist forces. The real issue is not the group but the extremist ideology it espouses. We have many examples of banned outfits resurfacing under different names. That could also happen in the TLP’s case. It is necessary to address the root causes of religious extremism in the country. Support for the TLP and other extremist groups largely come from semi-educated and deprived sections of society, which are easily swayed. It does not mean, however, that other sections are not influenced as well by radical groups. A country where over 40 per cent of the population live below the poverty line and 25 million children are out of school provides fertile ground for extremist religious groups to mobilise support. Moreover, the TLP and other extremist groups try to legitimise their actions through some faulty provisions in the law. Exploitation of religion for political gains also provides sustenance to extremist groups. If the state is sincere about eradicating religious extremism, it needs to address socioeconomic issues. The growing population is adding to the ranks of the unemployed in the country, which means it is also providing easily swayed recruits to extremist groups. Our education system itself creates extremist mindsets. Just banning the TLP without addressing these issues is not going to solve the problem of religious extremism.

Sources told Dawn that the names of Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Chaudhry Yasin, Faisal Rathore and Sardar Yaqub are under consideration for the top slot. Under the AJK Constitution, the movers of a no-confidence resolution are required to name a successor to the sitting prime minister. The no-trust motion will be submitted soon after the PPP finalises its candidate. A PPP source said there was ‘no hurry’ to form the new government, adding that the PML-N’s decision not to join the treasury benches was “its democratic right”. The party insists it will move ahead “with consensus”. According to sources, a detailed charge sheet highlighting the AJK prime minister’s alleged governance failures has been prepared. These complaints include his failure to consult cabinet members, his harsh attitude toward bureaucracy, and cuts to development funds for ministers and assembly members. His unilateral decisions and weak handling of public protests have reportedly deepened dissatisfaction within the coalition. In a related development, Faryal Talpur, head of the PPP’s women wing and the AJK political affairs wing, called on AJK President Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry to seek support from six members of the forward bloc belonging to his group. She discussed matters pertaining to formation of the new government in Azad Kashmir during the meeting. Speaking to Dawn , PML-N leader Mushtaq Minhas clarified that if the Azad Jammu and Kashmir prime minister resigns, the party will not vote for the PPP candidate, though it will support a no-confidence motion, if tabled. He said the PML-N had been seeking Anwarul Haq’s removal for the past six months over governance concerns. PTI to file references Meanwhile, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has decided to file references against its defected members who have joined other parties or plan to support the no-confidence motion. PTI AJK President Abdul Qayyum Niazi held consultations with Opposition Leader Khawaja Farooq Ahmed and summoned the party’s legal team. According to sources, references will be filed under Section 30 of the Elections Act 2020, which allows the disqualification of members who switch parties. PTI had earlier sent a reference to the speaker against four members — Akmal Sargala, Rafiq Nayyar, and Ali Shan Soni among them. Now, 12 members of the PTI forward bloc who have joined the PPP could face disqualification if they vote for the no-confidence motion. Published in Dawn, October 29th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped out on attending an Asean summit in Malaysia to avoid broaching the issue of Pakistan in a possible meeting with United States President Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Modi had backtracked from his proposed visit to Malaysia over the weekend to attend an Asean summit and opted to join the discussions “virtually” instead. The opposition Congress party had blamed the change of plan on Modi’s fear of meeting Trump. The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, was held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur. “Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stayed away from a regional leaders summit in Malaysia this week to avoid meeting US President Donald Trump and having a possible discussion about Pakistan,” people familiar with the matter said. “Officials in the government were apprehensive that Trump would repeat his claim that he mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day armed conflict in May, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private,” Bloomberg reported about the alleged actual reason behind the skipping out on the summit. It added that Modi was campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the crucial Bihar election and he “didn’t want to risk a meeting with Trump that could end up being embarrassing for the prime minister, the people said. “Modi is the main face of his party’s campaign in Bihar state and any comments by Trump, especially regarding Pakistan, could be used by the prime minister’s rivals against him and damage his party’s chances at the polls, they said.” Bloomberg similarly reported in August that Modi had turned down an invitation from Trump to visit the White House over concern that he would set up a meeting with Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil. Also fueling the tensions has been Trump’s insistence of ending the May conflict between Pakistan and India — something that New Delhi adamantly refuses still. Earlier today, Trump again stated that seven aircraft were shot down during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India in May. Tensions between Pakistan and India escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” which targeted sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory operation called “Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.",

      "summary_orig": "More than 2,650 electronic challans have been issued by the Karachi Traffic Police following the inauguration of the new e-ticketing system in the city. In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred. The decision came amid the port city witnessing a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data. The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates. According to a press release by the Sindh police dated October 28, 1,535 challans have been issued for not wearing a seat belt, 507 challans for riding a motorcycle without a helmet, 419 for over speeding, 166 for running a red light, and 32 for using a mobile phone while driving. Moreover, per the press release, seven challans were issued for putting tints on vehicle windows, five challans each for improper parking and parking in a no-parking zone, four for stop line violation, and three each for lane line violation and driving on the wrong way. On the day of the inauguration, work was underway to further improve the technical aspects of the system, after which the e-challan system was activated, according to the press release. The statement quoted the Deputy Inspector General Traffic as saying that this system is an “important milestone” in effective monitoring and ensuring compliance with traffic rules among citizens. “With public cooperation, this system is being further improved. Citizens are urged to fully comply with traffic rules so that the traffic system in the city can be improved and accidents can be reduced,” said the statement. Earlier this month, Inspector General (IG) of Sindh Police Ghulam Nabi Memon said the biggest problem in the metropolis is a lack of trained drivers, who are also responsible for tragic accidents. Meanwhile, Additional IG of Karachi Javed Alam Odho said a faceless e-ticketing system would end abuse of powers by police and their negative attitude towards the public.",

      "summary_orig": "American forces killed 14 people in strikes that destroyed four alleged drug-smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean, United States Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday, bringing the death toll from Washington’s anti-narcotics campaign to at least 57. The United States began carrying out the strikes — which experts say are illegal — in early September , and has now destroyed at least 14 vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific. “A total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes, with one survivor. All strikes were in international waters with no US forces harmed,” Hegseth said in a post on X about strikes carried out the day before. “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” he said. The Pentagon chief’s post included video of the strikes, the first of which targeted two stationary boats that appeared to be moored together, and the other two on vessels that were speeding across open water. Hegseth said that US Southern Command “immediately” started searching for the sole survivor of the strikes, and that Mexican authorities “accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue”. He did not specify what happened to the survivor or if the person was found. “We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them,” Hegseth said of drug traffickers. Washington has carried out a major buildup of military forces in Latin America that it says is aimed at countering drug trafficking, deploying seven US Navy warships as well as F-35 stealth jets and ordering the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group to the region. Regional tensions have flared as a result of the strikes and the military buildup, with Venezuela accusing the United States of plotting to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro, who has accused Washington of “fabricating a war“.",

      "summary_orig": "An Indian national was charged with an assault on a flight travelling from Chicago to Germany, according to a press release issued by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday. The DoJ stated that Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli, 28, stabbed two teenagers with a metal fork and was arrested on October 25 after the flight was diverted to Boston. He was charged in the US District Court with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm. “According to the charging documents, on October 25, 2025, while on board Lufthansa flight 431 en route from Chicago to Frankfurt, Germany, Usiripalli allegedly stabbed a 17-year-old male passenger (Minor A) in the shoulder area with a metal fork,” the statement read. “Usiripalli then allegedly stabbed a second 17-year-old male passenger (Minor B) in the back of the head with the same metal fork.” The DoJ said that when flight crew members attempted to subdue Usiripalli, he reportedly raised his hand, formed a gun with his fingers, put it in his mouth and pulled an imaginary trigger. “Immediately afterwards, Usiripalli allegedly turned toward a female passenger to his left and slapped her with his hand. Usiripalli also allegedly attempted to slap a flight crew member,” the statement read. “As a result of the disturbance, the flight was diverted to Boston Logan International Airport, where Usiripalli was immediately taken into custody.” The department added that while Usiripalli was admitted to the US on a student visa, it added that he presently does not have any legal status in the country. “The charge of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm while travelling on an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000,” the statement read.",

      "summary_orig": "At least six suspects were killed in four separate encounters with the Crime Control Department (CCD) in different locations of Lahore late on Monday, the CCD said on Tuesday. Earlier this year, the Punjab government launched the CCD with a mandate to tackle organised crime, terrorism, and high-profile criminal gangs. Recently, the body has carried out a range of encounters. Officials have publicly praised the department for its successes, claiming it has “significantly reduced street crime and targeted major criminal figures.” As per a statement issued by the department’s spokesperson today, “CCD teams conducted four different encounters in Lahore’s Nishtar Colony, Green Town, Harbanspura, and Ring Road, where six suspects were killed.” In the first instance, in Nishtar Colony, the CCD team came under attack while they were out to arrest the suspects, the statement said. “An exchange of fire ensued, leaving two suspects dead by their associates’ fire,” the CCD said, adding that the “deceased had been involved in theft, previous encounters with the police, murder, and attempted murder.” In a separate incident that took place in Green Town, a detained suspect was killed by his own associates, it said, adding that two suspects were killed in an encounter on Ring Road as they were attempting to rob citizens, it added. The CCD spokesperson said, “The suspects opened fire on the police team. Two were killed while another two managed to escape.” In the fourth encounter that took place in the Harbasnpura area, one of the suspects died after sustaining severe injuries during an exchange of fire with the police, the statement said. “The injured suspect was taken to the hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries,” the CCD added. Rising number of ‘encounters’ The mounting death toll during the encounters has sparked concerns among legal experts and civil society. On October 14, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed deep alarm at the “growing normalisation” of police encounters, a pattern it says has become entrenched since the establishment of CCD as a special wing of the Punjab Police in February 2025. The rights body highlighted that the “trend undermines the rule of law and constitutional guarantees of due process.” According to data compiled by the HRCP, the province has witnessed more than 500 alleged encounters since January 2025, resulting in over 670 fatalities — a figure higher than in any other province. Human rights monitors allege that extrajudicial killings are being used as a substitute for the criminal justice system. Critics argue that the encounters often follow a similar narrative: a suspect is located, they open fire on police, and are subsequently killed in the ensuing shootout, leaving no possibility for arrest, investigation, or trial.",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday again stated that seven aircraft were shot down during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India in May. Addressing a dinner with business leaders during his trip to Japan, Trump claimed that a lot of the wars he stopped were because of his tariffs imposed on multiple countries, stating that he did “a great service to the world”. “If you look at India and Pakistan, they were going at it,” he said. “Seven brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down. “I said to [Indian] Prime Minister Modi and I said to the Prime Minister [Shehbaz Sharif], very nice man, a very good man and the Field Marshal [Asim Munir] over in Pakistan … I said, ‘look we’re not going to do any trade if you’re going to be fighting’,” Trump said. “We said ‘no, we’re not doing any deals if you’re going to fight’ and within 24 hours that was the end of that. It was amazing, actually,” he added. “I think trade is responsible for 70 per cent of the fact that we didn’t have wars.” The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale .

      "title_orig": "Peshawar corps commander visited to congratulate me, says KP CM Sohail Afridi",
      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Tuesday said that the Peshawar corps commander visited the CM Secretariat earlier to “congratulate” him. The CM shared this information while speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court, where he was also asked what the two had discussed during the meeting. “He came to congratulate me, and it was not an official [exchange]. The conversation was unofficial. And our stance is the same [everywhere], what we say inside is what we say outside,” Afridi replied. Responding to a follow-up question, he further explained that he was the chief executive of a province and even the inspector general of police and the chief secretary had visited his office. Similarly, he continued, “the corps commander will also come there, and the officers of all of our security institutions will also come. We will discuss matters pertaining to the province with them.” Apparently referring to security officials, he said they should visit the chief ministers and the prime minister’s office instead of the office holders going to them. The CM also stressed that his government’s stance would be the same as that of the PTI and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan. Imran, who was has been in jail since 2023, had blamed former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa for an alleged conspiracy that resulted in his ouster as the prime minister via a no-confidence vote in April 2022. Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “sabotaging” meetings with him. Meanwhile, several PTI supporters have also been facing military trials and convictions following violent protests on May 9, 2023, over Imran’s arrest, during which civilian and military properties and installations were vandalised. The PTI has also been opposing military operations in KP, even though Afridi’s immediate predecessor as the provincial chief executive, Ali Amin Gandapur, had deviated from the party line in the past and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military. Gandapur was removed as the CM earlier this month on Imran’s directive while the PTI had named Afridi as his potential replacement. Later, Afridi was elected as the CM on October 13. Three days before his election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership. In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations? ‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’ Regarding another question about the change in KP leadership and how it might signal a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR stated that the establishment is itself a part of the state. “Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’ ‘Courts held hostage’ Speaking outside the SC today, KP CM Afridi alleged that courts had been “held hostage” since April 9, 2022, when Imran was ousted as the premier . “We are firmly standing alongside the judges who want to deliver justice,” he said, regretting that a superintended was disregarding judges’ directives — an apparent reference to relevant authorities not allowing him to meet Imran in jail despite court orders. He said his name was in the visitor’s list for Imran today, adding that if he was denied a meeting even today, he would wait for the court’s decision.",

This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’ ‘Courts held hostage’ Speaking outside the SC today, KP CM Afridi alleged that courts had been “held hostage” since April 9, 2022, when Imran was ousted as the premier . “We are firmly standing alongside the judges who want to deliver justice,” he said, regretting that a superintended was disregarding judges’ directives — an apparent reference to relevant authorities not allowing him to meet Imran in jail despite court orders. He said his name was in the visitor’s list for Imran today, adding that if he was denied a meeting even today, he would wait for the court’s decision.",

      "summary": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Tuesday said that the Peshawar corps commander visited the CM Secretariat earlier to “congratulate” him. The CM shared this information while speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court, where he was also asked what the two had discussed during the meeting. “He came to congratulate me, and it was not an official [exchange]. The conversation was unofficial. And our stance is the same [everywhere], what we say inside is what we say outside,” Afridi replied. Responding to a follow-up question, he further explained that he was the chief executive of a province and even the inspector general of police and the chief secretary had visited his office. Similarly, he continued, “the corps commander will also come there, and the officers of all of our security institutions will also come. We will discuss matters pertaining to the province with them.” Apparently referring to security officials, he said they should visit the chief ministers and the prime minister’s office instead of the office holders going to them. The CM also stressed that his government’s stance would be the same as that of the PTI and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan. Imran, who was has been in jail since 2023, had blamed former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa for an alleged conspiracy that resulted in his ouster as the prime minister via a no-confidence vote in April 2022. Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “sabotaging” meetings with him. Meanwhile, several PTI supporters have also been facing military trials and convictions following violent protests on May 9, 2023, over Imran’s arrest, during which civilian and military properties and installations were vandalised. The PTI has also been opposing military operations in KP, even though Afridi’s immediate predecessor as the provincial chief executive, Ali Amin Gandapur, had deviated from the party line in the past and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military. Gandapur was removed as the CM earlier this month on Imran’s directive while the PTI had named Afridi as his potential replacement. Later, Afridi was elected as the CM on October 13. Three days before his election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership. In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations? ‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’ Regarding another question about the change in KP leadership and how it might signal a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR stated that the establishment is itself a part of the state. “Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state?
