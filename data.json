      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: At least 31 people were killed and another 169 injured when an explosion ripped through an imambargah during Friday prayers in the federal capital, according to a district administration spokesperson. The explosion occurred at Imambargah Khadijah al-Kubra in the Tarlai area of the federal capital. Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris, and panicked worshippers. Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the imambargah as people called for help. Islamabad Capital Territory Police Spokesperson Taqi Jawad said it was too soon to ascertain the nature of the blast. However, he indicated that the signs pointed to a suicide bomber. Taqi added that among those killed was the cousin of Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, while another relative was injured. The district administration spokesperson said the site of the blast was completely sealed off by security personnel, and added that assistant commissioners were assigned to oversee the treatment of the injured at various hospitals. Meanwhile, police and Rescue 1122 personnel reached the site of the incident and initiated rescue operations after the explosion. An emergency was also imposed at the federal capital’s Polyclinic, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), and CDA Hospital. Security personnel stand guard outside an imambargah following an explosion, in Islamabad on February 6, 2026. —AFP On the directives of the executive director Pims, an emergency was enforced at the hospital, a spokesperson confirmed to Dawn . The hospital administration appealed to citizens to donate blood. The main emergency, orthopaedic, burn centre, and neurology departments have been activated, he added. The attack comes as Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev is currently visiting Pakistan. Ambulances dispatched to Islamabad Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in a post on X, said the provincial government had dispatched 25 ambulances to Islamabad. She added that all hospitals across Rawalpindi district had been placed on high alert with “surgical teams, anesthetists, orthopedic and neurosurgical specialists on standby”. “Blood banks are fully staffed, and operation theatres are fully equipped to ensure prompt and effective medical care for the injured.” Maryam added that the commissioner and deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi were also instructed to extend every possible assistance. Condemnations pour in President Asif Ali Zardari extended condolences to the victims who lost their lives in the blast, according to a statement issued by the PPP on X. He expressed grief over the incident, saying, “Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity”. The president prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to them. In a statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the blast, AFP reported. He expressed “deep grief” and “strongly condemns” the blast. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also condemned the “cowardly suicide attack on innocent worshippers during Friday prayers at a Shia imambargah in Islamabad, killing dozens”. “Targeting places of worship and civilians is a heinous crime against humanity and a blatant violation of Islamic principles,” he said. Dar further said, “Pakistan stands united against terrorism in all its forms. This barbarity will not intimidate us and extremists will be brought to full account.” Today’s incident comes less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast. This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters.",

Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris and panicked worshippers. The attack was widely condemned by political leaders and foreign diplomats, who labelled the incident “abhorrent” and “a direct attack on humanity, religion and social values”. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal strongly condemned the “cowardly” attack, writing on X that his heart went out to the victims’ families. “Pakistan stands united against terrorism — we will bring the perpetrators to justice,” he added. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry strongly condemned the attack in a post on X, expressing grief over the loss of lives in the “cowardly act”. He extended condolences to the bereaved families and prayed for the recovery of the injured. “Such acts of terrorism cannot dampen the morale of the nation. The need of the hour is that we all stand united for peace, tolerance, and stability, and express solidarity with law enforcement agencies,” the minister stressed. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed deep sadness over the incident, extending “prayers for the swift recovery of the injured, and may Allah grant patience and strength to all those affected”. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari strongly condemned the blast and called targeting citizens in a mosque “an attack on humanity, religion, and the national conscience”, according to a statement from the PPP. “No religion or ideology permits the murder of innocent people,” he was quoted as saying. “Terrorism in all its forms is an attack on Pakistan’s unity and values.” Bilawal demanded that an immediate and transparent investigation of the incident be conducted, and the “perpetrators and their facilitators [be] brought to justice”. He added that effective measures must be put in place to protect places of worship and stressed that the nation must stand united against “hatred, extremism, and terrorism”. Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the incident. “Such an incident of terrorism in the federal capital is not just a proof of the grave failure to protect human lives, but it also is a big question mark on the performance of the administration and law enforcement agencies,” he said in a post on X. Abbas strongly condemned the attack and extended condolences to the families of the deceased. “Targeting places of worship is a direct attack on humanity, religion and social values, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” he said. He also appealed to the youth in Islamabad to donate blood at hospitals and “play their part in saving precious lives”. British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott took to X and extended her thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families. “Outraged and heartbroken by the horrific attack at Imambargah in Islamabad during Friday prayers,” she said. “Such violence is abhorrent. We stand with Pakistan. Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the incident in a post on X on behalf of the government and the people Iran. “On behalf of the government and the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I strongly condemn the hideous and awkward terrorist attack in Islamabad during the Friday prayers, which led to the martyrdom and injury of tens of innocent civilians.” “I extend my sincere and deepest condolences and sympathy to the government and the people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Thursday rejected an offer from his Russian counterpart to voluntarily extend the caps on strategic nuclear weapons deployments after the treaty that held them in check expired. “Rather than extend ‘New START … we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved and modernised Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. Arms control advocates warn that the expiration of the treaty will fuel an accelerated nuclear arms race, while US opponents say the pact constrained the US ability to deploy enough weapons to deter nuclear threats posed by both Russia and China. Trump’s post was in response to a proposal by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the sides to adhere for a year to the 2010 accord’s limit of 1,550 warheads on 700 delivery systems — missiles, aircraft and submarines. New START was the last in a series of arms control treaties between the world’s two largest nuclear weapons powers dating back more than half a century to the Cold War. It allowed for only a single extension, which Putin and former US President Joe Biden agreed to for five years in 2021. In his post, Trump called New START “a badly negotiated deal” that he said “is being grossly violated,” an apparent reference to Putin’s 2023 decision to halt on-site inspections and other measures designed to reassure each side that the other was complying with the treaty. Putin cited US support for Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion as the reason for his decision. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the US would continue talks with Russia. Both sides signals openness to talks Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was still ready to engage in dialogue with the US if Washington responded constructively to Putin’s proposal. “Listen, if there are any constructive replies, of course we will conduct a dialogue,” Peskov told reporters. The UN has urged both sides to restore the treaty. Besides setting numerical limits on weapons, New START included inspection regimes experts say served to build a level of trust and confidence between the nuclear adversaries, helping make the world safer. If nothing replaces the treaty, security analysts see a more dangerous environment with a higher risk of miscalculation. Forced to rely on worst-case assumptions about the other’s intentions, the US and Russia would see an incentive to increase their arsenals, especially as China plays catch-up with its own rapid nuclear build-up. Trump has said he wants to replace New START with a better deal, bringing in China. But Beijing has declined negotiations with Moscow and Washington. It has a fraction of their warhead numbers — an estimated 600, compared with around 4,000 each for Russia and the US Repeating that position on Thursday, China said the expiration of the treaty was regrettable, and urged the US to resume dialogue with Russia on “strategic stability.” Uncertainly over treaty expiry date There was confusion over the exact timing of the expiry, but Peskov said it would be at the end of Thursday. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Moscow’s assumption was that the treaty no longer applied and both sides were free to choose their next steps. It said Russia was prepared to take “decisive military-technical countermeasures to mitigate potential additional threats to national security” but was also open to diplomacy. That warning was in apparent response to the possibility that Trump could expand US nuclear deployments by reversing steps taken to comply with New START, including reloading warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched missiles from which they were removed. A bipartisan congressionally appointed commission in 2023 recommended that the US develop plans to reload some or all of its reserve warheads, saying the country should prepare to fight simultaneous wars with Russia and China. Ukraine, which has been at war with Russia since Moscow’s 2022 invasion, said the treaty’s expiry was a consequence of Russian efforts to achieve the “fragmentation of the global security architecture” and called it “another tool for nuclear blackmail to undermine international support for Ukraine.” Strategic nuclear weapons are the long-range systems that each side would use to strike the other’s capital, military and industrial centres in the event of a nuclear war. They differ from so-called tactical nuclear weapons that have a lower yield and are designed for limited strikes or battlefield use. If left unconstrained by any agreement, Russia and the US could each, within a couple of years, deploy hundreds more warheads, experts say. “Transparency and predictability are among the more intangible benefits of arms control and underpin deterrence and strategic stability,” said Karim Haggag, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.",

      "title_orig": "PTI again approaches Supreme Court seeking Imran’s medical report, visitation rights",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Friday again approached the Supreme Court (SC) seeking party founder Imran Khan’s medical report and visitation rights for his personal doctors and family members. Days after reports regarding the treatment of Imran emerged in mainstream media, the government last week admitted that the former premier was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad. Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, expressing concern over Imran’s health, said that the party had submitted a memorandum to the registrar requesting access to Imran for his personal doctors, as well as requesting his medical report. The memorandum, a copy of which is available with Dawn , reiterated the PTI’s request that “immediate access to Mr Imran Khan be provided to his family, doctors, lawyers and friends”. Gohar said that this was the “10th time” the party was approaching the apex court about Imran and that they had approached the high courts 16 times as well. Gohar said that Imran’s health was a “very important issue, not just for PTI’s parliamentarians but for the whole country and every Pakistani”. The party chairman said that until now, they had not received information on Imran’s medical reports and the procedure that he recently underwent. “In the middle of this, Tuesday and Thursday passed by,” Gohar added. “Still, there was no meeting of Imran with either family members or lawyers, nor his personal physician or doctors.” According to Gohar, although National Assembly Opposition Leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai had written a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif seeking his “personal intervention” for Imran’s medical examination by his “trusted” doctors, there had been no answer. Hence, he said, the PTI was again requesting the chief justice to make sure that not only would the party receive the report about the jailed leader, but his doctors would be able to meet with him as quickly as possible, for the peace of mind of “his family, the party and the whole country”. “This is our minimum,” he said. Speaking to Geo News last week, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said the former premier was taken to Pims for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24. He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”. The PTI had previously condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed and denying him access to personal physicians. Special assistant to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, Shafi Jan, said last week that the sudden transfer “was deeply concerning and raised serious questions”. On Friday, PTI members had staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad, including KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in an effort to facilitate a meeting between Imran and his personal physicians. After the protest, the party said that Imran’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.",

The memorandum, a copy of which is available with Dawn , reiterated the PTI’s request that “immediate access to Mr Imran Khan be provided to his family, doctors, lawyers and friends”. Gohar said that this was the “10th time” the party was approaching the apex court about Imran and that they had approached the high courts 16 times as well. Gohar said that Imran’s health was a “very important issue, not just for PTI’s parliamentarians but for the whole country and every Pakistani”. The party chairman said that until now, they had not received information on Imran’s medical reports and the procedure that he recently underwent. “In the middle of this, Tuesday and Thursday passed by,” Gohar added. “Still, there was no meeting of Imran with either family members or lawyers, nor his personal physician or doctors.” According to Gohar, although National Assembly Opposition Leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai had written a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif seeking his “personal intervention” for Imran’s medical examination by his “trusted” doctors, there had been no answer. Hence, he said, the PTI was again requesting the chief justice to make sure that not only would the party receive the report about the jailed leader, but his doctors would be able to meet with him as quickly as possible, for the peace of mind of “his family, the party and the whole country”. “This is our minimum,” he said. Speaking to Geo News last week, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said the former premier was taken to Pims for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24. He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”. The PTI had previously condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed and denying him access to personal physicians. Special assistant to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, Shafi Jan, said last week that the sudden transfer “was deeply concerning and raised serious questions”. On Friday, PTI members had staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad, including KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in an effort to facilitate a meeting between Imran and his personal physicians. After the protest, the party said that Imran’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran and the United States commenced high-stakes negotiations in Oman on Friday over Tehran’s nuclear programme, but a dispute over the agenda suggests progress will be hard won amid the threat of a regional Middle East war. While both sides have signaled readiness to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West, Washington wants the talks to cover Iran’s nuclear programme, its ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and its “treatment of their own people”, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday. Iran has said it wants Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss only nuclear issues in Muscat. Iran’s foreign minister called on Friday for “mutual respect” ahead of talks with the United States on the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme and other issues. “Iran enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year. We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X. “Commitments need to be honored. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric – they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement. “ Tehran said it will engage in the talks “with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue”. “We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Thursday. Tehran’s leadership remains deeply concerned that US President Donald Trump may still carry out his threats to strike Iran amid a buildup by the US Navy near Iran. The US naval buildup, which Trump has called a massive “armada” , has followed a bloody government crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran last month, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday told reporters that Trump was looking to determine whether a deal can be struck but also issued a warning. “While these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at his disposal, aside from diplomacy as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world,” she added. Trump has warned that “bad things“ would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of airstrikes. Iran has warned it would respond harshly to any military strike and has cautioned neighbouring countries hosting US bases that they could be in the firing line if they were involved in an attack. “It’s very difficult to see them conceding enough in talks tomorrow for the US credibly to be able to claim that it’s made a breakthrough. And this is where I think, military conflict is more likely than not,” Edmund Fitton-Brown, senior fellow at Washington-based think-tank FDD, said. Uranium enrichment Negotiators in Oman will have to navigate Iran’s red line on discussing its missile programme to reach a deal and avert future military action. Tehran has flatly ruled out talks on its “defence capabilities, including missiles and their range.” Hours before the talks, Iran’s state TV said that “one of the country’s most advanced long-range ballistic missile Khorramshahr 4” has been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guards’ vast underground missile complexes. However, Tehran is willing to show “flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution,” Iranian officials told Reuters last week. Iran also insists that its right to enrich uranium is not negotiable. Iran says its nuclear activities are meant for peaceful, not military purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons. In June, the US struck Iranian nuclear targets , joining in the final stages of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said its uranium enrichment work has stopped. Tehran’s influence throughout the region has been severely weakened by Israel’s attacks on its regional allies - known as the “Axis of Resistance” – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. US asks citizens to ‘leave Iran now’ Meanwhile, in a travel advisory issued by the US virtual embassy in Tehran dated February 6, US citizens residing in Iran were urged to “consider departing Iran by land to Armenia or Turkiye if safe to do so”. The advisory noted that “increased security measures, road closures, public transportation disruptions, and internet blockages” were going on in Iran. “The government of Iran continues to restrict access to mobile, landline, and national internet networks. Airlines continue to limit or cancel flights to and from Iran,” it added. The advisory outlined several actions for US citizens to take, including asking them to “leave Iran now”. “Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on US government help,” it said. In case they are unable to leave, the advisory advised US citizens to “find a secure location within your residence or another safe building. “Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items,” it added. “Avoid demonstrations, keep a low profile, and stay aware of your surroundings. “Monitor local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans,” it said.",

In a post on X, the US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA) said it stood “steadfast with Pakistan” in the wake of the attacks, which it described as “horrific”.

According to the ISPR, 36 civilians, including women and children, were killed during the violence, while 22 security forces and law enforcement personnel also lost their lives. It added that a substantial cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered during the operations. The attacks have also drawn condemnation from the United Nations, with UN officials earlier expressing concern over the violence and stressing the need to hold those responsible accountable.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed 24 terrorists in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released on Friday. “On 4-5 February 2026, twenty four khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” said the statement from the military’s media wing. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Two intelligence-based operations were conducted in the province’s Orakzai and Khyber districts. During the operation conducted in Orakzai district, troops engaged the terrorists and killed 14. While in Khyber, during the conduct of another IBO, security forces killed 10 terrorists. “On reported presence of khwarij, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in Orakzai District. During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen khwarij were sent to hell,” said the ISPR, adding that “ten more khwarij were effectively neutralised” in Khyber. Following the engagements, security forces conducted sanitization operations in the areas “to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area”. The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism operation “under [the] vision [of] “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. Earlier in January, 11 terrorists were killed in two separate IBOs in KP. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.",

      "summary": "Security forces killed 24 terrorists in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released on Friday. “On 4-5 February 2026, twenty four khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” said the statement from the military’s media wing. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Two intelligence-based operations were conducted in the province’s Orakzai and Khyber districts. During the operation conducted in Orakzai district, troops engaged the terrorists and killed 14. While in Khyber, during the conduct of another IBO, security forces killed 10 terrorists. “On reported presence of khwarij, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in Orakzai District. During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen khwarij were sent to hell,” said the ISPR, adding that “ten more khwarij were effectively neutralised” in Khyber. Following the engagements, security forces conducted sanitization operations in the areas “to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area”. The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism operation “under [the] vision [of] “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.

      "title_orig": "Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry assails proposed quarterly power tariff hike",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has protested against the proposed positive quarterly tariff adjustments (QTA) sought by power distribution companies (Discos), arguing that the claims are based on flawed data and that costs should, in fact, have declined. In a letter to Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Leghari and the chairman and members of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), FPCCI Research Team Head Rehan Javed said a select group of consumers was given a benefit of Rs1.53 billion under a cheaper incremental consumption package in December 2025, but this resulted in an additional burden of about Rs6.6bn on consumers nationwide. He said Discos were claiming a net national quarterly adjustment of Rs10.83bn for the second quarter of FY26 after accounting for capacity charges, transmission and use-of-system charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, the impact of transmission and distribution losses on fuel cost adjustment, and the incremental consumption package. Under Nepra’s uniform tariff mechanism, this amount would be socialised across about 28.75 billion units of national electricity sales for the quarter, translating into a system-wide impact of around 38 paise per unit. While Disco-wise adjustments ranged from a negative Rs5.1bn to a positive Rs5.6bn, these variations fully offset each other at the national level, leaving the consolidated per unit impact as the only outcome relevant for consumers. Mr Javed contended that a material portion of the quarterly adjustment did not stem from unavoidable cost variations but arose directly from the defective design of the incremental consumption package. He said the issue had been raised repeatedly in regulatory hearings, written submissions and stakeholder engagements, but continued implementation without correction raised serious concerns about policy responsiveness and governance. He said system data showed that national electricity demand had remained broadly flat at around 2,400-2,500 gigawatt hours per month from July 2025 onwards. Sales stood at about 2,439 GWh in Nov 2025 and 2,431 GWh in Dec 2025, confirming that no incremental demand had been generated. Despite this, around 600 GWh in Dec 2025 was billed at a discounted rate of Rs11.02 per unit below the normal tariff, using an outdated reference consumption of about 1,900 GWh from Dec 2023. As a result, base-load consumption was misclassified as incremental, and existing demand was merely repriced at a lower tariff, he said. While the reported benefit to selected industrial consumers, mainly in B3 and B4 categories, amounted to about Rs1.533bn, the resulting revenue shortfall was estimated at around Rs6.6bn. This shortfall neither reduced capacity payments nor increased system utilisation, nor did it generate additional energy sales, he said, adding that it would instead be passed on through quarterly adjustments and socialised across the entire consumer base, including those who received no benefit from the package. Mr Javed argued that had this Rs6.6bn revenue loss not occurred and the same energy been sold at the full tariff, the quarterly adjustment would have been lower by about 23 paise per unit. The Q2 adjustment of 38 paise per unit would then have fallen to roughly 15 paise per unit, demonstrating that more than half of the impact was policy-induced. Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026",

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has protested against the proposed positive quarterly tariff adjustments (QTA) sought by power distribution companies (Discos), arguing that the claims are based on flawed data and that costs should, in fact, have declined. In a letter to Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Leghari and the chairman and members of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), FPCCI Research Team Head Rehan Javed said a select group of consumers was given a benefit of Rs1.53 billion under a cheaper incremental consumption package in December 2025, but this resulted in an additional burden of about Rs6.6bn on consumers nationwide. He said Discos were claiming a net national quarterly adjustment of Rs10.83bn for the second quarter of FY26 after accounting for capacity charges, transmission and use-of-system charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, the impact of transmission and distribution losses on fuel cost adjustment, and the incremental consumption package. Under Nepra’s uniform tariff mechanism, this amount would be socialised across about 28.75 billion units of national electricity sales for the quarter, translating into a system-wide impact of around 38 paise per unit. While Disco-wise adjustments ranged from a negative Rs5.1bn to a positive Rs5.6bn, these variations fully offset each other at the national level, leaving the consolidated per unit impact as the only outcome relevant for consumers. Mr Javed contended that a material portion of the quarterly adjustment did not stem from unavoidable cost variations but arose directly from the defective design of the incremental consumption package. He said the issue had been raised repeatedly in regulatory hearings, written submissions and stakeholder engagements, but continued implementation without correction raised serious concerns about policy responsiveness and governance. He said system data showed that national electricity demand had remained broadly flat at around 2,400-2,500 gigawatt hours per month from July 2025 onwards. Sales stood at about 2,439 GWh in Nov 2025 and 2,431 GWh in Dec 2025, confirming that no incremental demand had been generated. Despite this, around 600 GWh in Dec 2025 was billed at a discounted rate of Rs11.02 per unit below the normal tariff, using an outdated reference consumption of about 1,900 GWh from Dec 2023.

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: British police have charged three more men in an investigation into a series of violent incidents targeting Pakistani dissidents in the United Kingdom, according to a statement released by the Metropolitan Police on Wednesday night. The latest charges bring the total number of people arrested in connection with the investigation to seven. The charges relate to attacks on properties in Cambridge and Chesham in late December 2025 and form part of a wider counter-terrorism investigation being led by Counter Terrorism Policing London. Although the police statement did not name the victims, earlier reports indicate that the arrests are linked to attacks reported by former Imran Khan adviser Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber-blogger Adil Raja. Adil Raja’s home was targeted on December 24, 2025, while Shahzad Akbar’s residence was attacked on December 24 and 31, 2025, and again on January 10, 2026. Following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service, Asaf Afsar, 38, of Birmingham; Liam McGarry, 24, of Warwickshire; and Mark Regan, 52, also of Birmingham, were charged on February 4 with conspiracy to assault and to occasion bodily harm. Mr Afsar and Mr Regan face two counts each, linked to incidents in both Chesham and Cambridge on December 24, 2025. Mr McGarry was charged with one count relating to the Cambridge incident on the same date. All three men were in police custody and appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. The men were arrested a day earlier, on February 3, as part of what police described as an “ongoing investigation” into alleged coordinated attacks. Two other men, aged 55 and 30, were also arrested in Birmingham and London, respectively, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault and criminal damage. Both have since been released on bail until May while inquiries continue. Police said the arrests in the West Midlands and Warwickshire were carried out with support from local forces and Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. Officers also conducted five searches across the West Midlands, Warwickshire and London. The latest charges bring the total number of people charged in the investigation to seven. Four other men were previously charged and are due to appear at the Old Bailey on Feb 13. Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026",

The Israeli military halted the roughly 40 boats in the Global Sumud Flotilla in October as they attempted to reach blockaded Gaza, arresting Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and more than 450 other participants. Organisers, who gathered at the foundation of the late South African leader Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg on Wednesday, said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt. “It is a cause … for those that want to rise and stand for justice and dignity for all,” Mandela’s grandson Mandla Mandela, who was among activists detained last time, told the gathering. “We want to mobilise the … global community to join forces with us.” Israeli officials repeatedly denou­nced last year’s mission, and previous smaller-scale attempts to reach Gaza by sea, as publicity stunts. Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents. Palestinians and international aid bodies say supplies reaching the enclave are still insufficient, despite a ceasefire reached in October which included guarantees of increased aid. Following the ceasefire, Israeli forces now control more than 53 per cent of Gaza Strip where they have ordered residents out. Nearly the entire population is crowded into a narrow strip along the coast, mostly living in makeshift tents and damaged buildings. If the flotilla is blocked again, the activists said it would still be worth it to highlight Gaza’s plight. “We may not have reached Gaza physically, (but) we have reached … the people in Gaza,” said one of the activists, Susan Abdallah. “They know that we care, that we will not stop at anything until we actually break the siege.” Settler attacks cause record displacement Violence and harassment by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank displaced nearly 700 Pales­tinians last month, the UN said on Thursday, the highest rate since the Gaza conflict erupted in Oct 2023. At least 694 Palestinians were forcefully driven from their homes last month, according to figures from the UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA, which compiles data from various United Nations agencies. The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said in late January that settler violence has become a key driver of forced displacement in Israeli-occupied West Bank. January’s numbers were particularly high in part due to the displacement of an entire herding community in the Jordan Valley, whose 130 families left after months of harassment. “What is happening today is the complete collapse of the community as a result of the settlers’ continuous and repeated attacks, day and night, for the past two years,” Farhan Jahaleen, a Bedouin resident, said at the time. Settlers in West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, use herding to establish a presence on agricultural lands used by Palestinian communities and gradually deny them access to these areas, according to a report by Israeli NGO Peace Now. To force Palestinians out, settlers resort to harassment, intimidation and violence, “with the backing of the Israeli government and military”, the settlement watchdog said. “No one is putting the pressure on Israel or on the Israeli authorities to stop this and so the settlers feel it, they feel the complete impunity that they’re just free to continue to do this”, said Allegra Pacheco, director of the West Bank Protection Consortium, a group of NGOs working to support Palestinian communities against displacement. She pointed to a lack of attention on the West Bank as another driving factor. “All eyes are focused on Gaza when it comes to Palestine, while we have an ongoing ethnic cleansing in the (occupied) West Bank and nobody’s paying attention to the West Bank,” she said. Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank is home to around 490,000 Israelis living in settlements and outposts considered illegal under international law. Around three million Palestinians live in the territory. Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• US envoy says ‘significant work remains’ to end war • No update from any side on territorial dispute • Russia attacks Ukraine’s energy supplies ABU DHABI: Ukraine and Russia swapped over 300 prisoners following “productive” talks in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, as a US mediator conceded that “significant” work lay ahead in the quest for a broader deal to end the war. The negotiations are the latest bid in diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting — Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II, with hundreds of thousands killed, millions forced to flee their homes and much of eastern and southern Ukraine left decimated. As talks were underway, large swathes of the Ukrainian capital were still without heating in sub-zero temperatures, after successive Russian strikes knocked out energy supplies to hundreds of apartment blocks in Kyiv. “Today, delegations from the United States, Ukraine, and Russia agreed to exchange 314 prisoners — the first such exchange in five months,” US envoy Steve Witkoff said on social media during the second day of talks in Abu Dhabi. Russia’s defence ministry later confirmed the two sides changed 157 prisoners each. While Witkoff described the negotiations as “detailed and productive,” he dimmed hopes for a breakthrough saying “significant work remains”. On Wednesday, Kyiv had described the first day of negotiations as “substantive and productive”. Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev also said talks were going well. “There is definitely progress, things are moving forward in a good, positive direction,” he said. But there was no update from any side on the contentious issue of territory, or any sign of concession from Moscow, which entered the talks refusing to compromise on its key demands. The Russian envoy also slammed what he called attempts from European nations to “disrupt the progress,” without elaborating. In a rare official admission of battlefield losses, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday that at least 55,000 of his country’s troops had been killed since Russia invaded in February 2022 — a figure lower than many independent estimates. Russia has not disclosed how many of its soldiers have been killed. Tracking of obituaries and family announcements by the BBC and independent Mediazona outlet has found the names of more than 160,000 Russian soldiers killed in the conflict. ‘Concrete steps’ Ahead of the two-day talks, Russia launched its latest massive attack on Ukraine’s power infrastructure, leaving many people without power and shivering through temperatures as low as minus 20C. Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov said on Wednesday that “concrete steps and practical solutions” had been discussed in the first day of the talks. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters fighting would persist “until the Kyiv regime makes the appropriate decisions”. The main sticking point in the negotiations is the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine. Moscow is demanding that Kyiv pull its troops out of swathes of the Donbas, including heavily fortified cities atop vast natural resources, before any deal. It also wants international recognition that land seized in the invasion belongs to Russia. ‘Maintain pressure’ Kyiv has said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected a pull-back of forces. The talks in Abu Dhabi are the second round of trilateral negotiations between the US, Russia and Ukraine. US President Donald Trump has been pushing both sides to negotiate an end to the war since he returned to office, boasting he could strike a deal in hours. Zelensky said the US president’s role was crucial, telling French television in an interview that “Putin is only scared of Trump”. Trump could use economic sanctions against Russia or transfer weapons to Ukraine to “maintain this pressure on Putin”, Zelensky said. Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026",
