      "summary_orig": "US-mediated talks between Syria and Israel have resumed after an interruption of several months, Syria’s state news agency SANA reported on Monday, with Damascus seeking the withdrawal of Israeli troops from territory seized after the fall of Bashar al-Assad . Two diplomatic sources told AFP that the US-mediated talks were being held in Paris. SANA , citing a Syrian government source, said the Syrian delegation was led by Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani and intelligence chief Hussein al-Salama. The resumption of the talks reflects a push by Damascus to reclaim what it describes as its non-negotiable national rights, the source said. The discussions are focused on reviving a 1974 disengagement agreement that established a UN-monitored buffer zone between Israel and Syria after the 1973 Middle East war, SANA said. The United States has been pushing Syria and Israel to reach an agreement that would halt hostilities between the two countries, technically at war since 1948. Israeli troops advanced deeper across the border after Assad was toppled on Dec 8, 2024 by rebel fighters who assumed Syria’s leadership. Israel has also intervened in what it calls missions to protect the ethnic minority Druze in southwestern Syria. Syria is seeking an Israeli withdrawal to positions held before Assad was toppled, and wants a reciprocal security framework guaranteeing its sovereignty and preventing interference in its internal affairs. A Syrian official told Reuters last month that talks had been stalled since October, but that Syria expected a possible shift following a December 29 meeting between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Syrian official said Damascus considered Israel’s withdrawal from territory it took after Assad’s fall to be a “red line” and that Syria had been asked to consider a phased withdrawal by Israeli troops. “We’re not going to legitimise an Israeli presence in Syria or the Golan Heights for that matter,” the official said. Officials have met on several occasions, most recently in September, but Israel’s insistence on a demilitarised zone in southern Syria has been a major stumbling block. Last month, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the demand would endanger his country and urged Israel to respect the 1974 deal, which separated forces and maintained a ceasefire for decades, though formal peace was never achieved. Israeli positions in Syria as of Dec 10, 2024, from the Institute for the Study of War and AEI Critical Threats Project. — Reuters/File Syria’s leadership has also sought an end to Israeli air strikes and incursions. Israel has said it would conclude an agreement only on terms safeguarding its security interests, including demilitarisation of parts of southwestern Syria and protection for minority communities. It has yet to publicly commit to a full withdrawal to pre-2024 lines. EU chief to visit Syria this week Separately, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen will visit Syria later this week on her first trip to the country since the fall of Assad, spokeswoman Paula Pinho said today. Von der Leyen will head to Syria as part of a tour of the Middle East that will also see her visit Jordan and Lebanon, Pinho said. Von der Leyen’s visit to the devastated country comes as the international community seeks to bolster fragile efforts to rebuild a year after Assad’s downfall. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa , a former fighter who led Assad’s ouster, has been scrambling to boost support from abroad and shore up security. But the country remains in a perilous position and is still grappling with sectarian violence and the threat of the militant Islamic State group. The EU is a key financial donor for Damascus and has rolled back sanctions imposed during the civil war to try to boost reconstruction efforts.",

      "title_orig": "Maduro arrives for first US court appearance after capture",
      "summary_orig": "Deposed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro arrived at a New York court on Monday, just days after being seized in Caracas in a shock US military operation that paved the path for Washington’s plans to control the oil-rich country. Maduro, 63, faces narcotrafficking charges along with his wife, Cilia Flores. The pair were forcibly taken out of Caracas in a US assault on Saturday, in which commandos swooped in on helicopters, backed by fighter jets and naval forces, to capture them. On Monday morning, Maduro was escorted by heavily armed law enforcement officers to a courthouse in New York, having been transported by helicopter and armoured car. All eyes are on Venezuela’s response to the swiftly moving events, and late Sunday, interim leader Delcy Rodriguez stepped back from her initial defiance by offering to work with Trump. “We extend an invitation to the US government to work together on an agenda for cooperation ,” the former vice president said. Some 2,000 Maduro supporters, including rifle-wielding men on motorcycles, rallied Sunday in Caracas, with crowds shouting and waving Venezuelan flags. Deposed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro arrives at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, as he heads towards the Daniel Patrick Manhattan United States Courthouse for an initial appearance to face US federal charges in New York City, the US on January 5. — Reuters The Venezuelan military, loyal to Maduro, announced it recognised Rodriguez and urged calm. No Venezuela death toll has been announced, but Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said a “large part” of Maduro’s security team was killed “in cold blood”, as well as military personnel and civilians. Trump said late on Sunday that the United States was “in charge” of the South American nation, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that discussions of Venezuela holding elections following Maduro’s ouster were “premature.” ‘Need access to oil’ When asked what he needs from interim leader Rodriguez, Trump said: “We need total access. We need access to the oil and other things in their country that allow us to rebuild their country.” Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves , and more Venezuelan crude in the market could exacerbate oversupply concerns and add to recent pressure on prices. But analysts say that alongside other major questions about the South American country’s future, substantially lifting its oil production will not be easy, quick or cheap. Oil dipped as investors weighed the impact. The Trump administration says it retains economic leverage by blockading oil tankers from Venezuela. Trump has also threatened additional military attacks. While there are no known US forces left inside Venezuela, a huge naval presence, including an aircraft carrier , remains off the coast. Leading opposition figure Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia said that while the US intervention was “important,” without the release of political prisoners and acknowledgement that he won the 2024 election, it was simply “not enough.” Details of the US operation were still emerging Monday, with Havana saying 32 Cubans were killed in the attack and Trump adding that Cuba itself was ready to fall after Maduro’s capture. “I don’t think we need any action. It looks like it’s going down,” Trump said. The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session on Monday at Venezuela’s request. Maduro allies remain The White House indicated Sunday that it does not want regime change, only Maduro’s removal and a pliant new government — even if it is filled with his former associates. Anointed by his mentor Hugo Chavez before the latter’s 2013 death, Maduro kept a tight grip on power until his capture by US forces on Saturday. He ruled alongside Flores and three other powerful figures: Rodriguez, now Venezuela’s interim leader, her brother Jorge, and their rival, hardline Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. “It’s like a club of five,” a diplomatic source in Caracas told AFP under the condition of anonymity. This handout picture released by the Miraflores Palace press office shows Venezuela’s Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez (C) speaking next to Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez (C-L) and Venezuela’s Minister of Interior Relations, Justice, and Peace, Diosdado Cabello (C-R) during a council of ministers meeting at the Vice Presidency headquarters in Caracas, Venezuela on January 4. — AFP The US position leaves the Venezuelan opposition, which the Trump administration says was robbed of victory by Maduro, out in the cold. China, Russia and Iran, which have longstanding ties with Maduro’s government, were quick to condemn the operation. Some US allies, including the EU, expressed alarm. China called for Maduro to be “immediately released” in a condemnation of the US operation, which its foreign ministry said was a “clear violation of international law.” Iran said on Monday that its relations with close ally Venezuela remained unchanged and called for Maduro’s release. Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whose country neighbours Venezuela, called the US action an “assault on the sovereignty” of Latin America, which would lead to a humanitarian crisis. Petro rejected threats on Sunday of military action in Colombia made by Trump, who also accused the South American leader of drug trafficking.",

All eyes are on Venezuela’s response to the swiftly moving events, and late Sunday, interim leader Delcy Rodriguez stepped back from her initial defiance by offering to work with Trump. “We extend an invitation to the US government to work together on an agenda for cooperation ,” the former vice president said. Some 2,000 Maduro supporters, including rifle-wielding men on motorcycles, rallied Sunday in Caracas, with crowds shouting and waving Venezuelan flags. Deposed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro arrives at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, as he heads towards the Daniel Patrick Manhattan United States Courthouse for an initial appearance to face US federal charges in New York City, the US on January 5. — Reuters The Venezuelan military, loyal to Maduro, announced it recognised Rodriguez and urged calm. No Venezuela death toll has been announced, but Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said a “large part” of Maduro’s security team was killed “in cold blood”, as well as military personnel and civilians. Trump said late on Sunday that the United States was “in charge” of the South American nation, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that discussions of Venezuela holding elections following Maduro’s ouster were “premature.” ‘Need access to oil’ When asked what he needs from interim leader Rodriguez, Trump said: “We need total access. We need access to the oil and other things in their country that allow us to rebuild their country.” Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves , and more Venezuelan crude in the market could exacerbate oversupply concerns and add to recent pressure on prices. But analysts say that alongside other major questions about the South American country’s future, substantially lifting its oil production will not be easy, quick or cheap. Oil dipped as investors weighed the impact. The Trump administration says it retains economic leverage by blockading oil tankers from Venezuela. Trump has also threatened additional military attacks. While there are no known US forces left inside Venezuela, a huge naval presence, including an aircraft carrier , remains off the coast. Leading opposition figure Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia said that while the US intervention was “important,” without the release of political prisoners and acknowledgement that he won the 2024 election, it was simply “not enough.” Details of the US operation were still emerging Monday, with Havana saying 32 Cubans were killed in the attack and Trump adding that Cuba itself was ready to fall after Maduro’s capture. “I don’t think we need any action. It looks like it’s going down,” Trump said. The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session on Monday at Venezuela’s request. Maduro allies remain The White House indicated Sunday that it does not want regime change, only Maduro’s removal and a pliant new government — even if it is filled with his former associates. Anointed by his mentor Hugo Chavez before the latter’s 2013 death, Maduro kept a tight grip on power until his capture by US forces on Saturday. He ruled alongside Flores and three other powerful figures: Rodriguez, now Venezuela’s interim leader, her brother Jorge, and their rival, hardline Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. “It’s like a club of five,” a diplomatic source in Caracas told AFP under the condition of anonymity.

China, Russia and Iran, which have longstanding ties with Maduro’s government, were quick to condemn the operation. Some US allies, including the EU, expressed alarm. China called for Maduro to be “immediately released” in a condemnation of the US operation, which its foreign ministry said was a “clear violation of international law.” Iran said on Monday that its relations with close ally Venezuela remained unchanged and called for Maduro’s release.

Petro rejected threats on Sunday of military action in Colombia made by Trump, who also accused the South American leader of drug trafficking.",

Addressing a press conference alongside CTD Additional Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Ali Larik in Karachi, CTD Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ghulam Azfar Mahesar said that law enforcement agencies and the “premier intelligence agency” received information that terrorists were planning an attack to target the city. Mahesar said that the terrorists were planning to attack specific targets in Karachi to “destabilise” national security. He said that intelligence agencies, the Special Branch, the Intelligence Bureau as well as Sindh and Balochistan CTD designed a strategy to thwart these plans. He said that intelligence officials were deployed in different locations, while focusing on Karachi’s west region. Mahesar said that after several days of robust efforts, officials succeeded in getting information on a terrorist hideout in Raees Goth, Karachi, where terrorists had prepared a large amount of explosive material. He said that upon receiving the information, Sindh CTD and the “premier intelligence agency” conducted a joint raid. “We captured one terrorist, while three or four of them managed to escape the scene,“ he said. Mahesar affirmed that the agencies had initiated a search operation to ensure their capture. “The officials recovered a Mazda truck loaded with explosive materials,” he said. He said 30 drums filled with explosives, five cylinders filled with explosives, 2,000kg of explosives and detonators had been seized.

      "summary": "The Sindh Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Monday that a major terrorist attack had been averted in Karachi. Addressing a press conference alongside CTD Additional Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Ali Larik in Karachi, CTD Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ghulam Azfar Mahesar said that law enforcement agencies and the “premier intelligence agency” received information that terrorists were planning an attack to target the city. Mahesar said that the terrorists were planning to attack specific targets in Karachi to “destabilise” national security. He said that intelligence agencies, the Special Branch, the Intelligence Bureau as well as Sindh and Balochistan CTD designed a strategy to thwart these plans. He said that intelligence officials were deployed in different locations, while focusing on Karachi’s west region. Mahesar said that after several days of robust efforts, officials succeeded in getting information on a terrorist hideout in Raees Goth, Karachi, where terrorists had prepared a large amount of explosive material. He said that upon receiving the information, Sindh CTD and the “premier intelligence agency” conducted a joint raid. “We captured one terrorist, while three or four of them managed to escape the scene,“ he said. Mahesar affirmed that the agencies had initiated a search operation to ensure their capture. “The officials recovered a Mazda truck loaded with explosive materials,” he said. He said 30 drums filled with explosives, five cylinders filled with explosives, 2,000kg of explosives and detonators had been seized.

      "title_orig": "LOSING THE PESHAWAR THAT I ONCE KNEW",
      "summary_orig": "Landing in my birthplace always gives me the feeling of a tired child resting his head in his mother’s lap, the comfort that says I’m home. This time, the feeling was warmer, for I had brought with me the joy of my son’s wedding to share with my family and friends. It felt like returning to a celebration. But joy in this country is always fragile, more so in the border regions. The minute I touched down in Islamabad, news broke of yet another suicide attack — 12 killed, dozens injured. The headline cut through my heart before I even reached baggage claim. Still, I drove to Peshawar, to my roots. To the soil that has always known both happiness and heartbreak. The walls of Peshawar’s old qahwa khanas tea houses, which once echoed with Rehman Baba’s verses and the faces of film stars, are now filled with Quranic calligraphy, reflecting a changing moral and social landscape. When I reached home, the air was the same as when I left it. Dry, warm, filled with the scent of dust and bright sunshine. Children I once saw in school uniforms are now married. Cousins have grey hair. New faces sit where elders once did. But the streets have grown crowded, the tolerance thinner, the city restless. Yet, every corner still tells a story of life, and survival. And the unbreakable stubbornness of its people. A native returns to his home in what was once known as the ‘City of Flowers’ and tries to make sense of its slow erosion, over decades, of culture, tolerance and joy. Where the city once pulsed with music, cinema, dance, poetry and coexistence, it struggles today under the weight of fear, radicalisation and silence. Is the old Peshawar just destined to exist only in his memory? THE CITY THAT WAS Forty years ago, Peshawar was one of the most vibrant cultural cities in South Asia. What Paris had in sophistication, what New York had in artistic energy, my city had in its own distinct, confident way. A vendor on Peshawar’s Cinema Road pictured 30 years ago. I still remember my teenage days in a small village near Peshawar in the early 1980s. Back then, the city was alive with colour and melody, cinemas showing Pashto, Urdu, English and Punjabi films, the sound of the rabab floating through Dabgari Bazaar, and wedding nights throbbing with dance, drums and currency notes being showered over performers. Peshawar was a city of art, of scandal, of tradition and temptation. There were musicians’ streets, poetry festivals, bookshops and open-air performances that carried on late into the night. In the Saddar neighbourhood, Khyber Café served as the informal headquarters of Pakistan Television’s Peshawar Centre, where actors, poets, writers and producers gathered daily. A short walk away stood Saint John’s and Saint Cathedral churches, and beside them the historic Jamia Darvesh Mosque. A coexistence of faiths carved naturally into the city’s landscape. A worshipper sits inside the historic Mohabbat Khan Mosque. Amid fading frescoes and worn marble floors, the centuries-old mosque remains a place of solitude and devotion. In Kali Bari street, Muslim, Hindu and Christian families lived side-by-side in a harmony that felt permanent. Every year, the month-long Jashn-i-Khyber festival filled the night air with announcements and music from Peshawar Stadium’s loudspeakers. And in Dabgari Chowk, the celebrated Pashto ghazal singer Khyal Muhammad would perform all night in the middle of the road, surrounded by people who came for poetry, not politics. That was the Peshawar I grew up in: confident, open, generous. Painter and sculptor Arbab Muhammad Sardar in his gallery: in 1997, after receiving threats warning him against painting human faces and creating sculptures, he began removing his works from display. THE TRANSFORMATION But then came the Afghan war and Gen Ziaul Haq’s call for ‘jihad’. Overnight, Peshawar became the frontline of a global game. It turned into a Kalashnikov capital, a smuggler’s paradise, a city of spies and sudden millionaires. To own a gun was to be powerful, to fire it in the air was to be feared. Over decades, religious seminaries multiplied, public art vanished and cultural spaces disappeared or were muted. Suspicion replaced neighbourliness. Extremism was not an accident, it was a slow, deliberate recalibration of society, one that suffocated the city’s cultural lungs. Supporters of a religious political party burn an American flag during a protest at Peshawar’s Martyrs’ Monument, erected in memory of members of the non-violent Khudai Khidmatgar movement killed by British forces. The moment underscores the contrast between a site rooted in peaceful resistance and later waves of political anger shaped by global events. On my second day in the city, I photographed a young Islamist student wrapped in a white turban, wearing a light-brown Schott NYC US Army jacket. The irony hit me like a flash: an American brand on a madrassa [seminary] student. When I asked about it, he smiled and said it was his “trophy”. I didn’t ask more. He happily posed for a picture. That single moment pulled me 30 years back, to 1996, when the Taliban had just taken control of Afghanistan. Back then, they walked freely in Peshawar’s streets. The city was their resting ground, their moral laboratory. Tora Bora, Afghanistan: Foot soldiers rest during a pause in fighting. Some prepare for prayer, while one listens quietly to Indian songs on the All India Radio. Beyond labels such as Taliban or mujahid holy warrior, the image reveals the ordinary human contradictions of war — faith, fatigue, memory and music coexisting in a single moment. And here I was again, 30 years later — the same story, the same spirit, just new clothes and a different brand. I didn’t ask this young man about his ‘trophy’. Not because I was afraid, but because I understood that, in our land, questions can sometimes be louder than answers. History in this part of the world never moves forward — it keeps circling, dressing old beliefs in new symbols. A WALK ON CINEMA ROAD The afternoon light falls softly on Cinema Road, the street that once carried the heartbeat of the city. The air still smells of dust, tea and faint memories of songs that used to spill from cassette shops. My steps now echo where music once lived. Near the Sethi House, Peshawar’s old streets still carry the elegance of carved balconies, fading paint and narrow passages that once shaped everyday life. Caught between neglect and survival, these lanes stand as quiet witnesses to a city whose architectural memory is slowly slipping away. Inside a narrow tea shop, Jan Muhammad sits cross-legged beside his brass samovar. This was once the German Tea Shop, now everyone calls it Jan Muhammad Chai Khana. He pours boiling milk into cups, the sound of hissing steam blending with the low hum of conversation. He looks up and says, “Alhamdulillah [Praise be to Allah], the bazar is clean now, no obscenity, only business.” The clang of kettles and the breath of steam are all that remain from a time when this road was alive with sound, posters and film lights. There was a time when Cinema Road glowed every evening. Three proud cinema halls stood shoulder-to-shoulder: Picture House, Novelty and Tasweer Mahal. People knew them not by their official names but by what they looked like: Picture House was Makhamkh Cinema, the one in the front; Novelty was Manz Cinema, the middle one; and Tasweer Mahal was Pehla Cinema, the first one in the row. At Picture House Cinema on Cinema Road in the early 2000s, film billboards were altered during the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure, with female faces removed and only male actors left visible. The cinema itself has since been bulldozed, marking the physical erasure of a once-thriving cultural space from the city’s landscape. Crowds of young men filled the street. Truck drivers, students and visitors from the villages of Khyber, Charsadda, Mardan and Kohat. They came for the films, for the laughter, for the noise that made this road feel like a fair. Music shops lined both sides: Sherbaz Khan Music Centre, Shalimar and Gul Sattar Khan. Their cassette racks glimmered under yellow bulbs, filled with Pashto, Indian, Persian and English songs. The road itself throbbed like a radio tuned between worlds. The photo studios were tiny rooms where magic happened. A young man could pose and see himself printed beside Badar Munir, Musarrat Shaheen, Yasmin Khan or Suraya Khan — a small miracle made with scissors, negatives and glue. He would take that photo back to his hujra [communal space], proud and smiling, showing it as proof that he had met fame. Now those same shops sell PVC boards and stationery — the film stars are gone, but the cracked walls still remember them. And through Photoshopping now, young men opt to be transformed into images of militants, guns in hand and a rocket-launcher on the shoulder. A little ahead, the Tasweer Mahal lies buried under a 13-storey plaza. Novelty and Picture House have also been erased, bulldozed like memories no one asked to keep. Dust has replaced the crowd clamouring at the cinema gate, eager to get in. Only silence stands where the hero once leapt across the screen amidst applause from cine-goers. Further down stands the Aina Cinema, its doors half-open to… whom? The ‘Ladies Gate’ sign still hangs above the narrow staircase. Aina Cinema, once alive with music, colour and collective dreams, is now reduced to a parking lot. The ‘Pay Box’ lettering survives, though a car now blocks the view. And above, the mural of dancers and musicians — colours faded — still hangs on through the years. This hall once echoed with clapping hands and Pashto film dialogue. Now it rents its floor to cars. No one I ask says they miss those days. Maybe they have forgotten, maybe forgetting is easier. But for those who grew up in that sound and smoke, the loss runs deep — not just of cinemas, but of openness. An image from 1996 that captures the tension between public piety and private curiosity. There was a balance once. Faith and fun walking side by side. Falak Sair and Capital Cinemas in Saddar, the Takhtu Jumat mosque between them, Blue Bells Music Centre beside. Naz Cinema near Masjid Mahabat Khan and Cinema Road itself beside Madani Masjid of Namak Mandi. After Friday prayers, some men went to the cinema, some to Dabgari Bazar — both part of one rhythm that made the city move. In Peshawar’s Dabgari Bazaar, musicians traditionally kept their balcony windows open so passers-by could see and hire them. During the MMA provincial government’s campaign against music, pressure from authorities forced these windows shut. In this image from 2003, two musicians cautiously peer onto the street — a quiet moment reflecting how fear and regulation pushed a once public art into the shadows Evening falls again on Cinema Road. At Jan Muhammad’s shop, the kettles cool slowly and the tea tastes like nostalgia — thick, sweet and a little burnt. The steam curls upward like the city’s last song. The walls are cleaner now but quieter. We have built plazas and lost poetry, scrubbed away the music but not the memory. During the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure in KP in the early 2000s, cinema posters along Cinema Road were altered as female faces were removed or blacked out A CITY THAT WALKS THROUGH SMOKE The morning sun in Peshawar was pale and kind. And then, that morning, a car bomb. A suicide attacker struck right in front of the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters — formerly the Frontier Constabulary — in the heart of Saddar. The blast ripped through the stillness of an ordinary workday. A white Suzuki, packed with explosives, rammed the gate before a suicide bomber detonated himself. Within seconds, concrete dust, smoke and fear clouded the street. The echoes rolled beneath the overhead BRT [Bus Rapid Transit] track, bouncing between the concrete pillars that now bear the stains of shrapnel. Three FC personnel were martyred on the spot, several others were wounded. Under the overhead bridge, men gathered in silence. Children clutched schoolbags. Bikers slowed to watch the police lift the burned car with a forklift, its tires dangling mid-air. A haunting image of another day gone wrong. Nearby, an FC soldier stood guard over a blood-soaked shroud, staring at what little was left of the attacker. And yet, just a few hundred meters away, life went on. Shops re-opened, schools and offices stayed functional, and traffic crawled as usual. The people of Peshawar, hardened by decades of violence, carried on with that familiar numbness that only a city long at war can understand. By noon, the road was cleared. The glass shards on the asphalt shimmered like tiny memorials in the sunlight. For outsiders, it was a terror attack — for Peshawar, it was Monday. A security personnel member stands near the remains of a suicide bomber after an attack on the Frontier Corps headquarters on November 24, 2025 WALTZING WITH TERROR This November, when my son was getting married in New York, my sisters in Peshawar insisted to have a traditional nakreezy — a henna night with music and dance — in my hometown. They wanted a Pashto singer, someone whose voice could bring back even a trace of the old Peshawar. Our friend, the renowned Pashto singer Sarfaraz Afridi, offered to perform along with his young son, Arman Faraz. I wanted to host them on a stage worthy of artists, decorated with candles and roses. The way Peshawar once honoured its musicians. I visited 17 wedding halls. Everyone refused. “No live music,” they said. “It is a sin.” As if joy itself had become forbidden. As if melody threatened the order of things. So I built my own stage. On the rooftop of our four-storey family home, in the heart of our village, we placed speakers on all four sides. Not to provoke anyone, but to remind them of what had been forgotten. Sarfaraz and Arman performed until dawn. Their voices floated over our neighbourhood like a small rebellion. That night was my protest. My refusal to accept silence as the new normal. For the main wedding, I had invited a Khattak dance troupe, a symbol of Pakhtun identity and pride. The FC, whose dancers I had invited, was burying its own after the bomb attack. I assumed the performance would be cancelled. But on the wedding day, the troupe arrived. Still grieving. Still shaken. But determined. Their presence was more than entertainment — it was a declaration. A refusal to let terror dictate how people live, celebrate or express their culture. In front of 1,000 guests, their dance was a quiet but unmistakable act of defiance. For a brief moment, I saw my old Peshawar again. The dance troupe that performed at the wedding of the writer’s son. Just two days earlier, they had survived a bomb attack. THE UNHEARD SONGS In my father’s youth, in the 1960s, things were different. He told me that when women dancers were invited to weddings, they would first go to the women’s side of the house. Female hosts would welcome them with tea, speak kindly and drape a chador over their shoulders. A gesture of respect, of protection. Only then would the dancers step toward the hujra, escorted by male elders of the family. Before the music began, an elder would raise his hand and declare: “She is our guest. She has come to bring joy to our celebration. Respect her as you would respect your own daughter.” Those few words were like a royal decree, an invisible shield. No one dared misbehave, no one dared touch. That was Pashtunwali — the old code of honour that balanced pride with protection. A rabab-maker in Dabgari Bazar. I grew up in the early 1980s, when the night air smelled of kerosene lamps in my village. In our villages, there was no cinema, no television, no theatre. Only the female dance party in the hujra. The night would go on — currency notes showered upon the dancers, tossed over the groom and his friends, laughter mixing with the music. The mehfil glowed until midnight, when it ended with bursts of gunfire in the air, a final announcement to the surrounding villages that the dance was over. Yet, within that fiery, fraught atmosphere, the dancing girls somehow felt safe. They came from everywhere — from Swat’s Banr Bazaar, from Mardan, from Rawalpindi, sometimes from Lahore or from Dabgari Bazaar itself, the old red-light heart of Peshawar. Names whispered in gossip and admiration: Shamshad Begum known as Shamshado, Farzana, Shahnaz, Babli, Chanoo. Women who carried the rhythm of a culture and the shame of a society that refused to own them. But that balance has been shattered. First by the Kalashnikov culture of the 1980s, then by the militancy and false piety that followed. The same land that once danced to the rabab began to tremble under sermons and gunfire. The same people who clapped to melodies now judge with verses. During the MMA government, music cassettes, CDs, DVDs and VHS tapes were publicly burned in Peshawar’s Jinnah Park after Friday prayers. At the very spot where Quaid-i-Azam once addressed the city, flames replaced melody, marking a moment when culture was condemned and Peshawar began to lose its plural, joyful voice. Today, a woman with a song is a threat. A woman who dances is fair game for anyone’s bullet. Her name was Muniba Shah. A name that most of Peshawar didn’t know until it was followed by the phrase “shot dead.” She was a damma, a Pakhtun dancer, an artist, a survivor of a cruel tradition that praises art but punishes the artist. She danced her last dance in the City of Flowers. No protest. No statement. No civil society outrage. Only a few blurred photos on social media, her painted face frozen mid-smile… and a city moving on as if nothing had happened. Muniba Shah is not the first. She joins a silent chorus: Shabana, the dancer from Swat, shot dead in 2009, her body dumped in a public square. Ayman Udas, singer and TV performer, murdered by her brothers for “dishonour”. Ghazala Javed, the nightingale of Peshawar, gunned down with her father in 2012. Sumbul, Sonia, Resham, Lubna, Khushboo — each killed for saying no, for performing, for living. Eighteen names that are known. Countless others lost. No monuments. No memorials. No justice. Just Facebook comments asking what she wore, what she did, as if death needed justification. But if music is our soul, why do we keep killing our singers? We praise God for beauty but destroy the ones who carry it in their bones. Muniba Shah will not perform again. Her anklets lie still, her music cut short. Somewhere tonight, another girl in Banr Bazaar may look at her picture and feel both wonder and warning — dreaming of the stage, fearing its price. Cinema Road used to be alive with music cassette shops where film songs, ghazals and Pashto songs were bought and sold. THE HIGH AND THE LOW He was known in our streets as “Nasimy”. His real name was Nasim Maseeh, but names fade fast in the dust of forgotten lives. He was the man with the broom — a long jharroo in one hand, a small steel cart in the other — walking through Nothia Jadeed, Miskeen Abad, Judge Bungalow and Kotla Mohsin Khan every dawn. A faded Palestinian-style scarf tied around his head, dark skin shining with sweat, white teeth flashing when he laughed. A laughter full of life and, at times, full of quiet sorrow. After sweeping, he would sit cross-legged on the ground, cracking jokes, calling out to the housewives in his broken Pashto: “ Ay baaji, chai milay gi? Ay mory, aik paratha mere liye bhi ! [Sister, can I get a cup of tea? One paratha for me too!] Every woman in the neighbourhood knew him, respected him. And he, in return, respected everyone. Working and smiling, never demanding more than a greeting or a cup of tea. But when someone threw waste food, plastic or burned trash on the same street he had just cleaned, Nasimy would laugh again. A deep, tired, saddened laugh, the kind that hides pain behind politeness. A few days ago, I learned that Nasimy had died. Inside a blocked gutter at Darul Uloom Usmania, the very madrassa whose drains he was cleaning. He suffocated there, in the dark, doing the work no one else wanted to do. He died where the city’s conscience never dares to go. I asked around: was he married? Did he have children, a home, a family? No one knew. There are thousands like Nasimy in Pakistan — most belonging to Christian and Hindu minorities, living without contracts, safety or respect. They clean the mess of millions, yet die in silence. Sometimes I think we Pakhtuns, indeed the entire Pakistani nation, are among the most contradictory of people, with arrogance born out of the caste system. Those who cut our hair and make us beautiful, we call nai, implying a lowly status. Those who shape the clay into pots that feed us, we call kolal, equally lowly. Those who bring colour to our lives, we still treat as low. We are blind to the truth that they — not us — keep the rhythm of life alive. FROM KALASHNIKOVS TO TIKTOK Forty-five years later, the story has not changed, only the platforms have. From Iqbaly and Dabangy to Tila Khan, Ayuby and Papu, these names ruled the underworld. They were legends of ‘badmaashi’ — gangsters, assassins, drug lords — until SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) Sifwat Ghayur arrived with an iron will. One by one, his team took down the city’s crime lords. But in a cruel irony of fate, SSP Ghayur and his men would later be killed by the Taliban they once fought to contain. Leaders and supporters of religious political parties address a public gathering during a rally in which Osama bin Laden was publicly portrayed as a “mujahid holy warrior”. The gangsters of Peshawar are no longer hiding in dark alleys; they are performing on TikTok. They threaten, boast and mock each other in viral videos, before ending up dead in police encounters that everyone knows are paid for. Just a few days ago, Malik Adam Khan, an Afghan-Pakistani figure once feared, was killed along with his companions. Rumours spread across the city that his rivals, Mumtazy “Two Feet”, Haji Habib and Breet Khan, paid the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police for the ‘operation’. Hours later, Mumtazy threw a celebration, a night of dance and gunfire, mocking the death of his rival. In the 1980s, Peshawar’s poison was heroin and opium — today it’s ice, crystal meth, a drug that burns young minds faster than war ever did. The city’s streets are no longer full of storytellers or musicians — they’re full of dealers, addicts and a lost generation. And then, the ultimate tragedy. Videos surface of fathers selling their own children for food. Crying boys and girls under the age of 12, auctioned in shame because poverty has crushed the last pillars of Pakhtun honour. It was unthinkable once. It’s the reality now. Guns, drugs, gangs and tears — the story repeats itself. But somewhere between the smoke of the Kalashnikov and the glow of a TikTok screen, the soul of Peshawar burns among its ashes. WHAT REMAINS I often say I lost my city. In many ways, I have. The Peshawar of my youth — diverse, artistic, tolerant — survives now only in memory and in scattered pockets of resistance. Once a walled city entered through many gates, Peshawar has recently restored these gateways as symbols of its centuries-old identity. Kabuli Gate, the historic entry to Qissa Khwani Bazaar, stands again — marking the threshold where stories, trade and history have flowed for generations. But I also know this: culture is resilient. Music finds cracks to slip through. Joy returns in unexpected places. It does sometimes on rooftops, sometimes on a wedding stage trembling after an attack. The extremists took much from Peshawar. But they have not taken its soul entirely. Not yet. I carry that belief like I carry an old photograph — edges fading, centre glowing. And I hold on to it, because cities don’t die when buildings fall or when cultures are silenced. They die when their people stop remembering what they once were. Until then, every Pakhtun must ask: what kind of flower garden are we, if we keep watering the soil with the blood of our own roses?

      "summary_en": "Landing in my birthplace always gives me the feeling of a tired child resting his head in his mother’s lap, the comfort that says I’m home. This time, the feeling was warmer, for I had brought with me the joy of my son’s wedding to share with my family and friends. It felt like returning to a celebration. But joy in this country is always fragile, more so in the border regions. The minute I touched down in Islamabad, news broke of yet another suicide attack — 12 killed, dozens injured. The headline cut through my heart before I even reached baggage claim. Still, I drove to Peshawar, to my roots. To the soil that has always known both happiness and heartbreak. The walls of Peshawar’s old qahwa khanas tea houses, which once echoed with Rehman Baba’s verses and the faces of film stars, are now filled with Quranic calligraphy, reflecting a changing moral and social landscape. When I reached home, the air was the same as when I left it. Dry, warm, filled with the scent of dust and bright sunshine. Children I once saw in school uniforms are now married. Cousins have grey hair. New faces sit where elders once did. But the streets have grown crowded, the tolerance thinner, the city restless. Yet, every corner still tells a story of life, and survival. And the unbreakable stubbornness of its people. A native returns to his home in what was once known as the ‘City of Flowers’ and tries to make sense of its slow erosion, over decades, of culture, tolerance and joy. Where the city once pulsed with music, cinema, dance, poetry and coexistence, it struggles today under the weight of fear, radicalisation and silence. Is the old Peshawar just destined to exist only in his memory? THE CITY THAT WAS Forty years ago, Peshawar was one of the most vibrant cultural cities in South Asia. What Paris had in sophistication, what New York had in artistic energy, my city had in its own distinct, confident way. A vendor on Peshawar’s Cinema Road pictured 30 years ago. I still remember my teenage days in a small village near Peshawar in the early 1980s. Back then, the city was alive with colour and melody, cinemas showing Pashto, Urdu, English and Punjabi films, the sound of the rabab floating through Dabgari Bazaar, and wedding nights throbbing with dance, drums and currency notes being showered over performers. Peshawar was a city of art, of scandal, of tradition and temptation. There were musicians’ streets, poetry festivals, bookshops and open-air performances that carried on late into the night. In the Saddar neighbourhood, Khyber Café served as the informal headquarters of Pakistan Television’s Peshawar Centre, where actors, poets, writers and producers gathered daily. A short walk away stood Saint John’s and Saint Cathedral churches, and beside them the historic Jamia Darvesh Mosque. A coexistence of faiths carved naturally into the city’s landscape. A worshipper sits inside the historic Mohabbat Khan Mosque. Amid fading frescoes and worn marble floors, the centuries-old mosque remains a place of solitude and devotion. In Kali Bari street, Muslim, Hindu and Christian families lived side-by-side in a harmony that felt permanent. Every year, the month-long Jashn-i-Khyber festival filled the night air with announcements and music from Peshawar Stadium’s loudspeakers. And in Dabgari Chowk, the celebrated Pashto ghazal singer Khyal Muhammad would perform all night in the middle of the road, surrounded by people who came for poetry, not politics. That was the Peshawar I grew up in: confident, open, generous. Painter and sculptor Arbab Muhammad Sardar in his gallery: in 1997, after receiving threats warning him against painting human faces and creating sculptures, he began removing his works from display. THE TRANSFORMATION But then came the Afghan war and Gen Ziaul Haq’s call for ‘jihad’. Overnight, Peshawar became the frontline of a global game. It turned into a Kalashnikov capital, a smuggler’s paradise, a city of spies and sudden millionaires. To own a gun was to be powerful, to fire it in the air was to be feared. Over decades, religious seminaries multiplied, public art vanished and cultural spaces disappeared or were muted. Suspicion replaced neighbourliness. Extremism was not an accident, it was a slow, deliberate recalibration of society, one that suffocated the city’s cultural lungs. Supporters of a religious political party burn an American flag during a protest at Peshawar’s Martyrs’ Monument, erected in memory of members of the non-violent Khudai Khidmatgar movement killed by British forces. The moment underscores the contrast between a site rooted in peaceful resistance and later waves of political anger shaped by global events. On my second day in the city, I photographed a young Islamist student wrapped in a white turban, wearing a light-brown Schott NYC US Army jacket. The irony hit me like a flash: an American brand on a madrassa [seminary] student. When I asked about it, he smiled and said it was his “trophy”. I didn’t ask more. He happily posed for a picture. That single moment pulled me 30 years back, to 1996, when the Taliban had just taken control of Afghanistan. Back then, they walked freely in Peshawar’s streets. The city was their resting ground, their moral laboratory. Tora Bora, Afghanistan: Foot soldiers rest during a pause in fighting. Some prepare for prayer, while one listens quietly to Indian songs on the All India Radio. Beyond labels such as Taliban or mujahid holy warrior, the image reveals the ordinary human contradictions of war — faith, fatigue, memory and music coexisting in a single moment. And here I was again, 30 years later — the same story, the same spirit, just new clothes and a different brand. I didn’t ask this young man about his ‘trophy’. Not because I was afraid, but because I understood that, in our land, questions can sometimes be louder than answers. History in this part of the world never moves forward — it keeps circling, dressing old beliefs in new symbols. A WALK ON CINEMA ROAD The afternoon light falls softly on Cinema Road, the street that once carried the heartbeat of the city. The air still smells of dust, tea and faint memories of songs that used to spill from cassette shops. My steps now echo where music once lived. Near the Sethi House, Peshawar’s old streets still carry the elegance of carved balconies, fading paint and narrow passages that once shaped everyday life. Caught between neglect and survival, these lanes stand as quiet witnesses to a city whose architectural memory is slowly slipping away. Inside a narrow tea shop, Jan Muhammad sits cross-legged beside his brass samovar. This was once the German Tea Shop, now everyone calls it Jan Muhammad Chai Khana. He pours boiling milk into cups, the sound of hissing steam blending with the low hum of conversation. He looks up and says, “Alhamdulillah [Praise be to Allah], the bazar is clean now, no obscenity, only business.” The clang of kettles and the breath of steam are all that remain from a time when this road was alive with sound, posters and film lights. There was a time when Cinema Road glowed every evening. Three proud cinema halls stood shoulder-to-shoulder: Picture House, Novelty and Tasweer Mahal. People knew them not by their official names but by what they looked like: Picture House was Makhamkh Cinema, the one in the front; Novelty was Manz Cinema, the middle one; and Tasweer Mahal was Pehla Cinema, the first one in the row. At Picture House Cinema on Cinema Road in the early 2000s, film billboards were altered during the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure, with female faces removed and only male actors left visible. The cinema itself has since been bulldozed, marking the physical erasure of a once-thriving cultural space from the city’s landscape. Crowds of young men filled the street. Truck drivers, students and visitors from the villages of Khyber, Charsadda, Mardan and Kohat. They came for the films, for the laughter, for the noise that made this road feel like a fair. Music shops lined both sides: Sherbaz Khan Music Centre, Shalimar and Gul Sattar Khan. Their cassette racks glimmered under yellow bulbs, filled with Pashto, Indian, Persian and English songs. The road itself throbbed like a radio tuned between worlds. The photo studios were tiny rooms where magic happened. A young man could pose and see himself printed beside Badar Munir, Musarrat Shaheen, Yasmin Khan or Suraya Khan — a small miracle made with scissors, negatives and glue. He would take that photo back to his hujra [communal space], proud and smiling, showing it as proof that he had met fame. Now those same shops sell PVC boards and stationery — the film stars are gone, but the cracked walls still remember them. And through Photoshopping now, young men opt to be transformed into images of militants, guns in hand and a rocket-launcher on the shoulder. A little ahead, the Tasweer Mahal lies buried under a 13-storey plaza. Novelty and Picture House have also been erased, bulldozed like memories no one asked to keep. Dust has replaced the crowd clamouring at the cinema gate, eager to get in. Only silence stands where the hero once leapt across the screen amidst applause from cine-goers. Further down stands the Aina Cinema, its doors half-open to… whom? The ‘Ladies Gate’ sign still hangs above the narrow staircase. Aina Cinema, once alive with music, colour and collective dreams, is now reduced to a parking lot. The ‘Pay Box’ lettering survives, though a car now blocks the view. And above, the mural of dancers and musicians — colours faded — still hangs on through the years. This hall once echoed with clapping hands and Pashto film dialogue. Now it rents its floor to cars. No one I ask says they miss those days. Maybe they have forgotten, maybe forgetting is easier. But for those who grew up in that sound and smoke, the loss runs deep — not just of cinemas, but of openness. An image from 1996 that captures the tension between public piety and private curiosity. There was a balance once. Faith and fun walking side by side. Falak Sair and Capital Cinemas in Saddar, the Takhtu Jumat mosque between them, Blue Bells Music Centre beside. Naz Cinema near Masjid Mahabat Khan and Cinema Road itself beside Madani Masjid of Namak Mandi. After Friday prayers, some men went to the cinema, some to Dabgari Bazar — both part of one rhythm that made the city move. In Peshawar’s Dabgari Bazaar, musicians traditionally kept their balcony windows open so passers-by could see and hire them. During the MMA provincial government’s campaign against music, pressure from authorities forced these windows shut. In this image from 2003, two musicians cautiously peer onto the street — a quiet moment reflecting how fear and regulation pushed a once public art into the shadows Evening falls again on Cinema Road. At Jan Muhammad’s shop, the kettles cool slowly and the tea tastes like nostalgia — thick, sweet and a little burnt. The steam curls upward like the city’s last song. The walls are cleaner now but quieter. We have built plazas and lost poetry, scrubbed away the music but not the memory. During the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure in KP in the early 2000s, cinema posters along Cinema Road were altered as female faces were removed or blacked out A CITY THAT WALKS THROUGH SMOKE The morning sun in Peshawar was pale and kind. And then, that morning, a car bomb. A suicide attacker struck right in front of the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters — formerly the Frontier Constabulary — in the heart of Saddar. The blast ripped through the stillness of an ordinary workday. A white Suzuki, packed with explosives, rammed the gate before a suicide bomber detonated himself. Within seconds, concrete dust, smoke and fear clouded the street. The echoes rolled beneath the overhead BRT [Bus Rapid Transit] track, bouncing between the concrete pillars that now bear the stains of shrapnel. Three FC personnel were martyred on the spot, several others were wounded. Under the overhead bridge, men gathered in silence. Children clutched schoolbags. Bikers slowed to watch the police lift the burned car with a forklift, its tires dangling mid-air. A haunting image of another day gone wrong. Nearby, an FC soldier stood guard over a blood-soaked shroud, staring at what little was left of the attacker. And yet, just a few hundred meters away, life went on. Shops re-opened, schools and offices stayed functional, and traffic crawled as usual. The people of Peshawar, hardened by decades of violence, carried on with that familiar numbness that only a city long at war can understand. By noon, the road was cleared. The glass shards on the asphalt shimmered like tiny memorials in the sunlight. For outsiders, it was a terror attack — for Peshawar, it was Monday. A security personnel member stands near the remains of a suicide bomber after an attack on the Frontier Corps headquarters on November 24, 2025 WALTZING WITH TERROR This November, when my son was getting married in New York, my sisters in Peshawar insisted to have a traditional nakreezy — a henna night with music and dance — in my hometown. They wanted a Pashto singer, someone whose voice could bring back even a trace of the old Peshawar. Our friend, the renowned Pashto singer Sarfaraz Afridi, offered to perform along with his young son, Arman Faraz. I wanted to host them on a stage worthy of artists, decorated with candles and roses. The way Peshawar once honoured its musicians. I visited 17 wedding halls. Everyone refused. “No live music,” they said. “It is a sin.” As if joy itself had become forbidden. As if melody threatened the order of things. So I built my own stage. On the rooftop of our four-storey family home, in the heart of our village, we placed speakers on all four sides. Not to provoke anyone, but to remind them of what had been forgotten. Sarfaraz and Arman performed until dawn. Their voices floated over our neighbourhood like a small rebellion. That night was my protest. My refusal to accept silence as the new normal. For the main wedding, I had invited a Khattak dance troupe, a symbol of Pakhtun identity and pride. The FC, whose dancers I had invited, was burying its own after the bomb attack. I assumed the performance would be cancelled. But on the wedding day, the troupe arrived. Still grieving. Still shaken. But determined. Their presence was more than entertainment — it was a declaration. A refusal to let terror dictate how people live, celebrate or express their culture. In front of 1,000 guests, their dance was a quiet but unmistakable act of defiance. For a brief moment, I saw my old Peshawar again. The dance troupe that performed at the wedding of the writer’s son. Just two days earlier, they had survived a bomb attack. THE UNHEARD SONGS In my father’s youth, in the 1960s, things were different. He told me that when women dancers were invited to weddings, they would first go to the women’s side of the house. Female hosts would welcome them with tea, speak kindly and drape a chador over their shoulders. A gesture of respect, of protection. Only then would the dancers step toward the hujra, escorted by male elders of the family. Before the music began, an elder would raise his hand and declare: “She is our guest. She has come to bring joy to our celebration. Respect her as you would respect your own daughter.” Those few words were like a royal decree, an invisible shield. No one dared misbehave, no one dared touch. That was Pashtunwali — the old code of honour that balanced pride with protection. A rabab-maker in Dabgari Bazar. I grew up in the early 1980s, when the night air smelled of kerosene lamps in my village. In our villages, there was no cinema, no television, no theatre. Only the female dance party in the hujra. The night would go on — currency notes showered upon the dancers, tossed over the groom and his friends, laughter mixing with the music. The mehfil glowed until midnight, when it ended with bursts of gunfire in the air, a final announcement to the surrounding villages that the dance was over. Yet, within that fiery, fraught atmosphere, the dancing girls somehow felt safe. They came from everywhere — from Swat’s Banr Bazaar, from Mardan, from Rawalpindi, sometimes from Lahore or from Dabgari Bazaar itself, the old red-light heart of Peshawar. Names whispered in gossip and admiration: Shamshad Begum known as Shamshado, Farzana, Shahnaz, Babli, Chanoo. Women who carried the rhythm of a culture and the shame of a society that refused to own them. But that balance has been shattered. First by the Kalashnikov culture of the 1980s, then by the militancy and false piety that followed. The same land that once danced to the rabab began to tremble under sermons and gunfire. The same people who clapped to melodies now judge with verses. During the MMA government, music cassettes, CDs, DVDs and VHS tapes were publicly burned in Peshawar’s Jinnah Park after Friday prayers. At the very spot where Quaid-i-Azam once addressed the city, flames replaced melody, marking a moment when culture was condemned and Peshawar began to lose its plural, joyful voice. Today, a woman with a song is a threat. A woman who dances is fair game for anyone’s bullet. Her name was Muniba Shah. A name that most of Peshawar didn’t know until it was followed by the phrase “shot dead.” She was a damma, a Pakhtun dancer, an artist, a survivor of a cruel tradition that praises art but punishes the artist. She danced her last dance in the City of Flowers. No protest. No statement. No civil society outrage. Only a few blurred photos on social media, her painted face frozen mid-smile… and a city moving on as if nothing had happened. Muniba Shah is not the first. She joins a silent chorus: Shabana, the dancer from Swat, shot dead in 2009, her body dumped in a public square. Ayman Udas, singer and TV performer, murdered by her brothers for “dishonour”. Ghazala Javed, the nightingale of Peshawar, gunned down with her father in 2012. Sumbul, Sonia, Resham, Lubna, Khushboo — each killed for saying no, for performing, for living. Eighteen names that are known. Countless others lost. No monuments. No memorials. No justice. Just Facebook comments asking what she wore, what she did, as if death needed justification. But if music is our soul, why do we keep killing our singers? We praise God for beauty but destroy the ones who carry it in their bones. Muniba Shah will not perform again. Her anklets lie still, her music cut short. Somewhere tonight, another girl in Banr Bazaar may look at her picture and feel both wonder and warning — dreaming of the stage, fearing its price. Cinema Road used to be alive with music cassette shops where film songs, ghazals and Pashto songs were bought and sold. THE HIGH AND THE LOW He was known in our streets as “Nasimy”. His real name was Nasim Maseeh, but names fade fast in the dust of forgotten lives. He was the man with the broom — a long jharroo in one hand, a small steel cart in the other — walking through Nothia Jadeed, Miskeen Abad, Judge Bungalow and Kotla Mohsin Khan every dawn. A faded Palestinian-style scarf tied around his head, dark skin shining with sweat, white teeth flashing when he laughed. A laughter full of life and, at times, full of quiet sorrow. After sweeping, he would sit cross-legged on the ground, cracking jokes, calling out to the housewives in his broken Pashto: “ Ay baaji, chai milay gi? Ay mory, aik paratha mere liye bhi ! [Sister, can I get a cup of tea? One paratha for me too!] Every woman in the neighbourhood knew him, respected him. And he, in return, respected everyone. Working and smiling, never demanding more than a greeting or a cup of tea. But when someone threw waste food, plastic or burned trash on the same street he had just cleaned, Nasimy would laugh again. A deep, tired, saddened laugh, the kind that hides pain behind politeness. A few days ago, I learned that Nasimy had died. Inside a blocked gutter at Darul Uloom Usmania, the very madrassa whose drains he was cleaning. He suffocated there, in the dark, doing the work no one else wanted to do. He died where the city’s conscience never dares to go. I asked around: was he married? Did he have children, a home, a family? No one knew. There are thousands like Nasimy in Pakistan — most belonging to Christian and Hindu minorities, living without contracts, safety or respect. They clean the mess of millions, yet die in silence. Sometimes I think we Pakhtuns, indeed the entire Pakistani nation, are among the most contradictory of people, with arrogance born out of the caste system.

One by one, his team took down the city’s crime lords. But in a cruel irony of fate, SSP Ghayur and his men would later be killed by the Taliban they once fought to contain. Leaders and supporters of religious political parties address a public gathering during a rally in which Osama bin Laden was publicly portrayed as a “mujahid holy warrior”. The gangsters of Peshawar are no longer hiding in dark alleys; they are performing on TikTok. They threaten, boast and mock each other in viral videos, before ending up dead in police encounters that everyone knows are paid for.

In the 1980s, Peshawar’s poison was heroin and opium — today it’s ice, crystal meth, a drug that burns young minds faster than war ever did. The city’s streets are no longer full of storytellers or musicians — they’re full of dealers, addicts and a lost generation. And then, the ultimate tragedy. Videos surface of fathers selling their own children for food. Crying boys and girls under the age of 12, auctioned in shame because poverty has crushed the last pillars of Pakhtun honour.

A short walk away stood Saint John’s and Saint Cathedral churches, and beside them the historic Jamia Darvesh Mosque. A coexistence of faiths carved naturally into the city’s landscape. A worshipper sits inside the historic Mohabbat Khan Mosque. Amid fading frescoes and worn marble floors, the centuries-old mosque remains a place of solitude and devotion. In Kali Bari street, Muslim, Hindu and Christian families lived side-by-side in a harmony that felt permanent. Every year, the month-long Jashn-i-Khyber festival filled the night air with announcements and music from Peshawar Stadium’s loudspeakers. And in Dabgari Chowk, the celebrated Pashto ghazal singer Khyal Muhammad would perform all night in the middle of the road, surrounded by people who came for poetry, not politics. That was the Peshawar I grew up in: confident, open, generous. Painter and sculptor Arbab Muhammad Sardar in his gallery: in 1997, after receiving threats warning him against painting human faces and creating sculptures, he began removing his works from display. THE TRANSFORMATION But then came the Afghan war and Gen Ziaul Haq’s call for ‘jihad’. Overnight, Peshawar became the frontline of a global game. It turned into a Kalashnikov capital, a smuggler’s paradise, a city of spies and sudden millionaires. To own a gun was to be powerful, to fire it in the air was to be feared. Over decades, religious seminaries multiplied, public art vanished and cultural spaces disappeared or were muted. Suspicion replaced neighbourliness. Extremism was not an accident, it was a slow, deliberate recalibration of society, one that suffocated the city’s cultural lungs. Supporters of a religious political party burn an American flag during a protest at Peshawar’s Martyrs’ Monument, erected in memory of members of the non-violent Khudai Khidmatgar movement killed by British forces. The moment underscores the contrast between a site rooted in peaceful resistance and later waves of political anger shaped by global events. On my second day in the city, I photographed a young Islamist student wrapped in a white turban, wearing a light-brown Schott NYC US Army jacket. The irony hit me like a flash: an American brand on a madrassa [seminary] student. When I asked about it, he smiled and said it was his “trophy”. I didn’t ask more. He happily posed for a picture. That single moment pulled me 30 years back, to 1996, when the Taliban had just taken control of Afghanistan. Back then, they walked freely in Peshawar’s streets. The city was their resting ground, their moral laboratory. Tora Bora, Afghanistan: Foot soldiers rest during a pause in fighting. Some prepare for prayer, while one listens quietly to Indian songs on the All India Radio. Beyond labels such as Taliban or mujahid holy warrior, the image reveals the ordinary human contradictions of war — faith, fatigue, memory and music coexisting in a single moment. And here I was again, 30 years later — the same story, the same spirit, just new clothes and a different brand. I didn’t ask this young man about his ‘trophy’. Not because I was afraid, but because I understood that, in our land, questions can sometimes be louder than answers. History in this part of the world never moves forward — it keeps circling, dressing old beliefs in new symbols. A WALK ON CINEMA ROAD The afternoon light falls softly on Cinema Road, the street that once carried the heartbeat of the city. The air still smells of dust, tea and faint memories of songs that used to spill from cassette shops. My steps now echo where music once lived. Near the Sethi House, Peshawar’s old streets still carry the elegance of carved balconies, fading paint and narrow passages that once shaped everyday life. Caught between neglect and survival, these lanes stand as quiet witnesses to a city whose architectural memory is slowly slipping away. Inside a narrow tea shop, Jan Muhammad sits cross-legged beside his brass samovar. This was once the German Tea Shop, now everyone calls it Jan Muhammad Chai Khana. He pours boiling milk into cups, the sound of hissing steam blending with the low hum of conversation. He looks up and says, “Alhamdulillah [Praise be to Allah], the bazar is clean now, no obscenity, only business.” The clang of kettles and the breath of steam are all that remain from a time when this road was alive with sound, posters and film lights. There was a time when Cinema Road glowed every evening. Three proud cinema halls stood shoulder-to-shoulder: Picture House, Novelty and Tasweer Mahal. People knew them not by their official names but by what they looked like: Picture House was Makhamkh Cinema, the one in the front; Novelty was Manz Cinema, the middle one; and Tasweer Mahal was Pehla Cinema, the first one in the row. At Picture House Cinema on Cinema Road in the early 2000s, film billboards were altered during the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure, with female faces removed and only male actors left visible. The cinema itself has since been bulldozed, marking the physical erasure of a once-thriving cultural space from the city’s landscape. Crowds of young men filled the street. Truck drivers, students and visitors from the villages of Khyber, Charsadda, Mardan and Kohat. They came for the films, for the laughter, for the noise that made this road feel like a fair. Music shops lined both sides: Sherbaz Khan Music Centre, Shalimar and Gul Sattar Khan. Their cassette racks glimmered under yellow bulbs, filled with Pashto, Indian, Persian and English songs. The road itself throbbed like a radio tuned between worlds. The photo studios were tiny rooms where magic happened. A young man could pose and see himself printed beside Badar Munir, Musarrat Shaheen, Yasmin Khan or Suraya Khan — a small miracle made with scissors, negatives and glue. He would take that photo back to his hujra [communal space], proud and smiling, showing it as proof that he had met fame. Now those same shops sell PVC boards and stationery — the film stars are gone, but the cracked walls still remember them. And through Photoshopping now, young men opt to be transformed into images of militants, guns in hand and a rocket-launcher on the shoulder. A little ahead, the Tasweer Mahal lies buried under a 13-storey plaza. Novelty and Picture House have also been erased, bulldozed like memories no one asked to keep. Dust has replaced the crowd clamouring at the cinema gate, eager to get in. Only silence stands where the hero once leapt across the screen amidst applause from cine-goers. Further down stands the Aina Cinema, its doors half-open to… whom? The ‘Ladies Gate’ sign still hangs above the narrow staircase. Aina Cinema, once alive with music, colour and collective dreams, is now reduced to a parking lot. The ‘Pay Box’ lettering survives, though a car now blocks the view. And above, the mural of dancers and musicians — colours faded — still hangs on through the years. This hall once echoed with clapping hands and Pashto film dialogue. Now it rents its floor to cars. No one I ask says they miss those days. Maybe they have forgotten, maybe forgetting is easier. But for those who grew up in that sound and smoke, the loss runs deep — not just of cinemas, but of openness. An image from 1996 that captures the tension between public piety and private curiosity. There was a balance once. Faith and fun walking side by side. Falak Sair and Capital Cinemas in Saddar, the Takhtu Jumat mosque between them, Blue Bells Music Centre beside. Naz Cinema near Masjid Mahabat Khan and Cinema Road itself beside Madani Masjid of Namak Mandi. After Friday prayers, some men went to the cinema, some to Dabgari Bazar — both part of one rhythm that made the city move. In Peshawar’s Dabgari Bazaar, musicians traditionally kept their balcony windows open so passers-by could see and hire them. During the MMA provincial government’s campaign against music, pressure from authorities forced these windows shut. In this image from 2003, two musicians cautiously peer onto the street — a quiet moment reflecting how fear and regulation pushed a once public art into the shadows Evening falls again on Cinema Road. At Jan Muhammad’s shop, the kettles cool slowly and the tea tastes like nostalgia — thick, sweet and a little burnt. The steam curls upward like the city’s last song. The walls are cleaner now but quieter. We have built plazas and lost poetry, scrubbed away the music but not the memory. During the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure in KP in the early 2000s, cinema posters along Cinema Road were altered as female faces were removed or blacked out A CITY THAT WALKS THROUGH SMOKE The morning sun in Peshawar was pale and kind. And then, that morning, a car bomb. A suicide attacker struck right in front of the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters — formerly the Frontier Constabulary — in the heart of Saddar. The blast ripped through the stillness of an ordinary workday. A white Suzuki, packed with explosives, rammed the gate before a suicide bomber detonated himself. Within seconds, concrete dust, smoke and fear clouded the street. The echoes rolled beneath the overhead BRT [Bus Rapid Transit] track, bouncing between the concrete pillars that now bear the stains of shrapnel. Three FC personnel were martyred on the spot, several others were wounded. Under the overhead bridge, men gathered in silence. Children clutched schoolbags. Bikers slowed to watch the police lift the burned car with a forklift, its tires dangling mid-air. A haunting image of another day gone wrong. Nearby, an FC soldier stood guard over a blood-soaked shroud, staring at what little was left of the attacker. And yet, just a few hundred meters away, life went on. Shops re-opened, schools and offices stayed functional, and traffic crawled as usual. The people of Peshawar, hardened by decades of violence, carried on with that familiar numbness that only a city long at war can understand. By noon, the road was cleared. The glass shards on the asphalt shimmered like tiny memorials in the sunlight. For outsiders, it was a terror attack — for Peshawar, it was Monday. A security personnel member stands near the remains of a suicide bomber after an attack on the Frontier Corps headquarters on November 24, 2025 WALTZING WITH TERROR This November, when my son was getting married in New York, my sisters in Peshawar insisted to have a traditional nakreezy — a henna night with music and dance — in my hometown. They wanted a Pashto singer, someone whose voice could bring back even a trace of the old Peshawar. Our friend, the renowned Pashto singer Sarfaraz Afridi, offered to perform along with his young son, Arman Faraz. I wanted to host them on a stage worthy of artists, decorated with candles and roses. The way Peshawar once honoured its musicians. I visited 17 wedding halls. Everyone refused. “No live music,” they said. “It is a sin.” As if joy itself had become forbidden. As if melody threatened the order of things. So I built my own stage. On the rooftop of our four-storey family home, in the heart of our village, we placed speakers on all four sides. Not to provoke anyone, but to remind them of what had been forgotten. Sarfaraz and Arman performed until dawn. Their voices floated over our neighbourhood like a small rebellion. That night was my protest. My refusal to accept silence as the new normal. For the main wedding, I had invited a Khattak dance troupe, a symbol of Pakhtun identity and pride. The FC, whose dancers I had invited, was burying its own after the bomb attack. I assumed the performance would be cancelled. But on the wedding day, the troupe arrived. Still grieving. Still shaken. But determined. Their presence was more than entertainment — it was a declaration. A refusal to let terror dictate how people live, celebrate or express their culture. In front of 1,000 guests, their dance was a quiet but unmistakable act of defiance. For a brief moment, I saw my old Peshawar again. The dance troupe that performed at the wedding of the writer’s son. Just two days earlier, they had survived a bomb attack. THE UNHEARD SONGS In my father’s youth, in the 1960s, things were different. He told me that when women dancers were invited to weddings, they would first go to the women’s side of the house. Female hosts would welcome them with tea, speak kindly and drape a chador over their shoulders. A gesture of respect, of protection. Only then would the dancers step toward the hujra, escorted by male elders of the family. Before the music began, an elder would raise his hand and declare: “She is our guest. She has come to bring joy to our celebration. Respect her as you would respect your own daughter.” Those few words were like a royal decree, an invisible shield. No one dared misbehave, no one dared touch. That was Pashtunwali — the old code of honour that balanced pride with protection. A rabab-maker in Dabgari Bazar. I grew up in the early 1980s, when the night air smelled of kerosene lamps in my village. In our villages, there was no cinema, no television, no theatre. Only the female dance party in the hujra. The night would go on — currency notes showered upon the dancers, tossed over the groom and his friends, laughter mixing with the music. The mehfil glowed until midnight, when it ended with bursts of gunfire in the air, a final announcement to the surrounding villages that the dance was over. Yet, within that fiery, fraught atmosphere, the dancing girls somehow felt safe. They came from everywhere — from Swat’s Banr Bazaar, from Mardan, from Rawalpindi, sometimes from Lahore or from Dabgari Bazaar itself, the old red-light heart of Peshawar. Names whispered in gossip and admiration: Shamshad Begum known as Shamshado, Farzana, Shahnaz, Babli, Chanoo. Women who carried the rhythm of a culture and the shame of a society that refused to own them. But that balance has been shattered. First by the Kalashnikov culture of the 1980s, then by the militancy and false piety that followed. The same land that once danced to the rabab began to tremble under sermons and gunfire. The same people who clapped to melodies now judge with verses. During the MMA government, music cassettes, CDs, DVDs and VHS tapes were publicly burned in Peshawar’s Jinnah Park after Friday prayers. At the very spot where Quaid-i-Azam once addressed the city, flames replaced melody, marking a moment when culture was condemned and Peshawar began to lose its plural, joyful voice. Today, a woman with a song is a threat. A woman who dances is fair game for anyone’s bullet. Her name was Muniba Shah. A name that most of Peshawar didn’t know until it was followed by the phrase “shot dead.” She was a damma, a Pakhtun dancer, an artist, a survivor of a cruel tradition that praises art but punishes the artist. She danced her last dance in the City of Flowers. No protest. No statement. No civil society outrage. Only a few blurred photos on social media, her painted face frozen mid-smile… and a city moving on as if nothing had happened. Muniba Shah is not the first. She joins a silent chorus: Shabana, the dancer from Swat, shot dead in 2009, her body dumped in a public square. Ayman Udas, singer and TV performer, murdered by her brothers for “dishonour”. Ghazala Javed, the nightingale of Peshawar, gunned down with her father in 2012. Sumbul, Sonia, Resham, Lubna, Khushboo — each killed for saying no, for performing, for living. Eighteen names that are known. Countless others lost. No monuments. No memorials. No justice. Just Facebook comments asking what she wore, what she did, as if death needed justification. But if music is our soul, why do we keep killing our singers? We praise God for beauty but destroy the ones who carry it in their bones. Muniba Shah will not perform again. Her anklets lie still, her music cut short. Somewhere tonight, another girl in Banr Bazaar may look at her picture and feel both wonder and warning — dreaming of the stage, fearing its price. Cinema Road used to be alive with music cassette shops where film songs, ghazals and Pashto songs were bought and sold. THE HIGH AND THE LOW He was known in our streets as “Nasimy”. His real name was Nasim Maseeh, but names fade fast in the dust of forgotten lives. He was the man with the broom — a long jharroo in one hand, a small steel cart in the other — walking through Nothia Jadeed, Miskeen Abad, Judge Bungalow and Kotla Mohsin Khan every dawn. A faded Palestinian-style scarf tied around his head, dark skin shining with sweat, white teeth flashing when he laughed. A laughter full of life and, at times, full of quiet sorrow. After sweeping, he would sit cross-legged on the ground, cracking jokes, calling out to the housewives in his broken Pashto: “ Ay baaji, chai milay gi? Ay mory, aik paratha mere liye bhi ! [Sister, can I get a cup of tea? One paratha for me too!] Every woman in the neighbourhood knew him, respected him. And he, in return, respected everyone. Working and smiling, never demanding more than a greeting or a cup of tea. But when someone threw waste food, plastic or burned trash on the same street he had just cleaned, Nasimy would laugh again. A deep, tired, saddened laugh, the kind that hides pain behind politeness. A few days ago, I learned that Nasimy had died. Inside a blocked gutter at Darul Uloom Usmania, the very madrassa whose drains he was cleaning. He suffocated there, in the dark, doing the work no one else wanted to do. He died where the city’s conscience never dares to go. I asked around: was he married? Did he have children, a home, a family? No one knew. There are thousands like Nasimy in Pakistan — most belonging to Christian and Hindu minorities, living without contracts, safety or respect. They clean the mess of millions, yet die in silence. Sometimes I think we Pakhtuns, indeed the entire Pakistani nation, are among the most contradictory of people, with arrogance born out of the caste system. Those who cut our hair and make us beautiful, we call nai, implying a lowly status. Those who shape the clay into pots that feed us, we call kolal, equally lowly. Those who bring colour to our lives, we still treat as low. We are blind to the truth that they — not us — keep the rhythm of life alive. FROM KALASHNIKOVS TO TIKTOK Forty-five years later, the story has not changed, only the platforms have. From Iqbaly and Dabangy to Tila Khan, Ayuby and Papu, these names ruled the underworld. They were legends of ‘badmaashi’ — gangsters, assassins, drug lords — until SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) Sifwat Ghayur arrived with an iron will. One by one, his team took down the city’s crime lords. But in a cruel irony of fate, SSP Ghayur and his men would later be killed by the Taliban they once fought to contain. Leaders and supporters of religious political parties address a public gathering during a rally in which Osama bin Laden was publicly portrayed as a “mujahid holy warrior”. The gangsters of Peshawar are no longer hiding in dark alleys; they are performing on TikTok. They threaten, boast and mock each other in viral videos, before ending up dead in police encounters that everyone knows are paid for. Just a few days ago, Malik Adam Khan, an Afghan-Pakistani figure once feared, was killed along with his companions. Rumours spread across the city that his rivals, Mumtazy “Two Feet”, Haji Habib and Breet Khan, paid the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police for the ‘operation’. Hours later, Mumtazy threw a celebration, a night of dance and gunfire, mocking the death of his rival. In the 1980s, Peshawar’s poison was heroin and opium — today it’s ice, crystal meth, a drug that burns young minds faster than war ever did. The city’s streets are no longer full of storytellers or musicians — they’re full of dealers, addicts and a lost generation. And then, the ultimate tragedy. Videos surface of fathers selling their own children for food. Crying boys and girls under the age of 12, auctioned in shame because poverty has crushed the last pillars of Pakhtun honour. It was unthinkable once. It’s the reality now. Guns, drugs, gangs and tears — the story repeats itself. But somewhere between the smoke of the Kalashnikov and the glow of a TikTok screen, the soul of Peshawar burns among its ashes. WHAT REMAINS I often say I lost my city. In many ways, I have. The Peshawar of my youth — diverse, artistic, tolerant — survives now only in memory and in scattered pockets of resistance. Once a walled city entered through many gates, Peshawar has recently restored these gateways as symbols of its centuries-old identity. Kabuli Gate, the historic entry to Qissa Khwani Bazaar, stands again — marking the threshold where stories, trade and history have flowed for generations. But I also know this: culture is resilient. Music finds cracks to slip through. Joy returns in unexpected places. It does sometimes on rooftops, sometimes on a wedding stage trembling after an attack. The extremists took much from Peshawar. But they have not taken its soul entirely. Not yet. I carry that belief like I carry an old photograph — edges fading, centre glowing. And I hold on to it, because cities don’t die when buildings fall or when cultures are silenced. They die when their people stop remembering what they once were. Until then, every Pakhtun must ask: what kind of flower garden are we, if we keep watering the soil with the blood of our own roses?

      "summary_orig": "Iran will offer no leniency to “rioters,” though the public has a right to demonstrate, the head of the judiciary said on Monday, following more than a week of protests . The demonstrations began last Sunday in Tehran when shopkeepers staged a strike over high prices and economic stagnation, but they have since spread to other regions and expanded to include political demands. “I instruct the attorney general and prosecutors across the country to act in accordance with the law and with resolve against the rioters and those who support them… and to show no leniency or indulgence,” Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency. He added that Iran “listens to the protesters and their criticism, and distinguishes between them and rioters”. Protests have taken place in 25 out of Iran’s 31 provinces and affected, to varying degrees, at least 45 different cities, most of them small or medium-sized and concentrated in the west, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and media reports. At least 12 people have been killed since December 30 in localised clashes, including members of the security forces, according to a tally based on official announcements, and there have been media reports of episodes of property damage in the west. The Fars news agency said on Monday that “the trend observed on Sunday night shows a notable decrease in the number of gatherings and their geographic reach compared to previous nights”. Local media’s accounting of the protests is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed their coverage of the demonstrations, while videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify. The national currency, the rial, has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year, while double-digit inflation has been undermining Iranians’ purchasing power for years. The rial was depreciating again on Monday against the greenback after strengthening in recent days, according to the informal black-market rate, which stands at around 1.4 million rials, compared with about 770,000 a year earlier. Publicly, officials have struck a conciliatory tone when it comes to protesters’ economic demands, while vowing to take a hard line against any chaos and destabilisation.",

      "summary_orig": "India’s Supreme Court denied bail on Monday for former student leader Umar Khalid , who has been detained for more than five years on charges of conspiracy to trigger deadly riots . Khalid, 38, was arrested in September 2020 under a sweeping anti-terrorism law and has remained in custody since, aside from brief releases to attend family weddings. His case has become a touchstone for critics who say India’s more than 200 million Muslims face discriminatory treatment in the Hindu-majority nation. Khalid was detained after the February 2020 sectarian riots in Delhi when 53 people were killed — mostly Muslims, but also several Hindus. The Supreme Court in New Delhi dismissed his appeal for bail, saying that “prolonged incarceration” was not grounds to grant him release. It also denied bail on the same grounds to another student activist, Sharjeel Imam. But it approved bail for five others in the same case. Khalid, a former student at Delhi’s prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University, was charged with rioting with a deadly weapon, as well as attempted murder, sedition and causing enmity between different groups. He denies all charges. Police also accused Khalid of delivering “provocative speeches” ahead of the riots. In 2022, he published an open letter saying that “we can be kept in jail for years, without those framing us needing to prove anything”. His partner, Banojyotsna Lahiri, has said that Khalid “became the victim of the injustice that he always fought against”. Amnesty International and six other rights groups issued a statement in September calling for the release of Khalid. “Khalid’s prolonged persecution exemplifies the derailment of justice in India, as it makes a mockery of international human rights principles,” Amnesty said in a statement to mark Khalid’s fifth year in prison. Khalid’s arrest came months after protests against India’s contentious Citizen Amendment Act (CAA). The 2019 law makes it easier for persecuted religious minorities from three neighbouring countries to obtain citizenship, but not if they are Muslim.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday called on lawyers in Islamabad to stand up for an independent judiciary as he continued his efforts to rally support for the PTI’s street movement . The KP CM made the remarks while addressing the legal fraternity at an event organised by the Islamabad Bar Association. After completing a three-day visit to Lahore, Afridi has announced Karachi as his next destination. “If you do not stand up for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law and for an independent judiciary, then future generations will spit on us and you as well,” Afridi said. He urged them to announce a lawyers’ movement, adding that the youth will support them. “Long live resistance,” the chief minister said. “You must support the PTI founder [Imran Khan] against oppression and barbarity. Whose conscience is even one per cent alive will stand against the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, as well as unfair trials — whether of journalists or politicians — and will demand the release of all political workers who are wrongfully in jail,” Afridi said. CM Afridi also stressed that Imran did not seek his release, but rather a fair trial. “A convicted person was received at the airport,” the PTI leader said, apparently referring to ex-premier Nawaz Sharif landing in Islamabad after he returned to Pakistan in October 2023. During his address, Afridi also praised Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, who was among the audience. “Imaan Mazari has created a new history of resistance. The youth receive encouragement from her,“ Afridi said. He also mentioned that some journalists were recently sentenced after their “trials in absentia”. “ Arshad Sharif had to leave his country to save his life because he was not getting justice and security here, but he was not spared even abroad,” the KP CM said, referring to the journalist being shot dead in Kenya on Oct 23, 2022. Afridi cautioned the lawyers that while the PTI was facing “oppression and fascism today”, it could be their turn tomorrow. “You will not be able to tolerate what the PTI has,“ he said. Afridi once again lamented that he was repeatedly being denied a meeting with Imran, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail. “Three judges [of the IHC] issued orders for [my] meeting with the PTI founder, but the Adiala jail’s superintendent threw that directive in the trash,” the KP CM said. He said that Imran was “fighting our war in jail”, adding that “those who took cars from the Toshakhana were the rulers and the person who took items legally was in prison“. “They have incapacitated you all,” the chief minister said. CM Afridi further said that “people from all schools of thought” in KP believed that a military operation was not the solution to rising militancy in the province. “But there are still preparations for an operation. This is not a functioning system but hooliganism,” the chief minister said.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Computer Emergency Response Team (PKCERT) on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with global cybersecurity company Kaspersky to enhance cybersecurity in Pakistan through collaboration. PKCERT is a federal government entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage. A joint press release issued on Monday said that the agreement marked a major step toward enhancing Pakistan’s national cybersecurity posture through collaboration in threat detection, mitigation, and prevention. “The partnership between PKCERT and Kaspersky focuses on strengthening the country’s cyber resilience through a series of coordinated efforts. These include extensive training and awareness programs designed to enhance operational readiness across all levels of government, industry, academia, and civil society,” the statement said. It added that the collaboration also focused on capacity development to cultivate a skilled cybersecurity workforce aligned with both national and international standards. “Additionally, the two organisations will ensure the timely dissemination of actionable cyber threat intelligence to relevant stakeholders across Pakistan,” it said. Under the MoU, the statement added, the organisations will cooperate across a wide range of cybersecurity areas, “including legislative and regulatory issues, incident detection and response, prevention and mitigation strategies, cybersecurity education, research and development, and professional exchanges”. “The two organisations will exchange relevant technical information, threat intelligence, and data feeds related to cyber threats and cyberattacks affecting citizens, businesses, and government institutions in Pakistan,” it said. According to the press release, the MoU was signed by Dr Haider Abbas, the director general of PKCERT, and Rashed Al Momani, general manager for the Middle East and Pakistan at Kaspersky. It was signed in the presence of Kaspersky CEO Eugene Kaspersky and IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja. “Information and communication technologies (ICTs) play a vital role in socio-economic development of a country; however, they have also introduced new challenges such as cyber espionage, hacktivism, ransomware, data breaches, identity theft, attacks on critical infrastructure, financial and supply chain disruptions, and disinformation campaigns,“ the statement quoted Abbas as saying. “Our collaboration with Kaspersky, a global leader with expertise in these domains, represents another important step toward strengthening national cybersecurity,” he added. “Safeguarding digital development requires robust cybersecurity, founded on deep and continuous partnerships between public authorities and private companies. Kaspersky has a long and fruitful history of working with global and regional organisations such as Interpol and Afripol, as well as local computer emergency response teams around the world,” Al Momani said. “We highly value this cooperation with PKCERT as an important step in consolidating Pakistan’s secure digital transformation for the entire nation,” he added.",

      "title_orig": "Trump says second Venezuela strike possible if govt does not cooperate, insists US ‘in charge’",
      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the US might launch a second military strike on Venezuela following the capture of President Nicolas Maduro if remaining members of the administration do not cooperate with his efforts to get the country “fixed”. His comments to reporters aboard Air Force One raised the possibility of further US military interventions in Latin America, and suggested Colombia and Mexico could also face military action if they do not reduce the flow of illicit drugs to the United States. “Operation Colombia sounds good to me,” Trump said. He also said that Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela, “looks like it’s ready to fall” on its own without US military action. He also insisted the US was “in charge” of Venezuela after the seizure of Maduro, but was also dealing with the new leadership in Caracas. Venezuela’s interim leader Delcy Rodriguez said at the same time that she was ready to work together with the Trump administration, asking the US leader for a balanced, respectful relationship. “We’re dealing with the people who just got sworn in. Don’t ask me who’s in charge because I’ll give you an answer and it’ll be very controversial,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One when asked if he had spoken to Rodriguez. Pressed on what he meant, Trump said: “It means we’re in charge”. Asked whether the operation was about oil or regime change, Trump replied: “It’s about peace on earth.” The US president said elections in Venezuela would have to wait. “We’re going to run it, fix it, we’ll have elections at the right time, but the main thing you have to fix is it’s a broken country,” he said. As he struck his triumphant tone, Trump also had harsh words for other US adversaries, saying Colombia’s leader was “not going to be doing it very long,” Communist-ruled Cuba was “ready to fall” and that Iran’s leadership will be “hit hard” if protesters are killed. The Trump administration says it is willing to work with the remainder of Maduro’s government as long as Washington’s goals, particularly opening access to US investment in Venezuela’s enormous crude oil reserves, are met. Maduro is in a New York detention centre awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges. His capture by the United States has sparked deep uncertainty about what is next for the oil-rich South American nation. Top officials in Maduro’s government are still in charge and have called the detentions of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores a kidnapping. “Here, there is only one president, whose name is Nicolas Maduro Moros. Let no one fall for the enemys provocations,” Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said in an audio recording released by the ruling PSUV socialist party. Images of the 63-year-old Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed stunned Venezuelans. The operation was Washington’s most controversial intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama 37 years ago. Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino said on state television the US attack killed soldiers, civilians and a “large part” of Maduro’s security detail “in cold blood”. Venezuela’s armed forces have been activated to guarantee sovereignty, he said. The Cuban government said 32 of its citizens were killed during the raid. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez who also serves as oil minister has taken over as interim leader with the blessing of Venezuela’s top court and has said Maduro remains president. Who will run Venezuela? Despite the success of the initial US operation, questions mounted over Trump’s Venezuela strategy. Trump said on Saturday the United States will “run” the South American country of about 30 million people. But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed on Sunday that Washington is not seeking complete regime change or elections. The US is fighting drug traffickers, “not a war against Venezuela,” Rubio told NBC ‘s ‘Meet the Press’. However, he said a large US naval presence would remain in the Caribbean to enforce a blockade of Venezuelan oil exports for “tremendous leverage”. With questions swirling on Capitol Hill, an administration official told AFP that Rubio will discuss Venezuela in meetings with lawmakers Monday. Trump has made clear Washington intends to call the shots in Venezuela, with a focus on securing access to the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Maduro, a self-described socialist, led Venezuela with an iron fist for more than a decade through a series of elections widely considered rigged. He came to power after the death of his charismatic mentor, Hugo Chavez. As news of Maduro’s capture rippled out, exiled Venezuelans waved flags and celebrated in plazas from Madrid to Santiago. About eight million Venezuelans have fled the grinding poverty and political suppression of their homeland. Rodriguez has long been considered the most pragmatic member of Maduro’s inner circle. But she has publicly contradicted Trump’s claim she is willing to work with the US. Trump said Rodriguez may pay a bigger price than Maduro “if she doesn’t do what’s right,” according to an interview with The Atlantic magazine on Sunday. The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that remark.",

Don’t ask me who’s in charge because I’ll give you an answer and it’ll be very controversial,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One when asked if he had spoken to Rodriguez. Pressed on what he meant, Trump said: “It means we’re in charge”. Asked whether the operation was about oil or regime change, Trump replied: “It’s about peace on earth.” The US president said elections in Venezuela would have to wait. “We’re going to run it, fix it, we’ll have elections at the right time, but the main thing you have to fix is it’s a broken country,” he said. As he struck his triumphant tone, Trump also had harsh words for other US adversaries, saying Colombia’s leader was “not going to be doing it very long,” Communist-ruled Cuba was “ready to fall” and that Iran’s leadership will be “hit hard” if protesters are killed. The Trump administration says it is willing to work with the remainder of Maduro’s government as long as Washington’s goals, particularly opening access to US investment in Venezuela’s enormous crude oil reserves, are met. Maduro is in a New York detention centre awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges. His capture by the United States has sparked deep uncertainty about what is next for the oil-rich South American nation. Top officials in Maduro’s government are still in charge and have called the detentions of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores a kidnapping. “Here, there is only one president, whose name is Nicolas Maduro Moros. Let no one fall for the enemys provocations,” Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said in an audio recording released by the ruling PSUV socialist party. Images of the 63-year-old Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed stunned Venezuelans. The operation was Washington’s most controversial intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama 37 years ago. Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino said on state television the US attack killed soldiers, civilians and a “large part” of Maduro’s security detail “in cold blood”. Venezuela’s armed forces have been activated to guarantee sovereignty, he said. The Cuban government said 32 of its citizens were killed during the raid. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez who also serves as oil minister has taken over as interim leader with the blessing of Venezuela’s top court and has said Maduro remains president. Who will run Venezuela? Despite the success of the initial US operation, questions mounted over Trump’s Venezuela strategy. Trump said on Saturday the United States will “run” the South American country of about 30 million people. But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed on Sunday that Washington is not seeking complete regime change or elections. The US is fighting drug traffickers, “not a war against Venezuela,” Rubio told NBC ‘s ‘Meet the Press’. However, he said a large US naval presence would remain in the Caribbean to enforce a blockade of Venezuelan oil exports for “tremendous leverage”. With questions swirling on Capitol Hill, an administration official told AFP that Rubio will discuss Venezuela in meetings with lawmakers Monday. Trump has made clear Washington intends to call the shots in Venezuela, with a focus on securing access to the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Maduro, a self-described socialist, led Venezuela with an iron fist for more than a decade through a series of elections widely considered rigged. He came to power after the death of his charismatic mentor, Hugo Chavez. As news of Maduro’s capture rippled out, exiled Venezuelans waved flags and celebrated in plazas from Madrid to Santiago. About eight million Venezuelans have fled the grinding poverty and political suppression of their homeland. Rodriguez has long been considered the most pragmatic member of Maduro’s inner circle. But she has publicly contradicted Trump’s claim she is willing to work with the US. Trump said Rodriguez may pay a bigger price than Maduro “if she doesn’t do what’s right,” according to an interview with The Atlantic magazine on Sunday. The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that remark.",

      "summary_orig": "RAWALPINDI: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has set up pre-departure facilitation desks at all its zonal offices nationwide to assist international travellers, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday, following widespread complaints over passenger offloading at airports. The move comes after around 66,154 passengers were offloaded last year despite holding valid documents, particularly at Lahore and Karachi airports, amid a post-2024 Greece boat tragedy crackdown on migrant smuggling, which claimed several Pakistani lives. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered the formation of a special committee to probe the frequent offloading of travellers, which has triggered growing concern and criticism from affected passengers. Taking to his X account, Naqvi wrote: “Pleased to share that the Federal Investigation Agency ( @FIA Pakistan) has launched Pre-Departure Facilitation Desks across all zonal offices with immediate effect.” According to the FIA, the initiative aims to provide guidance and assistance to international travellers on immigration procedures and clearances, ensuring a smoother and more hassle-free travel experience. The desks have been established in eleven zones – including Islamabad’s G/6 zonal office — and will be accessible for intending international travellers, as well as through helplines and email services. An FIA spokesman told Dawn the desks will be operational for international travellers on Saturday and Sunday, with experienced immigration staff deputed to facilitate citizens. “The immigration staff, headed by the assistant director and assisted by an inspector and a sub-inspector, will be available for citizens to provide them with details of visa documents required to travel, which visa is needed, a return ticket and how much currency they can keep with them, among other details,” he said. The spokesman said the facilitation desks have been set up at FIA zonal offices for international travellers — both locals and foreigners — seeking travel-related information, with immigration staff available from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Sunday. “Main zonal offices are located across the country, including Islamabad serving the federal capital territory, Karachi covering Sindh, Lahore covering Punjab, Peshawar covering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Quetta covering Balochistan. Zonal offices are also located in Gujranwala, Faisalabad and Multan,” he added. Last month, FIA authorities told the National Assembly Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development that it offloaded 66,154 passengers from Pakistani Airports in 2025 compared to 2024’s figure of 35,000. Initially, FIA authorities were reluctant to share details of the large-scale offloading of international travellers, despite repeated media queries and complaints from passengers who said they were stopped despite holding valid travel documents.",
