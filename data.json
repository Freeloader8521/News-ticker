      "summary_orig": "The leader of Yemen’s presidential council declared a state of emergency and cancelled a security pact with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Tuesday after separatists seized swathes of territory. “The joint defence agreement with the UAE is hereby cancelled,” a statement said, while a separate decree announced a 90-day state of emergency, including a 72-hour air, sea and land blockade. The announcements by Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, come after the Saudi-led coalition fighting in divided Yemen said it struck a UAE weapons shipment destined for the separatists. The Southern Transitional Council (STC) forces have swept through the south of Yemen this month, taking most of resource-rich Hadramawt province and swathes of neighbouring Mahrah. Alimi ordered the SCT to hand over the territory to Saudi-backed forces, calling the separatists’ advance an “unacceptable rebellion” in a televised address. The confrontation risks tearing apart the already fractured Yemeni government. It also threatens slow-moving peace negotiations with the Houthis, who ousted the government from the capital Sanaa in 2014, triggering a military intervention by the Saudi-led coalition. Saudi Arabia says its national security is a ‘red line’ after strike in Yemen Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday its national security was a red line it would defend, hours after a Saudi-led coalition struck what it described as foreign military support to southern separatists at Yemen’s Mukalla port. The Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement it hoped the UAE will take the necessary steps to preserve bilateral relations. It also expressed “disappointment” over the actions taken by “brotherly UAE pressuring the STC’s forces to conduct military operations on the southern borders of the kingdom in the governorates of Hadramout and Al-Mahara, which is considered a threat to the kingdom’s national security, and the security and stability of the Republic of Yemen and the region“. “The steps taken by the UAE are considered highly dangerous, inconsistent with the principles upon which the coalition to restore legitimacy in Yemen was established, and do not serve the coalition’s purpose of achieving security and stability for Yemen,” it said. “In this context, the kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat,” it said. “The kingdom also hopes that the brotherly UAE will take the necessary steps to preserve bilateral relations between the two brotherly countries, which the kingdom is keen on strengthening, and continue joint efforts towards all that leads to the well-being, prosperity and stability of countries in the region,” it added.",

      "summary_orig": "In a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that the Centre’s cooperation was vital for eliminating terrorism in the province. In a statement released on the social media platform X, the interior ministry said that Kundi called on the interior minister in Islamabad. It added that the two discussed security measures in KP’s border areas and ongoing operations against khawarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). According to the statement, the interior minister gave assurances of the government’s full cooperation for peace and security in KP. “Establishing peace in KP is the top priority,” he was quoted as saying. He said that the federal government was “prepared to provide support in this regard in every possible way”. “We appreciate the sacrifices made by the people of KP in the war against terrorism,” Naqvi said. “ Fitna al Khawarij and their facilitators are being eliminated through joint efforts,” he added. “No leniency of any kind will be shown toward the khawariji ,“ he said. Meanwhile, Kundi said that the Centre’s cooperation was essential for establishing peace and security in the province. “Joint and coordinated action is needed to eliminate terrorism,” he said. On Sunday, Kundi had asked the KP government to support the military operations in the province as the security situation had significantly deteriorated due to militancy. Speaking at the National Press Club, he said the KP government should support security operations, as “without stability, development projects could not move forward”. Insecurity has a negative impact on the social and economic conditions of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, adding that “sustained peace was essential for businesses and investment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”. According to statistics released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), Pakis­tan’s counterterrorism scenario saw a marked escalation in 2025 — combat-related deaths rising by 73 per cent against the previous one — with violence intensifying and pushing several indicators to their highest levels in over a decade. The year not only witnessed a steep rise in overall combat-related deaths, but also became the deadliest one for militants since 2015, the most lethal for security forces since 2011, and the worst for civilian casualties since 2015.",

He said that the federal government was “prepared to provide support in this regard in every possible way”. “We appreciate the sacrifices made by the people of KP in the war against terrorism,” Naqvi said. “ Fitna al Khawarij and their facilitators are being eliminated through joint efforts,” he added. “No leniency of any kind will be shown toward the khawariji ,“ he said. Meanwhile, Kundi said that the Centre’s cooperation was essential for establishing peace and security in the province. “Joint and coordinated action is needed to eliminate terrorism,” he said. On Sunday, Kundi had asked the KP government to support the military operations in the province as the security situation had significantly deteriorated due to militancy. Speaking at the National Press Club, he said the KP government should support security operations, as “without stability, development projects could not move forward”. Insecurity has a negative impact on the social and economic conditions of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, adding that “sustained peace was essential for businesses and investment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”. According to statistics released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), Pakis­tan’s counterterrorism scenario saw a marked escalation in 2025 — combat-related deaths rising by 73 per cent against the previous one — with violence intensifying and pushing several indicators to their highest levels in over a decade. The year not only witnessed a steep rise in overall combat-related deaths, but also became the deadliest one for militants since 2015, the most lethal for security forces since 2011, and the worst for civilian casualties since 2015.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Tuesday that it was resuming direct flights to London in March 2026 after a six-year hiatus. In a statement, the PIA spokesperson said the national flag carrier was increasing its flights to the United Kingdom. He said the airline would operate four weekly flights from Islamabad to London from March 29, 2026. He said that the flights would be operated from Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 4. “The flights are being resumed after a long gap of six years,“ he added. The spokesperson further said that London was the airline’s “first-ever” international destination and remained one of its most important routes. He maintained that the national carrier was already operating three weekly flights to Manchester. In June 2020, the European Union Air Safety Agency had barred PIA from operating in EU countries over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers. The ban on flights followed the then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament, where he termed pilots’ licences “dubious”. The European agency lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28, 2024. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. In September, PIA received the go-ahead to resume direct flights to the UK after a gap of nearly five years. Subsequently, the airline resumed flights to the UK, with flight operations to Manchester resuming in the first phase. At the time, the airline had said it planned to extend operations to Birmingham and London as well.",

An Arif Habib group-led consortium had won the auction for the airline with a bid of Rs135 billion last week after a competitive process, marking the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades. The investment firm‘s chairman spoke about the development on DawnNewsTV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’ — televised on Monday night — where he was asked about PIA employees’ concerns, reservations and protests regarding their jobs against the backdrop of the airline’s privatisaion. In response, Habib said the “number of staff [in the airline] was reasonable”, adding that the privatisation would in fact increase employment on the whole as an expansion was planned and, therefore, more team members would be required. But, he continued, a major issue would be that of “quality and performance”. “And we have come to know that most of these people are very competent,“ he said, adding that Pakistanis were generally capable people. Moreover, Habib said PIA had an “excellent track record” and that at one time, it was the world’s second-best airline. “These are the same people who made it the second-best airline.” Similarly, he added, PIA had also played “a very important role“ in the establishment of Emirates, Singapore and Malta airlines. “This means Pakistanis have the skill, and if they are given confidence, a proper platform and support, then I think these people can run PIA well. “We hope that they will play their role in bringing its (PIA’s) past glory back,” he added. A day after PIA’s privatisation, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali had also told Reuters during an interview that the buyer must retain all employees for 12 months after the transaction, with contracts unchanged. Habib was also asked about Fauji Fertiliser Company during the interview. Fauji Fertliser was initially in the race to acquire PIA shares but it later opted out of the bidding process. After the PIA auction, it joined the consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Limited. Confirming the development, Arif Habib had earlier told Dawn that the company had joined his consortium and discussions were under way to finalise the terms and conditions of the partnership. Speaking about it on ‘Doosra Rukh’ , he said Fauji Foundation Company was part of the consortium as a shareholder of PIA. He also said he had met Chief of Defence Forces and Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on two occasions before PIA’s privatisation — first in Karachi and then in Rawalpindi. On both occasions, he said, other businessmen and industrialists were also present, and the Field Marshal had emphasised that local businesses should show interest and invest in the airline.",

A day after PIA’s privatisation, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali had also told Reuters during an interview that the buyer must retain all employees for 12 months after the transaction, with contracts unchanged. Habib was also asked about Fauji Fertiliser Company during the interview. Fauji Fertliser was initially in the race to acquire PIA shares but it later opted out of the bidding process. After the PIA auction, it joined the consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Limited. Confirming the development, Arif Habib had earlier told Dawn that the company had joined his consortium and discussions were under way to finalise the terms and conditions of the partnership. Speaking about it on ‘Doosra Rukh’ , he said Fauji Foundation Company was part of the consortium as a shareholder of PIA. He also said he had met Chief of Defence Forces and Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on two occasions before PIA’s privatisation — first in Karachi and then in Rawalpindi. On both occasions, he said, other businessmen and industrialists were also present, and the Field Marshal had emphasised that local businesses should show interest and invest in the airline.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: A first information report (FIR) has been registered against more than a dozen lawyers after YouTuber Rajab Butt was physically assaulted during a court appearance in Karachi on Monday, it emerged on Tuesday. On Monday, Butt was physically assaulted, allegedly by some lawyers, at the Karachi City Court premises during the hearing of his bail plea in a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said on X that “a few lawyers launched a life-threatening attack on him within the court premises”. A video of the incident showed Butt, clad in a shirt torn from places, moving through a crowd surrounding him. The FIR of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn , was subsequently registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer, Ashfaq. It named Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers”. It should be mentioned that Solangi is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. The FIR was regisisted under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), Section 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), Section 382 (Theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft), Section 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation), and Section 337-A (Punishment of shajjah) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The complainant said that his client had arrived at City Court at 9am to seek bail in a case registered against him under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the PPC. “However, when we reached the inner premises near the West building, Solangi and Fatah, along with 15-20 other lawyers, attacked and started beating my client,” he alleged. He further said that his client was injured in the attack. “The attackers assaulted me as well and other lawyers from my office,” Ashfaq said. He further added that during the attack, his client Butt was holding a bag containing Rs300,000, which was snatched from him. He said that Solangi later returned the bag, but the cash was missing. He also said that his client was then forcibly taken to the additional district and sessions judge (Central), where they “threatened to kill my client”. South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that so far no one had been arrested. Advocate Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers. On Monday, Ashfaq had said that the attackers continued to beat him (Butt) despite being repeatedly asked to stop“. “Taking the law into their hands is weakening the reputation of lawyers in the country,“ he added. Another video had showed Butt walking along with a group of lawyers, who were raising slogans “ Karachi Bar Zindabad ” (long live Karachi Bar). Among them was also Solangi. Tiktoker Nadeem Mubarak, also known as Nani Wala, was also present on the occasion and was seen in one of the videos.",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday. Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said. “The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the Fajr prayer,” the party said in a statement. “We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added. Interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Bangladesh “has lost a great guardian”. “Through her uncompromising leadership, the nation was repeatedly freed from undemocratic conditions and inspired to regain liberty,” the Nobel Peace Prize winner said in a statement. “I pray for the eternal peace and forgiveness of Begum Khaleda Zia’s soul,” ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina said, in a statement on social media by her now banned Awami League party. Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Hasina last year. Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner. But in late November, she was rushed to hospital , where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues. Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment. She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power. View this post on Instagram There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough. Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters. Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority. Bangladesh declares three-day state mourning Bangladesh declared three days of state mourning, with Khaleda’s funeral to be held on Wednesday. Interim leader Yunus, in a television broadcast to the nation, appealed for calm. “I humbly appeal to everyone to maintain discipline while observing all forms of mourning, including the funeral prayers. I know you are all deeply emotional at this time,” Yunus said. “I hope that during this difficult period, you will show utmost patience and support one another in carrying out her last rites, including the funeral.” Asif Nazrul, who holds the law portfolio in the interim government, said the funeral prayers would be held in front of parliament after midday prayers, and that Zia would then be buried alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman. ‘Committed friend to Pakistan’ Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened by Khaleda’s passing. “Her lifelong service to Bangladesh and its growth and development leaves a lasting legacy,” he said. “Begum Zia was a committed friend of Pakistan. My government and the people of Pakistan stand with the people of Bangladesh in this moment of sorrow,” he said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends and the people of Bangladesh during this difficult time,” he said. President Asif Ali Zardari said Khaleda’s “leadership and services will be remembered with respect”. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also expressed his condolences at Khaleda’s passing. Separately, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Zia’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall. ‘Battling begums’ Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981. Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of “liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness”. She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990. But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed “the battling begums”. Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals. Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades. In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami. In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, who was elected three years earlier. Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free. She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win. Her second term was marred by the rise of militants and allegations of corruption. In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. Khaleda’s government and its allies were widely blamed. In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh’s highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated. Detention and freedom Although Khaleda later clamped down on radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence. The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008. Khaleda never regained power. With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics. Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods. In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister — charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics. She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated. Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina’s ouster. In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: A major terror plot was thwarted by law enforcers in the city on Monday as they rescued a school-going teenage girl who had been radicalised through social media by an outlawed militant group and was being prepared for a suicide attack in Karachi. This was shared by Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar during a press conference at the Central Police Office. The minister said that the girl was detained during routine checking by police on the outskirts of Karachi and during the investigation, she revealed the details of the potential terror attack. Mr Lanjar said that the girl belonged to an ordinary family in Balochistan and had been radicalised by anti-state elements through social media before being recruited by a banned group. She was shown fictitious heroic stories of past suicide bombers and was trained through WhatsApp groups to carry out a suicide attack in Karachi. However, law enforcers “foiled the terrorists’ nefarious designs by rescuing her in time,” he added. He also said that the girl’s father, a government servant, had passed away, while her mother was alive. One of her brothers is serving in the Balochistan police while the other is employed in a government department. Home minister claims girl from Balochistan detained during routine checking on city outskirts; alleges outlawed BLA brainwashed her Additional Inspector General of Police (CTD) Azad Khan said the girl was studying at a local school in Balochistan and that the family’s sole source of income was her father’s government pension. She was initially provided hate material through a mobile phone to mentally condition her. Later, an Instagram handler linked to the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) contacted her, shared extremist content and added her to a WhatsApp group where anti-state material was regularly circulated. He said the girl was persuaded to “perform a big act” and was gradually trained towards suicide bombing. One day, she left her home and met a woman outside Karachi, who took her to another location where she was further indoctrinated before being sent to Karachi. During police checking, she failed to give satisfactory answers and was taken to a women’s police station, where she disclosed the entire story during debriefing. The CTD chief said that on the directions of the home minister, authorities had decided not to apply the normal legal process against her and instead adopt a restorative justice approach. “We will treat her as a victim, not an accused,” he said, adding that no explosive or suicide material was recovered from her possession. However, he said her brainwashing was complete and she was close to the “execution phase” when she was rescued. Responding to a question, the home minister said it was an “open secret” that the BLA was destabilising Pakistan with the direct support of India. Additional IGP Karachi Javed Alam Odho, the rescued girl, and her mother were also present at the press conference. In a recorded video message, the girl said she was a student who aspired to become a teacher. She said she first came across a story about Shari Baloch on social media. It is pertinent to mention here that Shari Baloch had carried out a suicide attack to target Chinese academics at Karachi University in 2022. The girl said she developed curiosity about how an educated woman like Shari became a suicide bomber. She watched videos and read material that made her believe there was “some truth” in the propaganda. Gradually, her mindset changed after watching videos and songs glorifying the suicide bomber. The girl said she now realizes that social media handlers who speak softly and show sympathy are actually “hunters.” She questioned why they do not radicalise their own daughters. In her video message, the girl’s mother thanked the law enforcement agencies for saving her daughter and protecting their family’s honour. Published in Dawn, December 30th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "CHRISTMAS was the Big Day, the Bada Din for India’s diverse communities regardless of anyone’s religious beliefs. The big day was a holiday. It was for some a day to introspect, for others an occasion to meet up with the family, often around a large table of Christmas repast. Christmas offered, as it still does, an occasion to enjoy the delightful music of hymns and carols in churches and public events. It was an occasion to join a midnight mass here or listen to the story of Scrooge there, the miserly character from Charles Dickens. And Christmas is also increasingly identified with shopping crowds looking out for ‘Black Friday’ bargains. For Mother Teresa, Christmas was a living liturgy. She observed it by making the Nativity scene a reality in the slums and hospices of Kolkata. The crib was not just a display; it was the bed of a dying destitute person she was cleaning. The Christmas star was the light of hope in a sufferer’s eyes. For her, the truest celebration was to become a gift of love to those whom the world had forgotten. Times have changed. There’s a video clip of a Pakistani public intellectual on the internet complaining how, after shutting down children’s parks, playhouses and music and poetry soirées, the country had only one cultural inheritance left to indulge: to go out to eat a lot of good food. ‘What did you do today? Oh, we went to a nice eatery and ate great varieties of meat.’ Whether he was sardonically mimicking a sad truth or exaggerating somewhat, his intervention reminded me of increasing occasions of religious and cultural celebration that have turned into a consumer fest everywhere. Gandhiji had a soft corner for Christian ethics. He used the teachings of Jesus to critique Western civilisation, pointing out the contradiction between Christian nations professing love and peace while engaging in imperialism, warfare, and industrial exploitation. He challenged Western Christians to embody the ‘prince of peace’. One of his favourite hymns was Abide With Me , a favourite of India’s military bands before the advent of Hindutva rule. Nehru often attended public Christmas events, especially those involving children. He made appearances at Christmas parties organised for orphans, schoolchildren, and the underprivileged. The Nehru family’s Christmas parties at Teen Murti Bhavan (his official residence) were well-known, at which he played a benevolent figure distributing gifts, much like ‘Uncle Nehru’. Practised cynicism was in evidence on Christmas Day at the highest level of government in India. That was then. Much of Western Christendom remains in ferment today, grappling with several of the issues Gandhiji had described with reference to the teachings of Christ. In India, however, Christians have become a targeted community. Practised cynicism was in evidence on Christmas Day at the highest level of government. With elections due in Kerala shortly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was beside himself with joy, proclaiming peace and piety at a Christmas service he attended at a Delhi cathedral. “The service reflected the timeless message of love, peace, and compassion,” Modi wrote. “May the spirit of Christmas inspire harmony and goodwill in our society.” The BJP president was singing paeans to Christmas at another service. As they spoke and earlier, in the run-up to Christmas festivities, Hindutva mobs displayed their brute force of lumpenism — not without police acquiescence. They attacked and terrorised followers of Jesus Christ and the Christmas preparations across the country. The incidents took place almost entirely in states where the BJP runs state governments. For instance, the BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh ordered schools to remain open on Dec 25, insisting the students had to celebrate the 100th birthday of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In Bareilly, according to reports, Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad members sat outside the church at Bishop Conrad School, reciting the Hanuman Chalisa and shouting “Jai Shri Ram” in full view of the police. In Nalbari, Assam, VHP and Bajrang Dal activists stormed St Mary’s School in Panigaon, chanting “Jai Shri Ram” and “Jai Hindu rashtra” before setting fire to Christmas decorations. VHP district secretary Bhaskar Deka stated: “We don’t want Christian festivals here.” The BJP government reportedly ordered the arrest of four in the incident. Elections are also due in Assam. Yes, every BJP-ruled state witnessed anti-Christmas vandalism. Doublespeak is not anyone’s monopoly, however. Atrocities against minority Christians in Pakistan are only too well documented in the archives of the Human Rights Commission. This is not to deny the occasional empathy or even expression of solidarity offered to the harassed community by Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership. The blasphemy laws remain open to misuse by anyone seeking to settle scores with a Christian individual or an entire community. In the US, racism has traditionally trumped religious affinity. White Christians have lynched Black Christians. Created by six Confederate soldiers in 1865, the Ku Klux Klan used Christmas-themed events and imagery to promote its white supremacist ideology and recruit members. The hooded brotherhood circulated flyers and held events around Christmas time. These have included recruitment flyers wishing people a ‘Merry White Christmas’ and the use of a ‘Klanta Klaus’ figure to distribute gifts at KKK-sponsored sales and gatherings. The migration of Cassius Clay to become Muhammad Ali was explained by Ali in a lighter vein. He asked his mother why all the angels were white. Why was there no Black apostle at the last supper of Christ? The mother’s answer was withering: “The Blacks must be in the kitchen, darling.” More recently, during his presidential campaign, Barack Obama shrewdly and swiftly distanced himself from the leading Black American priest who had baptised his daughters. Jeremiah Wright spoke up for Palestine and slammed America in his sermons for wreaking havoc on defenceless people around the world for no legitimate reason. But then, which presidential candidate would not genuflect before the lobby that spearheads Israel’s curious hold over Western Christendom? The writer is Dawn’s correspondent in Delhi.

      "summary_orig": "• Environment ministry okays ‘run-of-the-river’ Dulhasti Stage II, to be built in held Kashmir • Indian govt forging ahead with several hydel projects in Indus basin after unilaterally suspending treaty • Water weaponisation in climate change-prone region ‘neither sane nor acceptable’, warns Sherry Rehman NEW DELHI / ISLAMABAD: India’s Ministry of Environment has been pondering clearances for a slew of controversial hydroelectric projects on the Chenab River in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident earlier this year. Yet, it does not seem to share serious apprehensions that leading environmentalists have expressed over their threat to a fragile Himalayan ecology. Last week, a panel under the ministry approved the 260-megawatt Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Kishtwar district of India-held Jammu and Kashmir, according to The Hindu . Earlier, in October, it was reported that environmental clearances were revived for the larger Sawalkote hydro-electric project on the same river. The clearances came against the backdrop of India unilaterally suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after blaming Pakistan over the Pahalgam incident — an allegation Islamabad had denied, terming the suspension of the 1960 treaty “an act of war”. Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab. At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty. The projects The Sawalkote project has been in the works for decades, and has faced numerous delays related to forest clearances and the compliance compulsions of the Indus Waters Treaty. As of now, the 1,856MW project is still said to be in the pre-construction stage. Its environment clearances have been reheated several times over. The Dulhasti Stage II is a 258MW project, conceived as a complementary run-of-the-river scheme to utilise the water discharged from the existing 390MW Dulhasti Power Station “more efficiently”. It is a smaller component of the frequently discussed Chenab basin projects. It is expected to cost around $35 million. According to The Hindu, “With the treaty now in abeyance, the centre is pushing ahead with several hydroelectric projects in the Indus basin, such as Sawalkote, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai I and II.” The total land requirement for the project is estimated at 60.3 hectares. This project will require 8.27 hectares of private land from two villages, Benzwar and Palmar, in Kishtwar district, The Hindu reported. Environmental concerns The question environmentalists are posing focuses greatly on a primary concern related to climate change. Water bodies are drying up rapidly. Chenab forms at the confluence of Chandra and Bhaga rivers in Lahaul and Spiti, Himachal Pradesh. According to the Indus Waters Treaty, Chenab is a Western River, allocated to Pakistan. India is permitted limited consumption use and unlimited non-consumption use of Chenab. From the treaty’s signing up to the year 2004-05, studies estimate that glacial volume in the Chenab basin has reduced by a whopping 33.3pc. This is what the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People NGO says: “For a river whose flows are made up of 50% meltwater when it leaves India at Akhnoor, this is shocking for both India and Pakistan”. “Glaciers, the water stored in them, the slow release of this water in spring and summers is the key to water security of the entire Himalayan region. Sixty per cent irrigation in the entire Indus basin depends on glacial melt. As the glaciers are concentrated in the Indian Himalayas, their health and sustenance is crucial for millions in both countries.” In the Hindu mythology, the River Saraswati, which is said to have made up a troika with the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, disappeared in ancient times. In the real world, many more rivers and water bodies face a similar fate. Chenab is among them. Sherry expresses alarm While there was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, former climate change minister Senator Sherry Rehman protested against this weaponisation of water, saying that it was “neither sane nor acceptable”. In a post on X, the PPP leader wrote, “In flagrant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India has just given approval to the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K). “As per the IWT, which cannot be unilaterally revoked, as recent UN rapporteurs have confirmed, Pakistan has control over the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers fall under India’s control,” she said. “Following the illegal suspension of the treaty, India has decided to fast-track several disputed hydroelectric projects in the Indus Basin. These projects include Sawalkot, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai-1 and 2. Dulhasti Stage-II is considered part of this strategy,” she said. “This weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the frontlines of climate change and environmental stress. It will inflame tensions in a bilateral relationship already bristling with hostility and distrust,” she said. Published in Dawn, December 30th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: An eight-year-old child died on Monday after he fell into an uncovered manhole while playing outside his house in Karachi’s Korangi area, said police. Earlier this month, the body of a three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal was recovered on December 1, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported. Following the tragedy, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials. The incident also prompted the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to increase the budget of 246 union committees (UCs) to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights. The latest victim, identified as Dilbar, was playing outside his residence with other area children when the tragedy occurred, Korangi Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Fida Husain Janwari told Dawn . The child’s relatives rushed to the spot, but were unable to save him. By the time the body was recovered, the child had died. SSP Janwari, along with other officials, later visited the spot where the accident happened and met the bereaved family. The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities. According to data released by the Edhi Foundation, 27 people died in Karachi in 2025 after falling into open manholes and nullahs. In Karachi, responsibilities for drains, roads, footpaths, sewerage, water supply and public safety are divided among the KMC, 25 town municipal corporations, around 250 union committees, the KDA, the water and sewerage corporation, cantonment boards, the Sindh government and private utilities. The city is run by a patchwork of authorities that rarely coordinate, and often contradict one another.",

      "summary_orig": "A major-ranked officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‘s Bajaur district, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday. The military identified the martyred officer as 36-year-old Major Adeel Zaman from Dera Ismail Khan. During the operation, security forces also killed five terrorists, added ISPR. On December 29, “security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in general area Khar, Bajaur district, on reported presence of Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij ,” it said. Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of operation, due to effective engagement by own troops five Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,“ said the statement. “However, during the intense fire exchange, Major Adeel Zaman (age: 36 years, resident of Dera Ismail Khan District), a brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, having fought gallantly, rendered the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat.” The statement further said that security forces recovered weapons and ammunition from the terrorists, who remained “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies as well as killing of innocent civilians”. Following the operation, security forces conducted a sanitisation operation to eliminate other terrorists in the area. “Relentless Counter-Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” added the statement. Funeral prayers offered The funeral prayers of Major Adeel were offered at Peshawar Garrison later in the evening. Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, commander Peshawar Corps and other senior military and civil officers were in attendance. Paying rich tribute to the officer’s sacrifice, Field Marshal Munir highlighted that the “martyrs of Pakistan Army are the pride of the nation and their sacrifices will forever be remembered,” said a statement by the military’s media wing. Senior military and civil leadership at the funeral prayers of martyred Major Adeel. —ISPR “He prayed for the elevation of the Shaheed’s ranks in Jannah and for patience and strength for the family.” “Major Adeel Zaman Shaheed laid down his life in the line of duty while leading from the front. Pakistan Armed Forces remain resolute in their commitment to eliminate the menace of terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices further strengthen the nation’s resolve,” added the statement. The martyred officer will be laid to rest at his native town in Dera Ismail Khan. Last month, at least 22 terrorists were killed and several were injured in Bajaur district during a successful counter-insurgency operation carried out by security forces. The IBO in Bajaur’s village of Gadar was termed a “major success” by the security sources in a statement and was carried out “based on highly classified information”. Last year, the federal government, in a meeting comprising top civilian and military leaders, announced a comprehensive, nationwide anti-militant operation codenamed ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ to mitigate a rise in attacks on security forces by militant groups.",

The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades released a video statement on its Telegram channel, saying: “We pause in reverence before … the masked man loved by millions … the great martyred commander and spokesperson of the Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida.” Israel previously announced it had killed Abu Obeida in a strike on Gaza on August 30. During the war, Abu Obeida, whose real name was Hudhayfa Samir al-Kahlout, emerged as a central figure eagerly awaited by Palestinians in Gaza, as well as by Arab and international media, for official statements from Hamas’s military wing, particularly those related to prisoner-exchange operations. Born on February 11, 1985 and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, Abu Obeida joined Hamas at an early age before becoming a member of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades. He later became the group’s sole spokesman, delivering video statements in military uniform with his face consistently concealed by a red keffiyeh. He had also been the target of multiple Israeli assassination attempts. According to Hamas officials, Abu Obeida embodied what they describe as “resistance” and was known for fiery and impactful speeches, many of which included threats against Israel or announcements of military operations.

Israel has decimated Hamas’s leadership, saying it seeks to eradicate the group following Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war. The video announcing Abu Obeida’s death was delivered by a masked man dressed in the former spokesperson’s distinctive style, who said he would adopt his predecessor’s name for future statements. In the same video, he also announced the deaths of four other Hamas commanders in Israeli attacks during the war.",

Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during Sheikh Hasina’s rule. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly, with Professor Muhammad Yunus leading the interim administration in Dhaka. “During the meeting, both sides discussed ways to expand cooperation in trade, investment, and aviation, as well as scaling up cultural, educational, and medical exchanges to further strengthen bilateral relations between the two South Asian nations,” said a statement shared on X by Bangladesh’s interim leader. Haider, during the meeting, also noted that bilateral trade has recorded a 20 per cent growth compared to last year, with business communities from both countries actively exploring new investment opportunities. The high commissioner further highlighted a “significant increase” in cultural exchanges, adding that “Bangladeshi students have shown strong interest in higher education opportunities in Pakistan, particularly in medical sciences, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence”. “Pakistan has witnessed a rise in patients travelling to its leading hospitals for liver and kidney transplants,” said Islamabad’s envoy. According to the statement, the high commissioner also stated that Pakistan was ready to offer “training and academic opportunities in transplantation-related medical fields”. The statement added that Bangladesh’s interim leader welcomed the “growing interactions between the two countries” and emphasised the “importance of increased visits, as well as cultural, educational, and people-to-people exchanges among SAARC member states.” “Professor Yunus also underscored the need to further boost Bangladesh–Pakistan trade,” added the statement. Yunus also expressed hope that during the current high commissioner’s tenure, both countries would “explore new avenues for investment and joint venture businesses“. In August, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also met with Professor Yunus. During his landmark visit to Dhaka, both countries stressed the need to revitalise regional cooperation through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc). The Foreign Office (FO) termed Dar’s two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations. Paki­stan and Bangladesh had agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side a month before, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter addressed to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday, expressed “deep concern” at the treatment meted out to him during his three-day Lahore visit , stating it was marked by “discourtesy and unnecessary hostility”. In a two-page letter, posted on X by the KP government, the Afridi recorded his formal objection to the Punjab government’s conduct, and said, “I write to you with deep concern and strong exception to the manner in which my recent visit to the Province of Punjab was handled, and the events that deliberately unfolded during and after the visit.” He recalled that the “sequence of actions witnessed was neither accidental nor administrative in nature. “It reflects conduct that is wholly incompatible with the dignity of constitutional office and the spirit of inter-provincial respect,” he said. CM Afridi told the Punjab CM that he undertook the visit in his capacity as the chief minister. “Regrettably, the treatment accorded to me was marked by discourtesy, unnecessary hostility, and protocol deviations that cannot be justified under any accepted standard of inter-provincial engagement,” he said. Afridi maintained that the Punjab government’s adoption of an extraordinary and excessive security posture — including sweeping detentions and visible enforcement theatrics — was “a message of intimidation rather than cooperation”. He complained that “such measures were neither proportionate nor warranted and conveyed an intent that went well beyond legitimate security considerations”. The KP chief minister further recalled that “even public places, including food streets and markets, were completely sealed, and whole blackouts were affected, venues denied, paining the common citizens of Lahore at this expense”. “Free access, as provided for in the Constitution, was even denied at Motorway rest areas,” added the letter. The KP CM also took note of the “coordinated and malicious social media campaign that accompanied and followed“ his visit. “Serious insinuations- specifically linking with narcotics were injected into public discourse,” Afridi said. “These allegations were amplified through accounts widely perceived to be aligned with, or operating under the umbrella of, the Government of Punjab,” he alleged. He continued: “Let me state this clearly: the use of state-linked digital platforms to circulate or amplify defamatory insinuations against a sitting Chief Minister of another province is unacceptable, irresponsible, and institutionally indefensible.” “Allegations of such gravity cannot be floated through innuendo or suggestion; they require evidence, jurisdiction, and lawful process,” he told the Punjab CM. “Anything short of that constitutes character assassination,” he added. KP CM was of the view that, “taken together — protocol degradation, excessive policing optics, and synchronised digital vilification — the pattern is too consistent to be dismissed as coincidental”. He alleged that the series of events suggested “planning and intent, aimed at humiliation rather than engagement”. CM Afridi maintained that “such actions undermine federal harmony, erode public trust in provincial institutions, and [set] a dangerous precedent where constitutional officeholders are targeted through insinuation rather than addressed through formal channels.” He termed the conduct “beneath the status of a provincial government“, and stressed that it damaged the ”collective credibility of federating units.“ As he concluded his letter to Maryam, the chief minister stated: “I place on record my strong protest and rejection of the treatment meted out to me and of the defamatory narratives propagated during this episode.” “I expect that your government will ensure that such conduct — administrative as well as digital — is neither repeated nor normalised, and that accountability is enforced where required,” he said. Punjab govt‘s conduct ‘undemocratic and reprehensible’ Separately, the KP CM also condemned the treatment meted out to him by the Punjab government during a cabinet meeting today, calling it “undemocratic, reprehensible and contrary to national unity”. The chief minister condemned the treatment and said, “The way me and my cabinet members were treated, the whole world witnessed it“. “When the country is going through political and economic instability, such an attitude — at a time when we need national unity — will only fan flames of hatred,“ the chief minister said. “Violence was perpetrated against cabinet members by the Punjab government, and roads were continuously blocked for a provincial chief minister, markets were forcibly shut down, even motorway rest areas were sealed, and turning off the lights during a visit to Mazar-e-Iqbal is extremely regrettable,” the minister was quoted as saying. He remarked that “such an attitude — reflecting Punjab government’s moral and intellectual depravity — was condemnable and alarming“. Afridi noted that the actions were “especially alarming given the instability in the country“ and warned that by continuing with such behaviour, “they were sowing hatred and division”. “We condemn the attitude in the strongest of words,” he said, adding that hateful attitudes were “detrimental to the country”. KP CM directed his government officials to be hospitable towards any officials or chief ministers visiting KP from other provinces in accordance with cultural traditions and norms. During the meeting, the chief minister also highlighted that the Centre had yet to release funds owed to the merged districts of KP under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP). “Work remains stalled in our merged districts because of it,” he said, adding that the Centre owed KP Rs4,758 billion. “It has been more than half a year, and we have not yet received the funds under AIP,” the chief minister said. “Even the amount that was already committed is not being given,” he added. Afridi was in Lahore to launch PTI’s street movement. He had arrived on Friday around 4:30pm, from where he made a beeline for the Punjab Assembly. However, the visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed. During his visit, he criticised the Punjab government for its rude behaviour toward him. “This shows their mean mentality, which cannot be approved in a civilised society,” he lambasted them and alleged that the “Punjab government is fanning hatred between the two provinces.“ Regretting the administration’s attitude on his arrival, he invited CM Maryam to visit KP, saying he would show her how democratic forces respect the office of a provincial chief executive. In a separate incident during his visit, when CM Afridi’s entourage reached Lahore’s Food Street for dinner, all restaurants were shut with the lights turned off, and even the general public was evicted.",

      "title": "In letter to Maryam, KP CM expresses ‘deep concern’ over treatment meted out to him in Punjab",
      "summary": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter addressed to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday, expressed “deep concern” at the treatment meted out to him during his three-day Lahore visit , stating it was marked by “discourtesy and unnecessary hostility”. In a two-page letter, posted on X by the KP government, the Afridi recorded his formal objection to the Punjab government’s conduct, and said, “I write to you with deep concern and strong exception to the manner in which my recent visit to the Province of Punjab was handled, and the events that deliberately unfolded during and after the visit.” He recalled that the “sequence of actions witnessed was neither accidental nor administrative in nature. “It reflects conduct that is wholly incompatible with the dignity of constitutional office and the spirit of inter-provincial respect,” he said. CM Afridi told the Punjab CM that he undertook the visit in his capacity as the chief minister. “Regrettably, the treatment accorded to me was marked by discourtesy, unnecessary hostility, and protocol deviations that cannot be justified under any accepted standard of inter-provincial engagement,” he said. Afridi maintained that the Punjab government’s adoption of an extraordinary and excessive security posture — including sweeping detentions and visible enforcement theatrics — was “a message of intimidation rather than cooperation”. He complained that “such measures were neither proportionate nor warranted and conveyed an intent that went well beyond legitimate security considerations”. The KP chief minister further recalled that “even public places, including food streets and markets, were completely sealed, and whole blackouts were affected, venues denied, paining the common citizens of Lahore at this expense”. “Free access, as provided for in the Constitution, was even denied at Motorway rest areas,” added the letter. The KP CM also took note of the “coordinated and malicious social media campaign that accompanied and followed“ his visit. “Serious insinuations- specifically linking with narcotics were injected into public discourse,” Afridi said. “These allegations were amplified through accounts widely perceived to be aligned with, or operating under the umbrella of, the Government of Punjab,” he alleged. He continued: “Let me state this clearly: the use of state-linked digital platforms to circulate or amplify defamatory insinuations against a sitting Chief Minister of another province is unacceptable, irresponsible, and institutionally indefensible.” “Allegations of such gravity cannot be floated through innuendo or suggestion; they require evidence, jurisdiction, and lawful process,” he told the Punjab CM. “Anything short of that constitutes character assassination,” he added. KP CM was of the view that, “taken together — protocol degradation, excessive policing optics, and synchronised digital vilification — the pattern is too consistent to be dismissed as coincidental”. He alleged that the series of events suggested “planning and intent, aimed at humiliation rather than engagement”. CM Afridi maintained that “such actions undermine federal harmony, erode public trust in provincial institutions, and [set] a dangerous precedent where constitutional officeholders are targeted through insinuation rather than addressed through formal channels.” He termed the conduct “beneath the status of a provincial government“, and stressed that it damaged the ”collective credibility of federating units.“ As he concluded his letter to Maryam, the chief minister stated: “I place on record my strong protest and rejection of the treatment meted out to me and of the defamatory narratives propagated during this episode.” “I expect that your government will ensure that such conduct — administrative as well as digital — is neither repeated nor normalised, and that accountability is enforced where required,” he said. Punjab govt‘s conduct ‘undemocratic and reprehensible’ Separately, the KP CM also condemned the treatment meted out to him by the Punjab government during a cabinet meeting today, calling it “undemocratic, reprehensible and contrary to national unity”. The chief minister condemned the treatment and said, “The way me and my cabinet members were treated, the whole world witnessed it“. “When the country is going through political and economic instability, such an attitude — at a time when we need national unity — will only fan flames of hatred,“ the chief minister said. “Violence was perpetrated against cabinet members by the Punjab government, and roads were continuously blocked for a provincial chief minister, markets were forcibly shut down, even motorway rest areas were sealed, and turning off the lights during a visit to Mazar-e-Iqbal is extremely regrettable,” the minister was quoted as saying. He remarked that “such an attitude — reflecting Punjab government’s moral and intellectual depravity — was condemnable and alarming“. Afridi noted that the actions were “especially alarming given the instability in the country“ and warned that by continuing with such behaviour, “they were sowing hatred and division”. “We condemn the attitude in the strongest of words,” he said, adding that hateful attitudes were “detrimental to the country”. KP CM directed his government officials to be hospitable towards any officials or chief ministers visiting KP from other provinces in accordance with cultural traditions and norms. During the meeting, the chief minister also highlighted that the Centre had yet to release funds owed to the merged districts of KP under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP). “Work remains stalled in our merged districts because of it,” he said, adding that the Centre owed KP Rs4,758 billion. “It has been more than half a year, and we have not yet received the funds under AIP,” the chief minister said. “Even the amount that was already committed is not being given,” he added. Afridi was in Lahore to launch PTI’s street movement. He had arrived on Friday around 4:30pm, from where he made a beeline for the Punjab Assembly. However, the visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed. During his visit, he criticised the Punjab government for its rude behaviour toward him. “This shows their mean mentality, which cannot be approved in a civilised society,” he lambasted them and alleged that the “Punjab government is fanning hatred between the two provinces.“ Regretting the administration’s attitude on his arrival, he invited CM Maryam to visit KP, saying he would show her how democratic forces respect the office of a provincial chief executive.

      "title_orig": "PTI founder Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi challenge Toshakhana 2 verdict in IHC",
      "summary_orig": "PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, on Monday filed separate appeals with the Islamabad High Court (IHC) challenging their conviction in the Toshakhana 2 case. A special court on December 20 sentenced Imran and Bushra to 17 years imprisonment in the case, which pertained to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. According to copies of the appeal available with Dawn , the couple’s lawyers contended that the sentencing was politically motivated, arguing, “The overarching objective of the present prosecution appears to be the continued incarceration of the appellant, thereby preventing his participation in national politics and curtailing his political role and influence.” Furthermore, it was noted that the case, initiated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), had been transferred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). “The learned trial court overlooked the methodology adopted by the Federal Investigation Agency in conducting the investigation. In the absence of settled law, precedent, or clear guidance on the subject, heightened care and caution were required in interpreting and applying the governing legal framework,” the appeal read. “Instead, both the investigating agency and the Trial Court proceeded in a cursory manner. This is evident from the absence of any FIR (first information report) on the record.” The appeals also noted that the FIA submitted a challan “within two days of the initiation of the investigation”, leaving inadequate time to conduct a fair and transparent probe. It was further noted that the Toshakhana 2 conviction was the fourth prosecution in the Toshakhana cases and constituted double jeopardy, “reflecting a repetitive and overlapping invocation of criminal process in respect of the same subject matter”. “NAB deliberately chose to bifurcate the prosecution by selectively proceeding in respect of one set of gifts while deferring or abandoning prosecution in respect of the others. Such a course of action is impermissible in law,” the appeals read, noting that Toshakahana 1 and 2 revolved around different gifts. “The bifurcation of what ought to have been a single, composite trial into multiple proceedings was undertaken with the ulterior motive of ensuring the continued incarceration of the present appellant,” the appeals argued. Moreover, the appeals stated that the conviction ignored the 2018 Toshakhana policy, with Clause I, mandating that all gifts received shall be duly reported and deposited with the Toshakhana. Clause VI “provides that gifts valued above Rs30,000 may be retained by the recipient upon payment of 50 per cent of the value exceeding the basic exemption of Rs30,000”. The appeals further argued that there was no violation of the Toshakhana policy, as the gifts were deposited and fees to retain the gifts were paid. It further noted that there are no criminal provisions or charges of criminal breach of trust or criminal misconduct envisaged in the policy, making the sentencing unlawful. “The learned trial judge misread and misapplied the relevant Toshakhana Policy/Rules governing retention of gifts,” the appeals read. “The prosecution wholly failed to establish the guilt of the appellant and his wife beyond [a] reasonable doubt; however, this fundamental deficiency was entirely overlooked by the learned Special Judge, Central, while recording the conviction.” Furthermore, the appeals contended that a criminal breach of trust requires the entrustment of property, dishonest misappropriation of such property for the accused’s own use, and in cases falling under Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by bank, merchant, or agent) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the accused must be a “public servant”; they contended that Imran and Bushra did not meet these requirements. “In the present case, the prosecution has failed to establish any of these foundational elements. There was no dishonest misappropriation or conversion, as the gifts were duly retained strictly in accordance with the Toshakhana Policy and Rules after payment of the requisite assessed amount,” the appeals read, arguing that Imran did not fall within the definition of a public servant as per Section 21 of the PPC. “The learned trial court, in paragraph 15 of the impugned judgment, has manifestly faltered in bringing the appellant within the ambit of the definition of a ‘public servant’ by relying upon the ninth description of Section 21 PPC, coupled with vague precedents from 1957 and 1961. This reflects a flawed, incorrect, and legally unsustainable approach,” Imran’s appeal read. Bushra’s appeal noted that she was “a housewife who has never held, occupied, or performed the functions of any public office”, meaning that the ruling was “ coram non judice , without lawful authority, and liable to be set aside in its entirety”. The appeals requested that the December 20 judgment be set aside and that Imran and Bushra be acquitted of the charges in the Toshakhana 2 case. Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year, in October, the two had denied all allegations in the case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.",
