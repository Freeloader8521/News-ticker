      "summary_orig": "Russia is trying to sever Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday, following days of ramped-up airstrikes on ports and energy facilities in the Odesa region and a critical route to the Moldova border. Russia has unleashed an almost continuous drone and missile campaign against a region where ports key to Ukraine’s foreign trade and fuel supplies operate, after Moscow threatened to cut “ Ukraine off from the sea ”. Strikes have escalated even as the United States pursues an uphill diplomatic drive to coax a deal to end the war. Ukraine held talks with the US team on Friday, and American negotiators were set to meet Russian officials in Florida today. “The situation in the Odesa region is harsh due to Russian strikes on port infrastructure and logistics. Russia is once again trying to restrict Ukraine’s access to the sea and block our coastal regions,” Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv. Russia’s aim is “to sow chaos, to exert moral pressure during winter … so that there is no fuel, no food supplies, so that there are problems with medical supplies”, he said. Russia’s attack on Pivdennyi port today hit reservoirs, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said on the Telegram messaging app, a day after a missile strike on the port killed eight people and injured at least 30. Geneva-based vegetable oil producer Allseeds said three tanks storing sunflower oil at the site were set ablaze in Pivdennyi, and one of its workers was killed and two were injured. Russia’s Defence Ministry was not available for immediate comment. The Kremlin has said Ukraine’s economic infrastructure is a legitimate military target in the almost four-year-old full-out war. Focus on Odesa Since Thursday, Russian forces have hit a bridge on the Dniester River near the village of Mayaky, southwest of Pivdennyi, at least five times, Kuleba told reporters. The bridge, which connects parts of the region divided by the river and sea inlets, is the main transport route westward to border crossings with Moldova, and is not operational now. The route accounts for around 40 per cent of fuel supplies to Ukraine, Kuleba said. Ukrainian authorities have set up a pontoon bridge and rerouted logistics through other regions, securing civilian and freight logistics. “The focus of the war may have shifted towards Odessa,” Kuleba said, adding that the “crazy” attacks could escalate even further as Russia tries to undermine Ukraine’s economy. Last week, one of the war’s biggest Russian air attacks on the Black Sea region damaged energy facilities and prompted a blackout in the biggest seaport, Odesa, plunging hundreds of thousands of civilians into darkness for days. Airstrikes on ports also damaged three Turkish-flagged vessels in December. Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to cut Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea in retaliation for Kyiv’s recent drone strikes on Moscow’s sanctions-busting “shadow-fleet” tankers. Ukraine says those vessels are used to transport oil, Russia’s main revenue source for funding its almost four-year-old full-scale invasion of its neighbour.",

      "title_orig": "Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi sentenced to 17 years in Toshakhana 2 case",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A special court on Saturday sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case. The case pertains to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated. Imran was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison; he was awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 (common intention) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Pakistan Penal Code, and seven years under Section 5(2) (criminal misconduct by public servants) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was also sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment under the same provisions. Both of them were also fined Rs16.4 million. As per the law, a failure to pay the fines will result in additional jail time. View this post on Instagram Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Imran’s jail term in the case would begin after his sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said, “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment.” It added that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was “hereby given to the convicts”. Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year in October, the two had denied all allegations in case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case. PTI slams verdict The PTI, in a post on X, said that Imran’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo court announced the verdict of the Toshakhana 2 case”. “A closed-door jail trial is neither free nor fair; it is in fact a military trial,” the party said. It also shared a video of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan inside a car asking why she was not being allowed to proceed further. “They can’t stop us. The jail trial is today,” she said in the video, adding that it was “illegal” that the family was being stopped. Later, Aleema, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against Imran were being delivered under a pre-written script. “Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. Aleema claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to ten years or fourteen years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said. “Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned. View this post on Instagram According to Aleema, Imran’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in what she described as illegal solitary confinement. Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja stated that the case was being conducted on the basis of promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said. He described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was put on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case. PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgment. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former prime minister and his wife were those of a “Kangaroo court”. “There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Ayub added. A detailed statement released by the PTI’s Central Media Department rejected the sentence against the former prime minister and his wife, terming it “unconstitutional, illegal, ill-intended” and the “worst form of political revenge”. The party alleged that Imran and Bushra Bibi’s lawyers were not present at the time of the verdict was announced. “Neither were their families allowed to come to court, nor were basic judicial requirements fulfilled,” PTI said. “This is open contempt of court, contempt of law and contempt of justice,” the party said. The party further stated that the sentence was the “second for the same charge, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy”. The party alleged that the courts had become an “instrument of political engineering, rather than being an independent forum”. It said that the “sole” purpose of this court was to “prolong the illegal imprisonment of Imran and provide temporary support to the rulers who are afraid of the mandate of the people”. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja slammed the sentence for how its proceedings were conducted in “undue haste” with the couple and their lead counsel not present when the judgement was announced. Minister says sentence to run consecutively Separately, Information Minister Tarar said the punishment was a “consecutive sentence”, adding that it would begin after the sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. Speaking to Geo News , the minister welcomed the judgment, asserting that the former prime minister and his wife had “committed fraud” by getting the gifts undervalued and retaining them for personal use. He said that PTI founder and his wife’s actions were a “breach of public trust”. View this post on Instagram “During the trial, when these gifts were properly assessed, it emerged that[..] the actual price was quite high,“ he said. He further stated that the two had “committed fraud” by undervaluing the gifts and retaining them for personal use. “They had no right to harm the exchequer and retain gifts,” he stressed. He said the judgment was “completely fair and grounded in the principles of justice”. “The misuse of office, dishonesty with the government’s property, and criminal breach of trust, all of it has been proven,” he said. Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, while speaking with Geo News, remarked that the judgment was “in line with the Constitution and the law”. He stressed that “there was no political side to this, if you violate the law, it is clear that a punishment is expected”. “The trial that went on for 15-16 months, it was proven that PTI founder and his wife caused the national exchequer significant harm as the set’s valuation was under-reported,” Malik said. “The gift was not even submitted,” he added. Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the judgment came after lengthy legal proceedings. Speaking to Geo News, he noted that the case followed a similar pattern to that of the Toshakhana-I reference. “The state was given a gift that was not deposited, which they were legally bound to do according to the procedure for acceptance and gifts in Toshakhana,“ he said. “Unfortunately, Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan attempted to buy the set at throwaway rates,“ he said. He asserted that all the facts had “now been established in light of today’s judgement”. Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah also addressed the sentence while speaking to the media in Chiniot, saying that state gifts did not belong to an individual but to the state. He said the entire case against Imran was documented.",

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: A special court on Saturday sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case. The case pertains to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated. Imran was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison; he was awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 (common intention) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Pakistan Penal Code, and seven years under Section 5(2) (criminal misconduct by public servants) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was also sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment under the same provisions. Both of them were also fined Rs16.4 million. As per the law, a failure to pay the fines will result in additional jail time. View this post on Instagram Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Imran’s jail term in the case would begin after his sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said, “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment.” It added that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was “hereby given to the convicts”. Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year in October, the two had denied all allegations in case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case. PTI slams verdict The PTI, in a post on X, said that Imran’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo court announced the verdict of the Toshakhana 2 case”. “A closed-door jail trial is neither free nor fair; it is in fact a military trial,” the party said. It also shared a video of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan inside a car asking why she was not being allowed to proceed further. “They can’t stop us. The jail trial is today,” she said in the video, adding that it was “illegal” that the family was being stopped. Later, Aleema, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against Imran were being delivered under a pre-written script. “Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. Aleema claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to ten years or fourteen years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said. “Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned. View this post on Instagram According to Aleema, Imran’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in what she described as illegal solitary confinement. Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja stated that the case was being conducted on the basis of promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said. He described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was put on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case. PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgment. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former prime minister and his wife were those of a “Kangaroo court”. “There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Ayub added. A detailed statement released by the PTI’s Central Media Department rejected the sentence against the former prime minister and his wife, terming it “unconstitutional, illegal, ill-intended” and the “worst form of political revenge”. The party alleged that Imran and Bushra Bibi’s lawyers were not present at the time of the verdict was announced. “Neither were their families allowed to come to court, nor were basic judicial requirements fulfilled,” PTI said. “This is open contempt of court, contempt of law and contempt of justice,” the party said. The party further stated that the sentence was the “second for the same charge, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy”. The party alleged that the courts had become an “instrument of political engineering, rather than being an independent forum”. It said that the “sole” purpose of this court was to “prolong the illegal imprisonment of Imran and provide temporary support to the rulers who are afraid of the mandate of the people”. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja slammed the sentence for how its proceedings were conducted in “undue haste” with the couple and their lead counsel not present when the judgement was announced. Minister says sentence to run consecutively Separately, Information Minister Tarar said the punishment was a “consecutive sentence”, adding that it would begin after the sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. Speaking to Geo News , the minister welcomed the judgment, asserting that the former prime minister and his wife had “committed fraud” by getting the gifts undervalued and retaining them for personal use. He said that PTI founder and his wife’s actions were a “breach of public trust”. View this post on Instagram “During the trial, when these gifts were properly assessed, it emerged that[..] the actual price was quite high,“ he said. He further stated that the two had “committed fraud” by undervaluing the gifts and retaining them for personal use. “They had no right to harm the exchequer and retain gifts,” he stressed.

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Saturday sentenced PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed to 10 years in prison terms in two more May 9 cases. The latest court verdict comes a day after a Lahore ATC acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while sentencing four other leaders, including Dr. Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, and Ejaz Chaudhry, to 10 years in prison in another case related to the May 9 riots. Rana Mudassar, the counsel for the PTI leaders, confirmed the development to Dawn , saying the cases are related to the burning of police vehicles in Lahore’s Gulberg and the burning of a container near Kalma Chowk during the nationwide riots on May 9, 2023 following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan. On that day, supporters and workers of the party, reacting to founder Imran Khan’s arrest, vandalised and torched military installations and government properties. The state subsequently launched a crackdown against Imran and his party, booking the party founder and its leadership in multiple cases. ATC-III Judge Arshad Javed presided over the hearings for both cases today in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. A total of 22 accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison, while five were acquitted in the Kalma Chowk case. In the Gulberg case, the judge handed down sentences to five, including the PTI leaders, while acquitting 22 others. The judge noted that former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had not yet been indicted in either case and his trial would proceed separately once a supplementary challan was submitted by the prosecution. According to the prosecution, a total of 78 witnesses were presented in both cases. In the Gulberg case, a challan was filed against 33 individuals, while four others were declared proclaimed offenders during the trial. In the Kalma Chowk case, the prosecution filed a challan against 36 people, while 12 others, including Hammad Azhar, Murad Saeed, Zubair Niazi, and Mian Aslam Iqbal, were declared absconders. The prosecutor argued that PTI leaders had instigated party workers to revolt and create public disorder. Talking to the media later, PTI’s counsel said the cases were scheduled for routine proceedings, but “sentences have been handed down once again in the darkness of night”. He added that the defence was not given the chance to fully present its case. “The morale of the prisoners in Kot Lakhpat Jail is high. So far, the leaders have been sentenced to a total of more than 200 years,” the counsel said, adding that the sentences would be challenged in the high court. With these verdicts, decisions have now been announced in seven of the 14 cases related to the May 9 riots registered in Lahore. Verdicts had previously been announced in trials concerning an attack on Shadman Police Station, violence at Sherpao Bridge, the burning of police vehicles near Rahat Bakery, the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House, and an attack on the entrance gate of the GOR-I Club Chowk.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: After weeks of protracted deliberations with security and administration officials, tribal elders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s restive Tirah valley finally agreed to start vacating their homes from January 10, ahead of an operation against militants, after reaching a written agreement with the district administration. The deadlock had persisted between the valley’s tribal elders and government officials over the launch of a military operation in the valley as well as the relocation of families to prevent collateral damage. Sources among the 24-member jirga, who negotiated the written agreement on the displacement process with the district administration, said that the entire Tirah valley would be vacated by January 25, 2026, thus paving the way for the long-anticipated military operation against all proscribed militant groups currently holed up in the valley. Spelling out the terms and conditions of the written agreement, the jirga said that the district administration agreed to pay Rs3 million to those whose houses were completely damaged and Rs1 million to those whose houses were partially damaged, respectively, during the military operation, which will be launched once the evacuation is completed. They said that the jirga was also assured that every family would receive Rs250,000 through JazzCash or Easypaisa upon biometric verification at the time of registration at the Bagh Markaz and Paindi Cheena registration centers. Each family would further be provided with a monthly stipend of Rs50,000 until April 5, 2026, when the return process would begin following the completion of the military operation, the sources added. The district administration also agreed to arrange free transportation for the departing families, along with the provision of free health services during their journey to their next destination. It was further decided during the deliberations held at Khyber House that families who had already left their homes would be included in the survey of newly displaced families, with the head of each family required to report to either the Bagh Markaz or Paindi Cheena registration center for biometric verification before January 25, 2026. A representative jirga of Tirah elders had earlier presented a list of demands to security and administrative officials, which included Rs8 million and Rs4 million as compensation for fully and partially damaged houses, respectively, along with Rs500,000 for every departing family. The demands were, however, toned down to a limit mutually agreed upon by the security and administrative officials and the jirga members, with the Tirah elders left with no option but to accept a written agreement as time was running out for the launch of a decisive military operation. Sources among the jirga members insisted that collateral damage from indiscriminate artillery shelling of suspected militants’ hideouts and quadcopter attacks was a major concern for most residents of the Tirah valley, while security officials argued that the presence of militants in congested residential areas was a major obstacle to executing intelligence-based military operations (IBOs). They said that the forceful occupation of private houses by militant groups and their frequent changes of location were also a source of continuous trouble and inconvenience, with security officials constantly insisting on the complete relocation of Tirah residents to pave the way for a decisive push against all outlawed militant groups. Security officials, in consultation with local elders, had earlier agreed on limited internal displacement during the IBOs, with families from a suspected locality relocated to a nearby safer area for a limited period and returning home upon the completion of the IBOs. However, this failed to alleviate the suffering of local residents, while security forces were forced to launch frequent IBOs whenever militant groups re-entered areas previously declared safe. “It’s imperative that we leave the entire valley at the disposal of the security forces after our complete relocation to safer locations, far from the heat of the military operations in Tirah,” a jirga member told Dawn . The jirga member, however, firmly insisted on the demand that there be no further displacement once the anticipated military operation is completed, with a strong assurance of no future IBOs in areas cleared after the major operation. Dawn has also learned that MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani, along with members of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, who had vehemently opposed forced displacement and the subsequent military operations in Tirah, were left out of the intense deliberations between the 24-member Tirah jirga and district administration officials. Later, responding to a Dawn query about his absence from the Friday jirga, MNA Iqbal Afridi insisted that military operations in the merged districts had never achieved the desired results and had instead proved to be a source of destruction and prolonged displacement of innocent tribesmen. He regretted being declared a proclaimed offender following the registration of numerous allegedly false First Information Reports (FIRs) against him, as he had consistently raised his voice against the military operations and forced displacements, which he said were actually aimed at gaining unlawful control over the natural resources of the newly merged districts. Last month at least five terrorists affiliated with the proscribed Tekreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in an IBO in Tirah valley. In September, at least two dozen residents of Tirah, including women and children, lost their lives in blasts , which officials claim were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses.",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Baloch rights activist Abdul Qadeer Baloch passed away on Saturday in a Quetta hospital after a prolonged illness. He served as the vice chairman of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), which set up a camp years ago on Quetta’s Adalat Road, a site that has long stood as a symbol of protest against enforced disappearances in Balochistan. VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch confirmed the rights activist’s passing to Daw n, saying: “He had been ill for a long time and was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Quetta for the past two months.” The group’s chairman added that the funeral prayers and burial would be performed on Sunday in Shaheed Sikanderabad district. Baloch said the deceased’s struggle had remained prominent in human rights circles across the country. In November 2011, Qadeer received the mutilated body of his son, Jalil Reiki, who was the information secretary of the Baloch Republican Party. The kidnapping and subsequent death of his son further galvanised the advocacy group, strengthening its efforts to support families enduring similar tragedies. In 2013, the activist led a long march on foot from Quetta to Islamabad, joined by other Baloch men and women, to protest against enforced disappearances. Since its inception, VBMP has raised its voice against the enforced disappearances of students, political activists and other civilians. ‘Legacy will endure’ The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) mourned the death and paid homage to the deceased activist. “His legacy will endure in the countless families he stood beside. We reiterate that the state must take concerted action to restore the rights for which Mama spent decades campaigning.” Advocate Rahab Khan Buledi, chairman of the Balochistan Bar Council’s Executive Committee, paid tribute to Qadeer in a statement. “Mama Qadeer Baloch had been peacefully struggling for the recovery of missing persons for a long time. His democratic struggle is commendable. He was a strong voice of the oppressed,“ he said, adding that the council also paid homage to him. Balochistan National Party President Sardar Akhtar Mengal hailed him as a “symbol of resistance against state oppression, enforced disappearances and injustice. ”Despite immense personal loss and relentless hardship, he never abandoned the families of the disappeared or his demand for truth and accountability.

      "summary_en": "QUETTA: Baloch rights activist Abdul Qadeer Baloch passed away on Saturday in a Quetta hospital after a prolonged illness. He served as the vice chairman of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), which set up a camp years ago on Quetta’s Adalat Road, a site that has long stood as a symbol of protest against enforced disappearances in Balochistan. VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch confirmed the rights activist’s passing to Daw n, saying: “He had been ill for a long time and was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Quetta for the past two months.” The group’s chairman added that the funeral prayers and burial would be performed on Sunday in Shaheed Sikanderabad district. Baloch said the deceased’s struggle had remained prominent in human rights circles across the country. In November 2011, Qadeer received the mutilated body of his son, Jalil Reiki, who was the information secretary of the Baloch Republican Party. The kidnapping and subsequent death of his son further galvanised the advocacy group, strengthening its efforts to support families enduring similar tragedies. In 2013, the activist led a long march on foot from Quetta to Islamabad, joined by other Baloch men and women, to protest against enforced disappearances. Since its inception, VBMP has raised its voice against the enforced disappearances of students, political activists and other civilians. ‘Legacy will endure’ The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) mourned the death and paid homage to the deceased activist. “His legacy will endure in the countless families he stood beside. We reiterate that the state must take concerted action to restore the rights for which Mama spent decades campaigning.” Advocate Rahab Khan Buledi, chairman of the Balochistan Bar Council’s Executive Committee, paid tribute to Qadeer in a statement. “Mama Qadeer Baloch had been peacefully struggling for the recovery of missing persons for a long time. His democratic struggle is commendable. He was a strong voice of the oppressed,“ he said, adding that the council also paid homage to him. Balochistan National Party President Sardar Akhtar Mengal hailed him as a “symbol of resistance against state oppression, enforced disappearances and injustice. ”Despite immense personal loss and relentless hardship, he never abandoned the families of the disappeared or his demand for truth and accountability.

      "title_orig": "US grapples with defining mandate for Gaza stabilisation force",
      "summary_orig": "The United States (US) is facing a delicate balancing act in defining the mandate for a proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza. Any plan must address the concerns of potential troop-contributing countries while also satisfying Israel’s security demands — a combination that has so far proven elusive. As diplomats gathered this week in Doha and Miami, it became clear that clarity on legal authority, rules of engagement, and operational responsibilities is a prerequisite for any country, particularly Muslim-majority nations, to commit troops. Until these questions are resolved, phase two of the Gaza peace plan risks remaining largely a blueprint on paper rather than an actionable plan. Consultations in Doha and Miami Earlier this week, the United States and its partners convened a conference in Doha, Qatar, bringing together representatives from more than two dozen countries to discuss key aspects of the ISF, including leadership, rules of engagement, and operational structure. The meeting, however, failed to produce a mandate that would satisfy both Israel and potential troop contributors. The lack of consensus highlighted the challenge Washington faces in moving from a diplomatic framework to an actionable plan. Turkish officials, for example, reiterated their readiness to participate, despite Israel’s objection to their participation. On Friday, Washington hosted senior officials from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkiye in Miami to advance discussions on the second phase of the ceasefire. The talks, led by US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, aimed to bridge gaps rather than finalise agreements. Israel and Hamas were not directly represented. The second phase envisions three intertwined steps: the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the establishment of an interim governing authority, and deployment of the proposed ISF to maintain order. Officials described the discussions as constructive but acknowledged slow progress. The talks occurred amid continued hostilities. An Israeli strike on a shelter in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood killed at least six Palestinians and wounded several others. Diplomats have warned that deploying an international force without a clearly defined mandate could place troops directly in harm’s way. ‘Mandate first, commitments later’ In his remarks during a press briefing on Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasised that defining the mandate is a prerequisite for troop contributions. Key questions remain unresolved, including the force’s legal authority, command structure, funding, rules of engagement, and duration. “We owe countries more answers before we can ask them to firmly commit,” Rubio said, noting that several states have expressed willingness to consider participation, but no formal commitments should be expected at this stage. Rubio specifically mentioned Pakistan , noting that Islamabad had offered to be considered for participation but had not formally committed. He described Washington as “very grateful to Pakistan for their offer to be a part of it, or at least their offer to consider being a part of it,” while stressing that clarity on mandate and operational details is needed before any troop contribution. Pakistan, Rubio added, could be a key partner if a mandate is finalised and concerns expressed by Muslim nations are addressed. Rubio also outlined plans for a “Board of Peace” and a Palestinian technocratic committee to oversee day-to-day governance. “I think the next step here is announcing the Board of Peace, announcing the Palestinian technocratic group that will help provide daily governance.  And then once that’s in place, I think that will allow us to firm up the stabilisation force, including how it’s going to be paid for, what the rules of engagement are, what their role will be in demilitarization and so forth,” he said. US officials view these interim bodies as essential to providing a political framework that legitimises the ISF. Without such structures, foreign troops risk operating in a political vacuum, caught between competing claims of authority. Disarmament — the main sticking point Disarmament of Hamas remains highly contentious. Bassem Naim, a Hamas official, insisted that talks must compel Israel to end truce violations and allow increased humanitarian aid. Earlier this week, Hamas chief Khalil al-Hayya said that the group had a “legitimate right” to hold weapons and that any proposal for the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire must uphold that right. Hamas has resisted full disarmament, arguing such steps cannot precede a credible political settlement. Israel, meanwhile, demands assurances that Gaza will not again become a Hamas stronghold. Rubio indicated that Washington aims to dismantle Hamas’ military capabilities while leaving room for further negotiation. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire. While the famine has officially been declared to have been averted , UN agencies warn that the population remains at serious risk. Diplomatic tensions are compounded by the US House’s vote to sanction the International Criminal Court over its war crimes investigation — a move welcomed by Israel but criticised by human rights groups and several Muslim nations. A long, uncertain road Rubio estimated that full implementation of the second phase of the Gaza peace plan could take two to three years. So far, the ISF remains largely conceptual rather than deployable. What the Doha and Miami talks, along with Rubio’s statements, reveal is a broader reality: phase two is as much a political transition as a security arrangement, and no country — including Pakistan — is likely to commit troops until the ISF’s mandate, authority, and political framework are clearly defined.

      "summary_en": "The United States (US) is facing a delicate balancing act in defining the mandate for a proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza. Any plan must address the concerns of potential troop-contributing countries while also satisfying Israel’s security demands — a combination that has so far proven elusive. As diplomats gathered this week in Doha and Miami, it became clear that clarity on legal authority, rules of engagement, and operational responsibilities is a prerequisite for any country, particularly Muslim-majority nations, to commit troops. Until these questions are resolved, phase two of the Gaza peace plan risks remaining largely a blueprint on paper rather than an actionable plan. Consultations in Doha and Miami Earlier this week, the United States and its partners convened a conference in Doha, Qatar, bringing together representatives from more than two dozen countries to discuss key aspects of the ISF, including leadership, rules of engagement, and operational structure. The meeting, however, failed to produce a mandate that would satisfy both Israel and potential troop contributors. The lack of consensus highlighted the challenge Washington faces in moving from a diplomatic framework to an actionable plan. Turkish officials, for example, reiterated their readiness to participate, despite Israel’s objection to their participation. On Friday, Washington hosted senior officials from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkiye in Miami to advance discussions on the second phase of the ceasefire. The talks, led by US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, aimed to bridge gaps rather than finalise agreements. Israel and Hamas were not directly represented. The second phase envisions three intertwined steps: the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the establishment of an interim governing authority, and deployment of the proposed ISF to maintain order. Officials described the discussions as constructive but acknowledged slow progress. The talks occurred amid continued hostilities. An Israeli strike on a shelter in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood killed at least six Palestinians and wounded several others.

      "summary_orig": "Tens of thousands of Bangladeshi mourners, including the country’s interim government leader, attended the funeral on Saturday of a slain youth leader and election candidate amid tight security. Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last week while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He died on Thursday in Singapore after six days on life support. His death has prompted a wave of unrest in the South Asian nation that included coordinated mob attacks on major newspapers and cultural institutions. Police and paramilitary forces were deployed across the capital for Saturday’s funeral, but there were no reports of any renewed violence. A convoy carrying the body of Sharif Osman Hadi, a student leader, who died after being shot in the head, moves along the crowd after the funeral prayer, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 20. — Reuters Interim government leader Muhammad Yunus said Hadi’s legacy would endure, describing the funeral as a collective pledge to uphold the ideals he had championed. “Today, we have come to promise you (Hadi) that we will fulfil what you stood for,” Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, told the mourners, who included Bangladesh’s army chief and representatives from across the political spectrum. In a rare and symbolic honour, Hadi was laid to rest on the Dhaka University campus beside the grave of national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. Muhammad Yunus, Chief Advisor of the Interim government of Bangladesh, offers funeral for Sharif Osman Hadi, a student leader, who died after being shot in the head, at Manik Mia Avenue, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 20. — Reuters Bangladeshis hope election will end years of instability Bangladesh is to elect a new parliament on February 12 — a transition many hope will help the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million people recover from nearly two years of instability and reclaim its position as a regional success story. But frequent bouts of violent protests and political wrangling among disparate groups, including Islamist hardliners, have punctured the national sense of euphoria that arose after Hasina was ousted in August 2024. It has also exposed the limitations of Yunus’ interim government, analysts say, raising questions over his grip on governance in the world’s largest apparel producer after China. The government has declared Saturday a day of state mourning for Hadi and has urged citizens to resist “mob violence by fringe elements”, warning that turmoil threatens Bangladesh’s fragile democratic transition. Human Rights Watch called Hadi’s killing a “terrible act” and urged the government to act urgently to halt the violence that has gripped the country since Hasina’s ouster. The rights group also condemned the attacks on the media as an assault on free expression. Bangladesh ranks 149th of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index. Rights groups say continued attacks on journalists and activists could further shrink civic space ahead of the election. Amnesty International urged prompt, independent investigations into Hadi’s killing and the subsequent violence, including the burning of newspaper offices and harassment of journalists. Demonstrations continued on Friday in the Shahbagh area of the capital, where crowds demanded justice for Hadi and accountability for the attacks. A mob stormed the Dhaka office of Udichi Shilpigosthi, Bangladesh’s premier progressive cultural organisation. The violence has spread beyond the capital. In Chittagong, protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission, reflecting growing anti-India sentiment since Hasina fled to New Delhi after her ouster. Her party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could derail the vote.",

      "summary_orig": "Pat Cummins skittled England’s top order and Nathan Lyon spun out their soft underbelly to all but seal another Ashes series victory for Australia on day four of the third Test at Adelaide Oval on Saturday. Chasing a world record 435 runs to win, England were reduced to 207 for six at stumps, still 228 runs short of victory and having played no small part in their predicament through batting misadventure. Jamie Smith, on two, and Will Jacks, on 11, were left to try to salvage something from the wreckage of another demolition day for the tourists. With holders Australia 2-0 up in the five-test series after eight-wicket wins in Perth and Brisbane, they need only draw the match to retain the urn. View this post on Instagram But there is little prospect of a rousing comeback win from an England squad that have failed to live up to expectations. “Obviously very disappointing. Uphill battle from here,” England opener Zak Crawley told reporters. “We came here to win the Ashes and we’re staring down the barrel now …. It’s been tough, they’re a very, very good side…. Obviously we’ve been slightly short of our best but credit to them.” Questions have been asked of England’s preparations, selections and batting approach, and there were plenty more teachable moments from Saturday’s play at Adelaide Oval. Their batters seemed determined to squander the rare periods when they could reasonably be judged to be on top of the Australian attack. They needed at least one, and preferably two, to stand up like Travis Head who put on 170, nearly half Australia’s second-innings total of 349, to effectively bat England out of the game. Instead, they were prey for Australia skipper Cummins, who took three top-order wickets andextracted gold from a still-firm pitch that proved unyielding, initially, for others. In his first test since July, coming off a back injury, Cummins became the second test captain to take 150 wickets, joining Pakistan’s Imran Khan (187). Keeping the champagne on ice England’s Ben Duckett was first to go, taking a half-hearted push at a nagging ball and sending an edge flying chest-high to Marnus Labuschagne in the slips. The shot was neither Bazball aggression nor stout defence, something meekly in between. Number three Ollie Pope fell for 17 in a similar vein, nicking off to the slips with a more hard-handed prod and watching in disbelief as Labuschagne dived forward to take a one-hander just above the grass. Labuschagne raced around the wicket in open-mouthed celebration, and England were 31 for two. Another collapse beckoned but Crawley (85) and Joe Root (39) dug in until just after tea. Root was lucky not to be dismissed lbw when he failed to play a shot at the part-time spin of Head, only to be caught-behind off Cummins moments later, playing at a ball he should have left. It was Cummins’ 13th dismissal of England’s master batter, the most by any bowler. Root slapped his bat in frustration but his was a misdemeanour compared to the batting crime committed by Harry Brook, who was bowled for 30 by Nathan Lyon with a botched reverse sweep. Lyon followed up by bowling captain Ben Stokes for five with a ball that pitched, straightened and crashed into middle and off-stump. The collapse gathered pace as Crawley lumbered forward at Lyon, misjudged the flight and was gleefully stumped by the clinical Alex Carey. He had batted well for his 85 to that point but his wicket came as the pressure rose, leaving England needing a miracle from Jacks and Smith. Each has struggled for runs when their team has been crying out for them. Australia will keep the champagne on ice until victory is complete. “We want to keep working hard and probably not look too far ahead,” said Carey, who singled out Lyon for praise. “I just thought Nathan was bowling really well and kept putting lots of energy on the ball. He toiled away all day and finally got some reward.”",

Instead, they were prey for Australia skipper Cummins, who took three top-order wickets andextracted gold from a still-firm pitch that proved unyielding, initially, for others. In his first test since July, coming off a back injury, Cummins became the second test captain to take 150 wickets, joining Pakistan’s Imran Khan (187). Keeping the champagne on ice England’s Ben Duckett was first to go, taking a half-hearted push at a nagging ball and sending an edge flying chest-high to Marnus Labuschagne in the slips. The shot was neither Bazball aggression nor stout defence, something meekly in between. Number three Ollie Pope fell for 17 in a similar vein, nicking off to the slips with a more hard-handed prod and watching in disbelief as Labuschagne dived forward to take a one-hander just above the grass. Labuschagne raced around the wicket in open-mouthed celebration, and England were 31 for two. Another collapse beckoned but Crawley (85) and Joe Root (39) dug in until just after tea. Root was lucky not to be dismissed lbw when he failed to play a shot at the part-time spin of Head, only to be caught-behind off Cummins moments later, playing at a ball he should have left. It was Cummins’ 13th dismissal of England’s master batter, the most by any bowler. Root slapped his bat in frustration but his was a misdemeanour compared to the batting crime committed by Harry Brook, who was bowled for 30 by Nathan Lyon with a botched reverse sweep. Lyon followed up by bowling captain Ben Stokes for five with a ball that pitched, straightened and crashed into middle and off-stump. The collapse gathered pace as Crawley lumbered forward at Lyon, misjudged the flight and was gleefully stumped by the clinical Alex Carey. He had batted well for his 85 to that point but his wicket came as the pressure rose, leaving England needing a miracle from Jacks and Smith. Each has struggled for runs when their team has been crying out for them. Australia will keep the champagne on ice until victory is complete. “We want to keep working hard and probably not look too far ahead,” said Carey, who singled out Lyon for praise. “I just thought Nathan was bowling really well and kept putting lots of energy on the ball. He toiled away all day and finally got some reward.”",

      "summary_orig": "The US military launched large-scale strikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria on Friday in retaliation for an attack on American personnel, US officials said. A US-led coalition had already been carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in Syria targeting Islamic State suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces. US President Donald Trump had vowed to retaliate after a suspected ISIS attack killed US personnel last weekend in Syria. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes targeted “ISIS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites” and said the operation was “OPERATION HAWKEYE STRIKE”. “This is not the beginning of a war it is a declaration of vengeance,” Hegseth said. “Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,” he added. Trump said on social media that the Syrian government fully supported the strikes and that the US was inflicting “very serious retaliation”. At a speech in North Carolina on Friday night, Trump called it a “massive” blow against the ISIS members that the US blames for the Dec 13 attack on coalition forces. “We hit the ISIS thugs in Syria. It was very successful,” Trump said at a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. US Central Command said the strikes hit more than 70 targets across central Syria, adding that Jordanian fighter jets supported the operation. One US official said the strikes were carried out by US F-15 and A-10 jets, along with Apache helicopters and HIMARS rocket systems. Syria reiterated its steadfast commitment to fighting Islamic State and ensuring that it has “no safe havens on Syrian territory,” according to a statement by the foreign ministry. Two US Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed on Saturday in the central Syrian town of Palmyra by an attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces before being shot dead, according to the US military. Three other US soldiers were also wounded in the attack. About 1,000 US troops remain in Syria. The Syrian Interior Ministry has described the attacker as a member of the Syrian security forces suspected of sympathising with Islamic State. Syria’s government is now led by former rebels who toppled leader Bashar al-Assad last year after a 13-year civil war, and includes members of Syria’s former Al Qaeda branch who broke with the group and clashed with Islamic State. Syria has been cooperating with a US-led coalition against Islamic State, reaching an agreement last month when President Ahmed al-Sharaa visited the White House.",

      "summary_orig": "PPP leader Sherry Rehman has said that Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan must apologise following his heated exchange with Senator Palwasha Khan during a Senate panel meeting on Friday. Pal­washa, who is also a PPP leader, and the federal minister had traded sharp remarks on Friday over the construction of a road allegedly benefiting a private housing society during a meeting of the Senate Stan­ding Committee on Com­mu­ni­cations. View this post on Instagram In a post on the social media platform X late on Friday night, Rehman said, “What happened today in a Senate standing committee can neither become normalised nor considered acceptable. No federal minister should speak the way Aleem Khan did with Senator Palwasha in a communications committee meeting.” Rehman further said that it was Senator Palwasha’s “absolute responsibility and right to ask questions” and to hold the government accountable. “He must apologise. I am not even going to say that it is necessary because she is a woman. She is due that basic right of respect as an honourable member of Parliament from a federal minister,” she said. The confrontation between the minister and Senator Palwasha had begun when the latter questioned whether public funds had been used to build a road primarily serving a private housing scheme in Lahore. Responding angrily, the minister warned that personal attacks would be met in kind. “If you make personal attacks, you will face the same behaviour,” he said, adding that while the government was willing to clarify its position, it would not lower itself to the level he felt the senator had adopted. However, she maintained it was her right as a parliamentarian to question the use of taxpayers’ money and reiterated that she had merely sought clarification on whether the road had been constructed to benefit a private housing society. The exchange escalated further when the minister accused committee members of being “blackmailers and dishonest”, prom­pting strong objections. Senator Pal­wa­sha said she had been humiliated by the minister’s remarks and announced she would raise the matter with her party’s top leadership. Following the intervention of the committee chairman, Senator Pervaiz Rashid, the minister tendered an apology. But Senator Palwasha declined to accept it. Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House following the argument, she said that if “a road funded by the public is being built, then why can we not question whether someone is trying to seek benefits for his private business?” Expressing disappointment at the minister‘s behaviour, she said it was the “collective demeanour of Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet”.",

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the verdict inside Kot Lakhpat Jail after concluding the trial of the accused in FIR No 852/2023, which relates to an attack on the entrance gate of the GOR-I Club Chowk. The case had been registered by the Race Course police, who later submitted a challan against 25 accused persons, including PTI leaders and party workers. In the same case, the court also handed down 10-year imprisonment sentences to PTI workers Qasim Elahi, Muhammad Shehbaz, Mushtaq and Abdullah. However, the judge acquitted 12 other accused due to a lack of sufficient evidence against them. This marks the fifth case in Lahore in which Mr Qureshi has been acquitted, while Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mehmoodur Rashid have been convicted. The majority of those convicted were charged with participating in the attack while armed with clubs, pelting stones and chanting slogans. Previously, verdicts have alre­ady been announced in several other cases arising from the May 9 unrest, including trials related to the attack on Shadman police station, violence at Sherpao Bridge, the burning of police vehicles near Rahat Bakery, and the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squ­ad vehicle near Jinnah House. Barrister Taimur Malik, counsel for Shah Mahmood Qureshi, stated that despite the acquittal, the PTI vice chairman would not be released from Kot Lakhpat Jail as his bail pleas in three other cases are still pending. He expressed hope that bail in those cases would be granted sooner rather than later, instead of Mr Qureshi having to wait for the completion of the trials. “We have now obtained his bail or acquittals in around 50 cases across Punjab and Islamabad over the last three years,” the counsel added. The May 9 riots erupted following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan by the National Accountability Bureau from the premises of the Islamabad High Court. Subsequently, PTI leaders and workers launched protests across the country, during which military installations and public property were attacked. Joint letter Separately, five senior PTI leaders currently incarcerated at Kot Lakhpat jail issued a joint letter through their lawyer, stating that dialogue is the only viable path to steer the country out of its ongoing crises. The letter, signed by Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed, stated that the party’s central leadership firmly believes that dialogue at all levels is the sole workable solution to the prevailing situation. The incarcerated leaders said that Pakistan has been grappling with severe political, economic and social crises for the past three years and eight months, and that it is the responsibility of every patriot to think in the national interest and pursue objectives through peaceful and constitutional means. According to the PTI leaders, negotiations alone can help pull the country out of the current turmoil. The letter further stated that the PTI founder has asked the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan to engage in consultations with national political parties in order to chart a way forward. It added that broad-based consultation opens the door to meaningful dialogue. The imprisoned leaders also expressed hope that Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas would provide guidance to the nation during this critical period.

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday issued a demarche to the Afghan Taliban over its failure to rein in terrorist organisations operating from its soil after a deadly attack on a military camp in North Waziristan earlier today. Four security forces personnel were martyred when an attempt by terrorists to attack a security forces camp was foiled in the area of Boya in North Waziristan district. In a statement, the FO said that Pakistan condemned the attack in the strongest possible terms and identified the attackers as members of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, a group under the TTP umbrella. “To convey our strong demarche, the Afghan deputy head of mission was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” the statement read. “The ministry conveyed Pakistan’s grave concern over the continued support and facilitation provided by the Afghan Taliban regime to the FAK/TTP, enabling them to carry out terrorist attacks against [the] Pakistan Military and the civilian population along the Pak-Afghan border and in adjoining areas,” it added. The FO emphasised that the permissive environment enjoyed by the Fitna-al-Khawarij in Afghanistan contradicts Kabul’s commitments to Pakistan and the international community. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “Pakistan has demanded a full investigation and decisive action against the perpetrators and facilitators of the terrorist attacks launched against Pakistan from Afghan soil,” the statement said. Islamabad also asked Kabul to take “immediate, concrete and verifiable measures against all terror groups operating from its territory, including their leadership and deny the continued use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan”. The FO warned the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan “reserves the right to defend its sovereignty and protect its citizens, and will take all necessary measures to respond to terrorism originating from Afghan soil”. Pak-Afghan relations Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the TTP remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes. Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process. The Foreign Office also said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups. On December 1, Saudi Arabia quietly facilitated a round of direct talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan aimed at easing tensions over cross-border terrorism, but the discussions wrapped up without any breakthrough. A recent United Nations Security Council report rejected the Taliban’s claim that terrorist groups are not using Afghan territory for cross-border violence, calling the assertion “not credible” and warning that neighbouring states increasingly view Afghanistan as a source of regional insecurity. The assessment, contained in the sixteenth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, was submitted to the UN Security Council, as international concern grows over Afghanistan’s security landscape more than four years after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. “The de facto authorities continue to deny that any terrorist groups have a footprint in or operate from its territory. That claim is not credible,” the report said.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A visible split among lawyers in the federal capital on Friday resulted in only a partial strike, as a small group of lawyers observed the call issued by the Islamabad District Bar Association (DBA) to protest the removal of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri , while the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) played down the verdict that led to his ouster. Justice Jahangiri was removed from office thro­ugh a short order passed by an Islamabad High Court (IHC) division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan. The bench ruled that his elevation to the high court was “without lawful authority” and that he had “ceased to hold” the office with immediate effect. The short order was announced at around 3:30pm. However, sources said Justice Jahangiri had left his chamber for his residence approximately half an hour earlier, adding that he may have been informed of the decision before its formal announ­cement. An official of his court told Dawn that the judge personally met and embraced each staff member before leaving, telling them: “We will meet again if God so wills.” Following the verdict, DBA President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar announced a strike to protest the decision. The IHCBA, however, chose not to issue any such call. IHCBA Secretary Chaudhry Manzoor Jajja told Dawn that the verdict was “like one of the many decisions the IHC passes every day” and said there was no justification for a strike. He added that IHC judges — including Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Jahangiri himself — had previously opposed strikes over what he described as peripheral issues. As a result of this division within the legal fraternity, the strike had only a limited impact. While routine attendance was reported at the Supreme Court, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and the Islamabad High Court, only a small number of lawyers boycotted proceedings at the sessions courts. A senior sessions court official estimated that fewer than 10 per cent of lawyers abstained from hearings in solidarity with the ousted judge. Meanwhile, the IHC administration issued a duty roster for the coming week that did not include Justice Jahangiri’s name. Hearings in cases fixed before his bench were cancelled, and the administration is expected to redistribute his caseload among other available judges. Even before the formal de-notification, Justice Jahangiri’s name was removed from the IHC website. Late on Thursday night, the Presidency confirmed that President Asif Ali Zardari had approved the de-notification of Justice Jahangiri on the advice of the prime minister, in compliance with the IHC order. The move followed a direction in the short written order instructing the law ministry to de-notify him. The ministry forwarded a summary through the Prime Minister’s Office, which was subsequently approved by the president. The controversy originated from a letter that surfaced on social media last year, purportedly issued by the University of Karachi (KU). During the proceedings, KU Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui submitted records stating that the university syndicate had cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, alleging that it had been obtained through “unfair means”. He claimed the judge had been found cheating and creating a disturbance in an examination hall in 1988 and was debarred until 1992, but had allegedly appeared in an examination in 1989 under a changed name. Justice Jahangiri’s counsel, Advocate Muhammad Akram Sheikh, argued that a sitting judge could only be removed through the procedure prescribed under Article 209 of the Constitution, which requires proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). However, amicus curiae Barrister Zafarullah Khan contended that where a judge’s eligibility or qualification was in question, the SJC process was not applicable, citing past judicial precedents. The bench observed that the qualification to hold the office of a high court judge was personal to the individual and independent of judicial performance. It noted that sufficient opportunity had been provided to Justice Jahangiri to submit his reply and credentials, but he failed to do so. Published in Dawn, December 20th, 2025",
