      "title_orig": "What prompted US to abort Iran strikes?",
      "summary_orig": "• US, Israel, Gulf allies all were underprepared for retaliation • Regime remained resilient as security forces stay loyal • Backchannel pledged to ‘stop the killing’ offered exit ramp WASHINGTON: The crisis in Iran, driven by economic collapse, soaring inflation and deep public anger, has underscored both the limits of external military intervention and the resilience of Tehran’s clerical regime, analysts and former officials said. US President Donald Trump publicly encouraged Iranian protesters, warning Tehran that it would face consequences if it “violently kills peaceful protesters”. But behind the scenes, Washington came close to — and then stepped back from — military action, exposing the operational, political and strategic constraints shaping US policy. According to a detailed Axios investigation , senior military, political and diplomatic officials across Washington and the Middle East believed US strikes on Iran were imminent. Preparations were real, officials stressed. US troops began evacuating from Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar and from the Navy’s Fifth Fleet base in Bahrain, while Iran closed its airspace. “It wasn’t fake or a ruse,” one US official told Axios . Yet by that afternoon, the moment passed. “It was really close,” another official said. “The military was in a position to do something really fast,but the order didn’t come.” A central factor for the stand-down was force posture. Axios reported that since the last clash with Iran in June, many US military assets had been redeployed to the Caribbean and East Asia. “The theatre was not ready,” one source said bluntly. Another added: “We sort of missed the window.” Limits of military leverage The lack of readiness shaped not only strike options but also contingency planning for Iranian retaliation, which US officials warned could endanger American forces and allies across the region. Regional leaders reinforced those concerns. In a call with Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel was not prepared to defend itself against Iran’s likely missile and drone retaliation. He also believed the US plan “was not strong enough and wouldn’t be effective”, according to one of his advisers. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman similarly expressed deep concern about regional destabilisation. A diplomatic backchannel also provided an exit ramp. Axios reported that Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi sent messages to Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, committing to halt planned executions of detained protesters and “stop the killing”. Trump later acknowledged the messages had an impact, though a White House official insisted they were “not the only reason”. For now, US officials say military action remains “on the table.” However, the near-miss suggests Washington’s restraint reflected not just caution or diplomacy, but the hard limits of military leverage over Iran’s internal struggle and the high costs of getting it wrong. Even if strikes had been launched, analysts say they would have done little to protect protesters on the ground. Andrew P. Miller said foreign military intervention is unlikely to create a stable democracy, especially one that benefits the intervening power. Any action would probably have been restricted to “a single or brief set of strikes”, avoiding ground troops yet risking Iranian retaliation and escalation, Miller added. Sanam Vakil, of Chatham House, said Trump’s approach relied more on coercive signalling than intervention. The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, she said, was designed to pressure Iran’s leadership rather than shield civilians. “His references to wanting an agreement and to ‘making Iran great again’ are transactional signals aimed at the leadership rather than Iranian society,” Vakil said. “The strategy is less about engineering internal change in Iran than about forcing its leadership to confront the limits of resistance.” Regime resilience Vali Nasr, a prominent Iranian-American scholar in Washington, emphasised the durability of Iran’s security apparatus. For protests to seriously threaten the regime, he said, parts of the state — especially the security forces — would need to defect. “There is no sign of any defections … or that it has in any way fractured,” Nasr said. “I am not certain the balance of forces necessarily lies with the protesters.” Sustained unrest over a longer period would be required to alter that balance, he added, highlighting the gap between public anger and the state’s capacity to withstand it. Scholars also note that the protests remain decentralised and leaderless. While symbolic support exists for former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi or, less frequently, MEK leader Maryam Rajavi, most Iranians appear focused on internal change rather than exiled leadership. Most experts agree there is little appetite inside Iran for either the restoration of the monarchy or the return of the MEK. Published in Dawn, January 20th, 2026",

      "summary_en": "• US, Israel, Gulf allies all were underprepared for retaliation • Regime remained resilient as security forces stay loyal • Backchannel pledged to ‘stop the killing’ offered exit ramp WASHINGTON: The crisis in Iran, driven by economic collapse, soaring inflation and deep public anger, has underscored both the limits of external military intervention and the resilience of Tehran’s clerical regime, analysts and former officials said. US President Donald Trump publicly encouraged Iranian protesters, warning Tehran that it would face consequences if it “violently kills peaceful protesters”. But behind the scenes, Washington came close to — and then stepped back from — military action, exposing the operational, political and strategic constraints shaping US policy. According to a detailed Axios investigation , senior military, political and diplomatic officials across Washington and the Middle East believed US strikes on Iran were imminent. Preparations were real, officials stressed. US troops began evacuating from Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar and from the Navy’s Fifth Fleet base in Bahrain, while Iran closed its airspace. “It wasn’t fake or a ruse,” one US official told Axios . Yet by that afternoon, the moment passed. “It was really close,” another official said. “The military was in a position to do something really fast,but the order didn’t come.” A central factor for the stand-down was force posture. Axios reported that since the last clash with Iran in June, many US military assets had been redeployed to the Caribbean and East Asia. “The theatre was not ready,” one source said bluntly. Another added: “We sort of missed the window.” Limits of military leverage The lack of readiness shaped not only strike options but also contingency planning for Iranian retaliation, which US officials warned could endanger American forces and allies across the region. Regional leaders reinforced those concerns. In a call with Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel was not prepared to defend itself against Iran’s likely missile and drone retaliation. He also believed the US plan “was not strong enough and wouldn’t be effective”, according to one of his advisers. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman similarly expressed deep concern about regional destabilisation. A diplomatic backchannel also provided an exit ramp. Axios reported that Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi sent messages to Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, committing to halt planned executions of detained protesters and “stop the killing”. Trump later acknowledged the messages had an impact, though a White House official insisted they were “not the only reason”.

      "summary_orig": "• Davos disinvites FM Araghchi over ‘tragic’ crackdown • UN condemns use of executions as ‘a tool of state intimidation’ TEHRAN: Internet access in Iran will “gradually” return to normal this week, a senior official said on Monday, as the government faces international fallout from an 11-day communications blackout imposed during deadly anti-government protests. The announcement came the same day organisers of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, confirmed the Iranian foreign minister would not attend the summit because it would not be “right” following the recent crackdown. Simultaneously, the United Nations issued a report condemning Tehran for using executions as a “tool of state intimidation”. “The internet will gradually return to normal operations this week,” Hossein Afshin, Iran’s vice president for science, technology and the knowledge economy, said on Monday on state television. The government imposed a nationwide communications blackout earlier this month amid huge demonstrations triggered by anger over economic hardship. Limited internet access briefly returned on Sunday for some foreign websites such as Google, but opening links from search results remained impossible as of Monday. The shutdown began on Jan 8. Norway-based Iran Human Rights said it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces, confirming cases through sources within the Islamic Republic’s health and medical system, witnesses and independent sources. The NGO warned the true toll is likely far higher. The media cannot independently confirm the figure, and Iranian officials have not provided an exact death toll. ‘Not right’ Iran’s foreign minister will not be attending the Davos su­­mmit in Switzerland this we­­ek, the organisers said, stressing it would not be “right” after the recent deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran. Abbas Araghchi had been scheduled to speak on Tuesday during the annual gathering of the global elite at the upscale Swiss ski resort town. But activists have been calling on the World Economic Forum organisers to disinvite him amid what rights groups have called a “massacre” in his country. “The Iranian Foreign Minister will not be attending Davos,” the World Economic Forum said on X. “Although he was invited last fall, the tragic loss of lives of civilians in Iran over the past few weeks means that it is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” it added. ‘Intimidation tool’ Iran appears to be using executions “as a tool of state intimidation”, the United Nations said on Monday, as it denounced a jump in capital punishment globally in 2025. The Islamic republic reportedly executed 1,500 people last year, UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. “The scale and pace of executions suggest a systematic use of capital punishment as a tool of state intimidation, with disproportionate impact on ethnic minorities and migrants,” he warned. The spike in executions in Iran — which according to rights groups is the world’s most prolific executioner after China — had contributed to “an alarming increase” in the use of capital punishment worldwide last year, Turk said. While the overall global trend continues to move towards universal abolition of the death penalty, Iran and a handful of other states such as Saudi Arabia and the United States saw executions surge. “Many of those executions were “for offences not meeting the ‘most serious crimes’ threshold required under international law,” Turk said, also criticising “the continued execution of people convicted of crimes committed as children, as well as persistent secrecy around executions”.

      "summary_orig": "An explosion tore through a Chinese-run restaurant in a hotel in a heavily guarded part of Afghanistan’s capital on Monday, killing a Chinese national and six Afghans and injuring several others, including a child, officials said. The restaurant was in the commercial Shahr-i-Naw neighbourhood of Kabul that includes office buildings, shopping complexes and embassies, police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said. The district is considered one of the safest in the city. The Chinese noodle restaurant was jointly run by a Chinese Muslim, Abdul Majid, his wife, and an Afghan partner, Abdul Jabbar Mahmood, and served the Chinese Muslim community, Zadran said. One Chinese national, identified as Ayub, and six Afghans were killed in the blast, which occurred near the kitchen, while several others were injured, Zadran added. Videos shared on social media showed debris scattered on the street outside and smoke spewing from a large hole torn into the front of the restaurant building. “So far, we have received 20 people at our hospital,” Dejan Panic, humanitarian group EMERGENCYs Country Director in Afghanistan, said in a statement. “Among the wounded are four women and a child … Unfortunately, seven people were already dead on arrival.” There was no immediate word on the cause of the explosion. Authorities said they were investigating. In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the bombing and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The president conveyed sincere sympathy with the injured and their families and prayed for their early recovery,” the statement read. “He paid tribute to the spirit of Chinese citizens who have continued to work for the development of Afghanistan despite rising insecurity and serious risks to their lives.” According to the statement, the president noted the Afghan Taliban regime’s failure to honour commitments made under the Doha Agreement, particularly the obligation to prevent the use of Afghan soil for acts of terrorism. “He recalled that Pakistan has repeatedly stressed that no terrorist groups should be allowed safe havens in Afghanistan and that regional peace and security must be upheld,” the statement said. The statement noted that other countries neighbouring Afghanistan, including Tajikistan, were recently affected by terrorists operating from Afghan soil. “The president further stated that the failure to establish a broad-based and inclusive government by the Taliban is contrary to the Doha Agreement,” the statement added. “He emphasised that full implementation of the agreement, in letter and spirit, along with concrete steps to end cross-border terrorism, remains essential.” The Taliban took control of war-torn Afghanistan in 2021 and said it would restore security, but bomb attacks have continued, many of them claimed by the local arm of the militant Islamic State group.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said on Saturday that the party’s future participation in meetings of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was conditional upon whether consultations would be allowed with incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. Neither Barrister Gohar nor Barrister Syed Ali Zafar — who represent PTI in JCP meetings — have attended recent sessions of the council during which, in separate meetings last week, the commission had recommended the confirmation of 31 additional judges as permanent judges. JCP is the key judicial body responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary Speaking to the media at the Supreme Court on Saturday, Gohar said, “The party will take a final decision whether or not to attend future meetings of the JCP after having consultation with the PTI founder”. When asked why PTI skipped meetings of the commission, Barrister Gohar explained that the status of the commission had changed after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the establishment of the new courts, such as the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). He said that the party had serious reservations about the 26th Constitutional Amendment as well, which was enacted into law in 2024. However, Gohar maintained that despite that, PTI “still wanted to present the party’s point of view and give input in the selection of judges for the superior judiciary, but then our meetings with the PTI founder were severed”. He maintained that due to no contact with Imran, the party is unable to consult him. “Just as we boycotted participation from other committees, we also decided to stay away from the meetings of the JCP,” he explained. “We will make a proper decision in this regard after meeting with Khan sahib ,” he added. Meetings with the PTI founder have been suspended till February 8, Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in December last year. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. ‘NA opposition leader not appointed at behest of Nawaz’ On the matter of the appointment of Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Gohar dismissed reports that the appointment was made at the behest of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif. On January 16, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Achakzai was appointed leader of the opposition in the NA. Gohar held that it was at the discretion of the speaker of the National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, to issue the notification. “I understand that it was done by the speaker National Assembly for which we were grateful,” he said. Responding to a question regarding the appointment of the opposition leader in the Senate, Gohar said, “We have been told that the notification of the opposition leader in the Senate will also be done in a few days”. He detailed that the PTI had filed nomination papers before the Senate Secretariat, hoping that the process would be completed today. “Since the PTI founder has already nominated leaders of the opposition in both the Houses, it will be better if they are appointed soon,” he said. In October 2025, PTI had nominated Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas as its candidates for the slots of leader of the opposition in the National Assem­bly and Senate, respectively.",

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said on Saturday that the party’s future participation in meetings of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was conditional upon whether consultations would be allowed with incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. Neither Barrister Gohar nor Barrister Syed Ali Zafar — who represent PTI in JCP meetings — have attended recent sessions of the council during which, in separate meetings last week, the commission had recommended the confirmation of 31 additional judges as permanent judges. JCP is the key judicial body responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary Speaking to the media at the Supreme Court on Saturday, Gohar said, “The party will take a final decision whether or not to attend future meetings of the JCP after having consultation with the PTI founder”. When asked why PTI skipped meetings of the commission, Barrister Gohar explained that the status of the commission had changed after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the establishment of the new courts, such as the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). He said that the party had serious reservations about the 26th Constitutional Amendment as well, which was enacted into law in 2024. However, Gohar maintained that despite that, PTI “still wanted to present the party’s point of view and give input in the selection of judges for the superior judiciary, but then our meetings with the PTI founder were severed”. He maintained that due to no contact with Imran, the party is unable to consult him. “Just as we boycotted participation from other committees, we also decided to stay away from the meetings of the JCP,” he explained. “We will make a proper decision in this regard after meeting with Khan sahib ,” he added. Meetings with the PTI founder have been suspended till February 8, Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in December last year. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. ‘NA opposition leader not appointed at behest of Nawaz’ On the matter of the appointment of Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Gohar dismissed reports that the appointment was made at the behest of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.

      "title_orig": "We want a ‘new Pakistan’ which is democratic: Achakzai addresses lawyers in Karachi",
      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Monday called for a “new Pakistan”, which is democratic, where there is rule of law, and where there is no cruelty. Achakzai — who is on a four-day visit to Sindh along with a delegation of opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) to mobilise the masses for a nationwide strike and protest rallies scheduled for February 8 — expressed these views while addressing lawyers at the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) in Karachi. Apart from him, other TTAP leaders, including Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and PTI’s Asad Qaiser, also spoke at the seminar titled “Protecting the Basic Structure of the Constitution of Pakistan”. “Let’s make Pakistan a democratic country, a country where people have the power, and there is rule of law and the Constitution,” said Achakzai, adding that democracy had not been allowed to flourish in the country. “The country is ailing like a cancer patient.” “Let’s comply with the social contract with the people. Injustice breeds disharmony among people. We want the formation of a new Pakistan, where there is no cruelty.” He also said, “We are a group of decent people,” and that the line of respect should not be crossed in politics. Moreover, he stressed that small provinces had also rendered sacrifices in the freedom movement for Pakistan. “We are not here to fight people […] Countries are not run at gunpoint,” Achakzai further stated, adding that people of all races and languages should be treated equally. “Our country is facing difficulties because of rogue and arbitrary behaviours. [But] we don’t want a civil war,” he said. The opposition leader also mentioned that there was no accountability for the expenditure of funds received through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan. Speaking about the inferno at Karachi’s Gul Plaza shopping mall, he asked why the building did not have emergency exits. “The matter should be investigated and those responsible should be punished.” Achakzai also asserted that the PTI founder had won the 2024 general election and “blocking his way [to Parliament] is constitutionally and religiously wrong”. Saying that the “spirit of freedom his being crushed among the youth”, he urged people to stand up “against cruelty”. Moreover, he said the TTAP protesters would not resort to violence on February 8 and urged the people of Sindh to take to the streets. “We have come out to save the country, come join us,” he said, concluding his speech. Before him, TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas also addressed the seminar, saying that presently, the Constitution in the country was “controversial”. He criticised the incumbent government, maintaining that people were losing confidence in the rulers, and the public was facing oppression. “The entire system is being employed for unlawful acts,” he further alleged. The senator also mentioned Form 47 — an allusion to the alleged rigging in the 2024 general elections — saying that “some people had been given a fake mandate”. He further lamented the “weakening of the three pillars of the country”. While he did not specify the “three pillars”, this ostensibly was a reference to the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. Abbas said February 8 was a very important day, “when we will show the government the power of the people”. He also highlighted the importance of Pakistan’s location and called it the “heart of Asia”. The senator claimed that “global powers have always tried to keep [Pakistan] under their control”. PTI leader Asad Qaiser said, “The way this country is being run, that makes progress impossible.” He also alleged that presently, there was government interference in lawyers’ bodies, claiming that efforts were being made to “weaken the voice of lawyers”. Qaiser regretted that the “executive has become an authority over the judiciary”, adding that the trust of people in the judiciary was eroding. “What option are people left with then?” he questioned. The PTI leader also lamented the “unfair distribution of resources” in the country, adding that the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan was “chaotic”. He further said the 1973 Constitution had been discarded, adding that “if you want to commit a robbery, why even let [people] vote?” Qaiser said the TTAP would need everyone’s support for the February 8 protest, the purpose of which was to “restore the judiciary and establish the Constitution’s supremacy”.",

      "title_orig": "Gul Plaza, SBCA, and the human cost of bad governance",
      "summary_orig": "The devastating fire at Gul Plaza, a landmark shopping centre on Karachi’s MA Jinnah Road, is not merely an accident or an unfortunate lapse in safety compliance. It is a grim reminder that poor governance kills. As rescue operations continue and the death toll rises in the aftermath, what is already evident is that this tragedy was foreseeable, preventable, and rooted in institutional failure rather than fate. Gul Plaza was an old, densely packed commercial building with hundreds of shops spread across its basement and upper floors, with inadequate emergency exits and fire safety systems. Despite its prominence and heavy daily footfall, reports indicate that the building lacked critical emergency exits and fire-venting infrastructure — features that should have been enforced long ago by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). Ensuring compliance with these standards is not optional; it is the statutory responsibility of the authority charged with public safety. The question is not whether a short circuit or another trigger caused the fire; it is why a structure with known safety deficiencies was allowed to operate for decades. The answer lies in institutional decay and bad governance. Systemic rot To be fair to individual officers, the SBCA itself has been rendered structurally weak. Over the last several years, the post of director-general (DG) appears to have been treated as a portable office rather than a strategic leadership position. Multiple DGs have been rotated and replaced in rapid succession, without explanation and with tenures too short to allow meaningful enforcement. When leadership is unstable, accountability collapses. When enforcement depends on personal courage rather than institutional backing, violations become routine. This pattern reflects a deeper and more troubling reality: appointments and transfers at the SBCA appear to be driven less by considerations of competence, integrity, and public safety and more by pliability to vested interests. Officials who are perceived to attempt to enforce rules, resist illegal conversions, or block unsafe constructions are often seen to be sidelined; those who accommodate vested interests are seen to be rewarded. This is not governance; it is the deliberate hollowing out of regulatory institutions. In earlier writings, I have argued that bad governance promotes corruption and corruption can kill as surely as bombs and militancy. Corruption is not just about bribery; it is about the systematic erosion of norms and safeguards that protect citizens. When building safety codes are ignored with impunity, when regulators are neutralised by political interference, and when accountability is treated as an inconvenience, the results can be catastrophic. In that sense, corruption kills not only through direct theft but by tearing the safety net that holds society together. This form of institutional sabotage is far more insidious than isolated corruption because it becomes normalised. Over time, citizens come to expect that regulations exist only on paper, that enforcement is negotiable, and that compliance is secondary to convenience. Buildings become death traps not because the rules are unclear, but because enforcement has been deliberately neutralised. The rot runs deep The problem is not confined to Karachi. In medium-sized cities such as Hyderabad and Sukkur, and in smaller towns like Nawabshah, Mirpurkhas, and Dadu, master plans are routinely seen to be ignored, residential areas reportedly converted into commercial hubs, and low-rise plots somehow become multi-storey buildings in violation of regulations. Whenever a conscientious officer is seen to enforce planning laws or court-approved master plans, it seemingly results in their swift transfer. This brings us to the question of accountability. Policymakers who sanction frequent, unexplained transfers of regulatory heads must be held responsible for the consequences of their decisions. When leadership instability becomes systemic, it is no longer an administrative matter; it is a policy choice. And when that choice leads to loss of life, accountability cannot stop at lower-level officials or building owners. In countries that take governance seriously, such failures trigger criminal inquiries reaching the highest levels of decision-making. In Pakistan, prime ministers have been removed for alleged legal violations. Why, then, is it unthinkable to hold chief secretaries, ministers, or heads of regulatory bodies meaningfully accountable when repeated governance failures result in deaths? Courts have taken suo motu notice of far less consequential matters. Will they now intervene where human lives have been lost? The case for accountability Governance is a trust delegated by voters and taxpayers. In an age defined by technology, global competition, and data-driven decision-making, citizens have every right to demand competence, integrity, and continuity in public institutions. Development projects may still be launched and ribbon-cuttings may continue, but at what cost? Putting unqualified or seemingly compromised individuals in charge of complex regulatory systems is like entrusting a multi-billion-rupee project to someone chosen for obedience rather than expertise. Something may be built, but it will not be safe, sustainable, or worthy of public trust. The fire at Gul Plaza should mark a turning point. Bad governance is not a soft concept — it is a profound threat to life and dignity. Institutional decay weakens national resilience just as surely as any external threat. In another previous newspaper article, I had argued that those who destroy institutions from within, who prioritise pliability over professionalism, and who treat regulatory enforcement as negotiable are not merely negligent; they are intentionally undermining the foundations of the state . If this tragedy does not prompt serious accountability and structural reform, it will not be the last. And the next fire, collapse, or disaster will again be described as an accident — until we finally accept that bad governance at the highest policymaking levels is the real culprit.

It is a grim reminder that poor governance kills.

Gul Plaza was an old, densely packed commercial building with hundreds of shops spread across its basement and upper floors, with inadequate emergency exits and fire safety systems. Despite its prominence and heavy daily footfall, reports indicate that the building lacked critical emergency exits and fire-venting infrastructure — features that should have been enforced long ago by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). Ensuring compliance with these standards is not optional; it is the statutory responsibility of the authority charged with public safety. The question is not whether a short circuit or another trigger caused the fire; it is why a structure with known safety deficiencies was allowed to operate for decades.

Corruption is not just about bribery; it is about the systematic erosion of norms and safeguards that protect citizens.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump’s government has asked countries to pay $1 billion for a permanent spot on his “ Board of Peace ” aimed at resolving conflicts, according to US media reports. The White House has asked various world leaders to sit on the board, chaired by Trump himself, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hungarian Premier Viktor Orban and Canada’s Mark Carney. Member countries — represented on the board by their head of state — would be allowed to join for three years, or longer if they contributed more than $1 billion within the first year, according to Bloomberg , which first reported the sum. “Each member state shall serve a term of no more than three years from this charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the chairman,” stated the board’s draft charter obtained by Bloomberg and other media. “The three-year membership term shall not apply to member states that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.” The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but its charter, widely cited by US media, does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory. The White House said there would be a main board, a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern the war-wracked territory, and a second “executive board” that appears designed to have a more advisory role. “The Board of Peace is an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” the charter says. ‘Failed institutions’ The document was sent to dozens of world leaders who were invited to join the board, The Times of Israel reported. It appears to take a swipe at international institutions such as the United Nations, saying that the board should have “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”. Trump has regularly criticised the United Nations and announced this month that his country will withdraw from 66 global organisations and treaties — roughly half affiliated with the UN. Membership of the board would be “limited to states invited to participate by the chairman”, according to the full draft charter published by the Times of Israel . Trump would have the power to remove member states from the board, subject to a veto by two-thirds of members, and choose his replacement should he leave his role as chairman. The “Board of Peace” began to take shape on Saturday as the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, Argentina and Canada were asked to join . Trump also named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair and senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff as members. Israel has objected to the line-up of a “Gaza executive board” to operate under the body, which includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi. Putin invited to join ‘Board of Peace’: Kremlin Separately, Russia said it was seeking to “clarify all the nuances” of the offer with Washington, without adding if the Kremlin chief was inclined to join. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told AFP in an interview that Putin “also received an invitation to join this Board of Peace”. Moscow for years tried to balance relations with all major players in the Middle East — including Israel and the Palestinians. But since the conflict in Gaza and Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Putin has moved away from Israel, boosting ties with its foes like Iran. Moscow has also sought closer relationships with the Gulf states amid growing Western isolation. The White House has reached out to various figures around the world, including Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , to sit on the so-called “Board of Peace”, chaired by the US president himself. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump talk during a bilateral meeting at the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, June 28, 2019. — Reuters/File Putin has previously praised Trump’s efforts to resolve conflicts. “He’s really doing a lot to resolve these complex crises, which have lasted for years, even decades,” Putin said last October. Referring to the situation in the Middle East, Putin said: “If we succeed in achieving everything Donald has strived for, it will be a historic event.” The assault on Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza have strained Moscow’s traditionally good relations with Israel, home to a large Russian-born community. The Kremlin has repeatedly criticised Israel’s response to the October 7 attacks and called for restraint. “The Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian catastrophe in the full sense of the word,” Putin was quoted as saying by the news agency RIA Novosti at a meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas last May. “Russia, as a friend of the Palestinian people, is trying to provide regular assistance,” the Russian president added.",

Member countries — represented on the board by their head of state — would be allowed to join for three years, or longer if they contributed more than $1 billion within the first year, according to Bloomberg , which first reported the sum. “Each member state shall serve a term of no more than three years from this charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the chairman,” stated the board’s draft charter obtained by Bloomberg and other media. “The three-year membership term shall not apply to member states that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.” The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but its charter, widely cited by US media, does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory. The White House said there would be a main board, a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern the war-wracked territory, and a second “executive board” that appears designed to have a more advisory role. “The Board of Peace is an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” the charter says. ‘Failed institutions’ The document was sent to dozens of world leaders who were invited to join the board, The Times of Israel reported. It appears to take a swipe at international institutions such as the United Nations, saying that the board should have “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”. Trump has regularly criticised the United Nations and announced this month that his country will withdraw from 66 global organisations and treaties — roughly half affiliated with the UN. Membership of the board would be “limited to states invited to participate by the chairman”, according to the full draft charter published by the Times of Israel . Trump would have the power to remove member states from the board, subject to a veto by two-thirds of members, and choose his replacement should he leave his role as chairman. The “Board of Peace” began to take shape on Saturday as the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, Argentina and Canada were asked to join . Trump also named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair and senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff as members. Israel has objected to the line-up of a “Gaza executive board” to operate under the body, which includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi. Putin invited to join ‘Board of Peace’: Kremlin Separately, Russia said it was seeking to “clarify all the nuances” of the offer with Washington, without adding if the Kremlin chief was inclined to join. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told AFP in an interview that Putin “also received an invitation to join this Board of Peace”. Moscow for years tried to balance relations with all major players in the Middle East — including Israel and the Palestinians. But since the conflict in Gaza and Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Putin has moved away from Israel, boosting ties with its foes like Iran. Moscow has also sought closer relationships with the Gulf states amid growing Western isolation. The White House has reached out to various figures around the world, including Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , to sit on the so-called “Board of Peace”, chaired by the US president himself. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump talk during a bilateral meeting at the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, June 28, 2019. — Reuters/File Putin has previously praised Trump’s efforts to resolve conflicts. “He’s really doing a lot to resolve these complex crises, which have lasted for years, even decades,” Putin said last October. Referring to the situation in the Middle East, Putin said: “If we succeed in achieving everything Donald has strived for, it will be a historic event.” The assault on Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza have strained Moscow’s traditionally good relations with Israel, home to a large Russian-born community. The Kremlin has repeatedly criticised Israel’s response to the October 7 attacks and called for restraint. “The Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian catastrophe in the full sense of the word,” Putin was quoted as saying by the news agency RIA Novosti at a meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas last May. “Russia, as a friend of the Palestinian people, is trying to provide regular assistance,” the Russian president added.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday granted lawyer and activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, one-day protective bail in relation to their arrest warrants in a case linked to controversial social media posts. The case has been registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. On January 17, Mazari and Chattha challenged their arrest orders in the IHC, arguing that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production. Justice Azam Khan of the IHC took up the petition today and stayed the arrest of Mazari and Chattha until tomorrow. Lawyer Kamran Murtaza, who represented the couple, informed the court that their bail had twice been cancelled. “Now an order has been issued to arrest them,” he said. He maintained that “if there were any misdoings on his client’s part, the judge should demonstrate patience”. “The judge is holding hearings every 15 minutes,” he said.“Imaan is a woman, and she has been sick,” he added. Earlier in the day, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka had directed authorities to obtain a search warrant for Mazari and Chattha. As the hearing at the sessions court resumed after two sittings, the prosecutor informed the session court that the two accused now have protective bail in the IHC and were ordered to appear before the court tomorrow. The judge adjourned the proceedings until tomorrow. Judge Majoka directed that the accused should be presented in the sessions court “within one hour of the appearance at IHC”. The judge also refused to entertain a request from the assistant counsel for adjournment till the day after tomorrow, stating that the counsel had taken “undue advantage” and no concession would be provided. Judge Majoka expresses displeasure During the hearing earlier today, judge Majoka expressed displeasure over why the accused had not yet been arrested. He directed the NCCIA officials to obtain a search warrant for the accused’s residence from a magistrate and ordered them to present Mazari and Chattha in court by 11am. When the hearing resumed, National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials, police officials, and special prosecutors appeared before the court. The court was informed that the arrest had not yet been made. NCCIA officials and police sought further time to submit a report regarding the arrest. Judge Majoka then adjourned the hearing till 2pm, warning that “whoever’s report is unsatisfactory, action will be taken against them”. On Saturday, the court reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Mazari and Chattha for their repeated absences from trial proceedings. In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Judge Majoka noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the NCCIA. During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest. At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad high court. The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused. Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants. The case The case stems from a complaint filed on August 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.",

The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday granted lawyer and activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, one-day protective bail in relation to their arrest warrants in a case linked to controversial social media posts. The case has been registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. On January 17, Mazari and Chattha challenged their arrest orders in the IHC, arguing that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production. Justice Azam Khan of the IHC took up the petition today and stayed the arrest of Mazari and Chattha until tomorrow. Lawyer Kamran Murtaza, who represented the couple, informed the court that their bail had twice been cancelled. “Now an order has been issued to arrest them,” he said. He maintained that “if there were any misdoings on his client’s part, the judge should demonstrate patience”. “The judge is holding hearings every 15 minutes,” he said.“Imaan is a woman, and she has been sick,” he added. Earlier in the day, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka had directed authorities to obtain a search warrant for Mazari and Chattha. As the hearing at the sessions court resumed after two sittings, the prosecutor informed the session court that the two accused now have protective bail in the IHC and were ordered to appear before the court tomorrow. The judge adjourned the proceedings until tomorrow. Judge Majoka directed that the accused should be presented in the sessions court “within one hour of the appearance at IHC”. The judge also refused to entertain a request from the assistant counsel for adjournment till the day after tomorrow, stating that the counsel had taken “undue advantage” and no concession would be provided. Judge Majoka expresses displeasure During the hearing earlier today, judge Majoka expressed displeasure over why the accused had not yet been arrested. He directed the NCCIA officials to obtain a search warrant for the accused’s residence from a magistrate and ordered them to present Mazari and Chattha in court by 11am. When the hearing resumed, National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials, police officials, and special prosecutors appeared before the court. The court was informed that the arrest had not yet been made. NCCIA officials and police sought further time to submit a report regarding the arrest. Judge Majoka then adjourned the hearing till 2pm, warning that “whoever’s report is unsatisfactory, action will be taken against them”. On Saturday, the court reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Mazari and Chattha for their repeated absences from trial proceedings. In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Judge Majoka noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the NCCIA. During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest. At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad high court. The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused. Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants. The case The case stems from a complaint filed on August 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.

      "summary_orig": "A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) arrived in Saudi Arabia to take part in a multinational aerial combat exercise, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release on Monday. The PAF contingent, comprising F-16 Block-52 fighter aircraft alongside dedicated air and ground crew, arrived at King Abdulaziz Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to participate in the multinational aerial combat exercise ‘Spears of Victory 2026’. “The exercise is witnessing the participation of fighter jets and combat support elements from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, France, Italy, Greece, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America,” the ISPR said. “It offers a robust platform to enhance interoperability, operational synergy, mutual understanding and capacity building among participating air forces, particularly in large force employment, night composite air operations, integrated ISR (Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance), and operations in advanced electronic warfare environments.” Through participation in this multinational forum, the PAF seeks to enhance interoperability with partner air forces and “validate its operational preparedness in a contested, technology-driven battle space”. The military’s media wing elaborated that PAF fighter aircraft undertook a non-stop flight from their home base in Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, “demonstrating the long-range operational reach and expeditionary capabilities of Pakistan Air Force”. “During the conduct of the exercise, PAF pilots flying advanced F-16 Block-52 aircraft equipped with modern avionics and Beyond Visual Range capabilities will be pitched against air crews of participating air forces operating a wide array of sophisticated combat aircraft,” it added. The ISPR further said that the participation of the PAF contingent in the exercise not only reflected its firm commitment to regional and international military cooperation, but also underscored its “professional excellence and proven capability to operate effectively in diverse and demanding operational environments alongside leading contemporary air forces”. In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both. The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies , with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.",
