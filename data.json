      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani in Doha on Wednesday and offered to expand bilateral cooperation in the areas of defence and defence production between Pakistan and Qatar, a statement issued by the Presidency said. According to the statement, the Qatari emir “responded positively” to the offer and said he would instruct the relevant authorities to initiate discussions with Pakistan in this regard immediately. The bilateral meeting was held on sidelines of the  Second World Summit for Social Development, which is being held in Qatari capital Doha from November 4 to 6. President Zardari is representing Pakistan at the moot. The Presidency’s statement said that the Qatari leader also “expressed satisfaction at the recent Pakistan-Saudi Arabia defence agreement”. “It was a welcome and timely step that should have happened earlier,” the statement quoted al-Thani as saying. He also noted Pakistan’s “unique position as a country maintaining strategic ties with China, the West and the Gulf states at the same time”. In September, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hinted that it was rooted in current world affairs and reflected the defence concerns of both countries. It also came just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June. On the matter of recent clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Qatari emir expressed “hope that Pakistan and Afghanistan would resolve their current issues and move beyond recent challenges”. Qatar is one of the two mediators in talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban, which were held in Doha and Istanbul following border clashes between the two sides last month. Another round of talks between them is set to begin tomorrow (Nov 6) in the Turkish capital. According to the Presidency’s statement, al-Thani told Zardari that “Qatar is proud of Pakistan and its achievements, and deeply values the contribution of the Pakistani community to Qatar’s development”. He expressed the desire to see their number “increase significantly” in the coming years, the statement said. For his part, President Zardari conveyed “warm greetings and best wishes” from the government and people of Pakistan to the Qatari emir, expressing “deep admiration for Qatar’s remarkable progress and visionary leadership”. Moreover, the statement said that President Zardari also “proposed enhancing cooperation in agriculture and food security” during the meeting. He also welcomed enhanced Qatari investment in Pakistan and expressed confidence that bilateral collaboration would continue to grow between the two nations. He lauded Qatar’s growing global role as a “centre of dialogue and humanitarian diplomacy and paid tribute to its leadership in advocating a ceasefire and humanitarian relief for the people of Gaza”. Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the Gulf nation, he highlighted Islamabad’s “strong condemnation” of Israel’s aggression against Qatar and its continued diplomatic support for Qatar’s sovereignty at international forums. The president welcomed enhanced Qatari investment in Pakistan and expressed confidence that bilateral collaboration would continue to grow between the two countries under the Qatari emir’s leadership, the statement said. The president “also commended the contributions of the Qatar Fund for Development, the Education Above All Foundation, and other Qatari humanitarian initiatives, paying special tribute to  Sheikha Moza bint Nasser and Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad Al Thani for advancing education and cultural exchange,” the statement read. It added that President Zardari further appreciated Qatar’s role in hosting and facilitating the UN-led Doha Process meetings on Afghanistan, including the first and second rounds held in May 2023 and February 2024, which have supported international coordination on humanitarian, development and security issues. He invited the Qatari emir to Pakistan to further strengthen “partnership with Qatar for regional peace, progress, and shared prosperity”, the statement said, adding that the Qatari leader said he would visit Pakistan early next year. Both leaders also discussed ways to further strengthen cooperation in political, economic and cultural spheres, the statement said, adding that they “reaffirmed the historic and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar, rooted in faith, mutual trust and shared aspirations for peace, prosperity and the advancement of the Muslim Ummah”. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was also present during the meeting, the statement said. Meeting with Chinese vice president Earlier, the president also met Chinese Vice President Han Zheng in the Qatari capital who appreciated Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and stability, a separate statement issued by the Presidency said. According to the statement by the Presidency, during his meeting with the Chinese vice president, Zardari recalled his recent visit to China, saying that Pakistan and China were “iron brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners”. “He thanked China for its consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan through all challenges, reaffirming that friendship with China remains the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy,” the statement said. The president also commended “China’s continued partnership in the successful implementation of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has now entered its second phase of high-quality development,” it added. For his part, the statement said, Han Zheng  appreciated “Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and stability” and reaffirmed the “enduring strength of the Pakistan-China friendship”. The vice president also conveyed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s warm greetings. He stressed that China would “continue to support Pakistan’s economic development under the second phase of CPEC, particularly in transport and infrastructure, information technology, agriculture, and vocational training”. According to the statement, the two leaders “reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership based on mutual trust, respect, and a shared vision for regional peace and prosperity”. “They also agreed to continue close cooperation on issues of mutual interest at regional and international fora,” the statement added. President Zardari was accompanied by MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Pakistan’s ambassador to Qatar during the meeting.",

      "summary_orig": "Zohran Mamdani , a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, capping a meteoric rise from a little-known state lawmaker to one of the United State’s most visible Democratic figures. According to CBS , Mamdani received 1,035,645 votes (50.4 per cent) against 854,783 (41.6pc) for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and 146,127 (7.1pc) for Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani will become the first Muslim mayor of the largest US city. He defeated Democratic former Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, who ran as an independent after losing the nomination to Mamdani in the primary election. The campaign served as an ideological and generational contest that could have national implications for the Democratic Party. Democrats won two key state governor races, sending an early warning signal to Republican President Donald Trump ahead of the 2026 midterms. The clean sweep among several ballots nationwide has boosted morale among Democrats bruised by Trump’s return to the White House and has set alarm bells ringing among Republican circles. Mamdani, the youngest to serve in more than a century, was born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin and has lived in the United States since he was seven, becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2018. The Democratic socialist’s victory came in the face of fierce attacks on his policies and his Muslim heritage from business elites, conservative media commentators and Trump himself, who had made an eleventh-hour intervention in the race, calling Mamdani a “Jew hater“. “Hope is alive,” Mamdani declared in his victory speech. “We won because New Yorkers allowed themselves to hope that the impossible could be made possible. We won because we insisted that no longer would politics be something that is done to us. Now, it is something we do,” he said. View this post on Instagram Mamdani said New York would no longer be a city where one can “traffic in Islamophobia and win an election”, adding that the city will be a light “in this moment of political darkness”. He pledged a city hall “that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of anti-Semitism, where the more than one million Muslims know that they belong”. He quoted Jawaharlal Nehru, saying, “A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.” View this post on Instagram The Democrat also gave a message to the US president, who is also a New Yorker, saying, “Donald Trump, since I know you are watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!” Mamdani said he would put an end to the “culture of corruption” that has allowed billionaires like Trump to “evade taxation and exploit tax breaks”. “We will stand alongside unions and expand labour protections because we know, just as Donald Trump does, that when working people have iron-clad rights, the bosses who seek to extort them become very small indeed,” he said. View this post on Instagram Promising to fight for all New Yorkers, Mamdani said his administration would represent “immigrants, members of the trans community, Black women fired by Trump from federal jobs, single mothers struggling with rising costs — anyone with their back against the wall”. He concluded his speech by thanking New Yorkers, saying, “This power is yours. This city belongs to you.” His emphatic speech concluded with Bollywood song ‘Dhoom Machale’ blaring over the speakers. View this post on Instagram Turnout was high in this year’s vote with 2.06 million ballots, or 98pc of votes cast, counted by 12:31am on Wednesday — more than the total number of voters in the 2021 race. “The next and last stop is City Hall,” Mamdani said in a video posted to X after his victory was declared. Congratulations for Mamdani Ex-president Bill Clinton congratulated Mamdani. “I’m wishing you success as you work to transform the passion of your campaign into building a better, fairer, more affordable New York,” he said. The former US First Lady and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that “more people voted in New York City’s election this year than they have in 50 years”. US Senator Bernie Sanders said Mamdani had “pulled off one of the great political upsets in modern American history”. “Yes. We CAN create a government that represents working people and not the 1pc,” he said. Former US president Barack Obama congratulated all the Democrat candidates who won on Tuesday, calling it a reminder that “when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win”. “We’ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter,” he said. In New York, one group exclaimed “Mamdaniiiiii“, substituting the 34-year-old’s name for the customary “cheese” as they posed for a photo at a Brooklyn bar watch party. Voters gathered there in cautious optimism, sporting Mamdani merch as they anxiously awaited the evening’s results, classic songs such as Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” and edgier tracks from Lou Reed blasting from the speakers. It was a “local victory” that offered a means of “resisting and pushing back” against the political establishment in Washington, 40-year-old Ben Parisi told AFP , adding that the night stood in stark contrast to Trump’s victory a year ago. “A lot of us worked hard in one way or another to make this happen,” Parisi said, “and here we are… we get to celebrate“. Ghazala Hashmi becomes first Muslim woman to win statewide office in US Meanwhile, Ghazala Hashmi defeated Republican writer and conservative talk show host John Reid in the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race on Tuesday, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States Hashmi maintained a steady lead over Reid throughout the campaign, though polling tightened in the final days before election day. She secured 747,773 votes (53.8 per cent) against 659,421 (46.4pc) for her Republican rival. Earlier in June, Hashmi narrowly clinched the Democratic nomination, defeating former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and state Senator Aaron Rouse in a closely contested primary. A member of the party’s progressive wing, Hashmi enjoyed strong support from prominent figures such as Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, who backed her during the primary campaign. Born in Hyderabad, India, Hashmi moved to the United States in her youth and later earned a PhD in English from Emory University. She began her career in academia, teaching English for over two decades at community colleges in Virginia before entering politics. Her election to the state Senate in 2019 marked her as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Virginia legislature, a milestone she has now extended to statewide office. Democrats win Virginia, New Jersey governor races In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger easily won the election for governor, becoming the first woman elected to serve in that role, while Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States. And in New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race. Spanberger defeated Republican Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor’s race, flipping control of the state and making her the first woman ever to serve as the state governor. A former congresswoman and CIA officer, Spanberger maintained a consistent lead over Earle-Sears through most of the campaign, buoyed by strong fundraising and strong support in the state’s suburban counties. Her victory gives Democrats a significant boost as they seek to regain political footing following their 2024 national election losses. Spanberger, 47, centred her campaign heavily on economic and affordability issues, as well as public safety and her support for abortion rights. Her campaign and allied groups attacked Earle-Sears over her conservative record on social issues and her loyalty to Trump. Earle-Sears, 61, struggled throughout much of the race to find a coherent message. “We sent a message to the world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,” Spanberger said in her victory speech. “We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.” “You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian,” she said. Separately, Democrat Sherrill won New Jersey’s election for governor. Sherrill, a US representative and former Navy pilot, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli and will succeed Democratic Governor Phil Murphy. It is the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected governors from the same party for three consecutive terms. Uphill battle The races offered the beleaguered Democratic Party a test of differing campaign playbooks a year ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress will be at stake. Since Trump’s win last year, Democrats have found themselves locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find the best path out of the political wilderness. Reacting to Republican losses, Trump cited unspecified pollsters who attributed the loss to the ongoing government shutdown and Trump not leading the ballot. “‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Prominent business people, including Bill Ackman, had noisily attacked Mamdani and funnelled cash to his rivals, while conservative media, including The New York Post , published blanket negative coverage. Mamdani’s improbable rise highlights the Democratic Party’s debate over a centrist or a leftist future, with some leading national figures offering only tepid endorsements of Mamdani ahead of voting. Syracuse University political science professor Grant Reeher said ahead of the result that Mamdani would face an uphill battle. “Everybody’s got their knives out, and it’s a very difficult city to govern,” he told AFP .",

      "summary_en": "Zohran Mamdani , a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, capping a meteoric rise from a little-known state lawmaker to one of the United State’s most visible Democratic figures. According to CBS , Mamdani received 1,035,645 votes (50.4 per cent) against 854,783 (41.6pc) for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and 146,127 (7.1pc) for Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.

      "summary_orig": "Awami Muslim League (AML) chief Sheikh Rashid Ahmed was barred from travelling to Saudi Arabia for Umrah on Wednesday, despite directives from the Lahore High Court (LHC) allowing him to travel abroad. According to an October 30 court order — a copy of which is available with Dawn — the AML leader’s name had been removed from the Exit Control List (ECL), following involvement in several May 9 cases. The court had directed relevant authorities to allow him to travel. However, in a video message posted on the social media platform X, Rashid alleged: “Today, I was stopped from going to Saudi Arabia for Umrah, despite having permission from LHC’s Rawalpindi bench under Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan.” The AML leader recalled that the “court had directed relevant authorities — who were present in the hearing — to comply and strictly adhere to the directives, yet I have been told that I can not go.” Rashid alleged that two airport officers told him he “could not go and refused to obey the court order”. Rashid vowed to file for contempt of court against airport officials before Justice Khan, adding that “in a country where even a high court order is not valid, you can only really look to God for help.” In the Oct 30 court order, it was notified that “name of the petitioner (Sheikh Rashid) with the consent of concerned authorities has been removed from the exit control list (ECL).” The court noted that, “Anti-terrorism court Rawalpindi had issued general order for impounding of passports relating to the persons facing trial under Section 28-A ATA, 1997, but at present respondents have no objection on going of the petitioner to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah.” In January 2024, the AML chief was arrested after a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court rejected his bail in a case pertaining to violence in the country on May 9. Previously, Rashid was arrested in 2023 by the Punjab police amid the state’s crackdown on the PTI and its supporters following incidents of vandalism on May 9 — when party chairman Imran Khan was first arrested from the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).",

      "summary_orig": "Karachi police said on Wednesday that a man had been arrested for allegedly firing on citizens who had torched a heavy vehicle that had struck a young man and injured his wife a day earlier. Angered citizens on Tuesday had set a dumper truck on fire in the city’s Garden area after it crashed into a couple on a motorcycle, killing 23-year-old Shahzeb Shahid and injuring his wife Misbah. A case was also registered against Liaquat Mehsud, the Sindh president of the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, and other suspects for firing on the enraged protesters at the scene. South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza on Wednesday said that police had arrested one suspect, identified as one of Mehsud’s gunmen, on charges of firing on the protesters. The weapon used in the incident was also recovered, he said in a statement. “Raids are being conducted to arrest the president of the dumpers association, Liaquat Mehsud,” he added. Ex-MQM-P lawmaker booked under Peca for threatening Mehsud Separately, Garden police also registered a first information report (FIR) against Kamran Farooqi, a former MPA of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), for allegedly threatening Mehsud. The case was registered on behalf of the state through a police officer, and invoked the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), as well as Section 506-B (criminal intimidation if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). In the FIR, complainant Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Rao Muhammad Shahrukh said he was present at his office on November 4, when he came across a video on social media at 6pm. In the video, as per the ASI, a man identified as Kamran Farooqi was seen saying: “This wretched person, was fortunate today that he went away a few moments earlier, otherwise he would have been burned along with his vehicle. This is a public reaction.” The video was accompanied by similar text stating that Mehsud was “fortunate” to have escaped,  the complainant added. The complainant recalled that a dumper truck had killed Shahzeb on Nishtar Road in the Ramswami area and injured his wife Misbah yesterday. After that incident, the people had set the dumper ablaze. Subsequently, Mehsud, along with his gunmen and others, had arrived at the spot. ASI Shahrukh noted that the police had already registered two separate cases about the incident at the Garden police station. He contended that Farooqi spread “mischief” on social media and threatened the dumper association’s head. Therefore, the ex-lawmaker had committed cognisable crimes under Peca and the PPC, the officer asserted.",

      "title_orig": "Fawad claims efforts for release of political prisoners, including Imran, to bear fruit soon",
      "summary_orig": "Former minister Fawad Chaudhry claimed on Wednesday that the “impacts” of the efforts of a trio — comprising him and other ex-PTI leaders — for political stability in the country and the release of political prisoners, including PTI founder Imran Khan, would start bearing fruit in the next 10 to 15 days. Fawad, along with fellow former PTI leaders  Mehmood Moulvi and Imran Ismail, has been insisting on talks between the government and the PTI, in what they say is an effort to bring the political temperature down and pave the way for Imran’s release, who has been in jail since 2023. “I am very pleased that the efforts for political stability and to secure the release of political prisoners, including Imran, have resulted in significant initial successes, and their impact will start becoming evident in the next 10 to 15 days,” Fawad posted on social media platform X. He reiterated that himself, Moulvi and Ismail were making these efforts for “political stability in Pakistan”, expressing the optimism that differences and distances would soon diminish in the political landscape. “It is important to abate political hostilities for Pakistan’s political stability and […] long-term development,” Fawad said. The statement came hours after a late-night post on Imran’s X account quoted him as saying that he would “neither hold talks with the government nor with the establishment”. While it remains unclear that who runs Imran’s social media accounts with him being in jail, posts on his X accounts frequently carry statements that are described as his messages from jail. In the post, Imran said it was futile to hold talks and any decisions regarding negotiations would be taken by Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Raja Nasir Abbas, who are part of the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, along with the PTI. The post also quoted Imran as saying that he had complete trust in PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who has been criticised by Fawad in recent days. Political outreach campaign Fawad, Ismail and Moulvi’s recent activities came into the spotlight when they visited PTI’s Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a hospital in Lahore last week. The trio, however, was reported to have returned empty-handed, with Qureshi’s lawyer saying that had no political discussion with his client. Qureshi is among several PTI leaders who were sent to prison in cases pertaining to May 9, 2023 protest that erupted over Imran’s arrest the same day. A crackdown on the party was launched after the violent protests, during which several public properties and military installations were vandalised. The former foreign minister was shifted to the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute from jail for medical treatment, where the three former PTI leaders   visited him. “Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” Qureshi’s lawyer Rana Mudassar later said, adding that by the time he got back, the ex-PTI leaders had already gone. He said the visitors stayed only a little over 10 minutes and left without any political discussion with Qureshi. However, the former PTI leaders, particularly Fawad and Ismail, have been insisting that Qureshi had agreed with them that the stalemate in Pakistan’s politics must end. The also maintain that they met another jailed PYI leader Ejaz Chaudhry in this regard. After their visit to the hospital, Raja also reportedly called on Qureshi , with party leaders Shaukat Basra and Zaheer Babar in tow. On Sunday, Fawad had doubled down on his quest to revive the fortunes of the PTI, even as senior party leaders like Asad Qaiser maintained that both the party and its founder “will not compromise on their principles” even if they engage in a dialogue. He also claimed that most seasoned PTI politicians and more than 15 MPAs had approached him to express their agreement that a government-PTI engagement was “highly necessary”. He urged the government to take the first step towards de-escalation by offering relief to imprisoned senior PTI leaders. “If the government gives relief to the incarcerated Lahore and Gujranwala leaders, then these leaders could engage with the jailed Khan and lead a process of engagement,” he explained. “Imran Khan’s mandate is with the party leaders, who have been in jails for the past two years,” he acknowledged, referring to PTI leaders such as Qureshi and Dr Yasmin Rashid. He also shared the trio’s plans to approach the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman, as well as some senior ministers, and ask them to play a role in defusing political tensions. The ex-PTI leaders have also dispelled the impression that they were working on a ‘minus Imran formula’.",

Political outreach campaign Fawad, Ismail and Moulvi’s recent activities came into the spotlight when they visited PTI’s Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a hospital in Lahore last week. The trio, however, was reported to have returned empty-handed, with Qureshi’s lawyer saying that had no political discussion with his client. Qureshi is among several PTI leaders who were sent to prison in cases pertaining to May 9, 2023 protest that erupted over Imran’s arrest the same day. A crackdown on the party was launched after the violent protests, during which several public properties and military installations were vandalised. The former foreign minister was shifted to the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute from jail for medical treatment, where the three former PTI leaders   visited him. “Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” Qureshi’s lawyer Rana Mudassar later said, adding that by the time he got back, the ex-PTI leaders had already gone. He said the visitors stayed only a little over 10 minutes and left without any political discussion with Qureshi. However, the former PTI leaders, particularly Fawad and Ismail, have been insisting that Qureshi had agreed with them that the stalemate in Pakistan’s politics must end. The also maintain that they met another jailed PYI leader Ejaz Chaudhry in this regard. After their visit to the hospital, Raja also reportedly called on Qureshi , with party leaders Shaukat Basra and Zaheer Babar in tow. On Sunday, Fawad had doubled down on his quest to revive the fortunes of the PTI, even as senior party leaders like Asad Qaiser maintained that both the party and its founder “will not compromise on their principles” even if they engage in a dialogue. He also claimed that most seasoned PTI politicians and more than 15 MPAs had approached him to express their agreement that a government-PTI engagement was “highly necessary”. He urged the government to take the first step towards de-escalation by offering relief to imprisoned senior PTI leaders. “If the government gives relief to the incarcerated Lahore and Gujranwala leaders, then these leaders could engage with the jailed Khan and lead a process of engagement,” he explained. “Imran Khan’s mandate is with the party leaders, who have been in jails for the past two years,” he acknowledged, referring to PTI leaders such as Qureshi and Dr Yasmin Rashid. He also shared the trio’s plans to approach the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman, as well as some senior ministers, and ask them to play a role in defusing political tensions. The ex-PTI leaders have also dispelled the impression that they were working on a ‘minus Imran formula’.",

      "summary_orig": "• Insists proposed 27th Amendment to be tabled ‘soon’, won’t be rushed • Says bill may originate in Senate instead of NA • Stresses govt will consult allies as opposition warns of ‘constitutional crisis’ • PTI’s Ali Zafar brands move a ‘conspiracy’, claims devolution at risk • Upper house passes Asaan Karobar Bill, extends Virtual Assets Ordinance by 120 days ISLAMABAD: As the opposition in the Senate raised alarm over the proposed 27th constitutional amendment, Deputy Pri­me Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday confirmed the bill would be brought bef­o­re parliament “soon” but insisted it would not be rus­hed and denied “external hand” in the amendment. “We will try to present it in accordance with the Constitution. I assure this will not be put to a vote in a flash,” he told the upper house while responding to PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar. Mr Dar’s remarks came amid a sustained protest by opposition senators over the delay in appointing the leader of the opposition. He said that after the PPP, the government would take all allies on board, including the MQM, ANP, IPP and BAP. “A standard process is being followed,” he said. The deputy prime minister noted that such amen­dments typically originate in the National Assembly, but added that if senators wis­hed to see the draft fir­st, he could request that the bill be moved in the Senate. Brushing aside suggestions that the amendment was coming from “somewhere else”, he said it was being brought by the government. He also suppor­ted the opposition’s dem­a­­nd for the immediate app­o­­i­­n­tment of the opposition leader, but said the Se­n­ate chairman was supposed to satisfy himself on who commanded a majority. ‘Conspiracy against Constitution’ Earlier, PTI’s Ali Zafar termed the forthcoming 27th Amendment a “conspiracy against the Constitution”. He said key ministers in television appearances he had taken part in had claimed there was no such amendment in the works. “This only means either they were telling a lie or were unaware of it. In both cases, it means that someone else is drafting the 27th Amendment for them,” he said, warning that an imminent constitutional crisis had effectively been announced and must be taken up by the Senate. “Constitutions are not murdered by bullets, but by mala fide amendments made under the guise of reform,” Mr Zafar said. Calling the Constitution a sacred document, he recalled that on April 10, 1973, when the Consti­tut­ion was adopted, the then prime minister Zulfi­kar Ali Bhutto declared that it was “the Constitu­tion of the people of Pakis­tan, not of one man or one party”. He said dictators had distorted the 1973 document over the next 37 years, until parliament passed the 18th Amendment in April 2010, restoring the democratic spirit of the Constitution, reviving the parliamentary form of government, strengthening provincial autonomy and safeguarding the independence of the judiciary and the Election Commission. However, he warned that the proposed 27th Amendment threatened to undo those gains. The senator alleged it would undermine judicial independence through the creation of constitutional courts, tamper with presidential powers and appointments relating to the armed forces under Article 243, alter the provincial share in the NFC Award by removing the constitutional minimum, and give devolved functions such as education, health and population planning back under federal control. “All these proposals, as suggested in PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s own tweet, strike at the very foundations of our constitutional order, reversing the principles of provincial autonomy, parliamentary supremacy and judicial independence.” He expressed surprise that, instead of rejecting such proposals, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had outlined them, arguing they contradicted the spirit and legacy of the PPP, whose founders had given Pakistan the 1973 Constitution . “The question before us is not merely legal, it is moral,” he said. “Will the Peoples Party honour the word it gave to the people in 1973, or once again erase it in the name of expedience?” He reminded the Senate that JUI-F had previously opposed the creation of any constitutional court and said he hoped both JUI-F and Jamaat-i-Islami would stand with the PTI in opposing the 27th Amendment. The row over the opposition leader’s appointment surfaced at the outset of proceedings when PTI-backed Senator Azam Swati raised the matter. The protest over the issue later escalated as PTI senators gathered before the chair’s podium and tore up copies of the agenda. The house echoed with chants of “Go PM go.” Presiding officer Manzoor Kakar of BAP said the issue did not fall within his jurisdiction. He asked members to return to their seats and assured them of time to speak. Asaan Karobar Bill Separately, the House passed the Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025, which aims to streamline the regulatory framework for business, trade and investment by removing cumbersome procedures and outdated requirements. Already cleared by the National Assembly, the legislation provides for the establishment of a Pakistan Regulatory Registry and a Pakistan Business Portal to serve as a national one-window for government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits. The bill was moved by MNA Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, chairman of the Board of Investment. According to the statement of objects and reasons of the bill, “The modernised regulatory requirements will be integrated through a Pakistan Business Portal, which will serve as a National One-Window facility for the identification and issuance of all government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits.” The implementation of this initiative “will have several benefits for the economy, including increased investment, job creation and economic growth,” the statement said. “It will also help improve Pakistan’s competitiveness in the global market and attract foreign investors seeking a stable and predictable regulatory environment.” The Senate also extended the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025 , for another 120 days. The ordinance, in force since July 8, 2025, establishes a legal framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, including the creation of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA). The authority’s mandate includes licensing crypto-related entities, issuing and implementing regulations, investigating suspicious transactions, ensuring consumer protection and imposing penalties, suspensions or legal action against non-compliant companies.
