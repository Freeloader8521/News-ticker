      "title_orig": "The eternal ascent: Basant returns to the skies of Lahore",
      "summary_orig": "In the ancient city of Lahore, where the Ravi river whispers secrets to the minarets of the Badshahi Mosque, spring arrives not with a gentle sigh, but with a sudden, jubilant roar. When the winter’s fog finally yields to the sun’s warm gaze, the skies above the walled city awaken. Kites (‘patangs’) burst upward from rooftops, their paper bodies trembling, their tails slicing the blue sky like calligraphy in motion. This is Basant: a centuries-old festival marked by marigold blooms and kites, carried by colour and the steady pull of the wind. Bo Kata! — a festival of freedom and flight Basant traces its roots to Vasant Panchami, the ancient herald of spring observed on the fifth day of Magh, when the land stirs from winter’s slumber. In the mustard fields of Punjab, ochre blooms unfurl like carpets laid for spring’s arrival. Goddess Saraswati, (the goddess of learning and the arts), clad in saffron-gold, is invoked with music and learning, her veena (an Indian stringed instrument) resonating with the promise of renewal. In Lahore, however, Basant long outgrew its ritual origins. It became deeply Punjabi, exuberantly urban, and radically inclusive. Hindu, Muslim and Sikh households alike climbed their roofs, dressed in amber and marigold hues, turning the city into a living mosaic where faith receded, and celebration took flight. Historical chronicles recall Basant at its most magnificent during the Mughal era. Emperors revelled in the spectacle: kites wheeling above the ramparts of Lahore Fort, their strings guided by hands adorned with henna. Amir Khusrau, the Sufi poet whose verses still seem to linger in the city’s breath, sang of Basant as a season of love, colour, and divine intoxication. A man holds kites ahead of the three-day kite-flying festival (Basant) at a market in Lahore on Feb 2, 2026. — APP/ File Later, in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the festival assumed an even grander, almost theatrical form. For 10 days, Lahore became a city lost in celebration. Marigold garlands draped streets and courtyards; soldiers appeared in turmeric-hued turbans; women swayed on jhulas (swings), the steady beat of the dhol travelled through every lane. Above it all, kite battles drew cheers of “Bo kata!” from rooftop to rooftop. Yet the true poetry of Basant lies not in its pomp, but in the humble kite itself. A fragile diamond-framed paper and bamboo, it is tethered to earth by a single string, yet it yearns for the heavens. In the hands of a Lahori child or elder, the patang becomes more than play: it is an act of transcendence. As the wind takes hold, the kite escapes the dust and clamour of crowded streets, briefly escaping the confines of class and circumstance, carrying the hopes of those who hold the string below. For many in Lahore, Basant has always been this quiet rebellion against gravity. In narrow streets where life presses close, the rooftop becomes a stage for liberation. A young man, burdened by tomorrow’s worries, sends his kite aloft and watches it soar, higher, freer, until it seems to touch the very edge of possibility. A woman, her heart full of unspoken longings, lets the wind carry her kite as if it could bear her dreams to distant horizons. The kite is an escape made visible: fragile yet defiant, tethered yet boundless. It reminds us that even the smallest soul can touch the infinite if given the right wind. The ghost of Basant lingering in memory for two decades For nearly two decades, however, the skies remained silent. The ban descended after tragic losses, lives claimed by sharp, glass-coated or metallic strings that sliced through the air, severing throats and injuring bystanders on rooftops and streets below. The silence was born of necessary grief and reckoning, a painful but essential pause to protect what mattered most. Families who once gathered with spools of thread in their hands now looked up at an empty blue sky, feeling the absence like a missing heartbeat. Old men sat on charpoys in the evenings, eyes distant, murmuring about days when the sky was alive with colour. Mothers recalled their children’s laughter as they ran across terraces, cheeks flushed with sun and excitement. Young people, who had known Basant only through stories and grainy videos, carried a quiet nostalgia for something they had never truly touched. A tournament at Guddi Ground in Lahore’s Iqbal Park in January 2001. — Dawn/ File The city missed it deeply: the shared joy, the playful rivalries, the way the wind seemed to carry away every worry for a single radiant day. Basant had become a beloved ghost, lingering over rooftops and in memory. But the longing never died. It lived in whispered conversations, in turmeric-hued kurtas worn on spring days as quiet tribute, in the careful way kite-makers kept their craft alive in the city’s hidden corners. It lived in the hope that one day the skies would fill again — not recklessly, but with wisdom earned from sorrow. Lahore’s patangs are set to rise once more, responsibly And now, as February has ascended, the wind is stirring once more. Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025, with its strict mandates for cotton strings only (no metallic or glass coatings), QR-coded registration, maximum nine threads, drone monitoring, and zero tolerance for violations, the patangs will rise again, thoughtfully and safely, over the rooftops of Lahore on February 6, 7, and 8, 2026. The old songs are being rehearsed, the dhol awaits its beat, and the air will soon carry the sweet scent of marigold sweets and the gentle tug of ordinary thread. What was lost is being remembered with care; what was mourned is being welcomed back, wiser and more precious for the wait. As one lifelong resident of Anarkali, Anwar Bajwa, shared with quiet emotion: “Basant was never just a day for me; it was part of who I was, part of every spring morning when the air turned warm and full of promise. As a boy, I would wake before dawn and run to the rooftop with my siblings, thread in hand, my heart racing for the wind to lift our kites. Those patangs were my companions, my secrets, my way of whispering dreams to the sky when words fell short. Every tug on the string felt like my own heartbeat reaching higher.” He added that when the rooftops went silent, “it was like losing a piece of my childhood. The empty sky in spring felt wrong, heavy, and incomplete. Now, hearing that the kites will fly again, safely and responsibly, I feel that old excitement stirring inside me, like time has turned back and I’m that boy once again, waiting for the wind to carry my dreams up where nothing can touch them.” The skies of old Basant were tapestries of scarlet, emerald, indigo, and amber, woven by thousands of patangs locked in gentle combat. Rooftops brimmed with laughter, the air thick with the scent of marigold-hued sweets. Families gathered, strangers became friends, and for radiant days, Lahore was united in pure, unbridled joy. The kite, too, carries its own quiet symbolism. A close look reveals intricate designs — stars, eyes, flowers — each patang a small work of art, born in the hands of artisans who know the wind’s secrets. And beneath it all, the earth itself celebrates: vast fields of mustard-gold sway in the breeze, a living mirror to the crowds above. The return of flight and soaring spirits As the season approaches, the memory of those quiet years only deepens the anticipation. The skies have been empty for too long, yet the longing has made every coming flight more sacred. In every Lahori heart, the kite still waits, patient, hopeful, and soon it will rise once more. When it does, Lahore will not merely remember joy; it will reclaim it, wiser for the silence, stronger for the lessons etched in loss. Basant returns not as a fleeting spectacle, but as proof that even after the darkest pause, the human spirit, fragile as paper and defiant as wind, can ascend again, tethered only by the thinnest thread of care, soaring toward a boundless sky that belongs, once more, to all of us.

      "summary_orig": "Terrorists martyred a police recruit constable in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, the local police said on Wednesday. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. KP and Balochistan are particularly frequent targets. The constable was killed in the Darga forest in Nasrkhel, near the Sarai Naurang area of ​​Lakki Marwat. District Police Spokesperson Qudratullah confirmed the incident, saying that the martyred constable had been undergoing training at Hangu Training School. “On Tuesday night, terrorists abducted him from his house in Nasrkhel and took him to a forest called Darga and shot and killed him there,” he said. The funeral prayers of the constable were offered with official honours at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines. Lakki Marwat’s District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan, Superintendent of Police (SP) Investigation Murad Khan, police officers, district administration officers and police personnel attended the prayers in large numbers. The DPO also paid tribute to the martyr’s sacrifice, saying that the constable had set “a shining example of bravery and sacrifice” by giving his life in the line of duty. “The entire nation is proud of this brave soldier. These cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken our resolve,” he said. “The morale of Lakki Marwat police is high and actions against Fitna-al-Khawarij will be further intensified. No sacrifice will be spared to protect the lives and property of the people, and the involved elements will be brought to their logical end soon.” Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Despite record militant deaths , the country saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. Last month, the KP Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan. Only days before that, at least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts, officials said. The previous week, the military’s media wing had said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. That same day, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu.",

These cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken our resolve,” he said. “The morale of Lakki Marwat police is high and actions against Fitna-al-Khawarij will be further intensified. No sacrifice will be spared to protect the lives and property of the people, and the involved elements will be brought to their logical end soon.” Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Despite record militant deaths , the country saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. Last month, the KP Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan. Only days before that, at least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts, officials said. The previous week, the military’s media wing had said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. That same day, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu.",

Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. KP and Balochistan are particularly frequent targets. The constable was killed in the Darga forest in Nasrkhel, near the Sarai Naurang area of ​​Lakki Marwat. District Police Spokesperson Qudratullah confirmed the incident, saying that the martyred constable had been undergoing training at Hangu Training School. “On Tuesday night, terrorists abducted him from his house in Nasrkhel and took him to a forest called Darga and shot and killed him there,” he said. The funeral prayers of the constable were offered with official honours at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines.

      "summary_orig": "Gold prices extended gains on Wednesday on safe-haven appeal, as renewed geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran added to the yellow metal’s recent upswing that saw it mark its best day since 2008 in the previous session. Spot gold gained 2.7 per cent to$5,071.79 per ounce as of 03:53 GMT, after surging 5.9pc on Tuesday, its biggest daily gain since November 2008. Bullion scaled a record high of $5,594.82 last Thursday. US gold futures for April delivery climbed 3.2pc to $5,092.0 per ounce. “Gold has climbed back about the key $5,000 level, … (as) geopolitical tensions have lifted the metal’s safe-haven appeal after US forces downed an Iranian drone,” said Jigar Trivedi, a senior research analyst at IndusInd Securities. The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters. Nuclear talks between the US and Iran are expected to take place in Oman on Friday, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on Tuesday, citing an Arab source. Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a spending deal into law that ends a partial US government shutdown, which had delayed key labour data reports that were due for release this week. Investors expect at least two Fed interest rate cuts in 2026 and await ADP private payroll data later in the day for more cues on the Fed’s policy path. Non-yielding bullion tends to perform better in low-interest-rate environments. “Going ahead (gold) prices may touch $5,100 in the very near-term … and we are expecting the same $5,600 levels by the end of the first half or April-end while prices will continue to rise thereafter and our year-end target is $6,000/oz,” Trivedi added. The current wave is expected to be sharp, probably to surge into the $4,950 to $5,198 range, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said on Tuesday. Spot silver rose 3.2pc to $87.84 an ounce.

      "title_orig": "Remembering Prince Karim Aga Khan — Faith, pluralism and service",
      "summary_orig": "The late Prince Karim al-Hussaini Aga Khan IV passed away on Feb 4, 2025 in Lisbon, Portugal, at the age of 88. He is remembered not only by his faithful followers but also by vulnerable communities globally, as he was a champion of community-based development as well as efforts to combat natural disasters. Late Prince Karim, the Aga Khan IV, was not only the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, but also a prominent statesman and key supporter of global development. Prince Karim was born on Dec 13, 1936 in Geneva to late Prince Aly Khan and his first wife, the late Princess Tajuddawlah, née Joan Yarde-Buller. He spent his early childhood in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. The philanthropist was also an accomplished skier and represented Iran at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. He founded what is now the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) more than 50 years ago, with the purpose of improving the quality of life of those in need — regardless of origin, race, gender or religion — through efforts in health care, education, habitat, culture and the creation of economic opportunity. The AKDN is active in more than 30 countries, with a particular focus on some of the poorest parts of Asia and Africa. Prince Karim held the position of Aga Khan for 67 years after succeeding his grandfather, Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan III, in 1957 at the age of 20. He guided all the agencies that comprise the AKDN to work closely with national and local governments on a politically neutral basis and to identify and implement solutions in a collaborative manner. The alleviation of poverty, enhancement of pluralism and gender equality, and protection of the environment are among its key areas of focus. The institutional framework and holistic approach of the AKDN have led to the establishment of two universities, over 200 schools and more than 700 health facilities. There are parks and gardens, foundations that work in social and cultural development, as well as microfinance programmes, environmental protection and climate change mitigation initiatives , habitat planning, disaster preparedness and humanitarian assistance. There are also businesses in commercial banking, insurance, telecommunications, energy, tourism and media. The AKDN’s impact is wide-ranging: it annually generates electricity for 10 million people, provides health care to 5m, educates 2m students, and hosts 5m visitors at its parks and gardens. With an annual budget of approximately $1bn for its non-profit activities, AKDN agencies employ some 96,000 people, the vast majority of whom are Asians and Africans living and working in their home countries or regions. Education Providing access to high-quality education in the developing world and promoting gender-equal education were among the most important priorities of the late Prince Karim. He inherited and enhanced schools that his grandfather, Aga Khan III, established in Asia and Africa, and expanded the portfolio of 200 schools to serve more than 85,000 students. Following the tradition of his ancestors, who founded Al-Azhar University in Cairo in 970, Prince Karim placed great importance on education and established the Aga Khan University in 1983 as Pakistan’s first private, internationally chartered university. It is home to leading medical, nursing and education faculties and programmes. It operates in six countries, in partnership with the governments of Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan through an international treaty. Prince Karim also founded the University of Central Asia in 2000 to improve the social and economic development of Central Asia, with special attention to its high-mountain societies. Continuing this initiative, he also supported partnerships with leading universities across the world and endowed programmes at Harvard, MIT and Brown. Patron of the arts The Aga Khan was deeply engaged in the arts and cultural matters, and established programmes and initiatives to support architecture, music and conservation. The Aga Khan Award for Architecture was established in 1977 and, with a prize fund of $1m, is awarded every three years to projects that set new standards of excellence in architecture, planning practices, preservation and landscape architecture. The Aga Khan Music Programme fosters the development of musical heritage in societies where Muslims have a significant presence. The Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme supports the delivery of restoration and conservation projects and the creation of parks and gardens, such as Al-Azhar Park in Cairo. Underlining his commitment to preserving Muslim heritage, Prince Karim in 2014 opened the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, home to over 1,000 masterpieces showcasing the arts of Muslim civilisations. Sporting pursuits Building on a long family tradition, the Aga Khan was a globally recognised horse owner and breeder. With stud farms in France and Ireland where his racehorses were bred and raised, Prince Karim had five Derby winners — including Shergar , who won the Irish and Epsom Derbies — four winners of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, and a record seven winners of the Prix de Diane. Bridge building Prince Karim embodied understanding and tolerance, promoted unity, and underscored the crucial importance of peace as a foundational building block for the progress of society. Through his personal efforts over the course of six decades, he played a vital role in bringing peace to a fragmented world. He facilitated diplomatic talks at regional and global levels, including the landmark 1985 summit between Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev in Geneva. In partnership with the Government of Canada, he founded the Global Centre for Pluralism in 2006. The centre works with policy leaders, educators and community builders around the world to amplify and implement the transformative power of pluralism. Titles and honours The hereditary title “Aga Khan” (meaning “Commanding Chief”) is an honorific title given by the 19th-century Persian Qajar monarch, Fath Ali Shah (1797–1834), to the 46th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, Hasan Ali Shah Aga Khan I (1817–1881). In keeping with the recognition accorded to the previous three Aga Khans by British monarchs, Queen Elizabeth II granted the title “His Highness” to Aga Khan IV in 1957. The Ismailis live in over 35 countries, mainly in Central, East and South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America and Australia, and number approximately 12–15m. In acknowledgement of his exceptional contributions to human development and improving social conditions globally, Prince Karim received distinctions of honour from France, Portugal, Kenya, Canada, the United Kingdom, Iran, India, Pakistan and Senegal. He received 44 international awards, including honorary Canadian citizenship and the UN Champion for Global Change Award, and was the recipient of 24 honorary degrees from leading institutions such as Cambridge, Harvard and McGill. His Highness the Aga Khan IV graduated from Harvard University in 1959 with a B.A. Honours degree in Islamic history. His grandfather served twice as the president of the League of Nations, and his uncle was a long-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Prince Karim cared deeply about the continued development of communities and societies, irrespective of their faith.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s spin-heavy squad are in winning form ahead of the T20 World Cup, but a controversial decision to forfeit their marquee clash against India could still trigger another early exit. Pakistan came close to withdrawing from the tournament in solidarity with Bangladesh , who pulled out after refusing to play in India, citing security concerns. The Pakistan government eventually cleared the team’s participation but it barred them from facing India in Colombo in a blockbuster clash on February 15. With two points for a win, a forfeit of the match will leave Pakistan with no margin for error if they are to progress as one of the top two from a five-team Group A. It means they must win their opening game against the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday and beat the United States three days later to stay in contention. Their final group game will be against Namibia on February 18. Captain Salman Agha said the move to boycott the India game was out of the team’s hands. “That is not our decision. We have to follow what our government decides,” he said. The Pakistan government has not said what their stance might be if the team were to end up facing India again in the semi-finals or final. Agha was not thinking about that. “Our job is to win, and we are capable of doing that,” he said. Pakistan will be keen to avoid a repeat of the last T20 World Cup in 2024, where a shock super over defeat to co-hosts the United States led to them failing to get out of the group. The side has since faced criticism for failing to adapt to the modern demands of T20 cricket, with the batting, particularly Babar Azam’s low strike rate , under scrutiny. The criticism was fuelled by Pakistan’s record last year, where 21 of their 34 T20 international wins came against lower-ranked opponents. Confidence restored Against elite teams, the results were sobering: three losses to India in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series defeat to New Zealand. However, Agha believes recent performances have restored confidence. Pakistan beat South Africa 2-1, won a home tri-series, and then completed a 3-0 sweep of an under-strength Australia. “We’ve had good preparation by beating Australia. We have the luxury of quality spinning all-rounders like Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan and Saim Ayub. “We’re ticking most boxes and believe we can win the World Cup,” Agha said. The spin department has been strengthened by Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, the latter known for his unusual, slingy action and exaggerated pause at the crease. The pace attack is led by the experienced Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah. Faheem Ashraf provides seam-bowling all-round support and newcomer Salman Mirza has been impressive. Batting remains Pakistan’s most volatile component. When openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan provide strong starts, the side can post competitive totals, but collapses remain a constant threat. Head coach Mike Hesson has added another layer of risk by leaving out experienced wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan because of poor form, opting instead for makeshift options in Usman Khan, Khawaja Nafay and Farhan. For Pakistan, the ingredients for a deep run are present, but with points potentially forfeited, there is little room left for error.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: After accusing the police of subjecting its workers to violence and detaining them near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, the PTI wrapped up its sit-in in the early hours of Wednesday. The IHC has allowed Imran twice-a-week meetings — on Tuesday and Thursdays — with his family, lawyers and other associates. Despite the order, the ex-premier has not been allowed any visitors for weeks, including his sisters and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. Therefore, protests and sit-ins near the Adiala jail, where Imran has been incarcerated since September 2023, have become a usual occurrence on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On several occasions, police have also used force to disperse the protesters, who often camp at Factory Naka — a police picket near the prison. Imran’s sisters and supporters again staged a sit-in near the prison on Tuesday, while a PTI post on social media platform X alleged that police had inflicted violence on party workers and arrested them. A livestream on the PTI’s YouTube channel showed one of Imran’s sisters, Aleema Khanum, surrounded by party workers and supporters, including children, sitting on the ground and shouting slogans. However, videos posted by PTI leader Aliya Hamza Malik from earlier in the evening showed men, appearing to be policemen, detaining people. Malik claimed in her post on X that lawmaker Mehar Abdul Sattar, along with party workers, had been arrested. A video posted by Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Moeen Riaz Qureshi showed a large contingent of police in riot gear. The caption said “a large contingent of police is approaching”. The sit-in continued despite the alleged police action, with Imran’s all three sisters present. While the protest was still under way until a short while after midnight, the number of participants had reduced by then. Naeem Haider Panjutha, who is a spokesperson to Imran on legal affairs and was present at the sit-in, posted on X at 12:44am that their protest was continuing. However, at around 1:30am, he wrote, “The sit-in has ended for the release of arrested [party] workers.” A video shared by him showed Aleema sitting in a car and speaking to Panjutha. Speaking to reporters at the spot earlier, Aleema demanded a meeting with Imran and immediate medical treatment for his eye condition Al-Shifa Hospital. “They have made a joke out of this, they have to provide him medical treatment,” she emphasised. The PTI has been raising concerns about Imran’s health after reports emerged, and later the government confirmed, that he was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). Aleema, flanked by Noreen Niazi and Uzma Khanum, also requested CM Afridi to “do something to get Imran free”. “You may shut down KP. What is happening with Imran in Punjab … you should come here.” Speaking to Geo News , Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had said last week that the former premier was taken to Pims in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on Imran’s eye on the night of January 24. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”. The PTI has also condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians. Aleema said about the development today that information about the Pims visit had been “leaked” and neither she, nor anyone else in Imran’s family was informed. “They quietly took him late at night. They might be worried that something might happen to him (Imran), but why leak it?” she questioned. “Why weren’t we told that he was taken to the hospital?” Aleema added. She said they had to meet Imran and said that Imran medical check-up be conducted in the presence of his physician, Dr Aasim Yusuf. She also called for the examination of Imran’s eye by a specialist doctor. While Aleema was staging a sit-in, the Rawalpindi sub-divisional police officer approached her with warrants issued for her by an anti-terrorism court in the garrison city on Monday, and Aleema signed the warrants. PTI to file another contempt plea Earlier, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja was at the Islamabad High Court to initiate the process of filing yet another contempt of court petition against Adiala jail authorities for repeatedly denying party leaders permission to meet Imran. Announcing that his party’s plans to again move the court against jail authorities, Raja said while speaking to reporters on the court premises that this would be the “sixth contempt petition” filed on the matter. The PTI and Imran’s sisters both have previously filed contempt petitions against Adiala jail authorities over non-compliance with the IHC order. Today, Raja said while speaking to reporters at the IHC that he was at the court to file “another contempt of court petition” over what he deemed was “continued and deliberate non-compliance with court orders”. “This is not the first time; this is the sixth contempt petition,” Raja said, adding that despite clear judicial directions, prison officials had consistently obstructed access to the PTI founder. “No constitution prevents a prisoner from speaking, and the jail rule being cited to restrict meetings is itself unconstitutional,” he asserted, without specifying which rule he was referring to. Raja maintained that while incarceration lawfully curtailed a person’s physical freedom, it did not “extinguish fundamental rights altogether”. The PTI leader said while a prisoner’s freedom was taken away, they could not be deprived of their capability to think and speak. “When someone goes to meet a prisoner, he can say whatever comes to his mind. There is no law that allows the state to censor thought or speech in this manner,” the PTI leader added. Raja alleged that restrictions on meetings with Imran were “not administrative but political in nature”, aimed at “silencing the former premier and controlling the political narrative”. “An attempt is being made to hide the hollowness of the system,” he said, further alleging that authorities were trying to bury what he described as the “lie of February 8” — seemingly a reference to the 2024 general elections, which the PTI has repeatedly alleged were rigged. He alleged that efforts were being made to hide that “people’s vote was robbed”, further accusing the state of “sending a message of submission” to the public. “They are telling the people that your destiny is only subjugation, that your vote and your voice have no value,” he said, without naming anyone. Raja further alleged that the continued denial of meetings with Imran was intended to create an atmosphere of fear and helplessness. “They are giving the people the impression that the freedom of your leaders is at our mercy,” he said, adding that such actions struck at the heart of democratic norms and constitutional guarantees. Raja described Imran Khan as the country’s most popular political leader and claimed that those in power were unnerved by his influence even from behind bars. “The founder of PTI is the biggest leader in the country, and today they are scared and terrified,” he said. “Their aim is to silence the voice of the founder of PTI.” Additional input from Ikram Junaidi and Mohammad Asghar",

Today, Raja said while speaking to reporters at the IHC that he was at the court to file “another contempt of court petition” over what he deemed was “continued and deliberate non-compliance with court orders”. “This is not the first time; this is the sixth contempt petition,” Raja said, adding that despite clear judicial directions, prison officials had consistently obstructed access to the PTI founder. “No constitution prevents a prisoner from speaking, and the jail rule being cited to restrict meetings is itself unconstitutional,” he asserted, without specifying which rule he was referring to. Raja maintained that while incarceration lawfully curtailed a person’s physical freedom, it did not “extinguish fundamental rights altogether”. The PTI leader said while a prisoner’s freedom was taken away, they could not be deprived of their capability to think and speak. “When someone goes to meet a prisoner, he can say whatever comes to his mind. There is no law that allows the state to censor thought or speech in this manner,” the PTI leader added. Raja alleged that restrictions on meetings with Imran were “not administrative but political in nature”, aimed at “silencing the former premier and controlling the political narrative”. “An attempt is being made to hide the hollowness of the system,” he said, further alleging that authorities were trying to bury what he described as the “lie of February 8” — seemingly a reference to the 2024 general elections, which the PTI has repeatedly alleged were rigged. He alleged that efforts were being made to hide that “people’s vote was robbed”, further accusing the state of “sending a message of submission” to the public. “They are telling the people that your destiny is only subjugation, that your vote and your voice have no value,” he said, without naming anyone. Raja further alleged that the continued denial of meetings with Imran was intended to create an atmosphere of fear and helplessness. “They are giving the people the impression that the freedom of your leaders is at our mercy,” he said, adding that such actions struck at the heart of democratic norms and constitutional guarantees. Raja described Imran Khan as the country’s most popular political leader and claimed that those in power were unnerved by his influence even from behind bars. “The founder of PTI is the biggest leader in the country, and today they are scared and terrified,” he said. “Their aim is to silence the voice of the founder of PTI.” Additional input from Ikram Junaidi and Mohammad Asghar",

      "summary_orig": "TRIPOLI: Saif al Islam, the most prominent son of the late Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi, was shot dead at his home on Tuesday. Abdullah Othman Abdul Rahim, a relative, told a TV channel that Saif al Islam was killed in his house by a group of four unidentified men. “Four armed men stormed the residence of Saif al Islam Qadhafi after disabling surveillance cameras, then executed him,” Abdul Rahim said. While Saif al Islam was well known in the north African country, especially for his role in shaping policy during his father’s rule, his public profile receded in recent years. In 2015, a Libyan court passed a death sentence in absentia on Saif al Islam for suppressing peaceful protests during the country’s 2011 revolution that ended his father’s rule. He was also provisionally charged by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity. In 2021, Saif al Islam registered as a presidential candidate for a December vote that eventually collapsed amid a political deadlock. Saif went from being his father’s heir apparent to a decade of captivity and obscurity in a remote hill town before launching a presidential bid that helped derail the attempted election in 2021. Despite holding no official position, he was once seen as the most powerful figure after his father, who ruled for more than four decades. He led talks on Libya abandoning its weapons of mass destruction and negotiated compensation for the families of those killed in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland in 1988.

      "summary_orig": "THE separatist militancy, which has gripped Balochistan for the past two decades, now seems to have escalated into a full-blown insurgency. Last week, hundreds of armed terrorists launched simultaneous attacks reportedly in 12 locations, including the provincial capital Quetta. They stormed security installations, set government buildings on fire and looted banks. Highly trained terrorists engaged the security forces in gun battles for hours, revealing their capacity to challenge the state. While the government claims to have killed 145 terrorists and restored order, such large-scale attacks, which breach even high security zones such as the provincial capital and cause many casualties among security officials and civilians, are highly disturbing. The violence brought the province to a standstill. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has claimed responsibility for this massive terrorist attack, has also asked for people’s backing. The spectacle of a large number of terrorists launching such audacious and coordinated attacks across the province indicates the organisation is not without backing. There has been a sharp escalation in Baloch separatist violence over the past five years, with 2025, the deadliest year on record. According to the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, the province saw at least 254 attacks in 2025 (a 26 per cent increase from the previous year) resulting in more than 400 deaths. In recent times, the terrorists appear to have shifted from a hit-and-run strategy to one aimed at taking control of territory, though briefly. There have been incidents when dozens of heavily armed terrorists have stormed district headquarters and taken control of it before dispersing. Not only were the attacks targeted, according to reports, the terrorists also clashed with the security forces and blocked highways that connect Balochistan to other parts of Pakistan. The latest terrorist attacks in Balochistan undermine claims that the situation is under control. Last year, BLA terrorists carried out one of their most audacious attacks, hijacking the Jaffer Express, which was travelling from Quetta to KP. Over 300 passengers were rescued after an operation that lasted more than a day, during which 33 militants were killed. But despite the killing of so many terrorists by the security forces, there seems to be no cessation in the number of militant attacks. In fact, they have also increased in intensity. The latest terrorist attacks undermine the government’s claim that the situation is under control. It’s one of the most serious security challenges this country has faced in decades. The latest wave of terrorist violence in the strategically located region is a grim reminder of the resurgence of the menace with greater ferocity. What has made the situation worse is the state’s failure to win public support in its battle against the separatists. Considering that this region has long been the epicentre of political unrest, it is hardly surprising that it witnesses frequent attacks. Arguably, public discontent has increased over the years as Balochistan has still not been able to get its due political and economic rights. The civilian administration is non-existent in large parts of the province. Besides, the uptick in violence has also been evident following the controversial 2024 national elections. Thanks to electoral manipulation, there is a widespread perception that the government is unrepresentative and has thus failed to establish its authority. Those elections were criticised as marginalising even Baloch nationalists seeking democratic rights within the federal structure. Moreover, the increasing use of force to curb peaceful protests has inflamed the situation further, providing the terrorists an opportunity to recruit new members. A combination of factors, including the denial of democratic rights, poverty and excesses by the state have pushed many, particularly among the educated youth, towards terrorist groups, which have also recruited women in their ranks. Some of the major terrorist attacks have been carried out by Baloch women. The terrorist attack in Gwadar last week was reportedly led by a woman. The growing participation of women, mostly from educated middle class backgrounds, shows the widening influence of the terrorist groups. These groups, with the support of external forces, are now better trained and equipped with sophisticated weaponry, as was seen in the recent attacks. India has openly been supporting the Baloch separatist movement as a part of its ongoing hostilities against Pakistan. There is strong evidence of separatist leaders having close links with the Indian intelligence agencies. Regional geopolitics is another factor behind the escalation of such attacks. Afghanistan has long been a safe haven for Baloch terrorists. The return of Taliban rule and the escalating tension between Kabul and Islamabad have given even greater space to the terrorists to operate from. The terrorists have now acquired sophisticated weapons left behind by Nato forces as they exited Afghanistan in 2021. Some of the Baloch separatist factions are said to have made a tactical alliance with the banned TTP, which is being patronised by the Afghan Taliban regime. Moreover, a long porous border with Iran also provides a cross-border sanctuary for the insurgents in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province. A long coastal belt provides the militants a safe supply line. The areas along the sea and those bordering Iran have been the worst affected by terrorism. It is also the region where China is helping develop Gwadar, a key seaport on the Arabian Sea. The increased targeting of Chinese nationals working on various CPEC projects carries strong geopolitical implications. The BLA, which claimed the attacks, threatened intensified attacks on key Chinese interests unless China withdraw from the region. A mix of internal and external factors has complicated the Balochistan problem. But it is the growing political alienation of the Baloch people from the state that has made it harder to deal with the separatist insurgency. The country cannot confront the challenge without addressing the people’s grievances. A population that is deprived of its basic democratic and economic rights is estranged from the state.

Ties between Turkiye and Saudi Arabia have steadily recovered in recent years, with the countries cooperating on a range of diplomatic issues. This includes support for Gaza and backing Syria’s new government in the wake of the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in 2024. Erdogan met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh, Turkiye’s Comm­unications Director Burha­nettin Duran told Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu. Erdogan is accompanied by his wife, first lady Emine Erd­ogan, Foreign Minister Hak­an Fidan, Finance Minister Meh­met Simsek, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and other ministers. No further detail on the clos­ed-door meeting was provided. However, Anadolu has earlier reported that they would discuss the “deepening cooperation” between the countries, as well as regional and global developments. It added that Erdogan would then travel to Cairo on Wednesday. Following the meeting, Erdogan attended a closed-door dinner in his honour, hosted by the Saudi crown prince at the Yemame Palace. This is Erdogan’s first to the kingdom since July 2023, which was part of a Gulf trip aimed at drumming up investments. The visit comes days after two sources told AFP that Turkiye would not be joining a mutual defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan had said earlier this month that they had entered talks aimed at joining the alliance. ‘Balance thaw’ Experts like Umar Karim of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom warn that Turkiye will have to balance any thaw with Riyadh against relations with other regional rivals. “I think it’s in this visit that it will become clear what Turkiye can commit to Saudis in terms of this rivalry with UAE and in terms of the security threat from Israel,” Karim told AFP . Relations between Riyadh and Turkiye were enormously strained after Saudi agents murdered Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.

      "summary": "• Meets Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman as ties between ex-rival nations improve in last two years • State-run news agency reports Turkish president will travel to Egypt today RIYADH: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday, Saudi media said, his first visit to the kingdom in over two years as Saudi Arabia moves closer to its rival-turned-ally. Ties between Turkiye and Saudi Arabia have steadily recovered in recent years, with the countries cooperating on a range of diplomatic issues. This includes support for Gaza and backing Syria’s new government in the wake of the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in 2024. Erdogan met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh, Turkiye’s Comm­unications Director Burha­nettin Duran told Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu. Erdogan is accompanied by his wife, first lady Emine Erd­ogan, Foreign Minister Hak­an Fidan, Finance Minister Meh­met Simsek, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and other ministers. No further detail on the clos­ed-door meeting was provided. However, Anadolu has earlier reported that they would discuss the “deepening cooperation” between the countries, as well as regional and global developments. It added that Erdogan would then travel to Cairo on Wednesday. Following the meeting, Erdogan attended a closed-door dinner in his honour, hosted by the Saudi crown prince at the Yemame Palace. This is Erdogan’s first to the kingdom since July 2023, which was part of a Gulf trip aimed at drumming up investments. The visit comes days after two sources told AFP that Turkiye would not be joining a mutual defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan had said earlier this month that they had entered talks aimed at joining the alliance. ‘Balance thaw’ Experts like Umar Karim of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom warn that Turkiye will have to balance any thaw with Riyadh against relations with other regional rivals. “I think it’s in this visit that it will become clear what Turkiye can commit to Saudis in terms of this rivalry with UAE and in terms of the security threat from Israel,” Karim told AFP . Relations between Riyadh and Turkiye were enormously strained after Saudi agents murdered Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.

      "summary_orig": "In 1993, a rising star kicked off a legendary Bollywood career with back-to-back megahits in Darr and Baazigar , where he introduced audiences to the concept of the ‘anti-hero’. Thirty-three years later, it led to Bangladesh being expelled from a World Cup. If this paragraph makes no sense to you, there are some crucial details that need to be unpacked to make this connection clear. But at the heart of this story is one disturbing new reality — international cricket today has become a tool of India’s ruling Hindutva regime. From Mustafizur’s ouster to Bangladesh’s expulsion Let’s begin with the basic details. On January 2, a member of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Sangeet Som, attacked India’s most popular Muslim figure , Shahrukh Khan, calling him a traitor. Shahrukh owns the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), a cricket franchise of the Indian Premier League that had selected Bangladesh cricketer Mustafizur Rahman. Threatening Mustafizur with “dire consequences” and claiming Shahrukh had “no right to live” in India, Som’s calls led to a chorus of hatred against Shahrukh and Mustafizur. Within days, the Indian cricket board, the BCCI “requested” KKR to release the player, vaguely citing “recent developments going on all across”. Almost immediately, Bangladesh’s Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul reacted , ordering the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to ask the game’s governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), to change the venue of their matches in the upcoming T20 World Cup from India to co-host Sri Lanka. Nazrul noted that “if a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India … then the entire Bangladesh team cannot feel safe travelling to India for the World Cup.” After several rounds of negotiations between the BCB and the ICC, the latter responded firmly, rejecting Bangladesh’s request and stating that doing so “could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body”. The apex body kicked Bangladesh out of the tournament and replaced them with Scotland. In response to that, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi vocally opposed the decision, decrying the ICC’s “double standards.” A few days later, the Government of Pakistan instructed its team to boycott its World Cup game against India. ‘Ocean of vagueness’ So how is all of this related to India’s ruling Hindutva regime? For starters, Sangeet Som’s allegations and threats against Shahrukh and Mustafizur were part of the BJP’s standard dog-whistle, anti-Muslim tactics. These particular ones came as part of campaigning for the West Bengal state elections, where KKR play and where the BJP has called for the expulsion of local Muslims by claiming they are Bangladeshi refugees, amongst other bigoted claims. This has not been the first time that Shahrukh Khan in particular has come under the religiofascist BJP’s crosshairs . His decades-long megastardom has meant that the BJP has repeatedly sought to target him as the most iconic Muslim figure in Indian society. What was unprecedented however was when the BCCI stepped in and ‘requested’ KKR to remove the player. Journalists in both India and Bangladesh noted that there were no indications of any internal discussion or debate within the BCCI before the decision was taken. According to a report in The Indian Express , the decision was taken at the highest level in the board, with neither board members nor the league’s governing council involved. An unnamed BCCI official told the paper that “we ourselves got to know about this through the media. There was no discussion. No suggestion was taken from our side.” The BCCI’s request to KKR was also deliberately vague, avoiding any specifics of the toxic demands that led to the situation, which later allowed the ICC to reject BCB’s claims of security concerns. According to veteran Indian cricket journalist Sharda Ugra, this “ocean of vagueness” is a deliberate feature of the Indian board’s recent actions. She noted that despite her best efforts, she never managed to get any formal response on which officials ordered the Indian team to refuse shaking hands with their Pakistani counterparts in the Asia Cup 2025. Similarly, when the Indian team refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy last year, Ugra said that “there [was] no specific instruction from anyone, no clear cut statement saying … that we have been instructed by the external affairs ministry or the home ministry or the foreign ministry or the prime minister’s office — nothing.” The same process seems to have been followed in Mustafizur’s case. As Ugra noted, “There is no evidence of any paperwork, [or] procedure … there’s no document that says … this guy cannot have a contract [or] he’s in danger. No official government warnings. It is just whisperings. That’s all that it seems to have come from.” The question of revenue But if the BCCI is compromised by India’s ruling party, then the ICC is no different. It is currently run by Jay Shah, the son of Amit Shah, India’s Home Minister and the second-most important figure in the ruling regime after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As such, its announcement expelling Bangladesh came to be seen as particularly hypocritical, given it had happily conceded to demands to move venues from India for the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. As journalist Taha Hashim wrote in The Guardian , the ICC’s claim about protecting the “sanctity of future … events is a particularly tragicomic line [given that their] Champions Trophy decision did ‘set a precedent’, forming a hybrid model that has already turned ICC tournaments into a joke.” PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi was the only dissenting voice from other cricket boards, terming the ICC’s actions regarding Bangladesh “double standards” and an “injustice” to the South Asian team, as well as promising action in solidarity. But while it does appear that the fallout with Bangladesh might give Naqvi and the PCB another ally, senior Bangladeshi cricket journalist Mohammad Isam is cautious about such a possibility. Noting the political reality of Bangladesh being surrounded by India on three sides as well as the longstanding cultural links with Bangla-speakers across the border, he said that the options for Bangladeshi cricket were more limited. He pointed out that the current standoff was driven directly by the sports ministry and a government that is about to go into elections in February. According to Isam, the expectation amongst observers after Mustafizur’s removal was a diplomatic approach from the board. “[We heard] that the BCB was planning to give a statement that was going to be middle of the ground … because while for this Bangladesh government [opposing] India can be something, but for the cricket board, Indian cricket is the end all. The BCB can’t really afford to fight the BCCI, as one tour from India pays the bills for several years.” Similarly, he mentioned that several voices within Bangladeshi cricket felt that the government’s response had put the ball in India’s court and restricted the BCB’s ability to negotiate a way out. This fear of lost revenue is the stick that allows India its undue sway over world cricket. While the PCB and Pakistan cricket have spent almost two decades adjusting to and living with a de facto ban from Indian cricket and its riches, none of the smaller boards have the resources or the clout for such a fight. Crucially, the most economically and politically powerful boards have also shown a complete sense of apathy on this matter. Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University, wrote in a blog post that “the Mustafizur moment will not be the last time a player is sacrificed at the altar of majoritarian politics … The machinery is now in place, tested and proven effective. And no one — not the ICC, not the boards of other cricket nations, not the global media — has demonstrated the will to stop it.” When asked over an email what would need to happen to resist this tide, he speculated that it “would happen when countries like England and Australia are targeted. That could lead to some kind of a pushback but even then, those boards may decide to lump the humiliation and keep placating the BCCI for the moolah.” India’s grip on international cricket finances, governance Sharda Ugra was similarly unmoved by the potential of any opposition from within the ICC or the two most powerful boards after India. “I’ve been following cricket for 30 years,” she said, adding that “I’ve never seen [the ICC] look this bad — they are an unserious organisation. [And] the Australian and English cricket boards are no more than the sidekicks of the big don in our game. There is no capable, mature leadership in the ICC anymore.” That much maligned ICC leadership appeared to be scrambling in the wake of Pakistan’s decision to solely boycott the game against India — the biggest revenue generator in every tournament. In a statement released before they had even formally been notified of the decision by the PCB itself, the ICC made clear that “it expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution”, a much more conciliatory tone than the outright rejection of the BCB’s demands. Clearly, with a huge financial bite to face, the ICC’s priorities have been put to test. The decisions by Bangladesh and Pakistan have been the first time in a long time that the sport has had to address someone else’s concerns other than India’s. India’s vice-like grip over both international cricket’s finances as well as its governance has meant that the entire sport has become increasingly beholden to it. And in turn, the Hindutva movement and the BJP’s control over Indian institutions has meant that as Ugra puts it, the BCCI’s actions are now “addressing voting constituencies rather than cricket fans.” It has meant that the fallout from campaigning in a local state election in India can lead to massive implications for foreign countries and players, potentially crippling the future of the sport. As one Indian observer posted on social media platform X , “this is what happens if you decide to torch your … one genuine soft power currency to please a few. You can draw a straight line from the Mustafizur decision to [the Pakistan government’s] decision.” Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any quick solution. Writing after the news of Pakistan’s boycott, Sushant Singh said, “[The sport’s] final wicket will fall not to a rival bowler, but to a lawsuit from a broadcaster or the collapse of a commercial deal, leaving the game bankrupt in every sense — financially, morally, and culturally… The only way back is … through accountability.” Till then, the reality of the sport is that the flap of a butterfly’s wings in local Indian politics can cause a typhoon in another country’s cricketing fortunes.",

The decisions by Bangladesh and Pakistan have been the first time in a long time that the sport has had to address someone else’s concerns other than India’s. India’s vice-like grip over both international cricket’s finances as well as its governance has meant that the entire sport has become increasingly beholden to it. And in turn, the Hindutva movement and the BJP’s control over Indian institutions has meant that as Ugra puts it, the BCCI’s actions are now “addressing voting constituencies rather than cricket fans.” It has meant that the fallout from campaigning in a local state election in India can lead to massive implications for foreign countries and players, potentially crippling the future of the sport. As one Indian observer posted on social media platform X , “this is what happens if you decide to torch your … one genuine soft power currency to please a few. You can draw a straight line from the Mustafizur decision to [the Pakistan government’s] decision.” Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any quick solution. Writing after the news of Pakistan’s boycott, Sushant Singh said, “[The sport’s] final wicket will fall not to a rival bowler, but to a lawsuit from a broadcaster or the collapse of a commercial deal, leaving the game bankrupt in every sense — financially, morally, and culturally… The only way back is … through accountability.” Till then, the reality of the sport is that the flap of a butterfly’s wings in local Indian politics can cause a typhoon in another country’s cricketing fortunes.",

On Tuesday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office also confirmed that it had been invited to participate in the Iran-US talks aimed at de-escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington. According to earlier reports, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi were supposed to meet in Istanbul on Friday in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran’s nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war. The Reuters news agency, however, reported on Tuesday night that instead of Istanbul, Iranian officials are asking that the talks be held in Oman instead, and that the scope be narrowed to two-way talks on nuclear issues only. This latest uncertainty followed reports of escalatory moves in the Persian Gulf, where a US warplane shot down an alleged Iranian drone that was said to be approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. Earlier, a US-flagged tanker was approached and challenged by Iranian gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz, before continuing on its way, the British maritime security firm Vanguard Tech said. However, the White House reiterated that the proposed talks were still on, despite these hiccups. “I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks as of right now are still scheduled,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that they were due to happen “later this week.” Hectic diplomacy Iran’s president confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of talks with the US, provided they were free of threats, after his counterpart Donald Trump suggested “bad things” would happen without a deal. “I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X. He added that the talks followed requests “from friendly governments”. On Tuesday, Qatar’s foreign ministry said diplomacy with Iran was “continuing very intensively”, in “tandem with all our neighbours”. Earlier, a senior official from the UAE said Iran needed to reach a deal and “rebuild their relationship with the United States”. “I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don’t have these issues every other day,” said presidential adviser Anwar Gargash. Iran has repeatedly stressed that any talks should remain focused solely on the nuclear issue, rejecting the possibility of negotiations over its missile programme or defence capabilities. When asked about the upcoming talks, an Iranian diplomatic source told Reuters they were “neither optimistic nor pessimistic”, adding that Tehran would not negotiate over its defensive capabilities. Pakistan’s role “Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query on Tuesday. “Pakistan’s participation is seen as crucial to defusing tensions, as Islamabad has been quietly working to facilitate the talks,” a diplomatic source told Dawn. The diplomatic source added that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected to participate in the meeting. The priority of the talks is to avoid any conflict and de-escalate tensions between the two sides, a regional official told Reuters , adding that some regional powers were also invited. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the countries invited to the talks at the foreign ministers’ level included Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The person said the format of the meetings remained unclear, but that the “main meeting” would be on Friday. Last-minute change? According to Reuters , a regional diplomat said that Tehran wants to change the format of the talks. “They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans while the U.S. wants to include the ballistic missiles and the activities of Iran’s proxies in the region.” A source said that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.

      "summary_orig": "The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, it said. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” and was shot down by an American F-35 fighter jet, it said. “An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defence and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,” said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson at the US military’s Central Command. No American service members were harmed during the incident and no US equipment was damaged, he added. The incident came as diplomats sought to arrange nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, and US President Donald Trump warned that with US warships heading toward Iran, “ bad things ” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached. The Lincoln carrier strike group is the most visible part of a US military buildup in the Middle East following a crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month. Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded that Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was “seriously talking,” while Tehran’s top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were under way. Central Command said that in another incident today, hours later in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged and crewed merchant vessel. “Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” Hawkins said. Meanwhile, the White House said talks between US and Iranian officials were “still scheduled” this week after the drone was shot down. US envoy Steve Witkoff “is set to have conversations with the Iranians later this week; those are still scheduled as of right now”, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News .",

      "summary_orig": "Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism. Jian made these remarks during a regular press briefing when he was asked to comment on a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan last week. Jian said that China strongly condemned the attacks. “We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said. “China firmly opposes any form of terrorism and will, as always, firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism, maintaining solidarity and social stability, and protecting the safety of the people,” he added. On Monday, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan had also condemned the “recent multiple terrorist activities in Balochistan”. In a post on X, the embassy said “we […] deeply mourn for the lives lost, and extend sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured”. Apart from China, the US , European Union, Iran and several other countries have also condemned the attacks. As many as 92 terrorists were killed on Saturday as security forces repulsed coordinated attacks by members of banned organisations in parts of the provincial capital and around a dozen other cities and towns across Balochistan, the military’s media wing said. In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 15 security personnel were martyred while repulsing the attacks, while 18 civilians also lost their lives. It said that terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. According to reports, the assailants targeted police stations in Quetta’s Sariab area, torched records and killed officers who resisted the attacks. They also raided banks in the Hazarganji area and opened indiscriminate fire before dispersing into different localities of Sariab. In Kharan, armed men attacked the residence of the Mullazai Qaumi Etihad chairman, killing him and his six security guards. Senior police officer Abdul Baqi said the attackers fled the area after the assault. In the Tump area of Kech district, armed men shot dead former tehsildar Abid after he resisted an attempted kidnapping. Sources said armed men also attacked Mastung, burning the police station and breaking into the district jail, freeing 30 prisoners. They also targeted banks and government institutions. Similar attacks occurred in Kalat, where terrorists attacked banks and police stations, injuring three police personnel and setting banks ablaze. Government offices were also attacked. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had held India responsible for the attacks. Speaking on Saturday night, he said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and strategising.",
