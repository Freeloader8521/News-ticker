      "title_orig": "Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, dies at 80 after prolonged illness",
      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday. Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said. “The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the Fajr prayer,” the party said in a statement. “We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added. Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year. Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner. But in late November, she was rushed to hospital , where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues. During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus called for the nation to pray for Zia, calling her a “source of utmost inspiration for the nation”. BNP’s media chief Moudud Alamgir Pavel also confirmed Zia’s death to AFP . Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment. She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power. There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough. Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters. Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority. ‘Battling begums’ Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981. Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of “liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness”. She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990. But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed “the battling begums”. Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals. Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades. In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami. In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, who was elected three years earlier. Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free. She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win. Her second term was marred by the rise of militants and allegations of corruption. In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. Khaleda’s government and its allies were widely blamed. In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh’s highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated. Detention and freedom Although Khaleda later clamped down on radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence. The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008. Khaleda never regained power. With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics. Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods. In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister — charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics. She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated. Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina’s ouster. In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.",

      "summary_orig": "• Environment ministry okays ‘run-of-the-river’ Dulhasti Stage II, to be built in held Kashmir • Indian govt forging ahead with several hydel projects in Indus basin after unilaterally suspending treaty • Water weaponisation in climate change-prone region ‘neither sane nor acceptable’, warns Sherry Rehman NEW DELHI / ISLAMABAD: India’s Ministry of Environment has been pondering clearances for a slew of controversial hydroelectric projects on the Chenab River in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident earlier this year. Yet, it does not seem to share serious apprehensions that leading environmentalists have expressed over their threat to a fragile Himalayan ecology. Last week, a panel under the ministry approved the 260-megawatt Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Kishtwar district of India-held Jammu and Kashmir, according to The Hindu . Earlier, in October, it was reported that environmental clearances were revived for the larger Sawalkote hydro-electric project on the same river. The clearances came against the backdrop of India unilaterally suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after blaming Pakistan over the Pahalgam incident — an allegation Islamabad had denied, terming the suspension of the 1960 treaty “an act of war”. Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab. At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty. The projects The Sawalkote project has been in the works for decades, and has faced numerous delays related to forest clearances and the compliance compulsions of the Indus Waters Treaty. As of now, the 1,856MW project is still said to be in the pre-construction stage. Its environment clearances have been reheated several times over. The Dulhasti Stage II is a 258MW project, conceived as a complementary run-of-the-river scheme to utilise the water discharged from the existing 390MW Dulhasti Power Station “more efficiently”. It is a smaller component of the frequently discussed Chenab basin projects. It is expected to cost around $35 million. According to The Hindu, “With the treaty now in abeyance, the centre is pushing ahead with several hydroelectric projects in the Indus basin, such as Sawalkote, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai I and II.” The total land requirement for the project is estimated at 60.3 hectares. This project will require 8.27 hectares of private land from two villages, Benzwar and Palmar, in Kishtwar district, The Hindu reported. Environmental concerns The question environmentalists are posing focuses greatly on a primary concern related to climate change. Water bodies are drying up rapidly. Chenab forms at the confluence of Chandra and Bhaga rivers in Lahaul and Spiti, Himachal Pradesh. According to the Indus Waters Treaty, Chenab is a Western River, allocated to Pakistan. India is permitted limited consumption use and unlimited non-consumption use of Chenab. From the treaty’s signing up to the year 2004-05, studies estimate that glacial volume in the Chenab basin has reduced by a whopping 33.3pc. This is what the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People NGO says: “For a river whose flows are made up of 50% meltwater when it leaves India at Akhnoor, this is shocking for both India and Pakistan”. “Glaciers, the water stored in them, the slow release of this water in spring and summers is the key to water security of the entire Himalayan region. Sixty per cent irrigation in the entire Indus basin depends on glacial melt. As the glaciers are concentrated in the Indian Himalayas, their health and sustenance is crucial for millions in both countries.” In the Hindu mythology, the River Saraswati, which is said to have made up a troika with the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, disappeared in ancient times. In the real world, many more rivers and water bodies face a similar fate. Chenab is among them. Sherry expresses alarm While there was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, former climate change minister Senator Sherry Rehman protested against this weaponisation of water, saying that it was “neither sane nor acceptable”. In a post on X, the PPP leader wrote, “In flagrant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India has just given approval to the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K). “As per the IWT, which cannot be unilaterally revoked, as recent UN rapporteurs have confirmed, Pakistan has control over the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers fall under India’s control,” she said. “Following the illegal suspension of the treaty, India has decided to fast-track several disputed hydroelectric projects in the Indus Basin. These projects include Sawalkot, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai-1 and 2. Dulhasti Stage-II is considered part of this strategy,” she said. “This weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the frontlines of climate change and environmental stress. It will inflame tensions in a bilateral relationship already bristling with hostility and distrust,” she said. Published in Dawn, December 30th, 2025",

In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty. The projects The Sawalkote project has been in the works for decades, and has faced numerous delays related to forest clearances and the compliance compulsions of the Indus Waters Treaty. As of now, the 1,856MW project is still said to be in the pre-construction stage. Its environment clearances have been reheated several times over. The Dulhasti Stage II is a 258MW project, conceived as a complementary run-of-the-river scheme to utilise the water discharged from the existing 390MW Dulhasti Power Station “more efficiently”. It is a smaller component of the frequently discussed Chenab basin projects. It is expected to cost around $35 million. According to The Hindu, “With the treaty now in abeyance, the centre is pushing ahead with several hydroelectric projects in the Indus basin, such as Sawalkote, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai I and II.” The total land requirement for the project is estimated at 60.3 hectares. This project will require 8.27 hectares of private land from two villages, Benzwar and Palmar, in Kishtwar district, The Hindu reported. Environmental concerns The question environmentalists are posing focuses greatly on a primary concern related to climate change. Water bodies are drying up rapidly. Chenab forms at the confluence of Chandra and Bhaga rivers in Lahaul and Spiti, Himachal Pradesh. According to the Indus Waters Treaty, Chenab is a Western River, allocated to Pakistan. India is permitted limited consumption use and unlimited non-consumption use of Chenab. From the treaty’s signing up to the year 2004-05, studies estimate that glacial volume in the Chenab basin has reduced by a whopping 33.3pc. This is what the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People NGO says: “For a river whose flows are made up of 50% meltwater when it leaves India at Akhnoor, this is shocking for both India and Pakistan”. “Glaciers, the water stored in them, the slow release of this water in spring and summers is the key to water security of the entire Himalayan region. Sixty per cent irrigation in the entire Indus basin depends on glacial melt. As the glaciers are concentrated in the Indian Himalayas, their health and sustenance is crucial for millions in both countries.” In the Hindu mythology, the River Saraswati, which is said to have made up a troika with the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, disappeared in ancient times. In the real world, many more rivers and water bodies face a similar fate. Chenab is among them. Sherry expresses alarm While there was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, former climate change minister Senator Sherry Rehman protested against this weaponisation of water, saying that it was “neither sane nor acceptable”. In a post on X, the PPP leader wrote, “In flagrant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India has just given approval to the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K). “As per the IWT, which cannot be unilaterally revoked, as recent UN rapporteurs have confirmed, Pakistan has control over the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers fall under India’s control,” she said. “Following the illegal suspension of the treaty, India has decided to fast-track several disputed hydroelectric projects in the Indus Basin. These projects include Sawalkot, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai-1 and 2. Dulhasti Stage-II is considered part of this strategy,” she said. “This weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the frontlines of climate change and environmental stress. It will inflame tensions in a bilateral relationship already bristling with hostility and distrust,” she said. Published in Dawn, December 30th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence on Monday to hold crucial talks on Gaza and Iran. The US president will push the Israeli leader to move to the next stage of his fragile Gaza truce plan. Netanyahu is also expected to try to shift some focus onto Iran, amid reports he will call for more US strikes on the Islamic republic’s nuclear program. The meeting, the fifth between the two leaders to be held in the United States this year, comes as some White House officials fear both Israel and Hamas are slow-walking the second phase of their ceasefire. Trump, who said Netanyahu had asked for the talks, is reportedly keen to announce as soon as January a Palestinian technocratic government for Gaza, and the deployment of an international stabilisation force. Netanyahu’s office said he met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in Florida ahead of his talks with Trump, which are scheduled for 1pm (1800 GMT). Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian said Netanyahu would discuss ensuring that “Hamas is disarmed, Gaza is demilitarized” in the second phase of the agreement. He will also bring up the “danger Iran poses not only to the region of the Middle East, but the United States as well,” Bedrosian said. Hamas’s armed wing, however, reiterated on Monday that it would not surrender its weapons - one of the key sticking points in the talks. “Our people are defending themselves and will not give up their weapons as long as the occupation remains,” the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said in a video message. It also confirmed the death of their longtime spokesperson, Abu Obeida, months after Israel announced he had been killed in an air strike in Gaza on August 30. ‘Phase two has to begin’ Netanyahu’s visit caps a frantic few days of international diplomacy in Palm Beach, where Trump hosted Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday for talks on ending Russia’s invasion. The Gaza ceasefire in October is one of the major achievements of Trump’s first year back in power, but his administration and regional mediators want to keep up the momentum. The first phase of the truce deal stipulated that Hamas release the remaining hostages, both dead and alive, taken during its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The group has so far returned all the living captives and the remains of all but one. Under the second stage, Israel is supposed to withdraw from its positions in Gaza, while Hamas is supposed to lay down its weapons. An interim authority is meanwhile meant to govern the Palestinian territory, and the international stabilization force (ISF) is to be deployed. Both sides, however, have alleged frequent ceasefire violations. ‘Frustrated with Netanyahu’ The Axios news outlet reported on Friday that Trump wanted to convene the first meeting of a new Gaza “Board of Peace” that he will chair at the Davos forum in Switzerland in January. But it said that senior White House officials were growing exasperated with what they viewed as efforts by Netanyahu to stall the peace process. “There are more and more signs that the American administration is getting frustrated with Netanyahu,” said Yossi Mekelberg, a Middle East expert at London-based think tank Chatham House. The Israeli and US administrations are increasingly at odds on many key issues, including Israel’s continued strikes on Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and in Syria. On Iran, Israeli officials and media have expressed concern in recent months that Iran is rebuilding its ballistic missile arsenal after it came under attack during the 12-day war with Israel in June. But Sina Toossi, a researcher at the Center for International Policy (CIP) in Washington, said Trump’s insistence that US strikes in June destroyed Tehran’s nuclear program had “removed Israel’s most powerful historical justification for US support for war with Iran.” Netanyahu’s new focus on Iran’s missiles is “an effort to manufacture a replacement casus belli,” Toossi told AFP. Iran on Monday denounced the reports as a “psychological operation” against Tehran, emphasizing it was fully prepared to defend itself, and warning renewed aggression would “result in harsher consequences” for Israel.",

Earlier this month, the body of a three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal was recovered on December 1, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported. Following the tragedy, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials. The incident also prompted the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to increase the budget of 246 union committees (UCs) to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights. The latest victim, identified as Dilbar, was playing outside his residence with other area children when the tragedy occurred, Korangi Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Fida Husain Janwari told Dawn . The child’s relatives rushed to the spot, but were unable to save him. By the time the body was recovered, the child had died. SSP Janwari, along with other officials, later visited the spot where the accident happened and met the bereaved family. The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities. According to data released by the Edhi Foundation, 27 people died in Karachi in 2025 after falling into open manholes and nullahs. In Karachi, responsibilities for drains, roads, footpaths, sewerage, water supply and public safety are divided among the KMC, 25 town municipal corporations, around 250 union committees, the KDA, the water and sewerage corporation, cantonment boards, the Sindh government and private utilities. The city is run by a patchwork of authorities that rarely coordinate, and often contradict one another.",

      "summary_orig": "A Bangladeshi youth-driven party born out of the country’s 2024 uprising is facing an open revolt from within after sealing an election alliance with a religio-political group, a move analysts say could jeopardise its future and reinforce established parties. At least 30 senior leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) have openly opposed its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, announced on Sunday, with several resigning in protest. The Muslim-majority South Asian nation goes to the polls on February 12 . Before the deal, opinion polls had predicted Jamaat finishing a close second behind the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while the NCP lagged far behind in third place. “The NCP presented itself as a youth-driven alternative to traditional power structures. That identity is now under serious strain,” said H.M. Nazmul Alam, an academic. “Youth-based movements do not collapse only because they lose elections. They collapse when they lose clarity and internal unity.” ‘Alliance for greater unity’ The NCP was formed earlier this year by leaders of the protests that ousted long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, forcing her to flee to India. Driven by Gen-Z activists born after the late 1990s, it says it aims to free the nation from decades of nepotism and the dominance of Hasina’s Awami League and the BNP. With the Awami League banned, the vote will be effectively a direct contest between the BNP and Jamaat, which has trailed the other two in the past and had not been allowed to contest any elections since 2013 after a court said its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh’s secular constitution. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus revoked all the restrictions on Jamaat in August 2024. The NCP’s struggle shows the challenges of turning street power into votes and holds lessons for neighbouring Nepal, where similar youth-led protests ousted the government this year and fresh elections are due in March, political analysts have said. NCP chief Nahid Islam told a press conference late on Sunday that the recent killing of 32-year-old Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the uprising, forced his party to seek an alliance to keep at bay forces trying to derail the election through violence. “The dictatorship we overthrew is attempting to sabotage the election. Therefore, for the sake of greater unity, we have reached an electoral understanding with Jamaat, said Nahid, 27. “This was a majority decision within the party, but some may be opposed to it and they are free to take their own decisions.” Hadi was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier in December while launching his election campaign as an independent candidate. Police say they have identified the killers but have not apprehended them. ‘Your centrist idea and ideology will vanish’ Nahid earlier told Reuters his organisation was weak because it had not had enough time to build itself. It was also hampered by scarce funds and an unclear stance on key issues such as rights for women and minorities, Reuters reported in early December, citing party leaders who said alliance talks had been underway for some time. One senior NCP leader to have resigned is Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the party. She is now seeking the support of nearly 5,000 voters to be allowed to contest as an independent. “I promised you and the people of this country that I would fight for you and for building a new political culture,” she said on Facebook. “Whatever the circumstances, I am determined to keep that promise.” Political analyst Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, said the NCP was “doomed”. “If you go with Jamaat, it will help Jamaat, not you,” he said. “It will give them a liberal cover, and in return, you will become a force for the right. Your centrist idea and ideology - already poorly defined - will simply vanish.”",

      "summary_orig": "A major-ranked officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‘s Bajaur district, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday. The military identified the martyred officer as 36-year-old Major Adeel Zaman from Dera Ismail Khan. During the operation, security forces also killed five terrorists, added ISPR. On December 29, “security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in general area Khar, Bajaur district, on reported presence of Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij ,” it said. Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of operation, due to effective engagement by own troops five Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,“ said the statement. “However, during the intense fire exchange, Major Adeel Zaman (age: 36 years, resident of Dera Ismail Khan District), a brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, having fought gallantly, rendered the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat.” The statement further said that security forces recovered weapons and ammunition from the terrorists, who remained “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies as well as killing of innocent civilians”. Following the operation, security forces conducted a sanitisation operation to eliminate other terrorists in the area. “Relentless Counter-Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” added the statement. Funeral prayers offered The funeral prayers of Major Adeel were offered at Peshawar Garrison later in the evening. Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, commander Peshawar Corps and other senior military and civil officers were in attendance. Paying rich tribute to the officer’s sacrifice, Field Marshal Munir highlighted that the “martyrs of Pakistan Army are the pride of the nation and their sacrifices will forever be remembered,” said a statement by the military’s media wing. Senior military and civil leadership at the funeral prayers of martyred Major Adeel. —ISPR “He prayed for the elevation of the Shaheed’s ranks in Jannah and for patience and strength for the family.” “Major Adeel Zaman Shaheed laid down his life in the line of duty while leading from the front. Pakistan Armed Forces remain resolute in their commitment to eliminate the menace of terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices further strengthen the nation’s resolve,” added the statement. The martyred officer will be laid to rest at his native town in Dera Ismail Khan. Last month, at least 22 terrorists were killed and several were injured in Bajaur district during a successful counter-insurgency operation carried out by security forces. The IBO in Bajaur’s village of Gadar was termed a “major success” by the security sources in a statement and was carried out “based on highly classified information”. Last year, the federal government, in a meeting comprising top civilian and military leaders, announced a comprehensive, nationwide anti-militant operation codenamed ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ to mitigate a rise in attacks on security forces by militant groups.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider expressed hope on Monday that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka will start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during Sheikh Hasina’s rule. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly, with Professor Muhammad Yunus leading the interim administration in Dhaka. “During the meeting, both sides discussed ways to expand cooperation in trade, investment, and aviation, as well as scaling up cultural, educational, and medical exchanges to further strengthen bilateral relations between the two South Asian nations,” said a statement shared on X by Bangladesh’s interim leader. Haider, during the meeting, also noted that bilateral trade has recorded a 20 per cent growth compared to last year, with business communities from both countries actively exploring new investment opportunities. The high commissioner further highlighted a “significant increase” in cultural exchanges, adding that “Bangladeshi students have shown strong interest in higher education opportunities in Pakistan, particularly in medical sciences, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence”. “Pakistan has witnessed a rise in patients travelling to its leading hospitals for liver and kidney transplants,” said Islamabad’s envoy. According to the statement, the high commissioner also stated that Pakistan was ready to offer “training and academic opportunities in transplantation-related medical fields”. The statement added that Bangladesh’s interim leader welcomed the “growing interactions between the two countries” and emphasised the “importance of increased visits, as well as cultural, educational, and people-to-people exchanges among SAARC member states.” “Professor Yunus also underscored the need to further boost Bangladesh–Pakistan trade,” added the statement. Yunus also expressed hope that during the current high commissioner’s tenure, both countries would “explore new avenues for investment and joint venture businesses“. In August, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also met with Professor Yunus. During his landmark visit to Dhaka, both countries stressed the need to revitalise regional cooperation through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc). The Foreign Office (FO) termed Dar’s two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations. Paki­stan and Bangladesh had agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side a month before, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter addressed to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday, expressed “deep concern” at the treatment meted out to him during his three-day Lahore visit , stating it was marked by “discourtesy and unnecessary hostility”. In a two-page letter, posted on X by the KP government, the Afridi recorded his formal objection to the Punjab government’s conduct, and said, “I write to you with deep concern and strong exception to the manner in which my recent visit to the Province of Punjab was handled, and the events that deliberately unfolded during and after the visit.” He recalled that the “sequence of actions witnessed was neither accidental nor administrative in nature. “It reflects conduct that is wholly incompatible with the dignity of constitutional office and the spirit of inter-provincial respect,” he said. CM Afridi told the Punjab CM that he undertook the visit in his capacity as the chief minister. “Regrettably, the treatment accorded to me was marked by discourtesy, unnecessary hostility, and protocol deviations that cannot be justified under any accepted standard of inter-provincial engagement,” he said. Afridi maintained that the Punjab government’s adoption of an extraordinary and excessive security posture — including sweeping detentions and visible enforcement theatrics — was “a message of intimidation rather than cooperation”. He complained that “such measures were neither proportionate nor warranted and conveyed an intent that went well beyond legitimate security considerations”. The KP chief minister further recalled that “even public places, including food streets and markets, were completely sealed, and whole blackouts were affected, venues denied, paining the common citizens of Lahore at this expense”. “Free access, as provided for in the Constitution, was even denied at Motorway rest areas,” added the letter. The KP CM also took note of the “coordinated and malicious social media campaign that accompanied and followed“ his visit. “Serious insinuations- specifically linking with narcotics were injected into public discourse,” Afridi said. “These allegations were amplified through accounts widely perceived to be aligned with, or operating under the umbrella of, the Government of Punjab,” he alleged. He continued: “Let me state this clearly: the use of state-linked digital platforms to circulate or amplify defamatory insinuations against a sitting Chief Minister of another province is unacceptable, irresponsible, and institutionally indefensible.” “Allegations of such gravity cannot be floated through innuendo or suggestion; they require evidence, jurisdiction, and lawful process,” he told the Punjab CM. “Anything short of that constitutes character assassination,” he added. KP CM was of the view that, “taken together — protocol degradation, excessive policing optics, and synchronised digital vilification — the pattern is too consistent to be dismissed as coincidental”. He alleged that the series of events suggested “planning and intent, aimed at humiliation rather than engagement”. CM Afridi maintained that “such actions undermine federal harmony, erode public trust in provincial institutions, and [set] a dangerous precedent where constitutional officeholders are targeted through insinuation rather than addressed through formal channels.” He termed the conduct “beneath the status of a provincial government“, and stressed that it damaged the ”collective credibility of federating units.“ As he concluded his letter to Maryam, the chief minister stated: “I place on record my strong protest and rejection of the treatment meted out to me and of the defamatory narratives propagated during this episode.” “I expect that your government will ensure that such conduct — administrative as well as digital — is neither repeated nor normalised, and that accountability is enforced where required,” he said. Punjab govt‘s conduct ‘undemocratic and reprehensible’ Separately, the KP CM also condemned the treatment meted out to him by the Punjab government during a cabinet meeting today, calling it “undemocratic, reprehensible and contrary to national unity”. The chief minister condemned the treatment and said, “The way me and my cabinet members were treated, the whole world witnessed it“. “When the country is going through political and economic instability, such an attitude — at a time when we need national unity — will only fan flames of hatred,“ the chief minister said. “Violence was perpetrated against cabinet members by the Punjab government, and roads were continuously blocked for a provincial chief minister, markets were forcibly shut down, even motorway rest areas were sealed, and turning off the lights during a visit to Mazar-e-Iqbal is extremely regrettable,” the minister was quoted as saying. He remarked that “such an attitude — reflecting Punjab government’s moral and intellectual depravity — was condemnable and alarming“. Afridi noted that the actions were “especially alarming given the instability in the country“ and warned that by continuing with such behaviour, “they were sowing hatred and division”. “We condemn the attitude in the strongest of words,” he said, adding that hateful attitudes were “detrimental to the country”. KP CM directed his government officials to be hospitable towards any officials or chief ministers visiting KP from other provinces in accordance with cultural traditions and norms. During the meeting, the chief minister also highlighted that the Centre had yet to release funds owed to the merged districts of KP under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP). “Work remains stalled in our merged districts because of it,” he said, adding that the Centre owed KP Rs4,758 billion. “It has been more than half a year, and we have not yet received the funds under AIP,” the chief minister said. “Even the amount that was already committed is not being given,” he added. Afridi was in Lahore to launch PTI’s street movement. He had arrived on Friday around 4:30pm, from where he made a beeline for the Punjab Assembly. However, the visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed. During his visit, he criticised the Punjab government for its rude behaviour toward him. “This shows their mean mentality, which cannot be approved in a civilised society,” he lambasted them and alleged that the “Punjab government is fanning hatred between the two provinces.“ Regretting the administration’s attitude on his arrival, he invited CM Maryam to visit KP, saying he would show her how democratic forces respect the office of a provincial chief executive. In a separate incident during his visit, when CM Afridi’s entourage reached Lahore’s Food Street for dinner, all restaurants were shut with the lights turned off, and even the general public was evicted.",

      "title_orig": "PTI founder Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi challenge Toshakhana 2 verdict in IHC",
      "summary_orig": "PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, on Monday filed separate appeals with the Islamabad High Court (IHC) challenging their conviction in the Toshakhana 2 case. A special court on December 20 sentenced Imran and Bushra to 17 years imprisonment in the case, which pertained to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. According to copies of the appeal available with Dawn , the couple’s lawyers contended that the sentencing was politically motivated, arguing, “The overarching objective of the present prosecution appears to be the continued incarceration of the appellant, thereby preventing his participation in national politics and curtailing his political role and influence.” Furthermore, it was noted that the case, initiated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), had been transferred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). “The learned trial court overlooked the methodology adopted by the Federal Investigation Agency in conducting the investigation. In the absence of settled law, precedent, or clear guidance on the subject, heightened care and caution were required in interpreting and applying the governing legal framework,” the appeal read. “Instead, both the investigating agency and the Trial Court proceeded in a cursory manner. This is evident from the absence of any FIR (first information report) on the record.” The appeals also noted that the FIA submitted a challan “within two days of the initiation of the investigation”, leaving inadequate time to conduct a fair and transparent probe. It was further noted that the Toshakhana 2 conviction was the fourth prosecution in the Toshakhana cases and constituted double jeopardy, “reflecting a repetitive and overlapping invocation of criminal process in respect of the same subject matter”. “NAB deliberately chose to bifurcate the prosecution by selectively proceeding in respect of one set of gifts while deferring or abandoning prosecution in respect of the others. Such a course of action is impermissible in law,” the appeals read, noting that Toshakahana 1 and 2 revolved around different gifts. “The bifurcation of what ought to have been a single, composite trial into multiple proceedings was undertaken with the ulterior motive of ensuring the continued incarceration of the present appellant,” the appeals argued. Moreover, the appeals stated that the conviction ignored the 2018 Toshakhana policy, with Clause I, mandating that all gifts received shall be duly reported and deposited with the Toshakhana. Clause VI “provides that gifts valued above Rs30,000 may be retained by the recipient upon payment of 50 per cent of the value exceeding the basic exemption of Rs30,000”. The appeals further argued that there was no violation of the Toshakhana policy, as the gifts were deposited and fees to retain the gifts were paid. It further noted that there are no criminal provisions or charges of criminal breach of trust or criminal misconduct envisaged in the policy, making the sentencing unlawful. “The learned trial judge misread and misapplied the relevant Toshakhana Policy/Rules governing retention of gifts,” the appeals read. “The prosecution wholly failed to establish the guilt of the appellant and his wife beyond [a] reasonable doubt; however, this fundamental deficiency was entirely overlooked by the learned Special Judge, Central, while recording the conviction.” Furthermore, the appeals contended that a criminal breach of trust requires the entrustment of property, dishonest misappropriation of such property for the accused’s own use, and in cases falling under Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by bank, merchant, or agent) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the accused must be a “public servant”; they contended that Imran and Bushra did not meet these requirements. “In the present case, the prosecution has failed to establish any of these foundational elements. There was no dishonest misappropriation or conversion, as the gifts were duly retained strictly in accordance with the Toshakhana Policy and Rules after payment of the requisite assessed amount,” the appeals read, arguing that Imran did not fall within the definition of a public servant as per Section 21 of the PPC. “The learned trial court, in paragraph 15 of the impugned judgment, has manifestly faltered in bringing the appellant within the ambit of the definition of a ‘public servant’ by relying upon the ninth description of Section 21 PPC, coupled with vague precedents from 1957 and 1961. This reflects a flawed, incorrect, and legally unsustainable approach,” Imran’s appeal read. Bushra’s appeal noted that she was “a housewife who has never held, occupied, or performed the functions of any public office”, meaning that the ruling was “ coram non judice , without lawful authority, and liable to be set aside in its entirety”. The appeals requested that the December 20 judgment be set aside and that Imran and Bushra be acquitted of the charges in the Toshakhana 2 case. Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year, in October, the two had denied all allegations in the case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday that the persecution of minorities in India was a matter of “deep concern” following incidents of vandalism reported in the neighbouring country ahead of Christmas. Last week, mobs armed with wooden sticks vandalised Christmas decorations at a shopping mall in central India, while right-wing groups disrupted school celebrations and burned holiday merchandise in the northeast, according to Indian media. The incidents occurred in the states of Chhattisgarh, Assam, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh ahead of the holiday. In a statement released on Monday, the FO said, “The persecution of minorities in India is a matter of deep concern. “Recent condemnable incidents of vandalism during Christmas, as well as state-sponsored campaigns targeting Muslims — including the demolition of their homes and repeated lynchings, notably the case of Muhammad Akhlaq, in which the state worked to shield the perpetrators from accountability — have deepened fear and alienation among Muslims,” it said. Akhlaq, a 50-year-old man was beaten to death in India in 2015, while his 22-year-old son was severely injured after it was rumoured that the family had been storing and consuming beef in India’s Uttar Pradesh. Last month, The Hindu reported that the Uttar Pradesh government was seeking to withdraw the case against the accused. Last week, Times of India reported that the government’s plea had been dismissed. In its statement, the FO said, “The list of such victims is sadly long. The international community should take note of these developments and take appropriate steps to help protect the fundamental rights of vulnerable communities in India.” Last week, The Indian Express reported that a mob stormed a mall and destroyed Christmas installations in the city of Raipur in Chhattisgarh state. View this post on Instagram The incident occurred on the same day the Sarva Hindu Samaj organisation called for a “bandh” — a general strike — to protest alleged religious conversions and recent clashes over the burial of a person from a converted family. “Around 80-90 people barged in,” an employee of the mall told The Indian Express , adding that the mob threatened and shouted at the staff, and “indulged in violence”. Separately, in the Nalbari district of Assam, The Hindu reported that members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad Bajrang Dal vandalised a school and disrupted Christmas preparations. The group has been classified as a militant religious organisation by the US Central Intelligence Agency. An unidentified police official told The Hindu that activists targeted St. Mary’s School in Panigaon village. “The activists entered the St Mary’s School of Panigaon village and vandalised the preparation of the Christmas Day programme,” the official said. “They burnt down the banner and posters of the celebration.”",

Father and son Sajid and Naveed Akram are accused of targeting a Hanukkah event on Sydney’s Bondi Beach on December 14, killing 15 people and wounding dozens in what authorities have described as an anti-Semitic terrorist attack. Despite the tragedy, tales of heroism emerged of those who tried to stop the two gunmen during their deadly rampage. Among them was Ahmed al Ahmed, a fruit seller, who went viral for ducking between parked cars as the shooting unfolded and then wresting a gun from one of the assailants. “My target was just to take the gun from him, and to stop him from killing a human being’s life and not killing innocent people,” he told CBS News in an interview that airs on Monday. “I know I saved lots, but I feel sorry for the lost.” Ahmed was shot several times in the shoulder after tussling with one of the gunmen and underwent several rounds of surgery. He recalled the moment he “jumped” on the gunman’s back, holding him with his right hand and said: “Drop your gun, stop doing what you’re doing”. “I don’t want to see people killed in front of me, I don’t want to see blood, I don’t want to hear his gun, I don’t want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help,” Ahmed told the television network. Ahmed was at the beach getting a cup of coffee when the shooting occurred. The father of two emigrated to Australia from Syria in 2007; his uncle Mohammed, a farmer, had told AFP in Ahmed’s hometown of Al-Nayrab days after the shooting. “His act is a source of pride for us and for Syria,” Mohammed said. The Australian government has fast-tracked and granted a number of visas for Ahmed’s family, local media reported. “Ahmed has shown the courage and values we want in Australia,” Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement. One of the gunmen, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot and killed by police during the attack. An Indian national, he entered Australia on a visa in 1998. His 24-year-old son, Naveed, an Australian-born citizen, remains in custody on charges including terrorism and 15 murders, as well as committing a “terrorist act” and planting a bomb with intent to harm. He has yet to enter a plea.",

      "summary_orig": "China’s military moved army, naval, air force and artillery units around Taiwan on Monday for its “Justice Mission 2025” drills, as the island vowed to defend democracy and mobilised troops to rehearse repelling a potential Chinese attack. The Eastern Theatre Command announced the drills will involve live-fire exercises on Tuesday, in a statement containing a graphic demarcating five zones surrounding the island that will be under sea and air space restrictions for 10 hours from 8am (5am PKT). This marks China’s sixth major round of war games since 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the democratically governed island, and follows a rise in Chinese rhetoric over Beijing’s territorial claims after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo. The exercises began 11 days after the United States announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever weapons package for the island, drawing a protest from China’s defence ministry and warnings the military would “take forceful measures” in response. China’s military said it had deployed fighter jets, bombers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and long-range rockets, and would practice striking mobile land-based targets while simulating a coordinated attack on the island from multiple directions. “This (the drills) serves as a serious warning to ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces,” said Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the Eastern Theatre Command. Taiwan’s government condemned the drills. A presidential office spokesperson urged China not to misjudge the situation and undermine regional peace, and called on Beijing to immediately halt what they described as irresponsible provocations. Scare tactics The island’s defence ministry said two Chinese military aircraft and 11 ships had been operating around the island over the last 24 hours, and that Taiwan’s military was on high alert and poised to carry out “rapid response exercises”. That particular drill is designed to move troops swiftly in case China suddenly turns one of its drills around the island into an attack. “All members of our armed forces will remain highly vigilant and fully on guard, taking concrete action to defend the values of democracy and freedom,” the defence ministry said. Dozens of Chinese military boats and planes were operating near Taiwan on Monday, and some of them “deliberately closing in” to Taiwan’s contiguous zone, defined as being 24 nautical miles from its coast, a senior Taiwan security official told Reuters . Taiwan’s coast guard said it had dispatched large ships in reaction to Chinese coast guard activity near the island’s waters and that it was working with the island’s military to minimise the drills’ impact on maritime routes and fishing areas. Taiwan stock markets were unaffected by the drills, up 0.6 per cent to a record high in morning trading. “I think these drills are just meant to scare us,” said Lin Wei-ming, a 31-year-old teacher based in the capital, Taipei. “Similar drills have happened before … the political side of things can only be handled by Taiwan’s current government and how they choose to respond.” Taiwan rejects China’s claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island’s future. ‘Smash the separatist scoundrels’ The Chinese military released two posters titled “Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions,” and “Arrows of Justice: Control and Denial”, along with a third graphic depicting four locations across the island with targets locking on, following the drill announcement. China’s state broadcaster said the drills would focus on sealing off Taiwan’s vital deep-water Port of Keelung to the island’s north and Kaohsiung to Taiwan’s south, the island’s largest port city. While the PLA practiced port blockades around Taiwan during war games last year, this marks the first time it has publicly stated that drills around the island are aimed at “deterrence” of outside military intervention. The Japanese prime minister’s remarks triggered a surge in Chinese messaging stressing its sovereignty claims. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump in November that Taiwan’s “return to China” after World War Two was central to Beijing’s vision of the global order. The first poster appeared to show the armada of civilian ships China is mobilising to help in an attack on Taiwan. Vessels with ramps and open decks similar to military landing craft used in amphibious assaults were also shown. “Any foreign interference that touches the shield (of justice) shall perish!” the poster read. “Any separatist scoundrels who encounter the shield shall be destroyed!” The second poster shows flaming arrows raining down on Taiwan and spearing green cartoon bugs. Beijing regularly calls Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te a “parasite” and began using the cartoon green bug caricature to represent separatist forces during April’s war games. “I think their (China’s) goal is, as they said, ‘keep the island, not the people,’” said Stephanie Huang, a 56-year-old interior designer. “They just want to save face by claiming Taiwan as part of their own country, but Taiwanese people don’t see it that way. “We are who we are; they are who they are.”",

      "summary_orig": "Meaningful relief for compliant income tax payers, salaried individuals and the corporate sector — who together contribute roughly half of Pakistan’s revenues — appears unlikely. Most experts expect only a modest downward adjustment in the year ahead. To avoid a revenue shortfall and keep the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme on track, analysts believe the government may again fall back on lucrative indirect measures, most notably a higher petroleum levy. Those who trust the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) reform intent and believe the government is committed to improving fairness by targeting under-taxed sectors and identified tax evaders also acknowledge that even the best efforts will take time to bear fruit. As a result, the tax-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain flat in the best-case scenario, and could even decline if the FBR becomes complacent or the government fails to sustain its reform commitments or control expenditure. In 2026, to contain public discontent over shrinking jobs and weak investment, the government may be compelled to strike a finer balance between growth needs and stabilisation demands. Beyond resistance from powerful interest groups, it will also test the government’s economic team’s ability to negotiate effectively with the IMF. A recent media report indicates that the IMF, which is closely monitoring Pakistan’s economic trajectory, also expects tax collection to remain broadly stagnant in CY26. There appears to be little room for tax-rate cuts next year, with minor adjustments expected at best From 8.9 per cent the previous year, the tax-to-GDP ratio rose to 10.3pc in FY25 and could inch up about eight percentage points to 11.1pc in FY26 due to higher taxation measures in the current fiscal year ending in June 2026. However, if the next budget includes expected reductions in direct tax rates, revenue collection may weaken in the second half of 2026, stalling further improvement and keeping the tax ratio broadly unchanged in FY27. FBR revenues increased to Rs11.7 trillion in FY25 from Rs9.3tr in FY24, and are projected to reach Rs13.98tr by the end of the current fiscal. Musadaq Zulqarnain, a prominent businessman and member of several government advisory forums, expressed cautious optimism for over-taxed segments. “Both the corporate sector and the salaried class are under severe strain. Any real relief, however, must stay within IMF parameters. My view is that the FY27 budget may offer some easing for both groups. Fiscal space for such relief can only emerge from substantial improvements in revenue mobilisation. The most sustainable path is broadening and deepening the tax base through leveraging data, technology, and stronger enforcement to uncover under-reported incomes. If implemented well, this can enable tax rationalisation without undermining stability or the IMF programme.” Dr Hafiz Pasha, eminent economist and former finance minister, sees little room for tax-rate cuts next year. “At best, I expect only minor adjustments, if any,” he said. A source familiar with official discussions said most participants favour revising tax rates. “I support and expect a major reduction of taxes on salaried individuals and corporations. We have the fiscal space; what limits us is the IMF’s primary surplus requirement. Current taxes exceed their optimal level and are now producing diminishing returns. Businesses are shutting down or slipping into informality to survive. Bringing rates back to reasonable levels would curb evasion and help expand the tax.” Dr Nadeem Javaid, Vice Chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and former chief economist, sees no scope for real tax cuts in 2026. “Substantial tax relief is unlikely while Pakistan remains under the IMF programme and struggles to meet ambitious revenue targets. Without credible offsetting measures, broad-based rate reductions are fiscally untenable.” He also expects modest, targeted tweaks, minor slab adjustments or limited rationalisation, as the IMF continues to prioritise revenue mobilisation, compliance, and a wider tax base over statutory rate cuts. Still, Dr Javaid believes that some relief for salaried taxpayers is economically warranted, given the heavy burden on documented incomes and the resulting erosion of purchasing power and domestic demand. Covering any revenue gap, he added, would require stronger tax administration, fewer exemptions, better enforcement in retail, real estate, and agriculture-linked incomes, and tight expenditure control. Unfunded tax cuts could jeopardise the IMF programme, making sequencing and financing essential. Former federal minister Dr Nadeem ul Haq lamented over the narrow focus of Pakistan’s economic discourse. “All we hear is ‘tax, tax, tax’, because there is no real economics in the media or government, and our universities are producing no economists,” he remarked. Rehmatullah Khan Wazir, a former FBR member, noted strong public pressure for tax relief. “There is significant pushback from professionals and salaried workers after sharp tax hikes over the past two years, driven by the IMF’s recommendations. The government may reconsider, especially given the accelerating brain drain, as high taxation is understood to be one contributing factor. “I expect the basic exemption to rise from Rs600,000 to Rs800,000, the third slab to fall from 11pc to 8pc, and the top rate from 35pc to 30pc. These adjustments would be reasonable and should not derail the IMF programme.” Chairman FBR, Finance Minister Aurangzeb and members of his team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the deadline.

There appears to be little room for tax-rate cuts next year, with minor adjustments expected at best From 8.9 per cent the previous year, the tax-to-GDP ratio rose to 10.3pc in FY25 and could inch up about eight percentage points to 11.1pc in FY26 due to higher taxation measures in the current fiscal year ending in June 2026. However, if the next budget includes expected reductions in direct tax rates, revenue collection may weaken in the second half of 2026, stalling further improvement and keeping the tax ratio broadly unchanged in FY27. FBR revenues increased to Rs11.7 trillion in FY25 from Rs9.3tr in FY24, and are projected to reach Rs13.98tr by the end of the current fiscal. Musadaq Zulqarnain, a prominent businessman and member of several government advisory forums, expressed cautious optimism for over-taxed segments. “Both the corporate sector and the salaried class are under severe strain. Any real relief, however, must stay within IMF parameters. My view is that the FY27 budget may offer some easing for both groups. Fiscal space for such relief can only emerge from substantial improvements in revenue mobilisation. The most sustainable path is broadening and deepening the tax base through leveraging data, technology, and stronger enforcement to uncover under-reported incomes. If implemented well, this can enable tax rationalisation without undermining stability or the IMF programme.” Dr Hafiz Pasha, eminent economist and former finance minister, sees little room for tax-rate cuts next year. “At best, I expect only minor adjustments, if any,” he said. A source familiar with official discussions said most participants favour revising tax rates. “I support and expect a major reduction of taxes on salaried individuals and corporations. We have the fiscal space; what limits us is the IMF’s primary surplus requirement. Current taxes exceed their optimal level and are now producing diminishing returns. Businesses are shutting down or slipping into informality to survive. Bringing rates back to reasonable levels would curb evasion and help expand the tax.” Dr Nadeem Javaid, Vice Chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and former chief economist, sees no scope for real tax cuts in 2026. “Substantial tax relief is unlikely while Pakistan remains under the IMF programme and struggles to meet ambitious revenue targets. Without credible offsetting measures, broad-based rate reductions are fiscally untenable.” He also expects modest, targeted tweaks, minor slab adjustments or limited rationalisation, as the IMF continues to prioritise revenue mobilisation, compliance, and a wider tax base over statutory rate cuts. Still, Dr Javaid believes that some relief for salaried taxpayers is economically warranted, given the heavy burden on documented incomes and the resulting erosion of purchasing power and domestic demand. Covering any revenue gap, he added, would require stronger tax administration, fewer exemptions, better enforcement in retail, real estate, and agriculture-linked incomes, and tight expenditure control. Unfunded tax cuts could jeopardise the IMF programme, making sequencing and financing essential. Former federal minister Dr Nadeem ul Haq lamented over the narrow focus of Pakistan’s economic discourse. “All we hear is ‘tax, tax, tax’, because there is no real economics in the media or government, and our universities are producing no economists,” he remarked. Rehmatullah Khan Wazir, a former FBR member, noted strong public pressure for tax relief. “There is significant pushback from professionals and salaried workers after sharp tax hikes over the past two years, driven by the IMF’s recommendations. The government may reconsider, especially given the accelerating brain drain, as high taxation is understood to be one contributing factor. “I expect the basic exemption to rise from Rs600,000 to Rs800,000, the third slab to fall from 11pc to 8pc, and the top rate from 35pc to 30pc. These adjustments would be reasonable and should not derail the IMF programme.” Chairman FBR, Finance Minister Aurangzeb and members of his team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the deadline.

      "title": "2025 OUTLOOK : Tax relief held fast by IMF restraints",
      "summary": "Meaningful relief for compliant income tax payers, salaried individuals and the corporate sector — who together contribute roughly half of Pakistan’s revenues — appears unlikely. Most experts expect only a modest downward adjustment in the year ahead. To avoid a revenue shortfall and keep the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme on track, analysts believe the government may again fall back on lucrative indirect measures, most notably a higher petroleum levy. Those who trust the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) reform intent and believe the government is committed to improving fairness by targeting under-taxed sectors and identified tax evaders also acknowledge that even the best efforts will take time to bear fruit. As a result, the tax-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain flat in the best-case scenario, and could even decline if the FBR becomes complacent or the government fails to sustain its reform commitments or control expenditure. In 2026, to contain public discontent over shrinking jobs and weak investment, the government may be compelled to strike a finer balance between growth needs and stabilisation demands. Beyond resistance from powerful interest groups, it will also test the government’s economic team’s ability to negotiate effectively with the IMF.
