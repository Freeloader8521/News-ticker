      "summary_orig": "Officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan said on Saturday that the Torkham border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been reopened for Afghan refugees returning to their country. Speaking to Dawn , Khyber Deputy Commissioner Bilal Rao confirmed that the Torkham border crossing had been reopened earlier today for the resumption of Afghan refugees’ repatriation. Khizer Shah, the spokesman of the Pakistani embassy in Kabul, and Afghan officials also confirmed the development. “Torkham gate is now open for refugees. We welcome our countrymen,” Qureshi Badloon, head of the Information and Culture in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province, told Dawn . The repatriation of Afghan families with or without any travel or identity documents was abruptly suspended on October 11 following border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on October 19. Pakistan had closed all its borders with Afghanistan for all types of movement. Since then, a large number of returning families had been impatiently waiting for the reopening of the Torkham border. Trade between the countries has remained suspended since then, leading to increased prices of essential goods, especially tomatoes . Although Islamabad and Kabul on Friday decided to extend the ceasefire , Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi stated that the “border remains closed for trade for now” and resumption of trade would depend on the security situation. Officials previously said that all relevant staff members had been informed to ensure their presence on duty on Saturday morning. It was not clear whether Pakistanis stranded in Afghanistan would be allowed to return. ‘Thousands of refugees stranded’ Meanwhile, Afghan Consul General Hafiz Mohibullah Shakir told Dawn on Friday that thousands of Afghan refugees were stranded and living on the road due to the closure of the Torkham border crossing. “There are hundreds of vehicles, carrying thousands of refugees, stranded on roads from Nowshera till Torkham,” he had said, adding that many did not have access to food, water or shelter. He had stated that refugees were continuing to be expelled, especially from Punjab, which was leading to an increase in the number of those stranded on roads. He had appealed for the provision of water, tents and food for the stranded refugees. Shakir said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had not helped the stranded refugees either, most of whom he said were registered and held Proof of Registration (PoR) cards. Following the recent border tensions, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had asserted that the government would grant no further extension to Afghan refugees and that all refugee camps will be shut down. He was informed that as of October 16, a total of 1,477,592 Afghan nationals had been repatriated. The government has also warned that harbouring illegal Afghan residents wo­­uld be treated as a serious offence and violators wo­­u­ld face stern punishment.",

      "summary_orig": "Former PTI leader and ex-federal minister Ali Haider Zaidi on Saturday refuted reports of him “planning a political relaunch”, saying that he had no plans of doing so anytime soon. Zaidi was among the top PTI leadership who quit either the party or politics altogether amid a state crackdown on the party following the May 9, 2023 riots , which witnessed military installations being vandalised in protest of Imran’s arrest earlier that day. “Some [are] suggesting that I’m planning a political relaunch. Let me be clear: I am not planning to enter politics anytime soon,” Zaidi said on X. The first reason Zaidi stated for not rejoining politics was that his “financial circumstances and my personal family obligations” would not allow it. “Secondly, there is no politics in a country where the corrupt, the land grabbers, the extortionists, even those with blood on their hands are gifted power through a rigged election, protected by a compromised judiciary, which even today, fails to deliver justice,” he claimed. “When justice dies, politics loses its purpose,” the former PTI Sindh president said. “Imran Khan was, and remains, the only leader who truly tried to change this system. Sadly, he’s rotting in jail. And we all know why,” he added. “I wish all my old colleagues well,” Zaidi further said. The clarification comes after Daily Ausaf and The Express Tribune reported, citing sources, that senior politicians who were part of the PTI’s “old leadership” were planning to relaunch a political movement calling for Imran’s release. The media reports had claimed that ex-ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Asad Umar , former Sindh governor Imran Ismail , former MNA Mahmood Moulvi , and ex-Punjab Assembly speaker Sibtain Khan were expected to lead the initiative once released. All of them, except for Sibtain, had parted ways with the PTI following the May 9 riots. According to the Tribune report, sources said the veteran leaders intended to bring on board other experienced political figures from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh. “The movement will pick up real pace after Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s release, when the old guard will be seen back in active political action,” the publication reported a source as saying. The reports come after Chaudhry and Ismail posted near-identical statements on X yesterday, saying they had not only met PTI vice president Qureshi, who was hospitalised recently, but also party leadership and workers imprisoned at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. “If the PTI leadership can’t even go to inquire about him (Qureshi), then saying that we shouldn’t even visit him is strange logic,” they said. They affirmed that the entire PTI wanted Imran to be freed from prison and alleged that some elements within the party wanted otherwise so “their leadership can keep shining”.",

Sadly, he’s rotting in jail. And we all know why,” he added. “I wish all my old colleagues well,” Zaidi further said. The clarification comes after Daily Ausaf and The Express Tribune reported, citing sources, that senior politicians who were part of the PTI’s “old leadership” were planning to relaunch a political movement calling for Imran’s release. The media reports had claimed that ex-ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Asad Umar , former Sindh governor Imran Ismail , former MNA Mahmood Moulvi , and ex-Punjab Assembly speaker Sibtain Khan were expected to lead the initiative once released. All of them, except for Sibtain, had parted ways with the PTI following the May 9 riots. According to the Tribune report, sources said the veteran leaders intended to bring on board other experienced political figures from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh. “The movement will pick up real pace after Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s release, when the old guard will be seen back in active political action,” the publication reported a source as saying. The reports come after Chaudhry and Ismail posted near-identical statements on X yesterday, saying they had not only met PTI vice president Qureshi, who was hospitalised recently, but also party leadership and workers imprisoned at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. “If the PTI leadership can’t even go to inquire about him (Qureshi), then saying that we shouldn’t even visit him is strange logic,” they said. They affirmed that the entire PTI wanted Imran to be freed from prison and alleged that some elements within the party wanted otherwise so “their leadership can keep shining”.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday banned reporters from accessing a core part of the White House press office without an appointment, citing the need to protect “sensitive material”. Journalists are now barred if they do not have prior approval to access the area in the West Wing known as Upper Press — which is where Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s office is located. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended the move, saying without providing evidence that reporters had been “ambushing” cabinet secretaries in the area and secretly recording video and audio. “This memorandum directs the prohibition of press passholders from accessing … ‘Upper Press,’ which is situated adjacent to the Oval Office, without an appointment,” said a memo from the White House National Security Council (NSC). The memo, addressed to Leavitt and Cheung, said the aim was “protecting sensitive material from unauthorized disclosure in Upper Press”. The policy comes amid wider restrictions on journalists by the Trump administration, including new rules at the Pentagon that major outlets including AFP refused to sign earlier this month. White House reporters have until now been able to freely visit the area, often wandering up to try to speak to Leavitt or senior press officers to seek information or confirm stories. Media are still allowed to access the area known as “Lower Press,” next to the famed White House briefing room, where more junior press officers have their desks, the memo said. ‘Eavesdropping’ The memo said the new restrictions were triggered by “recent structural changes to the NSC” that meant White House press officers were dealing with more sensitive material. Republican Trump has effectively absorbed the once powerful NSC into the White House, putting it under the control of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, after former National Security Adviser Mike Waltz was reassigned in May following a scandal over the use of the Signal app to plan strikes on Yemen. But Cheung later went further, saying on X that “some reporters have been caught secretly recording video and audio of our offices, along with pictures of sensitive info, without permission”. “Cabinet Secretaries routinely come into our office for private meetings, only to be ambushed by reporters waiting outside our doors,” he added, also accusing reporters of “eavesdropping on private, closed-door meetings”. Cheung, a Trump veteran who is known for his combative social media approach, did not provide evidence for the claims. US media said Democratic president Bill Clinton’s administration also sought to limit access to the Upper Press area, before rescinding the decision. Trump’s administration has made a major shake-up to access rules for journalists since his return to power in January. Many mainstream outlets have seen their access to areas like the Oval Office and Air Force One reduced, while right-wing, Trump-friendly outlets have been given more prominence. The White House also banned the Associated Press news agency from key areas where Trump speaks after it refused to recognise his order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.",

      "title_orig": "Israeli military official resigns after leaked abuse video stirs furore",
      "summary_orig": "JERUSALEM: The Israeli military’s chief legal officer resigned on Friday over a criminal inquiry into the leaking of a video that showed soldiers abusing a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza conflict . Advocate General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said that she was stepping down because she had approved the video’s leak in August last year. The abuse investigation led to criminal charges against five soldiers and stirred an uproar. The inquiry drew condemnation from right-wing politicians and prompted protesters to storm two military compounds after investigators sought troops for questioning in the case. A week after the break-in at the bases, a security camera video showing the moments of the alleged abuse was leaked to an Israeli television channel. It showed soldiers taking a prisoner aside and crowding around while holding a dog and blocking visibility of their actions with their riot gear. On Wednesday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said that there has been an ongoing criminal inquiry into the video leak and that Tomer-Yerushalmi was on forced leave. Tomer-Yerushalmi defended her action as an attempt to fend off propaganda against the military’s legal department entrusted with upholding the rule of law, and which she said had been subjected to smears throughout the war. ‘Violence must be probed’ The footage came from Sde Teiman detention camp, where some Hamas fighters are held. Rights groups have reported grave abuses of Palestinians in Israeli detention since Oct 2023. Israel’s military is investigating dozens of cases, but says abuse is not systematic. Tomer-Yerushalmi called Sde Teiman detainees  “terrorists of the worst kind”, in her resignation letter, but added that this did not take away from the obligation to investigate suspected abuse. “To my regret, this basic understanding — that there are acts to which even the most vile of detainees must not be subjected — is no longer convincing to all,” she said. Some politicians were swift to seize on Tomer-Yerushalmi’s resignation. Katz said that anyone who fabricates “blood libels against Israeli soldiers was unworthy of donning IDF uniform”. Police Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir welcomed the resignation and called for an inquiry into more legal authorities. He also posted a video of himself standing over Palestinian prisoners who were lying bound on the floor in an Israeli jail, saying that they were Oct 7 attackers who should receive the death penalty.

      "summary_en": "JERUSALEM: The Israeli military’s chief legal officer resigned on Friday over a criminal inquiry into the leaking of a video that showed soldiers abusing a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza conflict . Advocate General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said that she was stepping down because she had approved the video’s leak in August last year. The abuse investigation led to criminal charges against five soldiers and stirred an uproar. The inquiry drew condemnation from right-wing politicians and prompted protesters to storm two military compounds after investigators sought troops for questioning in the case. A week after the break-in at the bases, a security camera video showing the moments of the alleged abuse was leaked to an Israeli television channel. It showed soldiers taking a prisoner aside and crowding around while holding a dog and blocking visibility of their actions with their riot gear. On Wednesday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said that there has been an ongoing criminal inquiry into the video leak and that Tomer-Yerushalmi was on forced leave. Tomer-Yerushalmi defended her action as an attempt to fend off propaganda against the military’s legal department entrusted with upholding the rule of law, and which she said had been subjected to smears throughout the war. ‘Violence must be probed’ The footage came from Sde Teiman detention camp, where some Hamas fighters are held. Rights groups have reported grave abuses of Palestinians in Israeli detention since Oct 2023. Israel’s military is investigating dozens of cases, but says abuse is not systematic. Tomer-Yerushalmi called Sde Teiman detainees  “terrorists of the worst kind”, in her resignation letter, but added that this did not take away from the obligation to investigate suspected abuse. “To my regret, this basic understanding — that there are acts to which even the most vile of detainees must not be subjected — is no longer convincing to all,” she said. Some politicians were swift to seize on Tomer-Yerushalmi’s resignation. Katz said that anyone who fabricates “blood libels against Israeli soldiers was unworthy of donning IDF uniform”. Police Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir welcomed the resignation and called for an inquiry into more legal authorities. He also posted a video of himself standing over Palestinian prisoners who were lying bound on the floor in an Israeli jail, saying that they were Oct 7 attackers who should receive the death penalty.

      "summary_orig": "TRADITIONAL Pakistan has long been aware of the destructive nature of coups — the abrupt toppling of political governments and their replacement with autocratic regimes marked by little to no accountability. Under such regimes, the noose tightens around dissent, crackdowns on diversity become routine, and tolerance for alternative opinions vanishes. In relation to this, we can perhaps be somewhat grateful that such blatant usurpations of power are no longer in fashion. However, that does not mean that such autocratic tendencies have disappeared. Where once political governments were sent packing on charges of plane hijackings, ironically, today, the victims of those alleged hijackings are accused of ‘hijacking’ the judiciary itself. Through the 26th Amendment , the executive and legislature had been given de facto control over judicial appointments, bench selections, and judicial performance evaluations. Efforts to convene a full court to determine the amendment’s validity had been neutralised, at least till now, the seniority of Islamabad High Court judges had been tampered with, some judges were parachuted in to keep others out, courts were packed with judges perceived to favour the amendment, and whether or not such a perception is accurate, an impression had been created that the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had become a treasury bench, while the one in Sindh had become the ‘people’s bench’. In these troubling times, some dissent persisted, primarily on the part of a handful of judges in the Supreme Court and the high courts. These judges were never an existential threat to the new system crafted by the establishment, nor are their present protests or expressions of concern a real danger to its continuation. Their dissent and expressions of grievance were, and perhaps remain, an inconvenience. Even that, however, is now intolerable. With the notification of the revised Code of Conduct, it is apparent that dissent of any kind is unacceptable, and that conformity is not a choice but a compulsion. Nothing makes this more evident than the decision to borrow from resolutions passed in the dark days of the Musharraf era, a time when democracy was a fairy-tale and autocracy was fair game. Designed to uphold judicial independence, the Code of Conduct could result in suppressing it. Article V of the Code deals with public controversies and how to avoid them. The earlier version was broad and generic; the new one is sweeping in scope, with a tendency to expand into every form of expression. Notably, it now prohibits public controversies arising from any “speech, writing, debate or comment at any forum” — essentially covering all forms of free speech. Yet “public controversies” remain undefined, leaving the article ripe for misuse. The same article further states that a judge shall “not cause any judicial or administrative matter to be discussed publicly, nor shall he make public any communication relating to his personal or official matters”. On the face of it, it may seem fine. However, there is a deeper concern involved in the phrasing of this section. How is a judge to ensure that any of his remarks, observations, or findings — whether during the course of proceedings in court or in a written judgement — do not “cause” public discussion or controversy? Public reaction lies well beyond a judge’s control, and is that not what is expected of a judge? Moreover, a judge may, at times, need to justify or reason a decision by citing communications relating to personal or official matters. Once cited, these inevitably enter the public record — leaving the judge technically liable for misconduct under this vaguely worded provision. Another notable revision concerns judges’ attendance at social events, gatherings, and functions, which the Code now directs them to abstain from altogether. Even soliciting an invitation to an international conference, amongst other things, regardless of whether it pertains to legal issues, could constitute misconduct. This restriction is alarming, as international conferences and similar forums allow judges to engage with diverse perspectives, broaden their understanding, and stay informed on current global developments. Additionally, if a judge is personally criticised or his character attacked, he or she is stopped from responding in any form. Instead, an institutional response is prioritised. Similar processes apply to attempts to influence judges. Yet if history is any guide, institutional responses — particularly in times of turmoil — tend to be timid, if not entirely absent. Clauses such as these might be uncontroversial in mature democracies where the judiciary operates independently, free from legislative or executive influence. In such systems, where safeguards against interference and corruption are firmly embedded, and where an overall culture of respect is found between and amongst the various institutions themselves, a code of conduct of this nature could function effectively. But in countries where democracy is ‘made to order’ — and that too by those whose names appear nowhere in the Constitution as governing authorities — such codes serve instead as Damocles’ swords hanging over the heads of independent judges, or those who dare to express independent thoughts, even sparingly. In such circumstances, such a Code of Conduct may well serve more so as a tool of misuse as opposed to a shield against wrongdoing. In essence, it may be used to manufacture misconduct as opposed to regulating conduct, with its real purpose being to cull independence, remove judges who think freely, and to protect those who do not. Designed to uphold judicial independence, it could result in suppressing it. Some may think that we are going out of our way to highlight the ‘possible’ misuse of this code, where no actual misuse has, in fact, come to light. However, in the context of a strained system already finding it hard to give a voice to the people, it is not far-fetched. In fact, in these times, if anything may be perceived as far-fetched, it would be its innocent, effective and judicious use without misapplication. And this is why it may not be improper to state that this Code, in its present form, may do wonders in established democratic orders, but may wreak havoc in others. Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, in today’s world, we are ‘the others’. The writer is a lawyer based in Karachi X: @basilnabi Published in Dawn, November 1st, 2025",

Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, in today’s world, we are ‘the others’. The writer is a lawyer based in Karachi X: @basilnabi Published in Dawn, November 1st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Senior PTI leader and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was hospitalised at the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute (PKLI) in Lahore for gallbladder stone complications, his daughter stated on Friday. Shah Mahmood has been indicted in multiple cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots and has remained behind bars since August 2023. In July 2024, the PTI leader was indicted by a Lahore anti-terrorism court in a case registered by the Shadman police over allegedly attacking and burning the police station. Meher Bano Qureshi took to X today to announce that the PTI leader was undergoing baseline tests for the stones, which he had “lived with … for years”. “In 2023, while incarcerated in Adiala Jail, doctors had advised surgery after his condition deteriorated. He chose not to undergo any procedures, then unwilling to do so while in solitary confinement,” she wrote. “Since then, the stones have increased in size and surgery is now unavoidable. We await the doctors’ final report and a confirmed date for the operation,” Meher Bano added. She added that Shah Mahmood also had a “ cardiac emergency ” while imprisoned at Kot Lakhpat Jail near Lahore earlier this year. “What remains deeply painful is knowing that he is not alone in this suffering,” Meher Bano wrote. “Every single PTI leader and worker who has endured imprisonment over the past year has faced serious health consequences under inhumane and unjust conditions. “Many continue to battle the effects of prolonged confinement, neglect and isolation … some of our workers have also lost their lives whilst unjustly imprisoned,” she added. His son, Zain, said that his father had been suffering from gallbladder stones for several years and now surgery was required. “Please pray for him, for Imran Khan sahib , Bushra Bibi, and all the imprisoned [PTI] leaders and workers,” he said. Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry also took to X and wrote that Shah Mahmood has been in the hospital for several days and was visited by family members and constituents. “If the PTI leadership can’t even go to inquire about him, then saying that we shouldn’t even visit him is strange logic,” Chaudhry wrote. “We have not only met Shah Mahmood Qureshi but also met workers and leadership in Kot Lakhpat Jail.”",

      "summary_orig": "THROUGH the efforts of foreign interlocutors, the failed parleys between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Istanbul have been salvaged, yielding an extension in the ceasefire, and a promise from both sides to meet again in Turkiye next week to firm up the details. As reported, Pakistani representatives were at the airport on Thursday when they were called back by the hosts to give diplomacy with the Afghan Taliban another shot. On Wednesday, Pakistani officials had said the talks had collapsed , mainly due to the Afghan side’s refusal to give explicit guarantees that their soil would not be used by anti-Pakistan militants such as the TTP. The development is welcome, and the tone of officials indicates that a breakthrough may be possible. For example, the FO spokesman said on Friday that Pakistan hopes for a “positive outcome” from the Nov 6 talks. A mechanism to verify the ceasefire and ensure peace at the border has been agreed to, and this can be the starting point for a more formal peace plan. The key problem remains Pakistan’s legitimate concern that terrorist groups in Afghanistan are not being prevented from staging attacks against this country, and Kabul’s ambiguous stance on the issue. According to reports, the Taliban negotiators said they could not fully control the TTP, particularly their attacks inside Pakistan. While internal security is indeed Pakistan’s own responsibility, it is the Taliban’s duty — as the de facto government in Kabul — to stop terrorist groups from crossing over into Pakistan. If they cannot stop cross-border terrorism, how can the Taliban be expected to be taken seriously as Afghanistan’s legitimate administration? However, the Pakistani side’s reported demand that the Taliban declare the TTP a fitna may be unrealistic. The Taliban and the TTP are cut from the same ideological cloth, hence, we should not expect any such edicts from Kabul or Kandahar. Much will depend on what the Taliban bring to the table in Istanbul next week. Hopefully they will realise that without a verifiable mechanism and commitment to stop cross-border terrorism, long-term peace with Pakistan will be difficult. Meanwhile both sides, including high officials in Pakistan, should shun intemperate language that could imperil the parleys. While Pakistan’s stance against terrorist groups like the TTP should be clear, aggressive commentary should be avoided. And as this paper has stated, with cooperation from Muslim states, such as Qatar and Turkiye, which have been instrumental in hosting the talks, as well as regional allies, Kabul should be pressed further on terrorism. For example, along with the TTP, the Taliban also host Al Qaeda, ETIM and IS-K. These groups have staged attacks on regional states, which is why a coordinated, transnational counterterrorism policy is needed to address the problem of militants based in Afghanistan.

In a report released to mark the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, PPF said threats ranged from physical assaults and detentions to criminal complaints, censorship orders and internet shutdowns, despite constitutional guarantees of free expression. The PPF urged authorities to move “beyond lip service” and implement domestic and international commitments to protect press freedom, including effective use of existing safety laws and mechanisms. The report documented 35 incidents of physical assault and manhandling, along with two journalists injured while on assignment, five detentions, two abductions and four attacks on property, including raids. Legal pressure remained significant, with eight arrests, 30 FIRs — 22 of which invoked the Pakistan Elec­tronic Crimes Act (Peca), including the newly introduced Section 26-A on “fake information” — and 23 actions initiated by the FIA and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency. Journalists also faced intimidation, including seven threats (online and offline), three threats of legal action, seven cases of harassment, sometimes involving family members or political rhetoric, and two journalists placed on the no-fly list. Meanwhile, censorship and rest­rictions included six suspensions of mobile or internet services, a Pemra directive, a court order blocking 27 YouTube channels (later suspended in separate proceedings) and restrict­ions on reporting outside Adiala Jail. ‘Brazen’ attacks The PPF said political leaders’ rhetoric and government actions perpetuated a hostile climate for the press, alongside “brazen” attacks on property and the bulldozing of restrictive legislation. It noted continued physical violence — including assaults, detentions and abductions — amid “a lack of preventive, protective and prosecutorial measures”. The report highlighted the risks faced by journalists covering climate disasters. On Aug 30, Geo News reporter Irfanullah and cameraman Ali Arsalan were allegedly ass­aulted and forced away by Punjab Enf­orcement and Regulatory Aut­hority personnel while reporting on flood-hit residents in Faisalabad. “In what has now appeared to become an unfortunate tactic are attempts to undermine the sanctity of physical spaces, including press clubs,” the report said. It said police forcibly entered Quetta Press Club on March 1; men linked to a shrine dispute attacked Badin Press Club on June 2; and Islamabad’s National Press Club was raided on Oct 2, with journalists assaulted on the premises. The PPF examined eight murders of media workers this year; six were deemed unrelated to journalistic work, while two — Abdul Latif Bal­och and Imtiaz Mir — remain inconclusive. It called for genuine, stakeholder-led reform rather than “bulldozing” measures such as the Paki­stan Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Act 2025, which drew concern over pote­ntial misuse.

      "summary_orig": "• Trials to be held in Rawalpindi ATC • Home dept says move will help ensure PTI founder’s security, prevent untoward incidents RAWALPINDI: The Punjab government has notified that all eleven FIRs registered against former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with the violent protests of May 9, 2023, will now be tried in the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Rawalpindi. The trials will be conducted via video link from Adiala jail, where the PTI founder remains incarcerated. According to a notification issued by the Home Department, the decision has been made under Sections 15(2) and 21(2)(b) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The order directs that proceedings in all eleven FIRs — registered at various police stations, including RA Bazaar, Civil Lines, City, Waris Khan, New Town, Morgah, Sadiqabad, Saddar Wah, and Cantt — be held at the Rawalpindi ATC through video link from Adiala jail. The Home Department stated that the arrangement aims to ensure Imran Khan’s security and prevent any untoward incident during the hearings. The fresh order replaces earlier notifications dated June 21, 2023, October 4, 2023, and November 6, 2024, which also addressed the transfer of trial venues. The last such notification was withdrawn by the Punjab government after being challenged before the Lahore High Court (LHC). With this latest order, the government has once again sanctioned the holding of Imran Khan’s trials through remote proceedings. An anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi had earlier dismissed the PTI’s plea challenging the government’s decision to have Imran Khan appear via video link in the case pertaining to the violent protest outside the General Headquarters (GHQ) — one of the several May 9 cases. Judge Amjad Ali Shah ruled that the provincial government’s notification was valid and that the accused would continue to attend proceedings virtually from jail. Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023, triggered widespread riots across Pakistan, during which government buildings and military installations — including the GHQ in Rawalpindi — were stormed and vandalised. Following the unrest, dozens of FIRs were lodged against PTI leaders and supporters under anti-terrorism provisions. The new notification consolidates all eleven Rawalpindi district cases before the same ATC, streamlining the trial process. These cases include charges related to attacks on military installations, police stations, and public property during the May 9 riots. The order has been circulated to key officials, including the advocate general of Punjab, the registrar of the Lahore High Court, the presiding judge of the Rawalpindi ATC, and the inspector general of prisons. It also instructs the superintendent of Adiala jail to ensure Imran Khan’s safe and secure participation via video link. Imran Khan, who was indicted in the GHQ attack case on December 5, 2024, has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since August 2023. He was subsequently arrested in additional May 9 cases in January 2024. The PTI founder’s legal team has consistently argued that the government’s insistence on conducting the trials through video link is politically motivated and undermines the principle of open justice. However, the provincial authorities maintain that the arrangement is strictly a security measure. With the latest notification, the stage is now set for all pending May 9 cases in Rawalpindi to proceed simultaneously in the ATC via video link — a move that could expedite proceedings but also reignite the legal debate over the right to a fair and public trial.

      "summary_orig": "• Islamabad says ceasefire with western neighbour not ‘open-ended’; any breach will trigger ‘all options’ • Foreign Office insists Istanbul statement a ‘preface’, not full text of accord • Says Taliban privately acknowledge TTP, BLA presence in Afghanistan • Khawaja Asif hints at multi-nation monitors, says ‘terrorism must stop’ ISLAMABAD: Islamabad on Friday viewed the Istanbul agreement with Kabul as a conditional truce and a step forward, but not an end-state as it awaited the next high-level engagement with the Afghan Taliban regime scheduled for Nov 6 in Turkiye. “Afghanistan should understand that this arrangement is a conditional truce, one which hinges on demonstrable responsibility by the Afghan side,” a senior security source said on condition of anonymity, underscoring Pakistan’s cautious optimism after five days of intense talks in Istanbul mediated by Turkiye and Qatar. The round of negotiations, which concluded earlier this week, produced a three-point understanding — the continuation of the ceasefire, the establishment of a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace, and penalties for violations. The operational details of that mechanism are expected to be finalised when the “principals”, senior representatives from both sides, meet again in Istanbul on Thursday. The Istanbul talks followed a sharp escalation in tensions last month that saw Pakistan launch Oct 9 airstrikes on TTP sanctuaries in Afghanistan, triggering Oct 11 border clashes that continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on Oct 18-19. The Istanbul agreement came after days of deadlock that nearly brought the process to a halt, with mediators pulling both delegations back to the table even as Pakistan’s team had already begun preparations to return home. “The Istanbul round was initially scheduled for two days. However, in an effort to reach an amicable agreement with the Taliban regime, the Pakistani side, in earnest, continued the talks for four days,” Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Hussain Andarabi said at his weekly briefing on Friday. “We would see these deliberations [in Istanbul] as comprehensive and all-encompassing as we move to the next stage,” Mr Andarabi added. He, however, urged against critiquing the statement. “The statement released by the foreign ministry of Turkiye was a kind of covering note on the talks that were held. It should be read as a preface to a book rather than as the book itself,” he explained while responding to questions about the statement not fully reflecting the Pakistani position, especially as it missed a reference to the TTP’s presence in Afghanistan. “Pakistan does not seek further escalation of hostilities but expects the Afghan Taliban regime to honour its commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking concrete and verifiable actions against terrorist entities, including Fitna al-Khawarij (TTP) and Fitna al-Hindustan (Balochistan Liberation Army),” Mr Andarabi said. While the Foreign Office emphasised diplomacy, the security official was explicit about Islamabad’s conditional approach. “Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to peace and stability on its western border but equally emphasises that this ceasefire is not open-ended and not unconditional,” the official emphasised. He added that Pakistan expects “credible evidence of action, including dismantling of militant hideouts, disruption of logistical channels, arrests or prosecutions of leadership and transparent reporting through the agreed monitoring and verification mechanism”. “If Afghanistan fails to deliver verifiable proof of agreed steps, or if militants continue to launch attacks from Afghan soil, Pakistan will deem the ceasefire violated and reserves all options to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens,” he warned. FO ‘fully engaged’ The Pakistani delegation in Istanbul was dominated by military and intelligence officials, though the Foreign Office spokesman insisted it remained fully engaged. “Istanbul talks took place with full engagement from the Foreign Office,” Mr Andarabi said. “The deputy prime minister and foreign minister gave guidance on numerous occasions. The foreign secretary and our Afghanistan Division were also engaged. We need to dispel this impression that there is some sort of fragmentation in our government apparatus.” Mr Andarabi also clarified that “the border remains closed for trade for now. The opening of the border for Afghan transit trade would depend on the evaluation of the security situation, and clearly that evaluation still warrants closure of the border.” On the monitoring system, the security source said, “The monitoring and verification mechanism established under the mediators’ auspices will serve as the impartial and essential instrument to determine compliance by Afghanistan.” Pakistan, however, remains sceptical about the Afghan Taliban’s sincerity. “Despite repeated assurances in the past (by Afghan Taliban), there has been a surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghanistan,” Mr Andarabi recalled. The spokesman further disclosed that the Afghan Taliban had acknowledged the presence of TTP and BLA on Afghan soil, even if they offered excuses for inaction. “As far as the acknowledgement of their physical presence in Afghanistan is concerned, they agreed to it,” he said. Security officials echoed that scepticism, while noting that “the single litmus test of Taliban sincerity is that Afghanistan will not allow its territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan”. Multi-nation monitors Meanwhile, Defence Minister Asif suggested that there might be the inclusion of multiple countries in the monitoring mechanism to ensure its long-term sustainability instead of a breakdown in 12 or 15 months. He said giving a “free hand” to any border crossing of terrorists amounted to abetting them or conniving with them. “If they don’t stop this or monitor this, it means they have connivance and their agreement is involved in terrorists coming and spilling blood in Pakistan,” he said. To a question on whether the Afghan Taliban accepted the presence and usage of their soil by the TTP to conduct attacks on Pakistan, Mr Asif: “They accept this privately.” He said the two were very entangled, and the entire TTP leadership was present in Kabul. “The sanctuaries in Kabul must have been provided by the Afghan Taliban. They (TTP) won’t be living in hotels,” he added. Mr Asif asserted that Pakistan’s main demand continued to be the “stopping of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”. He added that “there is a ray of hope, but not because of Afghanistan and only so because of Qatar and Turkiye’s influence” over Kabul. “There have been some ceasefire violations from Afghanistan,: he said, stressing that “until terrorism stops, the ceasefire cannot be\neffective”.

      "summary_orig": "• Critical Minerals Forum chief meets Aurangzeb • Islamabad welcomes move; asks team to revert with a detailed framework for collaboration ISLAMABAD: A leading US delegation met with Pakistani officials in Islamabad on Friday, seeking to build secure and transparent mineral supply chains for American industry amid Washington’s growing concerns over China’s upper hand in global rare earth materials. The delegation led by Robert Louis Strayer II, president of the US government-funded Critical Minerals Forum (CMF), “discussed avenues of cooperation in the minerals and mining sector, strengthening supply-chain security, and encouraging responsible and sustainable investment in Pakistan’s critical minerals landscape” with a Pakistani team headed by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, according to an official statement. The meeting took place as the US and India announced a 10-year defence framework agreement. The CMF’s focus is driven by the strategic threat posed by Beijing’s control over key resources. “China’s dominance of critical mineral supply chains has become a well-known threat to US national security, economic competitiveness, and long-term strategic objectives,” Strayer wrote in his only article on the CMF website. Mr Strayer told Pakistan that the CMF is working globally to support reliable supply chains for US industry, particularly in emerging markets. The forum, he said, “focused on rare and niche metals, including copper and antimony, and aims to de-risk investments from both financial and security perspectives”. He also promised a commitment to support technology transfer, intel­lectual property protection, and US private-sector investor confidence. Mr Strayer noted that the US viewed Pakistan’s science, engineering, and mathematics talent as a competitive advantage and “acknowledged Pakistan’s potential to become a future hub for critical mineral development,” the statement added. Natalie Baker, the US Chargé d’Affaires in Islamabad who accompanied the delegation, noted the Embassy’s support for American commercial engagement in Pakis­tan and “emphasised the importance of ensuring strong investor confidence and enabling regulatory frameworks in the minerals sector”. In response, Mr Aurangzeb said Pakistan is working on significant legal and regulatory reforms and would welcome structured proposals. “We encourage you to return with a detailed framework for collaboration. Pakistan will evaluate it with a view to facilitating responsible investment and ensuring mutual benefit,” the minister said. Mr Aurangzeb also positioned Pakistan as navigating a complex geopolitical landscape, highlighting its strengthened partnerships. “Pakistan today stands at a constructive intersection of global relationships—renewed momentum in Pakistan-US ties, time-tested relations with China, and forward-looking strategic cooperation with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” he said. He stressed that Pakistan’s mineral sector represents a “transformational opportunity” that could shift the country from “consumption-driven cycles to export-led growth.” He added, “A strong minerals policy framework will help Pakistan break the cycle of periodic balance-of-payments pressures and reduce future reliance on multilateral support.” The minister also updated the delegation that during his recent visit to Washington he met multiple global financial institutions, including Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and International Finance Corporation (IFC), which expressed interest in expanding investments in Pakistan. US stakeholders are concerned about China’s growing control over global critical minerals. The CMF president noted Chinese dominance stems from government subsidies, vertical integration, and lax regulations, especially in processing, which is energy and compliance-dependent, contrasting with US under-investment. According to the influential US Atlantic Council, critical minerals are foundational to the modern economy and state power, essential for advanced technologies in energy, military, and commercial applications. They range from permanent magnets in fighter jets to batteries in electric vehicles. The Atlantic Council warned that these “supply chains have become increasingly brittle: concentrated in a handful of countries, overwhelmingly refined in China, and increasingly exposed to extreme weather disruption.” It noted that China has shown a “willingness to weaponise its dominance”, tightening export restrictions on materials like graphite and antimony in retaliation for US trade controls. However, a major obstacle to US investment remains, Strayer said, citing the “unusually high uncertainty of both production costs and mineral prices”. He added that this uncertainty has “a chilling effect on new investment by profit-seeking companies, as investors prefer to make investments in projects with higher risk-adjusted expected profits.” Published in Dawn, November 1st, 2025",

      "title_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif rubbishes contentious remarks about disarming Hamas",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday rubbished and strongly condemned the contentious remarks made by government spokesperson Danyal Chaudhry regarding the role of Pakistani troops in the Gaza peace force, which also included the disarming of Hamas. Addressing the remarks by the federal parliamentary secretary for information and broadcasting in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’, the defence minister said: “I will say God forbid on all these three remarks; what kind of statement has he given. Nothing from this is our target or suits us.” In an interview on Tuesday on Ary News show ‘11th Hour’, Chaudhry had said regarding the mandate of the Gaza peace force: “Pakistan and the other countries that will be chosen will make sure there is no extremism or violence … or that there is no cross-border attack. Pakistan will enforce that.” Chaudhry also said that the security of any Pakistani soldier deputed for duty in the force would be the utmost priority. “We will fulfil our duty and protect Muslim brothers and make sure there are no cross-border violations or terrorism.” Questioned if the mandate would also include the disarmament of Hamas, Chaudhry had said: “Yes absolutely, if [Hamas] will be disarmed, only then the other force will be able to carry on. Things will only move forward after disarmament.” A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. According to officials close to the discussions, an announcement is expected soon from the federal government regarding the decision. Addressing the matter while slamming Chaudhry’s remarks, Asif said Pakistan would follow whatever collective decision is taken for the force. He also questioned on whose behalf the federal parliamentary secretary was speaking in terms of enforcing peace. “I have no information about this. I am frankly speaking that if we are saying such things on a personal level on any TV [channel] then it is inappropriate.” Questioned if the role of the force was really as per Chaudhry’s remarks, Asif said: “I won’t be in favour then. There has been no discussion like this.” He agreed when asked that the inclusion of any Pakistani troops in such a force in the face of continued Israeli bombing would cause a complicated situation. Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, have said discussions within the government and military establishment are at an “advanced stage”. According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission. The ISF’s mandate would include maintaining internal security, disarming Hamas, securing border crossings, and assisting with humanitarian relief and reconstruction under the supervision of a transitional Palestinian authority. Officials in Islamabad argue that Pakistan’s potential participation stems from both moral responsibility and diplomatic necessity. They noted that Pakistan was part of the original eight-country peace proposal conceived in late 2024, and backed by several Muslim-majority states, that formed the basis of the US-brokered Gaza peace plan finalised earlier this month. Since the ISF was a key pillar of that plan, officials said, Pakistan’s participation would signal consistency and credibility. Another argument giv­en by the government circles supporting Pakistan’s inclusion in the ISF is its strong track record in int­ernational peacekeeping. Pakistan is one of the largest troop contributors to United Nations peace missions, having deployed more than 200,000 personnel to over 40 operations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Officials contend that this experience not only equips Pakistani forces to manage volatile post-conflict environments but also lends credibility and legitimacy to the ISF. Beyond moral and operational grounds, foreign policy imperatives also underpin the government’s case for participation. Officials argue that joining the Gaza stabilisation force could strengthen Pakistan’s relations with the United States. Islamabad’s ties with Washington have been on a gradual mend since Trump’s return to the White House, following years of friction over Afghanistan and counter-terrorism. Participating in a US-supported multilateral initiative, they said, could further this thaw and open avenues for economic cooperation, defence support and regional influence. However, officials cautioned that there is still no clarity on the legal framework for the deployment. “Ideally, we would like this deployment to take place under a UN mandate,” an official said. Still, such a deployment would not be without risk. Gaza remains highly volatile, and domestic opinion in Pakistan presents an additional challenge. Many Pakistanis, deeply sympathetic to the Pales­tinian cause, may perceive participation in a US-desi­gned stabilisation mission as serving Israeli interests or even as a betrayal of Palestinian resistance. “It’s a difficult but defining choice,” said another official. Asif had said on Tuesday that a decision on sending Pakistani troops for the Gaza peace force was still being finalised and “it is in process”. Afghan Taliban issue Meanwhile, on the recent agreement with the Afghan Taliban to continue the current ceasefire ahead of further talks and the agreeement on a monitoring and verification mechanism for any violation, Asif suggested that there might be the inclusion of multiple countries in the monitoring mechanism to ensure its longterm sustainability instead of a breakdown in 12 or 15 months. He said giving a “free hand” to any border crossing of terrorists amounted to abetting them or conniving with them. “If they don’t stop this or monitor this then it means they have a connivance and their agreement is involved in terrorists coming and spilling blood in Pakistan,” the defence minister said. To a question on whether the Afghan Taliban accepted the presence and usage of their soil by the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to conduct attacks on Pakistan, Asif: “They accept this privately.” He said the two were very entangled and the entire TTP leadership was present in Kabul. “The sanctuaries in Kabul must have been provided by the Afghan Taliban, thry (TTP) won’t be living in hotels.”",

This was the most powerful storm to strike the island nation, packing winds of up to 185mph at its peak. Western parts of Jamaica were worst hit, with 90% of homes in the town of Black River losing their roof or being destroyed entirely. Roughly three-quarters of the country lost electricity, with at least 19 people known to have lost their lives at the time of publication. The cleanup operation was hampered by thunderstorms even after Melissa cleared to the north. The hurricane continued northwards, but was a slightly weakened category 3 storm by the time it made landfall in Cuba. Nonetheless, the storm continued to bring winds of up to 120mph and torrential rains. Continue reading...",
