      "summary_orig": "Bundled up in a yellow hat and black puffer jacket, Taylor was one of hundreds of protesters marching after the killing of a second US citizen this month by federal agents carrying out an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. The violence has put new pressure and scrutiny on US President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation campaign, which has drawn demonstrators onto the streets of the Midwestern city. “I think it was completely senseless, it was murder,” said the young woman, who did not want to give her last name. Federal agents shot to death 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti, claiming he intended to harm them during a confrontation on Saturday. However, a video shared widely on social media and verified by US media showed Pretti never drawing a weapon, with agents firing at him seconds after he was sprayed in the face with a chemical irritant and thrown to the ground. “I think the way that the government is bringing ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in to take away our neighbours and to pull families apart is completely inhumane. And if we don’t speak out for them, then other people won’t,” she added during the protest on Sunday. Pretti was killed less than three weeks after another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good, was shot dead by an ICE agent — on a street just over a mile (1.6 kilometres) away. Trump and his officials quickly defended the officer who fired the shots, who has neither been suspended nor charged. ‘This is America’ Coleen Fitzgerald, a 73-year-old retired construction worker, attended the protest wearing a clown costume and multi-colored wig and wig to mock the Trump administration. “We started to have ICE people come up there, and they’re coming into our restaurant,s and they’re going to people’s homes, and they’re taking them,” she told AFP . “We can’t live like this. This is America. We’re supposed to be free, and they’re trying to take that away.” Fitzgerald brandished a homemade sign, “Hire clowns, expect a circus”, against a backdrop of demonstrators chanting “our streets” and “ICE out now”. Thousands of federal immigration agents have been deployed for weeks to Minneapolis, after media reports on alleged fraud by Somali immigrants — which Trump has seized upon. The Democratic-led city has one of the highest concentrations of Somali immigrants in the United States. The area around Pretti’s killing was marked off Sunday by yellow caution tape with police cars parked across the road. At a makeshift memorial near the site of the shooting, demonstrators gathered after the march to lay flowers and candles. Locals wearing hats and coats huddled around a sea of bouquets. Some knelt despite the icy ground, with temperatures falling as low as -4F (-20C). “Stop killing us,” “Enough is enough. ICE out,” and “Alex should be here” were among the slogans written on signs posted around the site.",

      "summary_orig": "A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and two senior colleagues to be hanged for crimes against humanity committed during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. All three, including the capital’s former police chief, Habibur Rahman, were tried in absentia, and their whereabouts are not known. The verdict comes ahead of elections on February 12 , the first in the South Asian country of 170 million people since Hasina’s overthrow in August 2024. Five other ex-police officers were sentenced to varying terms. The case concerned the killing of six protesters in Dhaka on August 5, 2024, the day Hasina fled to India as protesters stormed her palace. Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations. “The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder read to the court in Dhaka. The court heard how Rahman sent messages to police units ordering the use of lethal force to crush the protests. Chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said he was satisfied with the verdict against the three men, although he wanted tougher sentences for the five others found guilty who were handed prison terms. “The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told the reporters after the verdict. In November, the same court also sentenced Hasina — who remains in hiding in India — to death for crimes against humanity. She refused to attend the trial and denies the charges. In that case, former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal was also sentenced to death in absentia after being found guilty of crimes against humanity. Ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who was in court and had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.",

      "title_orig": "Explainer: Why is Donald Trump so interested in Greenland?",
      "summary_orig": "Greenland is a land of snow and ice, home to only 57,000 people. Yet Donald Trump’s desire to control it has caused protests in Greenland itself together with unprecedented tensions with European allies. And at one point even seemed to risk military confrontation between North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) members. The US President has now backed down from his threat of tariffs and has ruled out military action. But why is Donald Trump so interested in Greenland? Here’s what he’s said about it himself: “We need it for strategic national security and international security. And the fact is, no nation or any group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland, other than the United States.” Greenland’s strategic military location Greenland, a Danish territory, certainly does occupy a strategic position. It’s at one end of what’s called the G-I-UK gap, between Greenland, Iceland and the UK. Much of Russia’s navy needs to cross this gap to access the Atlantic. Sitting near the top of the world, Greenland is also on the shortest route between the US and Russia, which could be used by missiles in case of a conflict. “If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it. Those missiles would be flying right over the centre of that piece of ice,” said Trump. Canada, Russia and China in Trump’s calculations Control of Greenland would also mean that US territory would nearly surround Canada, another country that Trump says he wants to annex. For Trump, the main threat to Greenland comes from Russia and China. Nato’s top commander agrees they’re stepping up activity in the region. “We certainly see Russia and China working together. We have had Chinese vessels patrolling with Russia, not only on the north coast of Russia but also north of Alaska and near Canada. And it’s not for peaceful purposes. They’re not studying the seals and the polar bears,” said Alexus Gregory Grynkewich, the Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Existing US military presence However, the US has long had a military presence in Greenland, under a Cold War deal first signed in 1951. It still has the Pituffik Space Base, which was visited by US Vice President JD Vance in March 2025 . According to Patrick Schröder of the Chatham House think tank, the US could already have boosted its defences without antagonising its European allies. “There are existing arrangements between the United States and Denmark that allow the United States to have military bases and facilities and deploy military within Greenland,” he said. “There’s no need for Greenland to be part of the United States in order to do so. And in the context of Arctic security, there’s a need for close collaboration. Denmark’s foreign minister already indicated he would welcome more US troops and military cooperation to collectively boost security in the Arctic,” said Schröder. Melting ice and new global trade routes Another reason Trump could be interested in Greenland is global trade. With temperatures rising, the melting ice is making new shipping routes possible in the Arctic, with some opening up around Greenland. According to Schröder, China is already actively exploring new shipping routes, which would enable shipments coming to Europe without having gone through the Suez Canal. “This is maybe also something that President Trump had in mind when he was talking about, if we don’t take Greenland, then China and Russia will. But again, these are two separate issues: there’s no immediate threat of China or Russia taking over Greenland, but they are investing in these new shipping lanes, and this is happening,” he continued. Rare earth minerals and the green transition Various sites on the island are also a potential source of rare earth minerals, which may be another temptation for the US. According to Thomas Varming, Senior Geologist and geophysicist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), many of these deposits that we have are actually crucial for doing this green transition. “Minerals that have to go into batteries, lithium, graphite, and also elements that go into super-strong magnets that you use in wind turbines or your electric cars or if you want to electrify your trains and stuff like that,” he said. “These are super important.” Trump denies mineral ambitions For his part, Donald Trump has denied minerals are part of his calculus, insisting it’s all down to national security – and it’s true that huge investment would be required to make these untapped deposits viable. The Nobel Peace Prize grievance Finally, according to Trump himself, his actions have been partly influenced by the fact that he wasn’t awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Last year’s prize went to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado . In a message to Norway’s Prime Minister, Trump wrote : “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace”. Greenlanders push back As for Greenlanders themselves, most are firmly against a US takeover, with a 2025 poll showing 85 per cent opposed it. “Of course, we are not for sale. We are a free people, we have always been free people,” said Greenland resident Aviaq Brand. “It’s very clear that we want our own country for ourselves and we won’t receive anything from Trump, no matter what,” said another resident, Tikeraq Knudsen. Greenland Minister for Natural Resources Naaja Nathanielsen said, “We have always welcomed collaboration with the outside world and with the US. And now we are talked about being occupied or bought. It is unacceptable.” Where things now stand Trump has now ruled out tariffs and military force, saying he’s reached a framework for a deal with NATO’s secretary general, Mark Rutte: “Really fantastic for the USA. Gets everything we wanted, including especially real national security and international security,” said Trump. While the details of the deal are still to be worked out, it seems Trump has fallen short of his goal of taking over all of the Danish territory.

      "summary_en": "Greenland is a land of snow and ice, home to only 57,000 people. Yet Donald Trump’s desire to control it has caused protests in Greenland itself together with unprecedented tensions with European allies. And at one point even seemed to risk military confrontation between North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) members. The US President has now backed down from his threat of tariffs and has ruled out military action. But why is Donald Trump so interested in Greenland? Here’s what he’s said about it himself: “We need it for strategic national security and international security. And the fact is, no nation or any group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland, other than the United States.” Greenland’s strategic military location Greenland, a Danish territory, certainly does occupy a strategic position. It’s at one end of what’s called the G-I-UK gap, between Greenland, Iceland and the UK. Much of Russia’s navy needs to cross this gap to access the Atlantic. Sitting near the top of the world, Greenland is also on the shortest route between the US and Russia, which could be used by missiles in case of a conflict. “If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it. Those missiles would be flying right over the centre of that piece of ice,” said Trump. Canada, Russia and China in Trump’s calculations Control of Greenland would also mean that US territory would nearly surround Canada, another country that Trump says he wants to annex. For Trump, the main threat to Greenland comes from Russia and China. Nato’s top commander agrees they’re stepping up activity in the region. “We certainly see Russia and China working together. We have had Chinese vessels patrolling with Russia, not only on the north coast of Russia but also north of Alaska and near Canada. And it’s not for peaceful purposes. They’re not studying the seals and the polar bears,” said Alexus Gregory Grynkewich, the Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Existing US military presence However, the US has long had a military presence in Greenland, under a Cold War deal first signed in 1951. It still has the Pituffik Space Base, which was visited by US Vice President JD Vance in March 2025 . According to Patrick Schröder of the Chatham House think tank, the US could already have boosted its defences without antagonising its European allies. “There are existing arrangements between the United States and Denmark that allow the United States to have military bases and facilities and deploy military within Greenland,” he said. “There’s no need for Greenland to be part of the United States in order to do so. And in the context of Arctic security, there’s a need for close collaboration. Denmark’s foreign minister already indicated he would welcome more US troops and military cooperation to collectively boost security in the Arctic,” said Schröder. Melting ice and new global trade routes Another reason Trump could be interested in Greenland is global trade. With temperatures rising, the melting ice is making new shipping routes possible in the Arctic, with some opening up around Greenland. According to Schröder, China is already actively exploring new shipping routes, which would enable shipments coming to Europe without having gone through the Suez Canal. “This is maybe also something that President Trump had in mind when he was talking about, if we don’t take Greenland, then China and Russia will. But again, these are two separate issues: there’s no immediate threat of China or Russia taking over Greenland, but they are investing in these new shipping lanes, and this is happening,” he continued.

      "summary_orig": "Israel said on Monday it would only allow pedestrians to travel through the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt as part of its “limited reopening ” once it has recovered the remains of the last captive in the Palestinian territory. Reopening Rafah, a vital entry point for aid into Gaza, forms part of a truce framework announced by US President Donald Trump in October, but the crossing has remained closed since Israeli forces took control of it during the conflict in the besieged Palestinian territory. Visiting US envoys had reportedly pressed Israeli officials to reopen the crossing during talks in Jerusalem over the weekend. World leaders and aid agencies have repeatedly pushed for more humanitarian convoys to be able to access Gaza, which has been left devastated by more than two years of bombardment and depends on the inflow of essential medical equipment, food and other supplies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Monday that Israel had agreed to a reopening “for pedestrian passage only, subject to a full Israeli inspection mechanism”. The move would depend on “the return of all living hostages and a 100 per cent effort by Hamas to locate and return all deceased hostages”, it said on X. It remained unclear whether the reopening would allow medical patients to leave Gaza for treatment in Egypt or other countries. The Israeli military said it was searching a cemetery in the Gaza Strip on Sunday for the remains of the last captive, Ran Gvili. “Upon completion of this operation, and in accordance with what has been agreed upon with the US, Israel will open the Rafah Crossing,” said Netanyahu’s office. The announcement came after Gaza’s newly appointed administrator, Ali Shaath , said the crossing would open “in both directions” this week. “For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate, it is a lifeline and a symbol of opportunity,” Shaath said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday. Israeli media had also reported that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner had urged Netanyahu to reopen Rafah during their Jerusalem talks. Before the conflict erupted in October 2023, Rafah had been the only gateway connecting Gazans to the outside world and enabling international humanitarian aid to enter the territory, home to 2.2 million people living under Israeli blockade. Last captive A spokesman for Hamas’s Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida, said on Sunday that the group had “provided mediators with all the details and information in our possession regarding the location of the captive’s body”, referring to Gvili. Obeida added that “the enemy (Israel) is currently searching one of the sites based on information transmitted by the Al-Qassam Brigades”. Except for Gvili, all of the 251 people taken captive have been returned, whether living or dead. A non-commissioned officer in the Israeli police’s elite Yassam unit, Gvili was killed in action on the day of the attack and his body was taken to Gaza. The first phase of the US-backed ceasefire deal had stipulated that Hamas hand over all the captives in Gaza. Gvili’s family has expressed strong opposition to launching the second phase of the plan, which includes reopening Rafah, before they have received his remains. “First and foremost, Ran must be brought home,” his family said in a statement on Sunday. The Gaza war flattened much of Gaza, a territory that was already suffering severely from previous rounds of fighting and from an Israeli blockade imposed since 2007. The two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas has left at least 71,657 Palestinians dead in Gaza, according to the territory’s health ministry, figures considered reliable by the United Nations.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Lawyers staged a protest on Monday at the main gate of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the arrest and sentencing of lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, in the controversial social media posts case. The protest was led by IHC Bar President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani. Senior lawyer Babar Awan and a large number of advocates from the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC), High Court Bar and District Bar also participated in the protest. They carried banners reading “Justice for Lawyers” and raised slogans against the police. Addressing the gathering, Awan said that “state and police terrorism” was being carried out against lawyers, adding that such actions were harmful for society. Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA), IBC and Islamabad District Bar jointly announced a strike. However, lawyers appeared in the high court only in urgent matters. Due to the protest, strict security arrangements were made in and around the IHC, with a heavy police contingent deployed and armoured vehicles stationed outside the court premises. The issue of the strike also came up during the hearing of a civil case before Chief Justice Sarfaraz Dogar. Advocate Qaiser Abbas Gondal informed the court that the bar had called for a strike due to the arrest of lawyers. When the chief justice asked which lawyers had been arrested, Gondal replied that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha had been taken into custody. The chief justice then asked whether they were considered lawyers. No reply was given. CJ Dogar observed that if the bar considered them lawyers, their representatives could convey their position in chambers. Due to the lawyers’ strike, proceedings in several cases were affected. In a separate statement, IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Jajja said lawyers were requested not to appear in court as part of the strike. He announced that lawyers would proceed to the district courts in a convoy and later gather again to record their protest. On Saturday, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka sentenced Imaan and Hadi to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in the case. The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad. The NCCIA complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.",

      "summary_orig": "A powerful winter storm spread a paralyzing mix of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Ohio Valley and mid-South to New England on Sunday, compounded by bitter, Arctic cold gripping much of the US east of the Rockies. Winter storm warnings were posted for most of the eastern third of the United States covering 118 million people, as the deep freeze strained energy supplies in some areas, and the National Weather Service predicted widespread, prolonged travel disruptions. An estimated 157 million Americans were warned to bundle up against cold ranging from sub-zero temperatures along the Canadian border to below-freezing as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The Arctic blast was accompanied by gusty conditions that sent wind-chill conditions a measure of how cold it feels based on the rate of heat loss from the body plunging as low as minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern Plains. Deep snow, thick ice Some of the heaviest snowfall, up to one foot or more since the storm developed on Friday, was measured on Sunday in parts of Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had mobilized National Guard troops in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley to assist with the state’s emergency storm response. A worker clears snow from a White House driveway as a major winter storm spreads across a large swath of the United States, in Washington, D.C., US, January 25, 2026. — Reuters The onslaught of snow, ice and winds hit air travel especially hard, with major carriers forced to cancel more than 11,000 U.S. flights scheduled for Sunday, according to an industry tracking service FlightAware.com . Ronald Reagan National Airport, located in northern Virginia just across the Potomac River from Washington, was effectively closed altogether. Airports serving other major metropolitan areas, including New York, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina, had at least 80% of their Sunday flights canceled, FlightAware data showed. Power outages were widespread across the South, where freezing rain deposited layers of ice up to an inch thick, toppling tree limbs and transmission lines. More than 1 million homes and businesses in eight states from Texas to the Carolinas were without electricity at the height of the storm on Sunday, according to utility data posted online. Tennessee bore the greatest brunt of energy cuts, accounting for about a third of all the outages. More than 800,000 electricity customers remained without power as of 0229 GMT, according to PowerOutage.us . Federal, state governments declare emergencies In parts of the mid-Atlantic, heavy snow early in the day gave way to sleet and freezing rain, adding to treacherous driving conditions and making it more difficult for street crews to safely clear road surfaces. People walk amid a major winter storm spreading across a large swath of the United States, in Brooklyn, New York City, US, January 25, 2026. — Reuters Heavy ice was reported by the weather service to be accumulating across the interior sections of the Eastern seaboard as far south as Atlanta, as the low-pressure system driving the storm moved through the Appalachian Mountains. Calling the storm “historic,” President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations for a dozen states, mostly in the mid-South. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia declared weather emergencies on Saturday. The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorizing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state. On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorize grid operator PJM Interconnection to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits. While the storm system was expected to drift away from the East Coast into the Atlantic on Monday, more Arctic air was forecast to rush in behind it, prolonging bitter cold, icy conditions over the next few days, the weather service said. “The situation with this storm is pretty unique, just because it’s going to stay cold for a period of time,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on the “Fox News Sunday Briefing” program. “This ice that has fallen will keep those (power) lines heavy, even if they haven’t gone down immediately.”",

Ronald Reagan National Airport, located in northern Virginia just across the Potomac River from Washington, was effectively closed altogether. Airports serving other major metropolitan areas, including New York, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina, had at least 80% of their Sunday flights canceled, FlightAware data showed. Power outages were widespread across the South, where freezing rain deposited layers of ice up to an inch thick, toppling tree limbs and transmission lines. More than 1 million homes and businesses in eight states from Texas to the Carolinas were without electricity at the height of the storm on Sunday, according to utility data posted online. Tennessee bore the greatest brunt of energy cuts, accounting for about a third of all the outages. More than 800,000 electricity customers remained without power as of 0229 GMT, according to PowerOutage.us .

Calling the storm “historic,” President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations for a dozen states, mostly in the mid-South. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia declared weather emergencies on Saturday. The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorizing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state. On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorize grid operator PJM Interconnection to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits. While the storm system was expected to drift away from the East Coast into the Atlantic on Monday, more Arctic air was forecast to rush in behind it, prolonging bitter cold, icy conditions over the next few days, the weather service said. “The situation with this storm is pretty unique, just because it’s going to stay cold for a period of time,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on the “Fox News Sunday Briefing” program. “This ice that has fallen will keep those (power) lines heavy, even if they haven’t gone down immediately.”",

      "summary": "A powerful winter storm spread a paralyzing mix of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Ohio Valley and mid-South to New England on Sunday, compounded by bitter, Arctic cold gripping much of the US east of the Rockies. Winter storm warnings were posted for most of the eastern third of the United States covering 118 million people, as the deep freeze strained energy supplies in some areas, and the National Weather Service predicted widespread, prolonged travel disruptions. An estimated 157 million Americans were warned to bundle up against cold ranging from sub-zero temperatures along the Canadian border to below-freezing as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The Arctic blast was accompanied by gusty conditions that sent wind-chill conditions a measure of how cold it feels based on the rate of heat loss from the body plunging as low as minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern Plains. Deep snow, thick ice Some of the heaviest snowfall, up to one foot or more since the storm developed on Friday, was measured on Sunday in parts of Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had mobilized National Guard troops in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley to assist with the state’s emergency storm response.

      "summary_orig": "MUZAFFARABAD: Kashmiri activists staged a symbolic sit-in to condemn the unrelenting reign of terror in India-held Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday, a day ahead of India’s so-called Republic Day. The demonstration, staged outside Muzaffarabad Press Club under the aegis of Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu Kashmir (PHJK) — an organisation of post-1989 Kashmiri refugees — was aimed at drawing attention to the Indian occupation machinery’s brutal acts in the held territory and the enforcement of a slew of draconian laws. Posters and banners depicting various forms of repression in occupied Jammu and Kashmir were displayed at the venue of the sit-in where participants raised slogans against India’s sham democracy and the continued subjugation of Kashmiris. Right to self-determination They demanded their internationally recognised right to self-determination, and also called on the United Nations (UN) to intervene. Kashmiri refugees stage sit-in, urge international community to intervene “Down with India’s farcical democracy” and “UNO, wake up and come to our rescue” were among the slogans chanted. Addressing the gathering, PHJK chairman Uzair Ahmed Ghazali said India’s decision of August 5, 2019 had not only stripped Kashmiris of their political status but had also deprived them of their all human, social and democratic rights. He said thousands of Kashmiris demanding the inalienable right to self-determination had been killed in extrajudicial actions, while youths continued to be targeted in staged encounters. “While Muhammad Maqbool Butt and Muhammad Afzal Guru were sent to the gallows despite their innocence, several Hurriyat leaders died in custody due to systematic torture,” he said. ‘Serious war crimes’ “India is a terrorist state and its savage military apparatus is using black laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, Public Safety Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act with impunity to collectively punish Kashmiris,” he added. Mr Ghazali pointed out that sexual violence against women was being used as a weapon of war by Indian forces, resulting in thousands of widows and orphans, and added that mass graves were evidence of ‘serious war crimes’. Other speakers said demographic changes, land seizures, curbs on religious and cultural expression and a prolonged media blackout had turned occupied Kashmir into an open prison, where residents were living under curfews and security restrictions amid a heavy troop presence. The organisers urged the UN and the international community to take notice of the situation in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, seek independent investigations into grave violations and facilitate the implementation of UN resolutions granting Kashmiris the right to self-determination. Prominent among those who participated in the sit-in were Ghulam Mehdi Dar, Usman Ali Hashim, Faisal Farooq Sheikh, Iqbal Yaseen Awan, Muhammad Fayaz Khan, Khawaja Muhammad Sadiq, Muhammad Younis Mir, Muhammad Aslam Inqalabi, Muhammad Ashfaq Kashmiri, Imtiaz Khan and Syed Khalid Shah.

      "summary_orig": "MINNEAPOLIS: The fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal immigration agents Saturday has triggered a wave of criticism from local leaders to Hollywood stars, with conflicting accounts raising questions about the incident. Federal agents shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, less than three weeks after an Immigration and Cus­toms Enforcement (ICE) officer killed Renee Good, also 37. While the Department of Homeland Security said Pretti carried a pistol and ammunition, cellphone footage has challenged the government’s description. Minnesota Gov Tim Walz called the shooting “horrific” and demanded state authorities take charge. “The federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period,” Walz told a news conference. Pretti’s parents described him as a “kindhearted soul” and disputed the official narrative. “The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said in a statement. “Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked.” Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, said Pretti was a nurse working “to support critically ill Veterans.” Political fallout spread to Was­hington, with Sen Bill Cassidy, a Republican, writing on X that the credibility of ICE and DHS is at stake. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation,” Cassidy wrote. “We can trust the American people with the truth.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged President Donald Trump to end the immigration operation. “This is a moment to act like a leader,” Frey said. “Put Min­neapolis, put America first in this moment — let’s achieve peace.” The incident also drew condemnation at the Sundance Film Festival. Olivia Wilde said the shooting was “unfathomable.” “I can’t bel­i­eve that we’re watching people get murdered in the street,” she told AFP at “The Invite” premiere. “These brave Americans who have stepped out to protest the injustice of these ICE quote/unquote ‘officers,’ and watching them be murdered — it’s unfathomable. We cannot normalise it.” Natalie Portman became emotional as she described her feelings about a “horrible day”. “What is happening in our country is just obscene,” she told AFP . Gun rights advocates voiced concern over the administration linking Pretti’s legal gun possession to an intent to harm. After a federal prosecutor suggested shooting armed protesters is often justified, the National Rifle Association called the sentiment “dangerous and wrong”. The Gun Owners of America added, “The Second Amendment protects Americans’ right to bear arms while protesting — a right the federal government must not infringe upon.” Barack and Michelle Obama on Sunday forcefully condemned the killing of Pretti, saying in a joint statement it should be a “wake-up call” that core US values “are increasingly under assault.” The former president and first lady blasted Trump and his government as seeming “eager to escalate the situation,” demanding they work with Walz and other local officials.

      "summary_orig": "• Israeli soldier being investigated for faking Palestinian’s abduction for ransom • US envoy Steve Witkoff calls talks with Netanyahu ‘positive’ CAIRO: In another violation of the US-brokered ceasefire, Israeli troops killed two more Palestinians in the Tuffah neighbourhood in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday, and an Israeli drone wounded four others in a separate incident in Gaza City, local health authorities said. On Saturday, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians, two of them teenagers, in two drone attacks in Gaza. Medical workers said an Israeli drone exploded on the rooftop of a multi-floor building in Gaza City, wounding four Palestinians in the street nearby. There was no comment by the Israeli military on either incident. Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the indiscriminate Israeli bombing. The Gaza health ministry says more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Israeli fire since then. It says that at least 480 people were killed by Israeli fire since the ceasefire agreement came into effect last October. Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza, and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory’s administration. Meanwhile, in Khan Younis, over a hundred people attended the funeral of a person who was killed by Israeli drone attack on Saturday, after holding special prayers in front of his white-shrouded body at the morgue in Nasser Hospital. “They are liars, there is no ceasefire,” said Fares Erheimat, a relative of the dead man, during the funeral. Ransom case Israeli military said on Sunday it had launched an investigation into a soldier who reportedly fabricated a kidnapping of a Palestinian detainee and demanded ransom from his family. The Palestinian man had been detained at a holding facility when a military police guard photographed him and sent the image to his family, falsely claiming he had been kidnapped, the Times of Israel reported . In a separate report, Israeli Army Radio said the soldier demanded the family transfer money in exchange for his release. Confirming the case, the military said an investigation had been launched but declined to provide details. US envoys, Netanyahu discuss Rafah US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reopen the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt during talks in Jerusalem, Israeli media reported Sunday. The reports came after a newly appointed administrator for Gaza said on Thursday that the crossing would be operational in both directions next week. Israeli news site Ynet reported, citing an unnamed Israeli official, that while the meeting between Netanyahu, Witkoff and Kushner was “positive”, Witkoff pressed Israel to reopen Rafah even before Hamas returns remains of the last Israeli prisoner believed to be held in Gaza. According to the official, Witkoff also raised the possibility of Turkiye playing a role in Gaza’s future. “Witkoff pushed to bring our greatest rival, Turkiye, to our border,” the official was quoted as saying. The official also accused Witkoff of acting on behalf of Doha, saying he had “become a lobbyist for Qatari interests”, according to Ynet. US officials’ discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the second phase of President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza were constructive, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday. “The United States and Israel maintain a strong and longstanding relationship built on close coordination and shared priorities. The discussion was constructive and positive, with both sides aligned on next steps and the importance of continued cooperation on all matters critical to the region,” Witkoff said in an X post. The talks were held on Saturday, he said. Published in Dawn, January 26th, 2026",

In a separate report, Israeli Army Radio said the soldier demanded the family transfer money in exchange for his release. Confirming the case, the military said an investigation had been launched but declined to provide details. US envoys, Netanyahu discuss Rafah US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reopen the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt during talks in Jerusalem, Israeli media reported Sunday. The reports came after a newly appointed administrator for Gaza said on Thursday that the crossing would be operational in both directions next week. Israeli news site Ynet reported, citing an unnamed Israeli official, that while the meeting between Netanyahu, Witkoff and Kushner was “positive”, Witkoff pressed Israel to reopen Rafah even before Hamas returns remains of the last Israeli prisoner believed to be held in Gaza. According to the official, Witkoff also raised the possibility of Turkiye playing a role in Gaza’s future. “Witkoff pushed to bring our greatest rival, Turkiye, to our border,” the official was quoted as saying. The official also accused Witkoff of acting on behalf of Doha, saying he had “become a lobbyist for Qatari interests”, according to Ynet. US officials’ discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the second phase of President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza were constructive, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday. “The United States and Israel maintain a strong and longstanding relationship built on close coordination and shared priorities. The discussion was constructive and positive, with both sides aligned on next steps and the importance of continued cooperation on all matters critical to the region,” Witkoff said in an X post. The talks were held on Saturday, he said. Published in Dawn, January 26th, 2026",

      "summary": "• Israeli soldier being investigated for faking Palestinian’s abduction for ransom • US envoy Steve Witkoff calls talks with Netanyahu ‘positive’ CAIRO: In another violation of the US-brokered ceasefire, Israeli troops killed two more Palestinians in the Tuffah neighbourhood in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday, and an Israeli drone wounded four others in a separate incident in Gaza City, local health authorities said. On Saturday, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians, two of them teenagers, in two drone attacks in Gaza. Medical workers said an Israeli drone exploded on the rooftop of a multi-floor building in Gaza City, wounding four Palestinians in the street nearby. There was no comment by the Israeli military on either incident. Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the indiscriminate Israeli bombing. The Gaza health ministry says more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Israeli fire since then. It says that at least 480 people were killed by Israeli fire since the ceasefire agreement came into effect last October. Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza, and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory’s administration. Meanwhile, in Khan Younis, over a hundred people attended the funeral of a person who was killed by Israeli drone attack on Saturday, after holding special prayers in front of his white-shrouded body at the morgue in Nasser Hospital. “They are liars, there is no ceasefire,” said Fares Erheimat, a relative of the dead man, during the funeral.

      "summary_orig": "Death has a way of rearranging the furniture of life. Drawers that have remained shut are opened and stories whose memory has grown faint re-emerge with greater clarity. If you’re lucky, you’ll find something insightful in what’s been left behind by the dearly departed. And, on the rare occasion, you may just find something revelatory. You may just find a bundle of 159 letters tied together with a string, charting one man and his family’s extraordinary circumstances from 1971 to 1974. This is that man, and that family’s, story. The 159 letters written by my Nana [maternal grandfather], Saiyid Safdar Nawab, emerge a few days after his passing on December 26, 2025. They tell a story that spans the length and breadth of the Subcontinent, much like the fortunes of my family itself. But, as with most stories, we’ll have to start at the beginning. From 1971 to 1974, Saiyid Safdar Nawab wrote more than 150 letters to his family in Pakistan while he was held in India as a prisoner of war (POW) after the 1971 Indo-Pak war. The letters, discovered upon his death in December, present a poignant portrait of what it was like to live in POW camps for three years, separated from his family and his life back home, and the agonising wait for a return… Born in Aligarh in 1932 to a father who was a sessions court judge, Safdar Nawab migrated to West Pakistan at the age of 20. After completing his postgraduate studies in physics, he joined the Army Education Corps (AEC) in May 1957 and taught at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) for more than 10 years. In 1971, following the closure of the MT (military training) Directorate at the General Heaquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, he was asked to join the Martial Law Headquarters in Dhaka as a G-2 (an information collection and analysis role). The officer initially chosen for the task wiggled his way out of the job and so, through a strange twist of fate, Safdar Nawab landed in Dhaka (or, as he spells it in adherence to its colonial-era spelling, “Dacca”) in August 1971. His wife and two children stayed back at their home on Hythe Road in Rawalpindi. By this point, tensions were already high as Pakistan’s military action in East Pakistan had begun on March 25, 1971 — and things were only set to escalate even further once the Indian army marched into East Pakistan a few months later. After the Indo-Pak war in December of that year, the Pakistan military personnel stationed in Pakistan’s former Eastern wing became prisoners of war (POWs). It is in the immediate aftermath of the war that Safdar Nawab sent his first letter from this collection of 159. Saiyid Safdar Nawab pictured as a captain after joining the Pakistan army IN ‘DACCA’ Written on December 27, 1971, it is addressed to his wife, Shahnaz Nawab, his son, Syed Raza Nawab (aged 11), and his daughter, Mahnaz Nawab (aged two). It is written on an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) message form, which has instructions on it in English, Urdu and Bengali. A stamp on the paper states, “Prisoner of War Mail”, while an instruction declares “Not over 25 words, family news of strictly personal character only.” The details mentioned on the form are as follows: Sender : Major SS Nawab AEC Postal Address: HQ MLA Sector 5 ZONE B CAMP B c/o ABPO-99 Dacca Cantt Country: East Pakistan Receiver: Mrs Shahnaz Nawab Postal Address: 4-A, Hythe Road, Rawalpindi Cantt, West Pakistan The message reads: “I wish and pray that you are well. I am fine and hope to see you all soon. We move out of Dacca in two weeks’ time.” But, as the stamped date in the corner reveals, this message form doesn’t reach the Rawalpindi General Post Office (GPO) till February 21, 1972. In fact, the more than dozen letters that he writes over the course of those initial four months after the war are written without him even knowing whether his words are reaching his family. Nevertheless, he keeps writing. From giving personal updates in early January, such as “I am still in Dacca and quite comfortable. Our messing arrangements are excellent. Most of the time we spend working for the welfare of our men. I am in perfect health”, to trying to give reassurances during an uncertain time — “I am not sure if you have read my letters. I have been writing frequently. We may move out tomorrow. Shall write on reaching the next station with my address. Don’t write back for the time being. I am fine and fit. Have no worries about me. Look after yourself and pray for an early reunion” — he keeps writing. For those few months after the war, while he keeps sending his posts, his loved ones back home have no knowledge of his whereabouts or his well-being. However, after January 16, 1972, Safdar Nawab doesn’t write a letter for another 10 days. The reason why becomes apparent in what he sends next. TRAIN TO INDIA When he writes again, it is on a plain-looking postcard sent on January 26, 1972, but now the instructions on it are in English and Hindi. “Prisoner of War Mail” remains emblazoned in the corner and now his details read as follows: Name: Major Safdar Nawab Place and date of birth: Aligarh, 1.7.32 Prisoner of War No . S-4684 Name of camp: No 33 c/o APO 56 Country where posted: India He is now a POW in the land of his birth. While the Rawalpindi mailing address on the card stays the same, the country the card is being sent to is referred to as “West Pakistan.” This is the last time it will be referred to by this name in these exchanges. Safdar Nawab says: “I am sorry I could not write for over 10 days. We left Dacca on the 17th and arrived here near Roorkee on the 24th. It was a long but interesting and comfortable journey… I am keeping fine health and hope that you all are also well. Please look after yourselves. Tomorrow is Eid — Eid Mubarak to all of you.” His journey from Dhaka into the hinterland of India was indeed “interesting” as he passed through Uttar Pradesh (UP) and lands he was all too familiar with during his youth. This message also betrays a glimpse of the watchful eye that the Indian army must keep on these cards, letters, notes sent by POWs as the words “near Roorkee” have been slashed out, but its mention shall surface in later letters. The majority of these 159 missives are written in English, with some longer, more detailed ones in Urdu scattered in between. His stay here in Roorkee proves to be only temporary, as he reveals in his next letter, sent on February 11, 1972. The country of mailing is now simply referred to as “Pakistan” and Safdar Nawab pens: “Last week we have moved from Camp 33 to Camp 54. It is in Central India. We have good company with us. Noor [ul Haq] and Zuberi are also here.” But there are no letters arriving for him from Pakistan, and it seems this absence is gnawing at him as much as the captivity itself. After it seems like the Indian POW postcards are not reaching his family, Safdar Nawab writes a letter on a page from a notepad and places it in an envelope that has a green Pakistani postage stamp on it that proudly displays the country’s name in Urdu, English and Bengali like a remnant from a fractured dream. The envelope has been stamped by the ICRC Islamabad. The contents of this letter sent on March 6, 1972 addressed to Shahnaz Nawab read as follows: “For the last three-and-a-half months, I haven’t heard anything. We don’t understand why the mail hasn’t reached us. I only wish you are getting my letters”, and “I have been writing very regularly to you. Since December last year, I haven’t received any letter from you… We left Dacca on January 17, reached Roorkee on the 24th. On February 7th we came to this camp, which is near Sagar in CP [Central Province]. Life over here is very drab… I hope that we will soon meet… I am confident you will stand with courage… I am anxious to know about your welfare.” It is also evident in several of the letters sent across March 1972 that Safdar Nawab is trying to assuage and allay what he perceives will be his family’s fears regarding news of trouble in some of the POW camps in India: “You might have heard some news about one of the camps in India. It is all well with us… We are all safe in this camp… There is nothing to do for us [here] and we spend the days quietly in our quarters.” He spends all of April 1972 without receiving a single word from his family and without knowing if they have any information of his present situation. And then, finally, a breakthrough. (Left) A draft for an article titled 'Bring Back Our POWs' written by Shahnaz Nawab. (Right) A booklet published by the National Council for Repatriation of POWs in 1973 calling for the release of Pakistani prisoners of war held in India LIFE IN CAMP 54 The excitement is palpable in the message he writes on May 2, 1972: “Received your [Shahnaz Nawab’s] three letters just now. The latest one, on this address, is dated April 1, 1972. The other two letters are addressed to Camp 33, dated March 1 and March 4. I felt much relieved on receiving these message forms after a gap of four-and-a-half months.” Now that the channel of communication has been established, husband and wife begin exchanging updates with one another as, from inside Camp 54, Safdar Nawab continues to plan a future. He writes about potentially having a house built in Rawalpindi, whether the finances are being managed alright, his children’s schooling and how the rest of the wider family is doing. They both tell each other to not worry. If anything, the knowledge of what is happening back home offers him an escape from the “monotonous life” in Camp 54. He offers us a window into what day-to-day life would have been like in those POW camps and, on May 6, 1972, he notes: “Food arrangements over here are satisfactory. We are five of us in a neat little house. Running water with electricity is available. Overall, it is not bad. There is good company of our officers around and we are quite comfortable… There is enough time for prayers. Playing bridge is another pass-time [sic]. We are also getting Rs 110 per month as an allowance, which is mostly spent on eatables. Eggs, jams, fruits, fish, butter, achaar, milk, Ovaltine, squash etc are available in the canteen. There are books to read as well.” He continues: “Yesterday each of us received one Pakistani packet containing towels, socks, biscuits, toothpaste, sleeping suit, chappal, PT shoes etc etc, in all 19 articles. Though we didn’t need all that, it was most welcome. Everybody felt extremely delighted and proud. You may please convey thanks to the authorities in Pakistan responsible for the gifts. This was from the Ministry of Defence through the Pak Red Cross. The morale of our men over here is high. None of us would like our government to bargain at our cost. We are ready for all sacrifices for the sake of our country… Inshallah, we will return soon, but with honour.” But while his letters continue to state that his living conditions are satisfactory, it is evident that the concern for his wife and children in Rawalpindi is perhaps taking more of a toll on him than his own situation: “Your letters have given me great strength and have helped me in keeping my morale up. However, I often feel that you must have undergone the greatest test and mental agony during the last one year… I wish I could do something more to console you than just writing letters.” On August 5, 1972 he writes, “It has now been over a year since I left Pindi”, and that sense of melancholy seeps through in his letter on August 10, 1972: “In your latest letter, you have said that she [Mahnaz Nawab] is speaking many sentences now. This is the most interesting age for her… I shall ever miss this period of her life.” He is meticulous about keeping track of the letters and the dates on which he has received or sent them, and the information he has conveyed in them. His letters detail how Ramazan, Eid and Muharram are all observed in the camp. How “volleyball and cricket matches [are held] amongst 300 officers in the camp”, and how he buys “Illustrated Weekly of India and Daily Times of India regularly”, listens to the “transistor radio” and is “collecting the pages of Dennis the Menace cartoons” for his son. A few letters are written in delight after receiving parcels sent by his wife “containing one nylon shirt, one pyjama, one jersey, one vest and one pair of socks” and “four biscuit packets, two BP toffee packets, two packets of fruit drops, two special British toffees and a big chocolate packet.” He also reminds his wife: “Probably I had written to you earlier that I am carrying all my personal belongings with me which I had at Dacca.” While he tells Shahnaz Nawab not to worry herself by sending several parcels, the one and only thing he repeatedly keeps asking for her to send him is a picture of what his family looks like now. The delays in his letters reaching her, and in her letters reaching him, means that several months pass by without this desire being fulfilled. And then, on April 28, 1973, the greatly-anticipated photograph finally arrives: “Received your detailed letter of March 15… and, above all, the most-awaited letter of March 1, enclosing the photograph. The photograph is lovely and I liked it very much. Though it took two months to reach me, but it gave me enormous pleasure.” He looks at his children in the photograph. He does not know when he’ll be able to meet them again. Saiyid Safdar Nawab photographed with his daughter, Mahnaz Nawab, prior to leaving for East Pakistan ‘BRING THEM HOME’ Safdar Nawab, in his letters from 1971 to 1974, is convinced that, sooner or later, he will return home. His hope cannot be dimmed. In June 1972, he writes that he is “praying for a reunion next month.” This optimism is spurred by what he notes in his message form on June 28, 1972: “President [Zulfikar Ali] Bhutto has arrived in Simla today. Let us hope some understanding and settlement is arrived at. The chances of our return are a bit brighter.” After the summit, he writes on July 4, 1972: “The summit is over. Under the circumstances, it is the best bargain... In a couple of months’ time we hope the repatriations will also be completed.” On December 1, 1972 Safdar Nawab writes about a significant development: “The POWs in Pakistan have been released. We have all appreciated the gesture by our president. Hope we will also return soon.” And on December 8, 1972 he notes, “Only yesterday, the decision regarding the withdrawal of troops from the border has been arrived at. Once the troops withdraw, something may follow for us. It appears that it may take us some time more before we return — maybe March/April 1973.” With an eye on the evolving diplomatic situation, he writes on April 10, 1973: “During the last 10 days, since [P.N.] Haksar went to Dacca, it appears that the stalemate is likely to break. It looks that in the near future there will be some good news about our return to Pakistan. By the time you get this letter, something definitive might emerge.” While Safdar Nawab reads the newspapers and listens to the radio to try and get a sense of when the repatriation process may start, his wife is already using her voice to advocate for it. Given her degree in English Literature and background in journalism, Shahnaz Nawab writes articles for several publications and pamphlets calling for the POWs to be freed. When the United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim lands in Rawalpindi in 1973, Shahnaz Nawab (with her daughter in her arms and her son by her side) and many other wives of POWs protest at the airport, demanding Waldheim take action to bring the Pakistani POWs back home. The pressure will soon start to pay off. It has to. FREEDOM IN SIGHT? In the second half of 1973, the repatriation efforts begin to pick up steam. On August 29, 1973, Safdar Nawab observes, “The Indo-Pak talks in Delhi [later known as the Delhi Agreement] have been declared successful. The details are yet to be announced, but the indications are that most of the prisoners of war would be returning home. It is unfortunate that some of our brave soldiers will be further detained in India for more bargaining and exploitation. We hope and pray that the remaining POWs will also return to their families by the end of the year.” Regarding his return, he explains in his letters in September: “With the latest developments and news, it is certain that our return is not far off. The Bengalis and Pakistanis have started moving and the first two trainloads of POWs from India will reach Lahore on the 28th and 29th of this month. With time, the transport and facilities for movement will increase and the flow of traffic will rise. It looks like most of us will be back between October 15 and November 15. “It is understood that we will be detained in Lahore for two to three days before going on two months’ leave with the families… In case you get this letter before my return, please do not come to Lahore to receive me since the date will not be very definite and there will be too much of rush [sic] and you will find it too much of an inconvenience.” With anticipation of his return building, he writes on September 28, 1973: “Today, the repatriation will start at Wagah. We hope that, in due course, the rate will increase and we should be back in a month or two.” By October 12, 1973, he can see that the process is now underway: “Currently, POWs from Agra and Meerut are returning. Their first train will be reaching tomorrow. The names of those returning is announced on Radio Pakistan on the evening a train arrives. Our camp is near the city of Sagar, also known as Dhana. Here, along with our camp, there are five more camps, with nearly 1,000 people.” But, in November, the process slows down: “This process is moving slower than I had expected. Another two three months, I hope… Once the UP camps are emptied, that is when our turn will come,” he writes. And in December: “Temporarily, the process of repatriation has stopped due to railway employees’ strike in India. Hope it will soon restart and all the backlog cleared.” That wait will continue for an agonising amount of time because, on January 18, 1974, Safdar Nawab scribbles a message in the margins shortly before dispatching this letter: “Next four trains from this camp running this month have been announced. I am not leaving this month. See you next month, Inshallah.” But his worries are about to be unexpectedly compounded. In his letter on February 25, 1974, he makes a revelation: “I am sending this letter through Captain Mehboob [Ahmed] who is departing today. We are not allowed to send letters with anyone leaving but because Captain Mehboob is at the hospital [with me] and is leaving for the train from here I’m hoping no one will stop this letter. “Yesterday, I got admitted to the CMH [Combined Military Hospital] here. There is nothing to worry about, it’s just the back pain I wrote to you about. When I walk around too much it gets amplified. According to the Indian surgical specialist, there is nothing wrong with the bones and it will all soon be well on my return to Pakistan. The pain is said to be muscular, aggravated by poor diet and mental worries. “Today the train that departs will be carrying 30 officers…[In] total, till tomorrow, eight trains would have departed from here… Now, nearly 170 officers are left [from our camp]. Nearly 115 officers have been sent home. Hoping the next few trains will be able to accommodate the remaining officers. Next train leaves February 28 and then March 10… They haven’t announced the names for the next train yet. I am praying to God that my name is on it and I can return home by March.” His final letter out of these 159 is written on March 15, 1974 and says, “I am trying to send this letter to you through someone leaving by the train on March 16. There are two more trains to leave this camp in this month, reaching Lahore on March 25 and 29. The names of officers have not been announced yet.” He is not going to be on either one of those trains. THE FINAL JOURNEY He was on the last train to leave “Dacca” for India. Now, Safdar Nawab is on the last POW train to leave India for Pakistan. From Sagar, he travels to Amritsar by train and then boards a bus to Wagah. He crosses over into Lahore on April 21, 1974. Shahnaz Nawab will forever remember this date, especially since it coincides with Allama Iqbal’s death anniversary. Safdar Nawab’s wife and son are there to receive him. On his second day in Lahore, Safdar Nawab heads to the CMH to see the neurosurgeon on his own accord. The doctor tells him to just get some rest. He is told that his full medical check-up will be done in Kharian after two to three months. By the end of 1974, he was promoted to Lt Colonel and, in November 1977, he was made a full colonel and appointed as the principal of Lawrence College in Murree. He retired as a brigadier and went on to work at the Dr A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in Kahuta as the Additional Director Administration. Safdar Nawab lived to the age of 94. He left behind a record of endurance, of a man who stayed present in his own life while being forcibly removed from it. Of a man who, stripped of movement and agency in captivity, did the only thing he could: he wrote himself home. The writer is a member of staff.

      "summary_en": "Death has a way of rearranging the furniture of life. Drawers that have remained shut are opened and stories whose memory has grown faint re-emerge with greater clarity. If you’re lucky, you’ll find something insightful in what’s been left behind by the dearly departed. And, on the rare occasion, you may just find something revelatory. You may just find a bundle of 159 letters tied together with a string, charting one man and his family’s extraordinary circumstances from 1971 to 1974. This is that man, and that family’s, story. The 159 letters written by my Nana [maternal grandfather], Saiyid Safdar Nawab, emerge a few days after his passing on December 26, 2025. They tell a story that spans the length and breadth of the Subcontinent, much like the fortunes of my family itself. But, as with most stories, we’ll have to start at the beginning. From 1971 to 1974, Saiyid Safdar Nawab wrote more than 150 letters to his family in Pakistan while he was held in India as a prisoner of war (POW) after the 1971 Indo-Pak war. The letters, discovered upon his death in December, present a poignant portrait of what it was like to live in POW camps for three years, separated from his family and his life back home, and the agonising wait for a return… Born in Aligarh in 1932 to a father who was a sessions court judge, Safdar Nawab migrated to West Pakistan at the age of 20. After completing his postgraduate studies in physics, he joined the Army Education Corps (AEC) in May 1957 and taught at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) for more than 10 years. In 1971, following the closure of the MT (military training) Directorate at the General Heaquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, he was asked to join the Martial Law Headquarters in Dhaka as a G-2 (an information collection and analysis role). The officer initially chosen for the task wiggled his way out of the job and so, through a strange twist of fate, Safdar Nawab landed in Dhaka (or, as he spells it in adherence to its colonial-era spelling, “Dacca”) in August 1971. His wife and two children stayed back at their home on Hythe Road in Rawalpindi. By this point, tensions were already high as Pakistan’s military action in East Pakistan had begun on March 25, 1971 — and things were only set to escalate even further once the Indian army marched into East Pakistan a few months later. After the Indo-Pak war in December of that year, the Pakistan military personnel stationed in Pakistan’s former Eastern wing became prisoners of war (POWs). It is in the immediate aftermath of the war that Safdar Nawab sent his first letter from this collection of 159. Saiyid Safdar Nawab pictured as a captain after joining the Pakistan army IN ‘DACCA’ Written on December 27, 1971, it is addressed to his wife, Shahnaz Nawab, his son, Syed Raza Nawab (aged 11), and his daughter, Mahnaz Nawab (aged two). It is written on an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) message form, which has instructions on it in English, Urdu and Bengali. A stamp on the paper states, “Prisoner of War Mail”, while an instruction declares “Not over 25 words, family news of strictly personal character only.” The details mentioned on the form are as follows: Sender : Major SS Nawab AEC Postal Address: HQ MLA Sector 5 ZONE B CAMP B c/o ABPO-99 Dacca Cantt Country: East Pakistan Receiver: Mrs Shahnaz Nawab Postal Address: 4-A, Hythe Road, Rawalpindi Cantt, West Pakistan The message reads: “I wish and pray that you are well. I am fine and hope to see you all soon. We move out of Dacca in two weeks’ time.” But, as the stamped date in the corner reveals, this message form doesn’t reach the Rawalpindi General Post Office (GPO) till February 21, 1972. In fact, the more than dozen letters that he writes over the course of those initial four months after the war are written without him even knowing whether his words are reaching his family. Nevertheless, he keeps writing. From giving personal updates in early January, such as “I am still in Dacca and quite comfortable. Our messing arrangements are excellent. Most of the time we spend working for the welfare of our men. I am in perfect health”, to trying to give reassurances during an uncertain time — “I am not sure if you have read my letters. I have been writing frequently. We may move out tomorrow. Shall write on reaching the next station with my address. Don’t write back for the time being. I am fine and fit. Have no worries about me. Look after yourself and pray for an early reunion” — he keeps writing. For those few months after the war, while he keeps sending his posts, his loved ones back home have no knowledge of his whereabouts or his well-being. However, after January 16, 1972, Safdar Nawab doesn’t write a letter for another 10 days. The reason why becomes apparent in what he sends next. TRAIN TO INDIA When he writes again, it is on a plain-looking postcard sent on January 26, 1972, but now the instructions on it are in English and Hindi. “Prisoner of War Mail” remains emblazoned in the corner and now his details read as follows: Name: Major Safdar Nawab Place and date of birth: Aligarh, 1.7.32 Prisoner of War No .

On August 29, 1973, Safdar Nawab observes, “The Indo-Pak talks in Delhi [later known as the Delhi Agreement] have been declared successful. The details are yet to be announced, but the indications are that most of the prisoners of war would be returning home. It is unfortunate that some of our brave soldiers will be further detained in India for more bargaining and exploitation. We hope and pray that the remaining POWs will also return to their families by the end of the year.” Regarding his return, he explains in his letters in September: “With the latest developments and news, it is certain that our return is not far off. The Bengalis and Pakistanis have started moving and the first two trainloads of POWs from India will reach Lahore on the 28th and 29th of this month. With time, the transport and facilities for movement will increase and the flow of traffic will rise. It looks like most of us will be back between October 15 and November 15. “It is understood that we will be detained in Lahore for two to three days before going on two months’ leave with the families… In case you get this letter before my return, please do not come to Lahore to receive me since the date will not be very definite and there will be too much of rush [sic] and you will find it too much of an inconvenience.” With anticipation of his return building, he writes on September 28, 1973: “Today, the repatriation will start at Wagah. We hope that, in due course, the rate will increase and we should be back in a month or two.” By October 12, 1973, he can see that the process is now underway: “Currently, POWs from Agra and Meerut are returning. Their first train will be reaching tomorrow. The names of those returning is announced on Radio Pakistan on the evening a train arrives. Our camp is near the city of Sagar, also known as Dhana. Here, along with our camp, there are five more camps, with nearly 1,000 people.” But, in November, the process slows down: “This process is moving slower than I had expected. Another two three months, I hope… Once the UP camps are emptied, that is when our turn will come,” he writes. And in December: “Temporarily, the process of repatriation has stopped due to railway employees’ strike in India. Hope it will soon restart and all the backlog cleared.” That wait will continue for an agonising amount of time because, on January 18, 1974, Safdar Nawab scribbles a message in the margins shortly before dispatching this letter: “Next four trains from this camp running this month have been announced. I am not leaving this month. See you next month, Inshallah.” But his worries are about to be unexpectedly compounded. In his letter on February 25, 1974, he makes a revelation: “I am sending this letter through Captain Mehboob [Ahmed] who is departing today. We are not allowed to send letters with anyone leaving but because Captain Mehboob is at the hospital [with me] and is leaving for the train from here I’m hoping no one will stop this letter. “Yesterday, I got admitted to the CMH [Combined Military Hospital] here. There is nothing to worry about, it’s just the back pain I wrote to you about. When I walk around too much it gets amplified. According to the Indian surgical specialist, there is nothing wrong with the bones and it will all soon be well on my return to Pakistan. The pain is said to be muscular, aggravated by poor diet and mental worries. “Today the train that departs will be carrying 30 officers…[In] total, till tomorrow, eight trains would have departed from here… Now, nearly 170 officers are left [from our camp]. Nearly 115 officers have been sent home. Hoping the next few trains will be able to accommodate the remaining officers. Next train leaves February 28 and then March 10… They haven’t announced the names for the next train yet. I am praying to God that my name is on it and I can return home by March.” His final letter out of these 159 is written on March 15, 1974 and says, “I am trying to send this letter to you through someone leaving by the train on March 16. There are two more trains to leave this camp in this month, reaching Lahore on March 25 and 29. The names of officers have not been announced yet.” He is not going to be on either one of those trains. THE FINAL JOURNEY He was on the last train to leave “Dacca” for India. Now, Safdar Nawab is on the last POW train to leave India for Pakistan. From Sagar, he travels to Amritsar by train and then boards a bus to Wagah. He crosses over into Lahore on April 21, 1974. Shahnaz Nawab will forever remember this date, especially since it coincides with Allama Iqbal’s death anniversary. Safdar Nawab’s wife and son are there to receive him. On his second day in Lahore, Safdar Nawab heads to the CMH to see the neurosurgeon on his own accord. The doctor tells him to just get some rest. He is told that his full medical check-up will be done in Kharian after two to three months. By the end of 1974, he was promoted to Lt Colonel and, in November 1977, he was made a full colonel and appointed as the principal of Lawrence College in Murree. He retired as a brigadier and went on to work at the Dr A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in Kahuta as the Additional Director Administration. Safdar Nawab lived to the age of 94. He left behind a record of endurance, of a man who stayed present in his own life while being forcibly removed from it. Of a man who, stripped of movement and agency in captivity, did the only thing he could: he wrote himself home. The writer is a member of staff.

      "title": "MISSIVES FROM A PRISONER OF WAR",
      "summary": "Death has a way of rearranging the furniture of life. Drawers that have remained shut are opened and stories whose memory has grown faint re-emerge with greater clarity. If you’re lucky, you’ll find something insightful in what’s been left behind by the dearly departed. And, on the rare occasion, you may just find something revelatory. You may just find a bundle of 159 letters tied together with a string, charting one man and his family’s extraordinary circumstances from 1971 to 1974. This is that man, and that family’s, story. The 159 letters written by my Nana [maternal grandfather], Saiyid Safdar Nawab, emerge a few days after his passing on December 26, 2025. They tell a story that spans the length and breadth of the Subcontinent, much like the fortunes of my family itself. But, as with most stories, we’ll have to start at the beginning. From 1971 to 1974, Saiyid Safdar Nawab wrote more than 150 letters to his family in Pakistan while he was held in India as a prisoner of war (POW) after the 1971 Indo-Pak war. The letters, discovered upon his death in December, present a poignant portrait of what it was like to live in POW camps for three years, separated from his family and his life back home, and the agonising wait for a return… Born in Aligarh in 1932 to a father who was a sessions court judge, Safdar Nawab migrated to West Pakistan at the age of 20. After completing his postgraduate studies in physics, he joined the Army Education Corps (AEC) in May 1957 and taught at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) for more than 10 years. In 1971, following the closure of the MT (military training) Directorate at the General Heaquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, he was asked to join the Martial Law Headquarters in Dhaka as a G-2 (an information collection and analysis role). The officer initially chosen for the task wiggled his way out of the job and so, through a strange twist of fate, Safdar Nawab landed in Dhaka (or, as he spells it in adherence to its colonial-era spelling, “Dacca”) in August 1971. His wife and two children stayed back at their home on Hythe Road in Rawalpindi. By this point, tensions were already high as Pakistan’s military action in East Pakistan had begun on March 25, 1971 — and things were only set to escalate even further once the Indian army marched into East Pakistan a few months later. After the Indo-Pak war in December of that year, the Pakistan military personnel stationed in Pakistan’s former Eastern wing became prisoners of war (POWs). It is in the immediate aftermath of the war that Safdar Nawab sent his first letter from this collection of 159. Saiyid Safdar Nawab pictured as a captain after joining the Pakistan army IN ‘DACCA’ Written on December 27, 1971, it is addressed to his wife, Shahnaz Nawab, his son, Syed Raza Nawab (aged 11), and his daughter, Mahnaz Nawab (aged two). It is written on an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) message form, which has instructions on it in English, Urdu and Bengali. A stamp on the paper states, “Prisoner of War Mail”, while an instruction declares “Not over 25 words, family news of strictly personal character only.” The details mentioned on the form are as follows: Sender : Major SS Nawab AEC Postal Address: HQ MLA Sector 5 ZONE B CAMP B c/o ABPO-99 Dacca Cantt Country: East Pakistan Receiver: Mrs Shahnaz Nawab Postal Address: 4-A, Hythe Road, Rawalpindi Cantt, West Pakistan The message reads: “I wish and pray that you are well. I am fine and hope to see you all soon. We move out of Dacca in two weeks’ time.” But, as the stamped date in the corner reveals, this message form doesn’t reach the Rawalpindi General Post Office (GPO) till February 21, 1972. In fact, the more than dozen letters that he writes over the course of those initial four months after the war are written without him even knowing whether his words are reaching his family. Nevertheless, he keeps writing. From giving personal updates in early January, such as “I am still in Dacca and quite comfortable. Our messing arrangements are excellent. Most of the time we spend working for the welfare of our men. I am in perfect health”, to trying to give reassurances during an uncertain time — “I am not sure if you have read my letters. I have been writing frequently. We may move out tomorrow. Shall write on reaching the next station with my address. Don’t write back for the time being. I am fine and fit. Have no worries about me. Look after yourself and pray for an early reunion” — he keeps writing. For those few months after the war, while he keeps sending his posts, his loved ones back home have no knowledge of his whereabouts or his well-being. However, after January 16, 1972, Safdar Nawab doesn’t write a letter for another 10 days. The reason why becomes apparent in what he sends next. TRAIN TO INDIA When he writes again, it is on a plain-looking postcard sent on January 26, 1972, but now the instructions on it are in English and Hindi. “Prisoner of War Mail” remains emblazoned in the corner and now his details read as follows: Name: Major Safdar Nawab Place and date of birth: Aligarh, 1.7.32 Prisoner of War No . S-4684 Name of camp: No 33 c/o APO 56 Country where posted: India He is now a POW in the land of his birth. While the Rawalpindi mailing address on the card stays the same, the country the card is being sent to is referred to as “West Pakistan.” This is the last time it will be referred to by this name in these exchanges. Safdar Nawab says: “I am sorry I could not write for over 10 days. We left Dacca on the 17th and arrived here near Roorkee on the 24th. It was a long but interesting and comfortable journey… I am keeping fine health and hope that you all are also well. Please look after yourselves. Tomorrow is Eid — Eid Mubarak to all of you.” His journey from Dhaka into the hinterland of India was indeed “interesting” as he passed through Uttar Pradesh (UP) and lands he was all too familiar with during his youth. This message also betrays a glimpse of the watchful eye that the Indian army must keep on these cards, letters, notes sent by POWs as the words “near Roorkee” have been slashed out, but its mention shall surface in later letters. The majority of these 159 missives are written in English, with some longer, more detailed ones in Urdu scattered in between. His stay here in Roorkee proves to be only temporary, as he reveals in his next letter, sent on February 11, 1972. The country of mailing is now simply referred to as “Pakistan” and Safdar Nawab pens: “Last week we have moved from Camp 33 to Camp 54. It is in Central India. We have good company with us. Noor [ul Haq] and Zuberi are also here.” But there are no letters arriving for him from Pakistan, and it seems this absence is gnawing at him as much as the captivity itself. After it seems like the Indian POW postcards are not reaching his family, Safdar Nawab writes a letter on a page from a notepad and places it in an envelope that has a green Pakistani postage stamp on it that proudly displays the country’s name in Urdu, English and Bengali like a remnant from a fractured dream. The envelope has been stamped by the ICRC Islamabad. The contents of this letter sent on March 6, 1972 addressed to Shahnaz Nawab read as follows: “For the last three-and-a-half months, I haven’t heard anything. We don’t understand why the mail hasn’t reached us. I only wish you are getting my letters”, and “I have been writing very regularly to you. Since December last year, I haven’t received any letter from you… We left Dacca on January 17, reached Roorkee on the 24th. On February 7th we came to this camp, which is near Sagar in CP [Central Province]. Life over here is very drab… I hope that we will soon meet… I am confident you will stand with courage… I am anxious to know about your welfare.” It is also evident in several of the letters sent across March 1972 that Safdar Nawab is trying to assuage and allay what he perceives will be his family’s fears regarding news of trouble in some of the POW camps in India: “You might have heard some news about one of the camps in India. It is all well with us… We are all safe in this camp… There is nothing to do for us [here] and we spend the days quietly in our quarters.” He spends all of April 1972 without receiving a single word from his family and without knowing if they have any information of his present situation. And then, finally, a breakthrough. (Left) A draft for an article titled 'Bring Back Our POWs' written by Shahnaz Nawab. (Right) A booklet published by the National Council for Repatriation of POWs in 1973 calling for the release of Pakistani prisoners of war held in India LIFE IN CAMP 54 The excitement is palpable in the message he writes on May 2, 1972: “Received your [Shahnaz Nawab’s] three letters just now. The latest one, on this address, is dated April 1, 1972. The other two letters are addressed to Camp 33, dated March 1 and March 4. I felt much relieved on receiving these message forms after a gap of four-and-a-half months.” Now that the channel of communication has been established, husband and wife begin exchanging updates with one another as, from inside Camp 54, Safdar Nawab continues to plan a future. He writes about potentially having a house built in Rawalpindi, whether the finances are being managed alright, his children’s schooling and how the rest of the wider family is doing. They both tell each other to not worry. If anything, the knowledge of what is happening back home offers him an escape from the “monotonous life” in Camp 54. He offers us a window into what day-to-day life would have been like in those POW camps and, on May 6, 1972, he notes: “Food arrangements over here are satisfactory. We are five of us in a neat little house. Running water with electricity is available. Overall, it is not bad. There is good company of our officers around and we are quite comfortable… There is enough time for prayers. Playing bridge is another pass-time [sic]. We are also getting Rs 110 per month as an allowance, which is mostly spent on eatables. Eggs, jams, fruits, fish, butter, achaar, milk, Ovaltine, squash etc are available in the canteen. There are books to read as well.” He continues: “Yesterday each of us received one Pakistani packet containing towels, socks, biscuits, toothpaste, sleeping suit, chappal, PT shoes etc etc, in all 19 articles. Though we didn’t need all that, it was most welcome. Everybody felt extremely delighted and proud. You may please convey thanks to the authorities in Pakistan responsible for the gifts. This was from the Ministry of Defence through the Pak Red Cross. The morale of our men over here is high. None of us would like our government to bargain at our cost. We are ready for all sacrifices for the sake of our country… Inshallah, we will return soon, but with honour.” But while his letters continue to state that his living conditions are satisfactory, it is evident that the concern for his wife and children in Rawalpindi is perhaps taking more of a toll on him than his own situation: “Your letters have given me great strength and have helped me in keeping my morale up. However, I often feel that you must have undergone the greatest test and mental agony during the last one year… I wish I could do something more to console you than just writing letters.” On August 5, 1972 he writes, “It has now been over a year since I left Pindi”, and that sense of melancholy seeps through in his letter on August 10, 1972: “In your latest letter, you have said that she [Mahnaz Nawab] is speaking many sentences now. This is the most interesting age for her… I shall ever miss this period of her life.” He is meticulous about keeping track of the letters and the dates on which he has received or sent them, and the information he has conveyed in them. His letters detail how Ramazan, Eid and Muharram are all observed in the camp. How “volleyball and cricket matches [are held] amongst 300 officers in the camp”, and how he buys “Illustrated Weekly of India and Daily Times of India regularly”, listens to the “transistor radio” and is “collecting the pages of Dennis the Menace cartoons” for his son. A few letters are written in delight after receiving parcels sent by his wife “containing one nylon shirt, one pyjama, one jersey, one vest and one pair of socks” and “four biscuit packets, two BP toffee packets, two packets of fruit drops, two special British toffees and a big chocolate packet.” He also reminds his wife: “Probably I had written to you earlier that I am carrying all my personal belongings with me which I had at Dacca.” While he tells Shahnaz Nawab not to worry herself by sending several parcels, the one and only thing he repeatedly keeps asking for her to send him is a picture of what his family looks like now. The delays in his letters reaching her, and in her letters reaching him, means that several months pass by without this desire being fulfilled. And then, on April 28, 1973, the greatly-anticipated photograph finally arrives: “Received your detailed letter of March 15… and, above all, the most-awaited letter of March 1, enclosing the photograph. The photograph is lovely and I liked it very much. Though it took two months to reach me, but it gave me enormous pleasure.” He looks at his children in the photograph. He does not know when he’ll be able to meet them again. Saiyid Safdar Nawab photographed with his daughter, Mahnaz Nawab, prior to leaving for East Pakistan ‘BRING THEM HOME’ Safdar Nawab, in his letters from 1971 to 1974, is convinced that, sooner or later, he will return home. His hope cannot be dimmed. In June 1972, he writes that he is “praying for a reunion next month.” This optimism is spurred by what he notes in his message form on June 28, 1972: “President [Zulfikar Ali] Bhutto has arrived in Simla today. Let us hope some understanding and settlement is arrived at. The chances of our return are a bit brighter.” After the summit, he writes on July 4, 1972: “The summit is over. Under the circumstances, it is the best bargain... In a couple of months’ time we hope the repatriations will also be completed.” On December 1, 1972 Safdar Nawab writes about a significant development: “The POWs in Pakistan have been released. We have all appreciated the gesture by our president. Hope we will also return soon.” And on December 8, 1972 he notes, “Only yesterday, the decision regarding the withdrawal of troops from the border has been arrived at. Once the troops withdraw, something may follow for us. It appears that it may take us some time more before we return — maybe March/April 1973.” With an eye on the evolving diplomatic situation, he writes on April 10, 1973: “During the last 10 days, since [P.N.] Haksar went to Dacca, it appears that the stalemate is likely to break. It looks that in the near future there will be some good news about our return to Pakistan. By the time you get this letter, something definitive might emerge.” While Safdar Nawab reads the newspapers and listens to the radio to try and get a sense of when the repatriation process may start, his wife is already using her voice to advocate for it. Given her degree in English Literature and background in journalism, Shahnaz Nawab writes articles for several publications and pamphlets calling for the POWs to be freed. When the United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim lands in Rawalpindi in 1973, Shahnaz Nawab (with her daughter in her arms and her son by her side) and many other wives of POWs protest at the airport, demanding Waldheim take action to bring the Pakistani POWs back home. The pressure will soon start to pay off. It has to. FREEDOM IN SIGHT? In the second half of 1973, the repatriation efforts begin to pick up steam. On August 29, 1973, Safdar Nawab observes, “The Indo-Pak talks in Delhi [later known as the Delhi Agreement] have been declared successful.
