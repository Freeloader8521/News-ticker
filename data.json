      "summary_orig": "A Seoul court on Friday issued a warrant to detain former President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges linked to his alleged drone deployment to North Korea in October last year. The Seoul Central District Court issued the warrant, citing the risk of evidence destruction, according to a special counsel team lead by Cho Eun-suk. Yoon's detention, which was set to expire on Jan. 18, will be extended by up to another six months. Cho's team earlier requested an extension of his arrest while additionally indicting him over the alleged drone operation, which it claimed was aimed at inciting the North's retaliation and using it as a pretext for the martial law declaration in December 2024. The team suspects Yoon gave direct orders to the drone commander to dispatch drones to North Korea without reporting to the defense ministry or the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This is the third time Yoon has been arrested. The first time was in January last year on charges of leading an insurrection, though a court later accepted his request to cancel the arrest, granting his release in March. He was later arrested again in Ju",

      "summary_orig": "Eight Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, on Friday expressed concern at the “deteriorating” humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip — exacerbated by severe weather conditions — and stressed the need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts. In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), expressed their “deepest concern” at the humanitarian situation in Gaza. These countries had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. A fragile ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since October as a result of the effort, with Israel violating the truce multiple times by carrying out attacks in the Gaza Strip. Last month, the UN International Organisation for Migration had said that hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians were facing flooding of their tents and shelters due to heavy rains , and materials for shelters and sandbags were not being allowed to enter the enclave. Much of Gaza’s infrastructure has also been destroyed because of the war, and Palestinians are facing grim living conditions. In their joint statement on Friday, the eight Muslim-majority nations highlighted that severe, harsh, and unstable weather conditions, including heavy rainfall and storms, had exacerbated the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. The situation had been further “compounded by the continued lack of sufficient humanitarian access, acute shortages of essential life-saving supplies, and the slow pace of the entry of essential materials required for the rehabilitation of basic services and the establishment of temporary housing”, the statement said. It added that the “severe weather has laid bare the fragility of existing humanitarian conditions, particularly for almost 1.9 million people, and displaced families living in inadequate shelters.” “Flooded camps, damaged tents, the collapse of damaged buildings and exposure to cold temperatures, coupled with malnutrition, have significantly heightened risks to civilian lives, including due to disease outbreaks, especially among children, women, the elderly, and individuals with medical vulnerabilities.” The foreign ministers, in their joint statement, also lauded the “tireless efforts“ of United Nations’ organisations, in particular the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), and other humanitarian international NGOs, in continuing to assist Palestinian civilians and deliver humanitarian assistance under extremely difficult and complex circumstances. They demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs were able to operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable, and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip. “Any attempt to impede their ability to operate is unacceptable,” the statement said. The foreign ministers also expressed “full support” for a US-drafted resolution that endorses Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza and was adopted by the UN Security Council in November last year. They also reaffirmed their support for Trump’s Gaza plan and their “intention to contribute to the successful implementation thereof, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the ceasefire, bringing an end to the war in Gaza, to secure a dignified life for the Palestinian people who have endured prolonged humanitarian suffering, and leading to a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” . They also called for the “urgent need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts”, including the provision of durable and dignified shelter to protect the population from the severe winter conditions. The joint statement further said that the international community should “uphold its legal and moral responsibilities to pressure Israel, as the occupying power, to immediately lift constraints on the entry and distribution of essential supplies, including tents, shelter materials, medical assistance, clean water, fuel, and sanitation support.” The ministers also called for “immediate, full, and unhindered humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip without any interference by either party, through the UN and its agencies, the rehabilitation of infrastructure and hospitals, and the opening of the Rafah Crossing in both directions as stipulated in President Trump’s plan,” the statement read.",

They also reaffirmed their support for Trump’s Gaza plan and their “intention to contribute to the successful implementation thereof, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the ceasefire, bringing an end to the war in Gaza, to secure a dignified life for the Palestinian people who have endured prolonged humanitarian suffering, and leading to a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” . They also called for the “urgent need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts”, including the provision of durable and dignified shelter to protect the population from the severe winter conditions. The joint statement further said that the international community should “uphold its legal and moral responsibilities to pressure Israel, as the occupying power, to immediately lift constraints on the entry and distribution of essential supplies, including tents, shelter materials, medical assistance, clean water, fuel, and sanitation support.” The ministers also called for “immediate, full, and unhindered humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip without any interference by either party, through the UN and its agencies, the rehabilitation of infrastructure and hospitals, and the opening of the Rafah Crossing in both directions as stipulated in President Trump’s plan,” the statement read.",
      "title": "Pakistan, 7 other Muslim-majority nations express ‘deepest concern’ over deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Gaza",
      "summary": "Eight Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, on Friday expressed concern at the “deteriorating” humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip — exacerbated by severe weather conditions — and stressed the need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts. In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), expressed their “deepest concern” at the humanitarian situation in Gaza. These countries had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. A fragile ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since October as a result of the effort, with Israel violating the truce multiple times by carrying out attacks in the Gaza Strip. Last month, the UN International Organisation for Migration had said that hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians were facing flooding of their tents and shelters due to heavy rains , and materials for shelters and sandbags were not being allowed to enter the enclave. Much of Gaza’s infrastructure has also been destroyed because of the war, and Palestinians are facing grim living conditions. In their joint statement on Friday, the eight Muslim-majority nations highlighted that severe, harsh, and unstable weather conditions, including heavy rainfall and storms, had exacerbated the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. The situation had been further “compounded by the continued lack of sufficient humanitarian access, acute shortages of essential life-saving supplies, and the slow pace of the entry of essential materials required for the rehabilitation of basic services and the establishment of temporary housing”, the statement said. It added that the “severe weather has laid bare the fragility of existing humanitarian conditions, particularly for almost 1.9 million people, and displaced families living in inadequate shelters.” “Flooded camps, damaged tents, the collapse of damaged buildings and exposure to cold temperatures, coupled with malnutrition, have significantly heightened risks to civilian lives, including due to disease outbreaks, especially among children, women, the elderly, and individuals with medical vulnerabilities.” The foreign ministers, in their joint statement, also lauded the “tireless efforts“ of United Nations’ organisations, in particular the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), and other humanitarian international NGOs, in continuing to assist Palestinian civilians and deliver humanitarian assistance under extremely difficult and complex circumstances. They demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs were able to operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable, and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip. “Any attempt to impede their ability to operate is unacceptable,” the statement said. The foreign ministers also expressed “full support” for a US-drafted resolution that endorses Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza and was adopted by the UN Security Council in November last year.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) handed out two life sentences each to YouTuber Adil Raja, journalists Wajahat Saeed Khan, Sabir Shakir and Shaheen Sehbai, anchorperson Haider Raza Mehdi, analyst Moeed Pirzada and former army official Akbar Hussain in cases related to riots in the country on May 9, 2023. The riots — during which government and military installations were also vandalised — had erupted following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan. The prosecution had accused the convicted individuals of “digital terrorism against state institutions” in relation to the events of May 9, 2023. The cases stemmed from allegations that the accused used digital platforms to incite, facilitate and amplify attacks against state institutions during the May 9 unrest. Reserved verdicts in the cases were announced by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on Friday after the completion of trials in absentia. The trials were conducted in absentia at the prosecution’s request and by means of invoking the relevant provisions of anti-terrorism laws. According to court orders issued by Judge Sipra — copies of which are available with Dawn — cases against Raja, Khan, Sehbai and Mehdi were registered at Islamabad‘s Ramna police station. Similarly, cases against Shakir, Hussain and Pirzada were registered at the Aabpara police station. The court sentenced the individuals to rigorous life imprisonment on two counts — waging or attempting to wage war against Pakistan and criminal conspiracy. They have also been directed to pay Rs500,000 in fines for each of the two offences. They have been further handed out 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs200,000 for committing an offence under Section 121-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The said provision deals with the subject of conspiracy to commit offences that are punishable under Section 121 (waging or attempting to wage war against Pakistan) of the PPC. Moreover, they have also been penalised with another 10-year sentence of rigorous imprisonment and Rs200,000 fine for committing an offence under Section 131 (abetting mutiny or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from their duty) of the PPC. They have also been handed out triple 5-year sentences of rigorous imprisonment on three counts under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. They are also required to pay Rs200,000 for each of the three offences. In case they fail to pay the fine for any of the offences they have been found guilty of committing, the period of their imprisonment will extend by six months, according to the court orders. The orders further stated that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was being extended to the convicts, and that all sentenced handed out to them were to run concurrently. “The convict is informed that he has the right to file/prefer an appeal in the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court, Islamabad within seven days,” each of the orders said. The court also authorised and instructed the relevant station house officers to arrest the convicts “upon his availability and to forward him to jail for the commitment of his sentence”. During the trials in the cases, the prosecution produced 24 witnesses. Public prosecutor Raja Naveed Hussain Kayani represented the prosecution while Advocate Gulfam Ashraf Goraiya appeared on behalf of the accused. Records show that Advocate Goraiya was appointed as the defence counsel by the court. A detailed written judgement, which is yet to be issued by the court, is expected to outline the evidentiary basis and legal reasoning underpinning the multiple convictions and sentences. The cases against the seven convicted individuals were registered in 2023. The case against Shakir, Pirzada and Hussain was registered by Islamabad police on charges of sedition and terrorism for their alleged involvement in the violence and vandalism amid protests that erupted in the wake of PTI chief Imran’s arrest. Similarly, Sehbai, Khan, Raja and Mehdi were booked for “abetting mutiny” and inciting people to attack military installations across the country on May 9, 2023. Rights organisation Amnesty International and global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) had raised concerns and called out Pakistani authorities in June 2023, following the registration of these cases. “At least seven journalists and commentators have been charged with offences against the state and anti-terror laws in the past four days,” Amnesty International had said in a statement, expressing concern over “the crackdown on voices critical of the state and military”. “The use of these laws to silence commentators and journalists is a violation of the right to freedom of expression,” the statement said.",

      "summary_orig": "Investigators raced on Friday to identify the victims of a fire that ripped through a bar in the Swiss Alps town of Crans-Montana, turning a New Year’s celebration into one of the country’s worst tragedies. It is not yet clear what set off the blaze at Le Constellation, killing around 40 people and injuring about 115 others, many seriously. Bystanders described scenes of panic and chaos as people tried to break the windows to escape and others, covered in burns, poured into the street. Swiss police warned it could take days or even weeks to identify everyone who perished, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends. “We’ve tried to reach our friends. We took loads of photos and posted them on Instagram, Facebook, all possible social networks to try to find them,” said Eleonore, 17. “But there’s nothing. No response.” “Even the parents don’t know,” she added. The exact number of people who were at the bar when it went up in flames remains unclear, and police have not specified how many are still missing. Le Constellation had a capacity of 300 people, plus another 40 people on its terrace, according to the Crans-Montana website . Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who took over on Thursday, called the fire “a calamity of unprecedented, terrifying proportions”, and announced that flags would be flown at half-mast for five days. Local police commander Frederic Gisler said authorities were “in close contact with the victims’ families, whom we are informing in real time, as well as with the various embassies involved”. “Given the international nature of the Crans resort, we can expect foreign nationals to be among the victims,” he told reporters. The canton’s chief prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, said significant resources have been deployed “to identify the victims and return their bodies to the families as quickly as possible”. ‘The apocalypse’ The fire broke out around 1:30 am (0030 GMT) Thursday at Le Constellation, a bar popular with young tourists. “We thought it was just a small fire — but when we got there, it was war,” Mathys, from neighbouring Chermignon-d’en-Bas, told AFP. “That’s the only word I can use to describe it: the apocalypse. It was terrible.” Authorities have declined to speculate on what caused the tragedy, saying only that it was not an attack. Several witness accounts, broadcast by Swiss, French and Italian media, meanwhile, pointed to sparklers that were apparently mounted on champagne bottles held aloft by restaurant staff as part of a regular “show” for patrons who made special orders to their tables. There were “waitresses with champagne bottles and little sparklers. They got too close to the ceiling, and suddenly it all caught fire”, Axel, a witness present at the time of the incident, told the Italian media outlet Local Team . Pilloud said the investigation would look into whether the bar met safety standards and had the required number of exits. Red and white caution tape, flowers and candles adorned the street where the tragedy occurred, while police shielded the site with white screens. After the emergency units at the local hospitals filled up, many of the injured were transported across Switzerland and to neighbouring countries. The European Union said it has been in contact with Swiss authorities about providing medical assistance, while French President Emmanuel Macron said some of the injured were being cared for in French hospitals. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told Italian broadcaster Rete 4 that around 15 Italians had been injured in the fire, and a similar number remained missing. The French foreign ministry said nine French citizens figured among the injured, and eight others remained unaccounted for. Multiple sources told AFP that the bar owners are French nationals: a couple originally from Corsica who, according to a relative, are safe, but have been unreachable since the tragedy.",

      "summary_orig": "The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan on Friday expressed concern over the roughing up of YouTuber Rajab Butt during a court appearance in Karachi earlier this week. On Monday, Butt was physically assaulted at the Karachi City Court premises during the hearing of his bail plea in a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said on X that “a few lawyers launched a life-threatening attack on him within the court premises” and registered a case against them. A video of the incident in question had showed Butt, clad in a shirt with the neckline torn open, attempting to move through a crowd surrounding him. “The HRCP expresses grave concern over the reported physical assault on YouTuber Rajab Butt within the Karachi city court premises and the alleged involvement of members of the legal fraternity,” the HRCP said in a statement today on social media platform X. “Violence, intimidation and vigilantism — particularly inside courts — undermine the rule of law and the right to due process,” it said. The commission urged a “prompt, impartial investigation”, accountability for responsible parties and effective measures to ensure the safety of litigants, lawyers and court officials. The first information report (FIR) of the incident registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer, had named Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers”. Solangi is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt. Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers. On Tuesday, a group of lawyers had stormed the City Courts police station, manhandled a station house officer (SHO) and then staged a protest sit-in on M.A. Jinnah Road demanding an FIR against Mr Butt. A day later, police had registered a criminal case against several lawyers, including Solangi, for allegedly assaulting the City Courts SHO after he lodged an FIR against them for assaulting Butt. Meanwhile, the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Thursday suspended Ashfaq’s practising licence for representing Butt before the court despite a strike called by the local bar. It said that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”. It added Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”.",

      "summary_orig": "Former special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Mirza Shahzad Akbar has said that his house in the United Kingdom (UK) — where he has been living in self-imposed exile — was subjected to a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”. The development comes a little over a week after Akbar said he suffered a fractured nose and other facial injuries after being attacked at his home. In a post on X on Thursday, Akbar said that his home in Cambridgeshire, England came under attack on December 31, 2025, in a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”. He said that the perpetrators “criminally damaged the property and attempted to set it on fire, placing lives at immediate risk”. Akbar maintained it was the second such attack “within one week against my home, myself, and my family, each carried out with clear malicious intent”. He held that the incidents were not isolated. “I was physically assaulted in a targeted attack on Dec 24, leaving me with substantial injuries,” Akbar recalled. He added that UK authorities were actively investigating both events, which are being treated as targeted attacks”. “The UK has a legal and moral obligation to exhaust all available powers and resources to ensure that it remains a safe country for all, particularly for political dissidents and individuals at risk of persecution,” he further said. Akbar, who was the accountability czar in the PTI government, said last week that an unk­nown assailant dressed in “construction or waste-collection attire” attacked him in Cambridge. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me,” Akbar posted on X. “I sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose.” The former accountability adviser termed the assault “cowardly” and urged the British government to ensure the safety of dissidents. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out,” he wrote, vowing to continue exposing “corruption, human rights violations, and the erosion of democratic norms in Pakistan”. This is the third such incident Akbar has reported since November 2023, when a masked individual threw acidic liquid at Akbar’s home in Hertfordshire. While Akbar had initiated legal action alleging Pakistani state involvement, Pakistan’s Foreign Office has “categorically rejected” those claims as “preposterous”. Recently declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court, Akbar also faces extradition efforts. Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott and handed over extradition papers for Akbar.",

This is the third such incident Akbar has reported since November 2023, when a masked individual threw acidic liquid at Akbar’s home in Hertfordshire. While Akbar had initiated legal action alleging Pakistani state involvement, Pakistan’s Foreign Office has “categorically rejected” those claims as “preposterous”. Recently declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court, Akbar also faces extradition efforts. Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott and handed over extradition papers for Akbar.",

      "summary": "Former special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Mirza Shahzad Akbar has said that his house in the United Kingdom (UK) — where he has been living in self-imposed exile — was subjected to a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”. The development comes a little over a week after Akbar said he suffered a fractured nose and other facial injuries after being attacked at his home. In a post on X on Thursday, Akbar said that his home in Cambridgeshire, England came under attack on December 31, 2025, in a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”. He said that the perpetrators “criminally damaged the property and attempted to set it on fire, placing lives at immediate risk”. Akbar maintained it was the second such attack “within one week against my home, myself, and my family, each carried out with clear malicious intent”. He held that the incidents were not isolated. “I was physically assaulted in a targeted attack on Dec 24, leaving me with substantial injuries,” Akbar recalled. He added that UK authorities were actively investigating both events, which are being treated as targeted attacks”. “The UK has a legal and moral obligation to exhaust all available powers and resources to ensure that it remains a safe country for all, particularly for political dissidents and individuals at risk of persecution,” he further said.

      "summary_orig": "Usman Khawaja said on Friday he will retire from international cricket after the fifth and final Ashes clash against England, leaving a legacy as Australia’s first Muslim Test cricketer while lashing out at perceived “racial stereotyping” during his 15-year career. The 39-year-old will pad up for the last time, should he be selected, when the Test gets under way in Sydney on Sunday, ending months of speculation about his future. It would be an 88th Test for the classy left-hander, culminating a career where it began after making his debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2011, also against England. “The number one emotion is contentment. I’m very lucky to have played so many games for Australia the way I have,” Khawaja said. “I hope I have inspired people along the way. “I’m a proud Muslim coloured boy from Pakistan who was told that he would never play for the Australian cricket team. Look at me now, and you can do the same.” Khawaja immigrated to Australia from Islamabad as a child, battling the odds to become the country’s first Pakistan-born, and first Muslim, national player. At one point, he was the only Asian first-class player in Australia and is credited as a role model who opened doors for others. “Usman has made a huge contribution to Australian cricket both through his outstanding achievements as one of our most stylish and resilient batters since his Test debut 15 years ago, and off field, particularly through the Usman Khawaja Foundation,” said Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg. “On behalf of Australian cricket I would like to thank and congratulate Usman for all he has achieved.” Khawaja’s foundation helps youths from refugee, immigrant, Indigenous, and poor socioeconomic backgrounds through introductory cricket programs and educational support. ‘Attacked me’ Khawaja, a qualified pilot, has plundered 6,206 runs in Test cricket with 16 centuries, averaging 43.39. He smashed a career-high 232 against Sri Lanka a year ago, but has not made three figures since. The current Ashes series has been a rollercoaster ride, with the veteran batsman coming under scrutiny. He injured his back in the first Test in Perth and was replaced as opener in the second innings by Travis Head who blasted a match-winning century. Khawaja did not feature in the next match at Brisbane and was omitted from the team for the third Test in Adelaide, only to get a lifeline when Steve Smith dropped out ill just before the toss. View this post on Instagram He came in at number four and hit 82 and 40 before making 29 and 0 in the fourth Test at Melbourne. “I’m glad I get to leave on amy own terms, with a little bit of dignity, and go out at the SCG where I love,” he said, while expressing frustration at how he was treated. “When I did my back (in Perth), I hurt my back and had back spasms and it was something I couldn’t control. “The way the media and past players came out and attacked me. I could have copped it for a couple of days but it went on for five days. “The way everyone came out at me about my preparation, ‘he’s not committed to the team. Only worried about himself. Playing a golf competition. He’s selfish, he didn’t train hard enough. He’s lazy’. “These are the same racial stereotypes (I thought we had moved past). “But obviously we haven’t fully moved past that. I haven’t seen anyone treated like that in the Australian cricket team before.” He nevertheless admitted the writing was on the wall during the current Ashes series. “Going into Adelaide and then not being picked initially for that game was probably a sign for me to say ‘all right, it’s time to move on’,” he said. Khawaja also played 40 one-dayers and nine Twenty20 internationals.",

The tests were conducted by Canadian police at Vancouver International Airport, after the pilot was asked to leave the aircraft, the person said. The incident was labelled as a “serious matter” by Transport Canada in a letter to Air India, and authorities are likely to pursue enforcement action, the person added. The person requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Transport Canada did not respond to an emailed request for comment outside regular working hours.

Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations,” Air India said. “Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy.” The letter from Transport Canada official Ajit Oommen has asked Air India to provide its findings and details of steps taken to prevent future occurrences by January 26, the person familiar with the matter said. India has been under intense scrutiny since the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner killed 260 people. India’s aviation regulator has flagged multiple safety lapses at the airline, which was previously owned by the government until 2022. Pilots at Air India, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, have also come under scrutiny. This week, India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation sent warning notices to four Air India pilots, flagging “serious safety concerns” related to regulatory compliance and flight crew decision-making. The DGCA said the pilots accepted an aircraft for operation last year despite prior knowledge of “repeated snags” and “existing systems degradations,” according to warning notices dated December 29 seen by Reuters . The aircraft is a Boeing 787 used for long-haul flights, according to Flightradar24.",

Pilots at Air India, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, have also come under scrutiny. This week, India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation sent warning notices to four Air India pilots, flagging “serious safety concerns” related to regulatory compliance and flight crew decision-making. The DGCA said the pilots accepted an aircraft for operation last year despite prior knowledge of “repeated snags” and “existing systems degradations,” according to warning notices dated December 29 seen by Reuters . The aircraft is a Boeing 787 used for long-haul flights, according to Flightradar24.",

      "summary_orig": "A few months ago, traffic on Karachi’s busy Rashid Minhas Road was moving with its usual chaos when a routine commute turned fatal. On the Askari Flyover, a 22-year-old woman riding a motorcycle hit a pothole while travelling in the fast lane. She lost her balance and fell onto the road. Within seconds, a water tanker approaching from behind ran her over and killed her on the spot. The incident barely stood out in a city accustomed to daily road fatalities, yet it captured the lethal mix that defines Karachi’s traffic crisis. Reckless driving, excessive speed, crumbling infrastructure, and weak enforcement of traffic laws have become the hallmarks of the city’s roads. A pressing issue In 2025, while Karachi grappled with a series of troubling developments, fatal road accidents emerged as more than just routine headlines in the national media, as they evolved into a significant political issue as well. At one point, the situation became so volatile that fears resurfaced of ethnic tensions spilling over, a spectre that has historically undermined the city’s peace and stability. A total of 803 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in Karachi in 2025. The Karachi traffic police, however, maintains that the situation began to improve during the latter half of the year. In its annual road accident report, the department recorded a noticeable decline in both fatalities and injuries, attributing the improvement to stricter enforcement, data-driven interventions, and closer coordination with transport stakeholders. According to official figures, 477 people lost their lives in traffic accidents during the first six months of the year, compared to 326 fatalities in the second half. While Karachi saw a tragic 803 road fatalities in 2025, official data reveals a 31.7 per cent drop in the second half of the year. Authorities credit the decline to a shift toward data-driven enforcement and tighter coordination with transport stakeholders. — created using Gemini A similar trend was observed in the number of injured persons. While 886 people were injured in road accidents between January and June, the figure fell to 642 during the next six months of the year, reflecting a decrease of 244 injuries, or about 40 fewer injuries each month. Comparison of road accident injuries between the first and second half of 2025. — created using Gemini The police link this progress to the formation of the Karachi Road Accident Analysis Team, which was tasked with identifying accident-prone locations, analysing underlying causes, and monitoring emerging patterns. Recommendations made by the team led to targeted preventive and corrective measures across the city, which authorities say produced tangible results. During this period, traffic police officials also engaged transporters and other stakeholders through a series of meetings, resulting in measures such as the mandatory installation of tracking systems in commercial vehicles and stricter compliance with traffic regulations. Awareness sessions focusing on road safety, monitoring mechanisms, and legal responsibilities were also conducted to improve discipline among drivers. Karachi Traffic Police performing their duties at a main thoroughfare of the port city. —  Karachi Traffic Police website The department said it will continue coordinating closely with the transport sector while strengthening enforcement, emphasising that evidence-based policymaking and sustained oversight remain central to its efforts to reduce road traffic accidents and protect lives. ‘Enforcement-led gains not enough’ While the official figures point to measurable progress, urban planning and road safety experts caution that enforcement-led gains alone cannot address Karachi’s deeper mobility crisis. They argue that the city’s road fatalities are rooted in structural flaws from car-centric planning and fragmented transport governance to unsafe infrastructure for pedestrians and motorcyclists. Without a comprehensive mobility reform plan that prioritises public transport, road design standards, and institutional coordination, experts warn that recent improvements risk remaining temporary rather than transformative. Urban planning and population dynamics, they believe, play a crucial role in shaping Karachi’s traffic patterns and road safety challenges, which is a perspective that highlights why enforcement alone cannot resolve the city’s mobility crisis. A Red Line worker helping pedestrians cross the road in front of Federal Urdu University. — Fahim Siddiqui/White Star “Karachi has experienced sprawl and population growth in a complex manner,” says academic, researcher and urban planner Dr Noman Ahmed, who also serves as the Pro-Vice Chancellor of NED University of Engineering and Technology. “The magnets of employment and enterprise show a pattern of corresponding residential developments around them. For example, the fruits and vegetable market is a source of daily-wage employment for hundreds of unskilled and semi-skilled labourers. One finds informal housing hubs evolving around it. “Similar patterns are also observed around truck and bus stands, transit terminals and extension of existing informal settlements in the west and south of the city. This population requires internal streets, neighbourhood roads and arterial roads to enable proper connectivity. As a consequence, existing roads are intensively used.” He emphasises that commuting choices, rapid motorbike adoption, and risky driving behaviours compounded by poor infrastructure are driving Karachi’s rising road accident rates, which require targeted interventions and systemic reforms. “The commuting choices impact the traffic management and road safety concerns,” he says. “A rapid growth in motorbikes is an example. With very limited options of public transport, a sizable number of teenagers and working men, now also women, are adopting motorbikes as an option. With limited training, inadequate safety arrangements on roads, and poor quality of road infrastructure, road traffic accidents are on a dangerous rise.” Can stricter enforcement alone reverse Karachi’s deadly road safety trend? Traffic authorities believe it can, at least to a certain extent, arguing that deterrence remains the most immediate tool available to curb reckless driving and restore discipline on the city’s roads. Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Traffic, Karachi, Peer Muhammad Shah, maintains that the introduction of the e-challan system, enhanced surveillance and stricter enforcement has begun to deliver measurable results. “Change is impossible without deterrence,” he says, adding that traffic disorder and undisciplined driving habits have become deeply embedded over the years. According to DIG Shah, before the introduction of digital enforcement mechanisms, Karachi recorded an average of three road accident deaths per day. “With the e-challan system in place, this figure has dropped to two fatalities per day,” he says, calling it an “encouraging” sign. He acknowledges that heavy vehicles, particularly dumpers and water tankers, continue to pose serious challenges. To address this, traffic police are establishing four new fitness centres in Karachi where the fitness and licensing of dumpers will be checked on a priority basis. “No dumper will be allowed on the roads without an approved tracking system,” he adds. Need for addressing deeper structural problems While traffic police credit enforcement with reducing fatalities, urban planners caution that such gains may prove short-lived unless deeper structural problems are addressed. According to experts, fines and surveillance can correct behaviour, but they cannot compensate for flawed road design, inadequate public transport and unsafe infrastructure. “Karachi’s roads were designed to accommodate usual vehicle loads based on earlier land-use patterns,” says Dr Ahmed. “Over time, the origins and destinations of traffic have changed, but the roads have not evolved accordingly.” Image showing the under-construction BRT line on Karachi’s University Road. — Fahim Siddiqi /White Star He points to the University Road as a prominent example, where the construction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) for the Red Line has reduced available road space despite the artery serving numerous educational institutions and rapidly densifying neighbourhoods. “While the BRT will carry a limited number of passengers along its corridor, the reduction of vehicular lanes will act as a perpetual bottleneck, especially during peak hours,” he says. Beyond capacity issues, Dr Ahmed highlights basic design failures that continue to expose road users to danger, including the absence of road markings, encroached or missing footpaths, lack of directional signage, inadequate street lighting and deteriorating pedestrian bridges. These deficiencies, he says, disproportionately affect pedestrians and motorcyclists who are the most vulnerable groups on Karachi’s roads. Dearth of public transport options Experts also link the rising accident toll to the city’s chronic public transport deficit. With few reliable and affordable options available, residents increasingly rely on motorcycles and private cars, a trend that urban planners describe as fundamentally unsustainable. “The exponential rise in motorbikes and motor cars cannot be controlled through enforcement alone,” Dr Ahmed says. “Only cheap, accessible and reliable public transport can reverse this trajectory.” He argues that shifting more than two-thirds of work-related trips to public transport would significantly reduce congestion, optimise road space and lower accident risks. This, he believes, requires a fleet of 100- and 70-seater buses connecting major neighbourhoods and acting as feeders to BRT corridors, supported by safe footpaths, pedestrian crossings and a unified fare system such as a single transport card. ‘Collective criminalisation of dump trucks is unjust’ Meanwhile, transporters argue that enforcement drives have unfairly singled them out. Sindh president of the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, Liaquat Mehsud, says that while accountability is necessary, collective criminalisation of dumpers and their operators is unjust. “If a dumper causes an accident, then take action against that driver and vehicle,” he says. “Conduct an investigation, seize the vehicle and punish the offender if the crime is proven. We stand with the law. But it is unfair to label everyone associated with this profession a criminal without due process.” Header image: A photograph showing a large number of people in Karachi. — AFP/File",

A total of 803 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in Karachi in 2025. The Karachi traffic police, however, maintains that the situation began to improve during the latter half of the year. In its annual road accident report, the department recorded a noticeable decline in both fatalities and injuries, attributing the improvement to stricter enforcement, data-driven interventions, and closer coordination with transport stakeholders. According to official figures, 477 people lost their lives in traffic accidents during the first six months of the year, compared to 326 fatalities in the second half. While Karachi saw a tragic 803 road fatalities in 2025, official data reveals a 31.7 per cent drop in the second half of the year. Authorities credit the decline to a shift toward data-driven enforcement and tighter coordination with transport stakeholders. — created using Gemini A similar trend was observed in the number of injured persons. While 886 people were injured in road accidents between January and June, the figure fell to 642 during the next six months of the year, reflecting a decrease of 244 injuries, or about 40 fewer injuries each month. Comparison of road accident injuries between the first and second half of 2025. — created using Gemini The police link this progress to the formation of the Karachi Road Accident Analysis Team, which was tasked with identifying accident-prone locations, analysing underlying causes, and monitoring emerging patterns. Recommendations made by the team led to targeted preventive and corrective measures across the city, which authorities say produced tangible results. During this period, traffic police officials also engaged transporters and other stakeholders through a series of meetings, resulting in measures such as the mandatory installation of tracking systems in commercial vehicles and stricter compliance with traffic regulations. Awareness sessions focusing on road safety, monitoring mechanisms, and legal responsibilities were also conducted to improve discipline among drivers. Karachi Traffic Police performing their duties at a main thoroughfare of the port city. —  Karachi Traffic Police website The department said it will continue coordinating closely with the transport sector while strengthening enforcement, emphasising that evidence-based policymaking and sustained oversight remain central to its efforts to reduce road traffic accidents and protect lives. ‘Enforcement-led gains not enough’ While the official figures point to measurable progress, urban planning and road safety experts caution that enforcement-led gains alone cannot address Karachi’s deeper mobility crisis. They argue that the city’s road fatalities are rooted in structural flaws from car-centric planning and fragmented transport governance to unsafe infrastructure for pedestrians and motorcyclists. Without a comprehensive mobility reform plan that prioritises public transport, road design standards, and institutional coordination, experts warn that recent improvements risk remaining temporary rather than transformative. Urban planning and population dynamics, they believe, play a crucial role in shaping Karachi’s traffic patterns and road safety challenges, which is a perspective that highlights why enforcement alone cannot resolve the city’s mobility crisis. A Red Line worker helping pedestrians cross the road in front of Federal Urdu University. — Fahim Siddiqui/White Star “Karachi has experienced sprawl and population growth in a complex manner,” says academic, researcher and urban planner Dr Noman Ahmed, who also serves as the Pro-Vice Chancellor of NED University of Engineering and Technology. “The magnets of employment and enterprise show a pattern of corresponding residential developments around them. For example, the fruits and vegetable market is a source of daily-wage employment for hundreds of unskilled and semi-skilled labourers. One finds informal housing hubs evolving around it. “Similar patterns are also observed around truck and bus stands, transit terminals and extension of existing informal settlements in the west and south of the city. This population requires internal streets, neighbourhood roads and arterial roads to enable proper connectivity. As a consequence, existing roads are intensively used.” He emphasises that commuting choices, rapid motorbike adoption, and risky driving behaviours compounded by poor infrastructure are driving Karachi’s rising road accident rates, which require targeted interventions and systemic reforms. “The commuting choices impact the traffic management and road safety concerns,” he says. “A rapid growth in motorbikes is an example. With very limited options of public transport, a sizable number of teenagers and working men, now also women, are adopting motorbikes as an option. With limited training, inadequate safety arrangements on roads, and poor quality of road infrastructure, road traffic accidents are on a dangerous rise.” Can stricter enforcement alone reverse Karachi’s deadly road safety trend? Traffic authorities believe it can, at least to a certain extent, arguing that deterrence remains the most immediate tool available to curb reckless driving and restore discipline on the city’s roads. Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Traffic, Karachi, Peer Muhammad Shah, maintains that the introduction of the e-challan system, enhanced surveillance and stricter enforcement has begun to deliver measurable results. “Change is impossible without deterrence,” he says, adding that traffic disorder and undisciplined driving habits have become deeply embedded over the years. According to DIG Shah, before the introduction of digital enforcement mechanisms, Karachi recorded an average of three road accident deaths per day. “With the e-challan system in place, this figure has dropped to two fatalities per day,” he says, calling it an “encouraging” sign. He acknowledges that heavy vehicles, particularly dumpers and water tankers, continue to pose serious challenges. To address this, traffic police are establishing four new fitness centres in Karachi where the fitness and licensing of dumpers will be checked on a priority basis. “No dumper will be allowed on the roads without an approved tracking system,” he adds. Need for addressing deeper structural problems While traffic police credit enforcement with reducing fatalities, urban planners caution that such gains may prove short-lived unless deeper structural problems are addressed. According to experts, fines and surveillance can correct behaviour, but they cannot compensate for flawed road design, inadequate public transport and unsafe infrastructure. “Karachi’s roads were designed to accommodate usual vehicle loads based on earlier land-use patterns,” says Dr Ahmed. “Over time, the origins and destinations of traffic have changed, but the roads have not evolved accordingly.” Image showing the under-construction BRT line on Karachi’s University Road. — Fahim Siddiqi /White Star He points to the University Road as a prominent example, where the construction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) for the Red Line has reduced available road space despite the artery serving numerous educational institutions and rapidly densifying neighbourhoods. “While the BRT will carry a limited number of passengers along its corridor, the reduction of vehicular lanes will act as a perpetual bottleneck, especially during peak hours,” he says. Beyond capacity issues, Dr Ahmed highlights basic design failures that continue to expose road users to danger, including the absence of road markings, encroached or missing footpaths, lack of directional signage, inadequate street lighting and deteriorating pedestrian bridges. These deficiencies, he says, disproportionately affect pedestrians and motorcyclists who are the most vulnerable groups on Karachi’s roads. Dearth of public transport options Experts also link the rising accident toll to the city’s chronic public transport deficit. With few reliable and affordable options available, residents increasingly rely on motorcycles and private cars, a trend that urban planners describe as fundamentally unsustainable. “The exponential rise in motorbikes and motor cars cannot be controlled through enforcement alone,” Dr Ahmed says. “Only cheap, accessible and reliable public transport can reverse this trajectory.” He argues that shifting more than two-thirds of work-related trips to public transport would significantly reduce congestion, optimise road space and lower accident risks. This, he believes, requires a fleet of 100- and 70-seater buses connecting major neighbourhoods and acting as feeders to BRT corridors, supported by safe footpaths, pedestrian crossings and a unified fare system such as a single transport card. ‘Collective criminalisation of dump trucks is unjust’ Meanwhile, transporters argue that enforcement drives have unfairly singled them out. Sindh president of the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, Liaquat Mehsud, says that while accountability is necessary, collective criminalisation of dumpers and their operators is unjust. “If a dumper causes an accident, then take action against that driver and vehicle,” he says. “Conduct an investigation, seize the vehicle and punish the offender if the crime is proven. We stand with the law. But it is unfair to label everyone associated with this profession a criminal without due process.” Header image: A photograph showing a large number of people in Karachi. — AFP/File",

The unrest, triggered by soaring inflation and a collapsing currency, has spread from the capital to other major cities. The semi-official Fars news agency reported that two civilians were killed in Lordegan, following confrontations with security services. Meanwhile, state media confirmed that a member of the Basij paramilitary force was killed overnight in the city of Kouhdasht. The violence marks a significant escalation in the demonstrations that began on Sunday, when shopkeepers in Tehran went on strike to protest economic stagnation and high prices. By Tuesday, students from at least 10 universities had joined the movement, which has since expanded to include closing major bazaars across the country. “Some protesters began throwing stones at the city’s administrative buildings, including the provincial governor’s office, the mosque, the Martyrs’ Foundation, the town hall and banks,” Fars reported regarding the situation in Lordegan. The agency stated that police responded with tear gas after the buildings were “severely damaged” and arrested several people described as “ringleaders”. In Kouhdasht, state television cited Said Pourali, the deputy governor of Lorestan Province, reporting the death of a 21-year-old member of the Basij. The channel said the man was killed “by rioters while defending public order”. Mr Pourali noted that “during the demonstrations in Kouhdasht, 13 police officers and Basij members were injured by stone throwing”. However, accounts of the violence vary. The rights group Hengaw repo­r­ted that security forces killed and wounded several people in Lordegan. Regarding the death in Kouh­dasht, the Revolutionary Guards accused demonstrators of taking advantage of the protests. Contrarily, Hengaw identified the deceased as Amirhossam Khodayari Fard and alleged he was a protester killed by security forces. Hengaw also reported that a protester was shot dead on Wednesday in Isfahan province in central Iran. Reuters could not immediately verify these reports. Protests also took place on Thursday in Marvdasht in the southern Fars province, the activist news site HRANA reported. Hengsaw said Wednesday’s events included demonstrations and detentions across Kermanshah, Khuzestan, and Hamedan. The unrest comes at a critical moment for Iran’s clerical rulers. The economy has been hammered by Western sanctions and a currency that has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year. Inflation reached 52 per cent year-over-year in December, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran. The country is also recovering from regional tensions that led to a 12-day air war in June, during which Israeli and US airstrikes targeted the country’s nuclear infrastructure and military leadership. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sought to calm tensions on Thursday, acknowledging the protesters’ “legitimate demands” and calling on the government to improve the economic situation. “From an Islamic perspective … if we do not resolve the issue of people’s livelihoods, we will end up in hell,” Pezeshkian said at an event broadcast on state television. Despite the conciliatory tone, authorities promised to take a “firm” stance against disorder. Iran’s prosecutor general warned on Wednesday that while peaceful economic protests were legitimate, any attempt to create insecurity would be met with a “decisive response”. “Any attempt to turn economic protests into a tool of insecurity, destruction of public property, or implementation of externally designed scenarios will inevitably be met with a legal, proportionate and decisive response,” the prosecutor said. Government spokesperson Fate­meh Mohajerani announced on Thur­sday that authorities would hold a direct dialogue with representatives of trade unions and merchants, though she did not provide further details. The current demonstrations remain smaller than the nationwide uprising in 2022, which was triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini for allegedly violating Iran’s strict dress code. That wave of anger left several hundred people dead. Tasnim news agency reported on Wednesday evening the arrest of seven people allegedly affiliated with “groups hostile to the Islamic Republic based in the United States and Europe”, claiming they were “tasked with turning the demonstrations into violence”.

      "summary_orig": "• Pak Institute for Peace Studies report counts 699 terrorist attacks in outgoing year • Burden of violence fell on security personnel, constituting over 42pc of fatalities ISLAMABAD: Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year. This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. These are the findings of the “Pakistan Security Report 2025,” released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) on Thursday. Besides rising border violence and militant resurgence, evolving militant tactics from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan fuel a widening security challenge, the report says. The burden of this violence fell disproportionately on the state’s defenders as security and law-enforcement personnel suffered over 42pc of all terrorism-related fatalities, with 437 lives lost, the data shows. The report notes that this stark figure highlights the frontline nature of the conflict and the relentless targeting of army, police and paramilitary forces. Civilians were also heavily affected, with 354 non-combatants losing their lives. Meanwhile, 243 militants were killed, either in suicide attacks they carried out or during retaliatory fire by security forces following some of the terrorist attacks. The PIPS report says that the conflict remained intensely regionalised, with over 95pc of attacks concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan. In KP, a 40pc rise in incidents illustrated the entrenched presence of groups like the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates. The province experienced the highest number of terrorist incidents in the country in 2025, with 413 attacks. These violent incidents claimed a total of 581 lives and left 698 others injured. The province faced not just more frequent attacks, but more complex ones, including a coordinated wave of assaults across 11 districts on Independence Day — a symbolic challenge to state authority, the report says. In Balochistan, the insurgency evolved qualitatively. The province experienced 254 militant attacks in 2025, resulting in 419 deaths and injuries to 607 others. A 26pc increase in attacks was accompanied by a shift towards high-impact, coordinated operations. Militant groups like the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) moved beyond hit-and-run tactics to execute highway blockades, sieges, and hijackings, directly targeting economic infrastructure and state symbols to amplify their political message and disrupt governance. Sindh province recorded 21 terrorist attacks, including 16 in Karachi, two in Shikarpur, and one each in Hyderabad, Jacobabad, and Jamshoro. These incidents resulted in 14 fatalities and left 17 others injured. Punjab witnessed seven terrorist attacks in 2025, a decline from 11 incidents in the previous year. These attacks killed five people including four militants and one policeman, and injured two policemen. A suicide blast outside the judicial complex housing the Islamabad district and sessions courts killed 12 people. Jamaatul Ahrar, a faction of the banned TTP, claimed the attack. In Gilgit-Baltistan, three attacks were reported, including two in Diamir district and one in Gilgit. These incidents claimed the lives of three security personnel, including two Scouts and one Frontier Corps official, and injured six others. Published in Dawn, January 2nd, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• FO says Islamabad advocating peace and diplomacy between allied Gulf states • Confirms Pakistan-India prisoner, nuclear list exchanges amid strained ties • Asks India to share details of Dulhasti-II project under Indus treaty ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office said on Thursday that Pakistan was seeking a diplomatic resolution of the dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen, underscoring Islamabad’s push for dialogue as tensions persisted between two of its closest Gulf partners. The comments, which were the most categorical since the start of the Saudi-UAE row about Pakis­tan’s role in defusing tensions, came during the weekly media briefing by FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi, who said Islamabad was actively engaging both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to encourage restraint and diplomacy. “We have been advocating peace and diplomacy to reach a solution. So, this is part of our exchanges that is taking place between our leadership and the leadership in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” Mr Andrabi said. Tensions peaked on Dec 30 when Saudi Arabia carried out air stri­kes on Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla, targeting what it said were weapons and armoured vehicles allegedly supplied to the Sou­thern Transitional Council (STC). No casualties were reported. Abu Dhabi later announced a voluntary pullout of its remaining counterterrorism units the same day. Thus far, Pakistan has pursued carefully balanced diplomacy. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Dec 30 in Rahim Yar Khan during the Emirati leader’s private visit, officially focusing on bilateral ties but widely viewed as urging de-escalation. A day later, PM Shehbaz spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan was pursuing the issue through multilateral forums as well, including the UN Security Council. At the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, he added, Pakistan advocated “for peace, dialogue, role for diplomacy, including peace­ful settlement for a Yemeni-led, Yemeni-owned political process”. “So, this is in that spirit that we take our role as a mediator and a facilitator for bringing peace and prosperity for Yemen and for the brotherly people of Yemen,” Mr Andrabi said. Exchange of lists Meanwhile, Pakistan and India on Thursday exchanged lists of nuclear installations and prisoners, a long-standing confidence-building practice that has endured despite unprecedented strains in bilateral ties, which brought relations close to a virtual breakdown. Mr Andrabi confirmed the exchange, saying: “Today, on 1st January, as per our bilateral agreements, Pakistan and India exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody. Accordingly, the government of Pakistan today handed over a list of 257 Indian prisoners (58 civilians and 199 fishermen) in Pakistan to the High Commission of India in Islamabad.” He said the move was in line with existing bilateral commitments. “This step is consistent with the provisions of the Consular Access Agreement between Pakistan and India, signed on May 21, 2008, under which both countries are required to exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody twice a year, on Jan 1 and July 1, respectively,” the spokesman added. India said it shared information about 391 civilian prisoners and 33 fishermen in its custody who are Pakistani or believed to be Pakistani. The two sides also exchanged lists of nuclear installations and facilities that cannot be attacked in the event of hostilities, under a separate agreement aimed at reducing the risk of escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours. “Also, on Jan 1, Pakistan and India exchange the lists of their respective nuclear installations pursuant to the Agreement on Prohibition of Attacks against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between Pakistan and India,” Mr Andrabi said. Dulhasti power project The Foreign Office also urged India to respond to formal queries raised by its Indus Waters Commissioner over India’s proposed Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project, saying New Delhi failed to share prior information as required under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had not been notified in advance about the project, describing the omission as a breach of international obligations. “No prior information or notification was shared with Pakistan with regard to this project (Dulhasti State-II Hydroelectric Project) as mandated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960,” he said. “Such acts of commission and omission yet again exemplify a complete disregard of international law.” The Dulhasti hydropower project is located on the Chenab River in the disputed region of India-held Jammu and Kashmir. Its original 390-megawatt, run-of-the-river Stage I plant was commissioned in 2007 and operated for years without major objections from Pakistan. However, concerns have surfaced following India’s approval last month of a 260MW Stage II extension. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan’s Indus Waters Commissioner has formally sought details from his Indian counterpart. Calling for immediate engagement, Mr Andrabi said: “We therefore call upon India to urgently return to treaty compliance and respond to the queries raised by our Indus Waters Commissioner in his latest as well as earlier communications.” He also stressed that Pakistan considers the treaty legally binding despite India’s position.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said on Thursday that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation. The PTI earlier said that it will not engage in negotiations with the federal government. Party Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan. “Two of them are my leaders, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif. The third is President Asif Ali Zardari, the fourth is [incarcerated PTI leader] Imran Khan, and everyone knows who the fifth is,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News Capital Talk on Thursday. He said the efforts at the level of leaders like him and PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Malik Amir Dogar, would continue, but until confidence among the top leaders is established, the political situation would not see a breakthrough. Sanaullah added that confidence-building measures would be possible only when social media accounts propagating a hate campaign against the army and its leadership are shut down. “The PTI leadership can’t evade responsibility [for these accounts] … They have to disown them,” he said, adding that PTI could instead initiate propaganda against political parties. He further said that the PTI should withdraw its call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, as it would be a “failure” and would further “damage the situation”. In response to Sanaullah, Dogar said the government should arrange a meeting between PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, and incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan. “Hopefully, a path will be made,” he added. “If these five leaders meet the conflict can be resolved,” added Dogar, without specifying which five leaders he was referring to. ‘Outright rejected negotiations’ Separately, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, while speaking on Dawn News Dosra Rukh, denied any contacts with the government regarding negotiations. “We have outright rejected the negotiations,” he said, adding that Imran Khan had stated the PTI would not negotiate with a Form-47 government. “The decision on whether to hold negotiations with the government rests with Achakzai and Abbas, as they welcomed it in the statement issued by the TTAP after the national conference,” he said. In response to another question on PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar’s statement regarding meetings with Imran Khan, Akram said: “PTI is dealing with frustration due to his statement, and this is clearly visible outside Adiala prison, where a crowd gathers every Tuesday. FIRs are lodged, people are arrested, yet workers gather the following week.” Earlier in December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence. The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Mismanagement at a musical concert organised as part of New Year celebrations at a private housing society turned violent when people were allegedly denied entry despite holding valid tickets. Police sources said tickets for the musical night were sold at Rs5,000 for families and Rs2,000 for individuals. However, tickets were allegedly sold beyond the venue’s capacity and adequate arrangements for spectators were not made. As a result, the area reserved for spectators became overcrowded. A large number of ticket-holders also gathered outside the venue in an attempt to gain entry. Security guards of the housing society stopped the gathering and did not allow them to enter the concert venue, prompting protests by the ticket-holders. It has yet to be established how the protest turned violent and which side took the first step in disrupting law and order. A police contingent was deployed at the venue for security and crowd control, but it reportedly remained a silent spectator until the situation worsened. During the protest, a physical confrontation broke out between the ticket-holders who were denied entry and the security guards. Both sides pelted stones at each other, while the guards also used batons to disperse the crowd. The use of force further angered the gathering, which then began damaging property. Police intervened when the situation went out of control and used force along with anti-riot gear to disperse the protesters. During the police action, a couple of protesters were picked up and taken to police installations. Videos that went viral on social media showed some youngsters throwing stones at the guards and damaging property. In the clips, guards can also be seen chasing and manhandling some of the youths. The housing society management had arranged the musical concert and sold tickets in different categories. Some participants alleged that despite purchasing tickets, they were not allowed entry, which became the initial cause of the disturbance. Sources said the society management was planning to register an FIR, but no official complaint had been lodged so far. According to sources, the management told the police that they would come to lodge a complaint, but it remains unclear when this will happen. Published in Dawn, January 2nd, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: The Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Thursday suspended the practising licence of Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq for representing TikToker Rajab Butt before a Karachi court despite a strike called by the local bar. The strike had been called in protest against the alleged victimisation of the Karachi Bar Association’s former librarian, Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro. During the strike, judicial proceedings were strictly prohibited within the city courts’ premises. According to an order issued by PbBC Executive Committee’s Chairman Zabiullah Nagra, the action was taken after receiving a letter from the president and general secretary of the Karachi Bar Association. The letter drew the council’s attention to a “video circulating on social media in which Advocate Ashfaq was seen appearing before the Karachi City Courts while representing TikToker Rajab Butt during an ongoing lawyers’ strike,” said Nagra. “It further observed that the advocate appeared before the courts despite the strike, allegedly accompanied by private guards or individuals in clear violation of the strike restrictions and the established canons of the legal profession,” the order stated. It further noted that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”. “These remarks reportedly caused divisions within the legal fraternity, leading to confrontation and discord among lawyers,” it added. As per the order, Advocate Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”. Examining his professional record, the order said that Advocate Ashfaq was registered as an advocate with the PbBC in 2010 and the high court in 2012. “As a practising lawyer,” the council asserted that Advocate Ashfaq was “duty bound to uphold the dignity and high standing of the legal profession at all times”. “The executive committee unanimously decided to suspend Advocate Ashfaq’s licence to practice law with immediate effect,” it said. The committee also referred the matter to the disciplinary committee of the council for further proceedings regarding the permanent cancellation of the licence in accordance with law. Talking to Dawn , Nagra said the PbBC, as a statutory regulatory body, was not required to issue a prior notice before suspending a lawyer’s licence in cases involving professional misconduct. “Every enrolled advocate is presumed to have full knowledge of the code of conduct prescribed under the Bar Council rules and is duty-bound to comply with it,” he said. Council’s executive committee chairman added that the lawyer concerned had been found involved in activities “unbecoming of a member of the legal profession” for quite some time. On Monday, YouTuber Rajab Butt was physically assaulted at a sessions court in Karachi during the hearing of a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. The hearing, during which the Youtuber was represented by Ashfaq, was marred by violence and chaos. Ashfaq has also been appearing as counsel for former spymaster Faiz Hameed in the trial concluded against him before a military court.",
