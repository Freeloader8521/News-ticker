      "summary_orig": "The Ministry of Information has said that neither the armed forces nor the federal government has issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley, where residents have been vacating their houses amid a planned military operation against militants. “The government has taken notice of misleading claims in circulation regarding alleged ‘depopulation’ from Tirah Valley on the orders of the army. “These assertions are baseless, malicious, and driven by ulterior motives aimed at creating alarm among the public. No directive has been issued for the depopulation of Tirah by the federal government and the armed forces,” a post on the ministry’s X account said on Sunday. The ministry further maintained in its statement that law enforcement agencies had been routinely conducting “targeted, intelligence-based operations, strictly against terrorist elements, with full care to avoid disruption to civilian life, for which no migration is needed or being undertaken”. “It may be noted that the local population is increasingly concerned over the presence of khawarij (a term that the state uses for terrorists) and desire peace and stability in Tirah,” the ministry said. It recalled that the KP government’s Relief, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Department had issued a notification for the release of funds — reportedly Rs4 billion — on December 26, 2025. The ministry said the purpose for the release of the funds was stated to be the “anticipated temporary and voluntary movement of population from certain localities of Tirah (Bagh)”. Moreover, the ministry continued, the provincial department had also “requested the facilitation of advance preparedness and relief-related arrangements, including transportation, food support, cash assistance, and establishment and management of transit and registration points”. It further quoted the notification as stating that “the deputy commissioner, Khyber (where Tirah is located), has further conveyed that the proposed voluntary movement reflects the views and preferences of the local population, articulated through a representative jirga convened at the district level, taking into account seasonal, logistical and contextual considerations, as well as a on-camp based modality”. “Hence, any stated position of the provincial government or their officials being conveyed to the media that the said migration has anything to do with the armed forces is false and fabricated, given with mala fide intent to gain political capital and, unfortunately, malign security institutions and, therefore, highly regrettable,” the ministry’s statement said.

Heat loss in the body causes chilblains, frostbite and hypothermia — treatable conditions that turn lethal due to the lack of knowledge about them. A warm hearth in winter can help. But the scores that languish on cold, hard footpaths wrapped in rags or plastic die uncounted. Welfare-centric policies and mechanisms that ensure uninterrupted gas and electricity and road safety in extreme weather events are crucial. The state’s inability to expand free shelter and meal programmes, such as panahgahs, must be tackled with the adoption of international models involving pavement shelters and drop-in facilities. For immediate relief, parts of public spaces should serve as refuge. The antidote to widespread indignity is compassion. Published in Dawn, January 25th, 2026",

The Pakistani parliamentary opposition makes a valid case that the matter should have been laid before the House for discussion and approval prior to any decision; but its view that joining the Board was not a prudent move is open to question. “It was the least worst [bad] option,” was the crisp comment of former ambassador Imran Ali Chaudhry, who had recently retired when the digital platform Naya Daur sought his opinion. There are a number of reasons why I tend to agree with him. People around the world have been up in arms at the apartheid State of Israel’s genocide in Gaza starting after the Hamas attack of Oct 7, 2023. Calls from around the world fell on deaf ears as the West, led by the US, unconditionally supported, armed and facilitated the Zionist state’s assault on the Strip. Some 70,000 Gaza Palestinians were slaughtered, including about 20,000 children and a large number of women, elderly and the infirm, ie, non-combatants. But it remained business as usual as far as the genocidal apartheid state was concerned. Whether in the hope of winning laurels or heeding his Gulf friends’ counsel, it was Trump who finally stopped the genocide. At the beginning, he was talking in terms of relocating the Gaza population and developing the Strip as the Middle East’s Riviera. Then, possibly the continuing street protests in the West, the US included, and the constant unhappiness of his well-resourced Gulf friends made him stay his hand and he made clear his plan did not envisage or include anyone being displaced from Gaza. Pakistan has wisely sought safety in numbers and has joined the Board as part of an OIC bloc. His announcements thus far have fallen way short of suggesting any pathway to Palestinian statehood. This is a major negative. Especially at a time when the apartheid state has accelerated evictions of Palestinians and the expansion of settlements in the West Bank. But, despite some 450 murders of Gaza Palestinians since last October’s ceasefire by Israel, the mass killing that continued unabated for two years and claimed at the very least 70,000 lives has stopped. If joining the Board means that the magnitude of killing has stopped and many more lives saved, then perhaps it is worth it. Pakistan has wisely sought safety in numbers and has joined the Board as part of an OIC bloc. This makes it easier in relative terms to have its voice heard. Perhaps, collectively, they can counter and dilute the apartheid state’s influence with Trump. And if the going gets too frustrating, then they can exit en bloc without one state having to face the seemingly unstable US leader’s wrath. Let’s not forget, the US is Pakistan’s largest export market valued at between $5 billion and $6bn a year. Pakistan is also currently in an IMF programme — an institution with huge American influence, which has brought in badly needed foreign exchange injections. Coupled with meeting some of Pakistan’s military spares/upgrade needs such as the $640 million upgrade of PAF F-16 aircraft which extends their operational age to 2040, all these factors make Pakistan’s decision understandable. In addition, Pakistan military’s performance during last May’s clash with India seems to have boosted the country’s standing in the region as well, with Trump constantly endorsing the PAF’s verified kill claims against its arch-rival, the IAF. This element, along with effective diplomacy by the hybrid leadership, has opened up opportunities. While I wouldn’t go as far as to repeat what some analysts are saying about Pakistan being now the net security provider in the region, the defence pact with Saudi Arabia is a significant milestone. The one interesting fact about this Board is that apart from the US, not a single UN Security Council member has joined it. Russia, China, Britain and France have so far not joined and don’t appear to be doing so either. The impact of this will become clear over time. Many pragmatic decisions taken to safeguard the national interest may not pass the principled position test. My first and foremost concern is that the issues affecting the lives of the Palestinians in Gaza, and then the West Bank, are to be decided by an apex body that does not have a single Palestinian on it. It will be left to other Muslim states’ representatives to carry the Palestinian mantle. Their past record of standing up for the rights of the Palestinians is not very inspiring, but the Gaza genocide seems to have shaken the most docile into sitting up and saying enough is enough. Let’s hope this isn’t wishful thinking. As much as I want to, I don’t see this Board, with chairman Trump armed with the solitary veto and a large number of committed Zionist supporters of the apartheid state including Benjamin Netanyahu himself on it, making progress on Palestinian statehood. But if it stops the genocide, and leads to some relief for the Gaza population and sets things on the path to reconstruction and rehabilitation it will be worthwhile. This is how powerless we are to see justice prevail in the world. Since this Board is unlikely to last a day after Trump’s term ends, one can safely say it may not achieve much more except give the US leader another opportunity to blow his own trumpet and make largely unfounded claims of success and impact. For Pakistan coming out unscathed at the end and more tightly aligned with Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Qatar and Indonesia would be a diplomatic and strategic win, particularly because the nation’s perennial ally China is reportedly fine with the decision.

Saner minds in the world community that have Mr Trump’s ear must insist that plans for a Zionist-neocon war against Iran must be jettisoned.

      "title_orig": "Staying relevant",
      "summary_orig": "PAKISTAN has officially joined the Trump-led Board of Peace (BoP), aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza. This decision reflects Pakistan’s usual realpolitik approach to the Middle East. However, in Pakistan, realpolitik is often seen as a national weakness. Since the Kuwait invasion, the US invasion of Iraq, the deployment of forces in Yemen, and most recently, attempts to stop the Israel-Palestine conflict, Pakistan has chosen a pragmatic foreign policy. These decisions are justified by geo-economic needs and the desire to stay relevant in the West and Middle East. The key question is: if Pakistan had a strong economy and stable political and social systems, would it make the same choices? This question is significant because, in such instances, the establishment often makes decisions that contradict prevailing public sentiments, sentiments shaped by opinion-makers and religious clergy who promote a moral narrative anchored in a narrow worldview. In contrast, the establishment tends to adopt a more grounded, interest-based approach. Pragmatism exacts a price. Those who advocate a moral-politics narrative continue to delegitimise political and military decision-makers, widening the gap between public opinion and state policy. It is worth examining whether a stronger economy and greater political stability would compel Pakistan’s leadership to weigh public sentiment more heavily, or whether strategic interests would still dominate policy choices. If Pakistan had a strong economy and stable systems, would it make the same choices? Most countries that have joined Trump’s BoP so far tend to have weak democratic credentials and are predominantly Muslim states that do not prioritise public opinion in foreign policy; their ruling elites often hold worldviews distinct from those of their populations. In contrast, democracies with some degree of pluralism, such as Indonesia or Turkiye, may consider public sentiment more directly, yet ultimately align their decisions with international norms and their political and strategic interests. Pakistan’s hybrid political system behaves at times like a quasi-monarchy, with critical foreign policy decisions taken outside a broad parliamentary consensus. This dynamic harms the credibility of ruling elites and enables the clergy to reinforce the narrative that the country’s leadership is a ‘puppet of Western imperialism’, asserting that under a truly Islamic system, the decisions would be different. The establishment does not like such equations and continues struggling to produce a counter-narrative. It is understandable why building consensus on sensitive issues, such as joining President Donald Trump’s BoP or participating in a stabilisation force in Gaza, is difficult in parliament; only a few brave legislators are willing to counter dominant popular perceptions. Political elites also prefer that the establishment manage consensus-building in such affairs, an expectation the institution is not equipped to meet without paying a domestic legitimacy cost. No doubt, public opinion is not very supportive of joining the BoP, but the situation in the country this time is different. Those who traditionally exploit such sentiments lack the strength to mobilise the masses or bring them into the streets. The Friday protests called by religious parties, and the occasional large demonstrations organised by the Jamaat-i-Islami, JUI-F, or a Shia party, may provide a degree of catharsis for public sentiment, but they are unlikely to generate sustained momentum. Nor are they capable of creating the kind of impression that would worry Pakistan’s partners in the Gulf or the US.0 Apart from the decision to join the BoP, which is justified from several regional and global perspectives, the hybrid regime has weakened the street power of political and religious parties, setting examples through its handling of the PTI and TLP. Although the two cases are not directly comparable — the PTI’s mass protests were rooted in demands for political rights, while TLP was promoting an extremist agenda — the state security institutions dealt with both through a fully muscular approach. As a result, the TLP is now in complete disarray, while the PTI is struggling to mobilise the masses, mainly in Punjab and the federal capital. This approach reflects the mentality of a hybrid regime that seeks to shape Pakistan into a more authoritarian state. The message is clear for all domestic actors. However, the durability of this model remains uncertain. Much depends on whether this approach can deliver economic improvements, ease public hardship and enhance economic indicators, a challenge that remains considerable. The realpolitik behind joining the BoP is evident; Pakistan seeks to remain relevant in regional affairs while enhancing defence and economic cooperation with Gulf and African nations. Another angle is that Pakistan has effectively joined the club of Trump’s allies, while India is in the opposite camp, deepening economic and defence collaboration with the EU and its member states, many of which have been at odds with Trump’s policies recently. In this context, Pakistan had limited options to remain neutral. Although association with Trump may not be popular in domestic or international public opinion, it has provided the architects and operators of the hybrid regime with an opportunity to gain legitimacy and consolidate their control over the political system, something they have sought for decades. As for the argument that Pakistan should not have joined the BoP because it is a parallel structure to the UN, this reasoning is flawed. The international body has long struggled to provide an effective dispute-resolution mechanism. Who knows this better than Pakistan, given what happened to its Kashmir resolutions in the Security Council? The UN has a history of siding with the powerful and with those on whom it depends on for funding. Whatever Trump wants, he can achieve through the UN as well; after all, it was the UNSC that first passed Resolution 2803, which effectively endorsed Trump’s peace plan for Gaza. If viewed closely, President Trump and the architects of Pakistan’s hybrid regime share a similar worldview; the only difference is that Trump has an entire world to play with.

      "summary_en": "PAKISTAN has officially joined the Trump-led Board of Peace (BoP), aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza. This decision reflects Pakistan’s usual realpolitik approach to the Middle East. However, in Pakistan, realpolitik is often seen as a national weakness. Since the Kuwait invasion, the US invasion of Iraq, the deployment of forces in Yemen, and most recently, attempts to stop the Israel-Palestine conflict, Pakistan has chosen a pragmatic foreign policy. These decisions are justified by geo-economic needs and the desire to stay relevant in the West and Middle East. The key question is: if Pakistan had a strong economy and stable political and social systems, would it make the same choices? This question is significant because, in such instances, the establishment often makes decisions that contradict prevailing public sentiments, sentiments shaped by opinion-makers and religious clergy who promote a moral narrative anchored in a narrow worldview. In contrast, the establishment tends to adopt a more grounded, interest-based approach. Pragmatism exacts a price. Those who advocate a moral-politics narrative continue to delegitimise political and military decision-makers, widening the gap between public opinion and state policy. It is worth examining whether a stronger economy and greater political stability would compel Pakistan’s leadership to weigh public sentiment more heavily, or whether strategic interests would still dominate policy choices. If Pakistan had a strong economy and stable systems, would it make the same choices? Most countries that have joined Trump’s BoP so far tend to have weak democratic credentials and are predominantly Muslim states that do not prioritise public opinion in foreign policy; their ruling elites often hold worldviews distinct from those of their populations. In contrast, democracies with some degree of pluralism, such as Indonesia or Turkiye, may consider public sentiment more directly, yet ultimately align their decisions with international norms and their political and strategic interests. Pakistan’s hybrid political system behaves at times like a quasi-monarchy, with critical foreign policy decisions taken outside a broad parliamentary consensus.

An Islamabad lawyer couple, often seen standing beside citizens challenging human rights violations, has been condemned by a sessions court to serve time for statements deemed too controversial to be posted on social media platform X. Imaan Zainab-Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, are both promising human rights lawyers and activists known for fighting high-profile cases involving enforced disappearances, blasphemy accusations, and judicial independence. They have often pleaded in court on behalf of citizens with no means to pay for legal counsel or the privilege to navigate a broken justice system on their own. Many believe their insistence on representing victims of state excesses, outspokenness on issues like free speech and rule of law, and criticism of state institutions are what prompted the recent witch-hunt against them. In the past few weeks, the two found themselves in the crosshairs of an unrelenting campaign of lawfare, which included a previously undisclosed case that ‘magically’ resurfaced when their detention was sought. The ordeal culminated in a dramatic arrest on Jan 23, followed by a conviction the very next day. The National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority, the complainant in this case, had accused Ms Mazari last July of “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”. Her husband was deemed complicit for reposting those posts. A court order authored by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka now holds the two guilty of ‘glorification of an offence’, ‘cyberterrorism’ and ‘false and fake information’. Their punishment: rigorous imprisonment for five years and a fine of Rs5m each for the first charge; 10 years and Rs30m each for the second; and two years and Rs1m each for the third. One does not need the content of the offending tweets to guess what they likely said, just as one does not need legal reasoning to understand this verdict. Our legal community has historically played a central role in resisting despotism and defending constitutional norms. This conviction raises the question of whether that tradition is being deliberately weakened through harsh punishment. If such convictions stand, the message to lawyers, journalists and citizens alike is unmistakable: dissent will not merely be discouraged, it will be criminalised.

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: British counter-terrorism police have charged three men in connection with a series of “highly targeted” attacks against Pakistani dissidents living in the United Kingdom, including a former minister in the Imran Khan government. The alleged assaults took place in Cambridgeshire and Buckinghamshire between Dec 24 and 31 and were directed at two prominent supporters of the jailed former Pakistani prime minister. Counter-terrorism police took over the investigation from local forces, citing the deliberate and targeted nature of the incidents. One of the victims, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, a former accountability adviser in Mr Khan’s cabinet, said he was brutally assaulted at his home after an attacker confirmed his identity. He told British media that he had been punched repeatedly and is now in hiding, fearing for his and his family’s safety. On Friday, police confirmed that three British nationals had been charged. Karl Blackbird, 40, and Clark McAulay, 39, face charges of conspiracy to cause actual bodily harm in relation to separate incidents. A third man, Doneto Brammer, 21, has been charged in connection with the attack on Akbar’s home and faces additional charges, including possession of a prohibited weapon and conspiracy to commit arson. All three appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Saturday. Several other suspects have been arrested during coordinated raids across London, the Midlands and Essex and later released on bail. Police said the investigation remains ongoing and that detectives are keeping an open mind regarding motive and possible links between the attacks. Published in Dawn, January 25th, 2026",

The civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue service under Hamas authority, said the drone strike killed the two teenagers near Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza. The territory’s Al Shifa Hospital said it received the two bodies, adding they were two boys aged 13 and 15. The Israeli military claimed the pair had posed an “immediate threat” to its soldiers. Another fatality was also reported in a separate incident when an Israeli quadcopter struck a group of civilians in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, leaving one Palestinian dead, the civil defence agency said. It did not provide details on the person killed in that incident. Israeli forces have killed at least 477 Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Israeli media restrictions in Gaza and other areas mean casualty figures cannot be verified. US envoys in Israel Meanwhile, US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were in Israel on Saturday to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, mainly to discuss Gaza, two people briefed on the matter said. The US on Thursday announced plans for a “New Gaza” rebuilt from scratch, to include residential towers, data centres and seaside resorts. The project forms part of President Donald Trump’s push to advance an October ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas that has been shaken by repeated violations. A spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister’s office confirmed that the meeting was planned but did not provide details.

      "summary_orig": "CISARUA: A predawn landslide killed at least eight people and left more than 80 missing on Indonesia’s main island of Java on Saturday, a disaster official said. Triggered by heavy rainfall, it struck villages in Java’s West Bandung region in the early hours — at around 2.30am (1930 GMT Friday) — and buried residential areas. Floods and landslides are common across the vast archipelago during the rainy season, which typically runs from October to March. “There was a rumbling noise, like thunder,” Oyoh, a resident of Pasirlangu village who, like many Indonesians, only has one name, told AFP. “It had been raining non-stop since the morning, and then it [the landslide] happened. I immediately felt scared.” Triggered by heavy rainfall, it struck villages in Java’s West Bandung region The 52-year-old had been evacuated to the village’s government office along with dozens of others, mainly women and children. She said her house survived the landslide, but her niece, her niece’s husband and their two children were missing. Abdul Muhari, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, confirmed that eight people were killed and 82 were unaccounted for. West Bandung’s mayor Jeje Ritchie Ismail told reporters that the military, police and volunteers were assisting in the search. However, he warned that the terrain was extremely difficult and the ground remained unstable. The local search and rescue agency said it was conducting manual excavation, spraying the soil with water pumps and using drones to search for the victims. Forest loss The disaster comes after tropical storms and intense monsoon rains late last year triggered flooding and landslides that killed around 1,200 people and displaced more than 240,000 in Indonesia’s Sumatra island, according to official figures. Environmentalists, experts and the government have pointed to the role forest loss played in the flooding and landslides that washed torrents of mud into villages. Forests help absorb rainfall and stabilise the ground held by their roots, and their absence makes areas more prone to flash flooding and landslides, David Gaveau, founder of conservation start-up The TreeMap, told AFP in December. Indonesia lost more than 240,000 hectares of primary forest in 2024, according to analysis by The TreeMap’s Nusantara Atlas project. It is regularly among the countries with the largest annual forest loss as mining, plantations and fires have caused the clearance of large tracts of lush vegetation in recent decades, NGOs have said. The government filed multiple lawsuits following the Sumatra floods, seeking more than $200 million in damages against six firms. It also stripped more than two dozen permits this week from forestry, mining and hydroelectric companies in Sumatra. This month, torrential rains battered Indonesia’s Siau island, causing a flash flood that killed at least 16 people. Published in Dawn, January 25th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi facilities up for grabs; Privatisation Commission assures domestic, foreign firms of level-playing field; abandons G2G mode amid investors’ high interest • Seeks proposals to appoint financial adviser for Roosevelt Hotel; plans joint venture for mixed-use development; aims to finalise transaction in a year ISLAMABAD: The Privatisation Commission announced on Saturday that the outsourcing operation for the country’s three major airports — Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi — will move to an open bidding mode following a high level of interest from various investors. The commission said the shift from a government-to-government (G2G) mode to open bidding aims to generate a competitive process wherein all domestic and foreign investors will have a level playing field to participate in the bidding process. According to a commission statement, the envisaged competitive process priorities inclusivity by welcoming participation from all eligible entities, including those from partner nations, while affording equal opportunities to local and foreign investors. This approach is designed to promote transparency and fair competition, deliver the most advantageous results for Pakistan’s economy and reinforce relationships with international partners, the commission said. The government has been actively considering options for Islamabad International Airport, Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport and Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport through appropriate modes, including management contracts and long-term commercial concessions. As part of this strategy, the Islamabad airport has been included in the active privatisation program, consistent with the ongoing process for the airports at Karachi and Lahore. This follows constructive dialogue with entities from partner nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia, as well as other international stakeholders. The commission noted that the primary objectives are to enhance efficiency, improve service delivery, maximise revenue generation, upgrade infrastructure and attract private sector investments. These efforts align with the nation’s economic vision to cultivate collaboration to modernise the aviation sector. Roosevelt Hotel Separately, the Privatisation Com­m­ission has invited technical and financial proposals for the appointment of a financial adviser for the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, aiming to secure a joint venture for mixed-use development of the elite Manhattan property owned by the Pakistan government. According to the commission’s website, proposals can be submitted by Feb 16. The government intends for the transaction regarding the Roosevelt Hotel to be completed in one year. The commission intends to offer the property for setting up a joint venture project through the “best suited transaction structure and mode of privatisation”. The appointed financial adviser will be tasked with conducting market sounding to validate investor interest in the hotel. The adviser must identify potentially interested parties and assess the level of interest in the transaction structure options covered in the transaction structure report and recommendations of the earlier financial adviser. Additionally, the financial adviser will develop and implement an effective marketing strategy with the approval of the Privatisation Commission. This includes developing and implementing a plan for introducing the Roosevelt’s site and projecting its image to bolster its value, “enabling expression of interest in the property from prospective investors”. The adviser will also be required to arrange meetings with potential investors in order to develop a better understanding of investor profiles and the investment climate. Located in midtown on Madison Avenue, the Roosevelt Hotel is the only real estate entity on the government’s privatisation program. The 19-storey property is considered among the elite hotels in Manhattan, comprising 1,025 rooms with a covered area of over 600,000 square feet. It is wholly owned by PIA Investments Ltd (PIAIL), which is owned and managed by the Pakistan government. Published in Dawn, January 25th, 2026",

This follows constructive dialogue with entities from partner nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia, as well as other international stakeholders. The commission noted that the primary objectives are to enhance efficiency, improve service delivery, maximise revenue generation, upgrade infrastructure and attract private sector investments. These efforts align with the nation’s economic vision to cultivate collaboration to modernise the aviation sector. Roosevelt Hotel Separately, the Privatisation Com­m­ission has invited technical and financial proposals for the appointment of a financial adviser for the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, aiming to secure a joint venture for mixed-use development of the elite Manhattan property owned by the Pakistan government. According to the commission’s website, proposals can be submitted by Feb 16. The government intends for the transaction regarding the Roosevelt Hotel to be completed in one year. The commission intends to offer the property for setting up a joint venture project through the “best suited transaction structure and mode of privatisation”. The appointed financial adviser will be tasked with conducting market sounding to validate investor interest in the hotel. The adviser must identify potentially interested parties and assess the level of interest in the transaction structure options covered in the transaction structure report and recommendations of the earlier financial adviser. Additionally, the financial adviser will develop and implement an effective marketing strategy with the approval of the Privatisation Commission. This includes developing and implementing a plan for introducing the Roosevelt’s site and projecting its image to bolster its value, “enabling expression of interest in the property from prospective investors”. The adviser will also be required to arrange meetings with potential investors in order to develop a better understanding of investor profiles and the investment climate. Located in midtown on Madison Avenue, the Roosevelt Hotel is the only real estate entity on the government’s privatisation program. The 19-storey property is considered among the elite hotels in Manhattan, comprising 1,025 rooms with a covered area of over 600,000 square feet. It is wholly owned by PIA Investments Ltd (PIAIL), which is owned and managed by the Pakistan government. Published in Dawn, January 25th, 2026",

      "summary": "• Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi facilities up for grabs; Privatisation Commission assures domestic, foreign firms of level-playing field; abandons G2G mode amid investors’ high interest • Seeks proposals to appoint financial adviser for Roosevelt Hotel; plans joint venture for mixed-use development; aims to finalise transaction in a year ISLAMABAD: The Privatisation Commission announced on Saturday that the outsourcing operation for the country’s three major airports — Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi — will move to an open bidding mode following a high level of interest from various investors. The commission said the shift from a government-to-government (G2G) mode to open bidding aims to generate a competitive process wherein all domestic and foreign investors will have a level playing field to participate in the bidding process. According to a commission statement, the envisaged competitive process priorities inclusivity by welcoming participation from all eligible entities, including those from partner nations, while affording equal opportunities to local and foreign investors. This approach is designed to promote transparency and fair competition, deliver the most advantageous results for Pakistan’s economy and reinforce relationships with international partners, the commission said.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The maritime sector posted a record Rs100 billion profit in 2025, mainly due to reforms in port efficiency, cost reduction and the clearing of long-delayed policies. In its annual perform­ance report, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs highlighted that these reforms ranged from modernising ports, shipping and fisheries sectors to unlocking the full potential of the blue economy. Karachi Port handled a record 54 million tonnes of cargo, while average vessel dwell time was reduced by 24 to 36 hours through closer coordination among port authorities, customs and other agencies, achieving an average turnaround of five days in line with regional benchmarks. Cost-cutting measures delivered substantial savings. Reduced overtime at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) saved about Rs70 million per month, while the abolition of 2,152 re­­d­undant posts across maritime entities lowered human resource costs by billions of rupees. The first bunkering facilities were also established at Karachi Port and Port Qasim, expected to save foreign exchange and attract transshipment traffic. The KPT and Port Qasim Authority reclaimed around 150 acres of encroached land, valued at roughly Rs110 billion. Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry said a central element of the overhaul was the finalisation of the National Maritime Policy, which brings shipping, ports, fisheries and maritime security under a single framework to guide sustainable growth. “The government also approved a National Shipping Policy aimed at expanding the Pakistan-flagged fleet to reduce reliance on foreign carriers, a longstanding drain on foreign exchange,” he added. He said stakeholder con­­s­ultations had been co­­mpleted on the Natio­n­­al Fisheries and Aquacul­ture Policy, which targets annual seafood exports of $2 billion and the creation of around two million jobs across coastal communities and allied industries. At the deep-sea port of Gwadar, 72 acres of free-zone land were handed over to operators, while bids were invited for an off-dock terminal on 100 acres to attract transit trade from Central Asia and beyond.

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that the federal cabinet had approved Pakistan joining the Board of Peace, which is led by US President Donald Trump. A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — had gathered on stage on Thursday with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland, to put their names to the founding charter of the body. Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, the Board of Peace’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts. Speaking to the media outside the Pakistan High Commission in London on Saturday, the premier said that he had a “very good trip” to Davos. He said that Pakistan had received an invitation from Trump to join the Board of Peace, adding that he accepted with the approval of the cabinet. “We signed with the hope that there will be peace in Gaza, that Palestinians will receive the respect they deserve, and that Gaza will be reconstructed,” the premier said. PM Shehbaz said the humanitarian situation in Gaza required urgent international attention and reiterated Pakistan’s long-standing position in support of Palestinian rights. The premier also highlighted his meeting with International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Kristalina Georgieva, describing it as positive. He did not share details of the discussion but said Pakistan would continue to engage constructively with international financial institutions as it works to stabilise its economy. Commenting on regional security, PM Shehbaz said he had thanked Mr Trump for what he described as his role in “saving millions of lives in South Asia by ending the India-Pakistan war”, without elaborating further. Meanwhile, the prime minister’s aide, Rana Sanaullah, also said on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan ’ that the federal cabinet had endorsed the decision to join the Board of Peace. “There was much discussion on this and the cabinet endorsed it. After the cabinet’s endorsement, the prime minister accepted this [invitation],” he said. “The development happened in the past week to 10 days. Based on this, the government signed after consultations with the cabinet. I know this, I was in that consultation,” he said. The decision to join the board was criticised, with politicians and analysts saying that the decision was “unwise” and Pakistan had “jumped the gun”. In response, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry had defended the move in the National Assembly, saying the country joined the body meant to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding in the interest of the Palestinian people. The issue was also raised during a joint sitting of Parliament on Friday, with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman claiming the decision was taken because of the “fear of Trump”. The government had again defended the move, with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal saying that Pakistan being at the “centre stage” along with its brother Muslim countries to contribute towards peace in Gaza and Palestine was a “diplomatic win”.",

A statement by the navy said that PNS ships Tabuk and Moawin successfully conducted the medical evacuation of a Sri Lankan national requiring “urgent medical attention” on an Indonesian-flagged merchant vessel (MV) Grey Palm. ​”The operation was initiated following a formal request from [the] Sri Lankan Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) for [the] provision of medical assistance to a Sri Lankan national crew member in critical condition onboard MV Grey Palm, positioned 800 nautical miles (approximately 1,500 kilometres) from Pakistan’s coast,” the statement said. The Pakistan Navy dispatched its ships as first responders and evacuated the Sri Lankan crew member along with an attendant, it said. Subsequently, the patient was immediately provided with the necessary treatment aboard the navy vessel, it added. “The Sri Lankan authorities and family of the individual thanked Pakistan for [the] prompt response and support,” the statement said. “​The successful medical evacuation is yet another testament to operational readiness and [the] longstanding commitment of Pakistan for the safety of life at sea, irrespective of nationality.” President Asif Ali Zardari praised the rescue operation, which took place 1,500 km off the coast of Gwadar, according to a statement from the Presidency. Paying tribute to the two vessels and their crews for their professionalism and prompt response, President Zardari was quoted as saying, “Pakistan Navy has fulfilled its international responsibilities by transcending nationality to protect human life at sea.”",

      "summary_orig": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday thanked his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar for his “ strong support ” and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) amid the prevailing tense situation between Washington and Tehran. On Friday, the UNHRC adopted a resolution — with 25 votes in favour, seven against and 14 abstentions — to extend the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran for two years. The resolution also extended the mandate of the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran by one year and called for an urgent investigation by the mission, in the context of the deadly nationwide protests in Iran that started in December. Pakistan, along with China and India, voted against the resolution. In a post on X on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said Dar, who is on a visit to Dubai, received a telephone call from Araghchi. The Iranian minister thanked the deputy prime minister for “his strong support and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, including its call for a vote as well as voting against the resolution concerning Iran”, the FO added. The ministry said the two dignitaries exchanged views on regional and international developments, while Araghchi conveyed “deep appreciation” for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Pakistani government and the people. Separately, Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam also thanked the country’s leadership for its “historic and unwavering support” at the UNHRC by “calling for a vote and casting a negative vote against the unjustified resolution targeting Iran”. In his post on X, Moghadam also conveyed special appreciation to the representatives of the Permanent Mission of Pakistan in Geneva for “their tireless efforts and dedication” in the pursuit of justice. “This principled stance marks the third consecutive defeat of unprovoked and politically motivated actions against Iran over the past year, including the unprovoked twelve-day aggression, recent foreign-backed riots aimed at destabilising the country, and the misuse of international organisations to pursue capricious and hostile agendas by certain members.” The envoy went on saying that such “steadfast support” was a clear reflection of the country’s “enduring commitment to justice, multilateralism, respect for human rights, and national sovereignty”, adding that it would be “remembered with deep appreciation”. On Friday, a senior Iranian official said the country would treat any attack “as an all-out war against us”, after US President Donald Trump’s comment that a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely.",
