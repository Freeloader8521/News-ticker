      "summary_orig": "The PPP on Wednesday continued questioning the government on the recent deforestation in Islamabad, expressing dissatisfaction with the answers given by the government in a session of the National Assembly (NA) a day earlier. In the past few days, there has been widespread criticism over the cutting of thousands of mature trees in various locations of the federal capital, including the levelling of acres of tree cover around Shakarparian. On Tuesday, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had informed lawmakers that 29,115 trees had been removed from the Islamabad Capital Territory region (ICT), but that more than this number would be planted in the coming months. PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri, addressing a press conference, said that the issue had been raised in the NA as “all parliamentarians were concerned”, hoping that they would receive answers to the “questions that have been flying about”. However, she said, the response by the state minister for interior during Tuesday’s NA session had only raised more questions. “Sometimes it is said that it is because of pollen allergies … yesterday another impression was given, that there are some brown districts and some green districts — so you have to keep some brown and some green,” Marri said. “At what cost? At the cost of your environment? At the cost of urban planning? At the cost of biodiversity in your urban areas? At what cost?” She pointed out that not only were political parties asking these questions, but also civil society, adding that the World Wide Fund of Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) had also shown serious concern about the way the trees were being cut down. “It is not just cutting,” she said. “It is an action that is challenging your environmental governance; it raises questions on transparency.” Marri particularly took exception to the lack of transparency shown by the government in its response to the outcry. “You tell us: for however many trees you have cut, how many have you planted? We are not being shown this. We are only shown trees being cut, not planted.“ “We don’t know how many trees are being planted — we are only told that these many thousands have been planted. But what proof is there of this?” she added. The lawmaker further said, “To give them some benefit of the doubt: if you cut the trees and there was some good reason for it, then why are you running from giving answers?” Marri added that Chaudhry “should have given a patient answer” in the NA session yesterday. “He felt that maybe the CDA [Capital Development Authority] was being attacked; it was not like that.” She further said, “If you’re going to cut trees by the thousands in Pakistan’s capital — that is the face of your country — and so boldly, then the question will be raised… and will not just be asked to you by political parties, by the PPP, but the public will ask, civil society will ask, journalists will ask. They ask you and you get upset — that is not appropriate.” “If there is indeed purity in this action of yours, then share it. Tell us,” she added. Marri regretted that the government had not given a press conference on the matter of the trees, saying, “There’s a press conference on everything. But why did the government not take the public into confidence on the cutting of trees, through a press conference or a media briefing? This should have happened, and I regret to say it did not.” The CDA has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed, as they had been causing pollen allergies . However, social media users had alleged that, besides paper mulberry, indigenous trees were also chopped down, making Shakarparian look like barren land. Climate Change Minister Musadiq Malik has defended the move , stating that paper mulberry was an invasive and “life-threatening” species. Load shedding concerns At the same press conference, Marri slammed the state of load shedding in Pakistan, particularly focusing on Sindh. She said that if one called their sub-divisional officer, they would be told that the load shedding was because a household had not paid their electricity bill: “If one house didn’t pay the electricity bill, then you’ll cut electricity for the whole neighbourhood? … If not paying the bill is illegal, then cutting the electricity of those who do pay the bill is also illegal.” Marri lamented that this was the state of affairs in winter, wondering what would happen in summer. She also condemned gas load shedding and the lack of gas provided to Sindh, including Karachi, although it was a natural resource found in Sindh. She added that according to Article 158 of the Constitution, the first right to gas went to the people of the wellhead region. However, she said, people were being deprived of gas and when gas was available, they were being sold imported gas at high prices.",

Although Iranians were able to call abroad, they could not receive calls from outside the country, several people in the capital told Associated Press. The internet remained blocked, they said, though it is possible to access some government-approved websites. Cloudfare - an internet infrastructure provider, and one of several companies and monitors tracking the status of internet traffic in Iran – said traffic volumes have remained “at a fraction of a percent of previous levels”. Its latest update as of 01:00 UTC (which is about three hours and 30 minutes ago), shows a continued widespread blackout. Iran has been under an internet shutdown since Thursday night. Brief windows of connectivity were observed on Friday, but these did not last, according to Cloudfare. Netblocks , an independent global internet monitor, also notes that while some phone calls from Iran are connecting, there is “no secure way to communicate” and the general public remain cut off from the outside world.

      "summary_orig": "An important bridge over the Kurram River in North Waziristan’s Shewa tehsil was blown up by unknown attackers using explosives on Wednesday. The structure was completely destroyed, severing land links between the area and Miranshah, Bannu and other adjoining regions. The incident has once again raised serious questions about the law and order situation in the volatile district. According to local sources, unidentified attackers planted a large quantity of explosives beneath the bridge during the early morning hours. The explosion was heard from many miles away, spreading fear and panic among the area’s residents. Following the incident, police and security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area. An investigation was launched into the incident. The destruction of the bridge — a vital line of communication in the region — is likely to cause severe hardships for the people as it served as an important route for the daily movement of civilians, patients, students, traders and government employees. Its collapse has also disrupted access to healthcare facilities, supply of essential goods and routine commercial activities, forcing the region’s residents to use much longer and more difficult alternative routes. Local sources added that security forces’ convoys occasionally used the route as well, leading to concerns that the attack may have been aimed at destabilising the region and undermining peace. According to official sources, the bridge was primarily used by civilians for relief operations and movement. Tribal elder Malik Islam Khan and other local elders strongly condemned the incident, calling it a “heinous and cowardly act”. They said such actions primarily harm innocent civilians who are already suffering due to years of insecurity and underdevelopment. They demanded immediate and strict action against those responsible. Local political leader Abdullah Khan also expressed grave concern over the incident, stating that the people of North Waziristan had made immense sacrifices for peace, and such attacks were an attempt to sabotage those efforts. He urged the government to further strengthen security in the area and ensure the protection of critical infrastructure. Authorities said a comprehensive investigation is underway, while a report has been sent to senior officials regarding the bridge’s reconstruction and interim alternative arrangements. Attacks on infrastructure While attacks targeting infrastructure are fairly common in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has also seen a rise in such incidents in recent months. On December 7 , unidentified terrorists blew up a link bridge in the Mamandkhel area of the Bannu district using explosive material, affecting public movement in the area. Also last month, within a span of a week, North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil witnessed two incidents of terrorists blowing up government schools. November also saw two incidents of terrorists attempting to blow up bridges in Bannu. One plot was foiled by the police’s bomb disposal squad, while the improvised explosive device (IED) in the other detonated prematurely, killing the attacker .",

      "summary_orig": "A crane at a China-backed high-speed rail project in Thailand collapsed onto and derailed a passenger train on Wednesday, killing at least 22 people and injuring scores, local authorities said. Footage from the scene verified by AFP showed the crane’s broken structure resting on giant concrete pillars, with smoke rising from the wreckage of the train below. Rescuers worked to extract passengers from the tilted carriages in Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeast of the capital Bangkok. Thatchapon Chinnawong, the district police chief, told AFP that 22 people had been confirmed dead and 80 more were injured. “We are now asking the hospital to say how many people are in critical condition,” Thatchapon said. “At around 9:00am, I heard a loud noise, like something sliding down from above, followed by two explosions,” said 54-year-old local resident Mitr Intrpanya, who was at the scene. “When I went to see what had happened, I found the crane sitting on a passenger train with three carriages. “The metal from the crane appeared to strike the middle of the second carriage, slicing it in half,” Mitr told AFP . The accident happened at a construction site that is part of a $5.4-billion project backed by Beijing to build a high-speed rail network in Thailand. It aims to connect Bangkok to Kunming in China via Laos by 2028 as part of China’s vast Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). “A crane collapsed onto a train causing it to derail and catch fire,” the Nakhon Ratchasima provincial public relations department said in a statement. Live footage aired by local media showed rescue workers rushing to the scene, with a brightly coloured train derailed on its side as smoke billowed from the debris. Thatchapon, the police chief, later told AFP that authorities were pausing the rescue operation due to “chemical leakage” at the scene. The Nakhon Ratchasima provincial department said the train was travelling from Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani province. Transport Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said 195 people were on board the train and authorities were rushing to identify the deceased. He ordered officials to determine the cause of the accident, according to a statement. Thailand already has around 5,000 kilometres of railway, but the run-down network has long driven people to favour travel by road. Upon completion of the 600km high-speed railway, Chinese-made trains will run from Bangkok to Nong Khai, on the Mekong River border with Laos, at up to 250 km/h. Industrial and construction site accidents have long been common in Thailand, where lax enforcement of safety regulations often leads to deadly incidents. In 2023, a freight train killed eight people after it struck a pickup truck crossing railway tracks in eastern Thailand. A freight train killed at least 18 people and injured more than 40 others in 2020 when it crashed into a bus carrying passengers to a religious ceremony.",

      "summary_orig": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan on Wednesday, said a statement by the department. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “On the special instructions of the inspector general of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, targeted operations against Fitna-al-Khawarij have been intensified in response to the attacks on the police,” the CTD said. It added that this morning, DI Khan’s CTD successfully carried out an operation on a confirmed intelligence report. “CTD teams reached the spot and surrounded the terrorists, who opened fire to avoid arrest. CTD teams also retaliated in self-defence, as a result of which the khawariji terrorists were killed,” said the statement. During the search operation, it said, the bodies of three terrorists were recovered and identified. According to the CTD, the slain terrorists were directly involved in attacks on police and security forces. The statement added that three Kalashnikovs, nine magazines, two hand grenades and several cartridges were also recovered from the slain terrorists. “In view of the presence of more terrorists and facilitators in the area, the scope of the investigation, including search operations, has also been expanded,” it said. According to the press release, KP’s Inspector General (IG) of Police Zulfiqar Hameed and the CTD additional IG paid tribute to the personnel of the CTD special weapons and tactics teams for the successful operation, and said that the series of targeted operations would be further intensified to make an example of Fitna al-Khawarij . “He added that the response to attacks on police and security forces will be very severe and the struggle will continue until the last khawarij is destroyed,” the statement said. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi commended the CTD for “sending three Indian-sponsored terrorists to hell” in DI Khan, a statement from his ministry said. Hailing their courage and professional abilities, the statement said the CTD had thwarted the “nefarious intentions” of the terrorists. “The entire nation proudly stands with the brave forces in completely eradicating the menace of Fitna al-Hindustan ,” Naqvi was quoted as saying.

Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. At least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts on Monday, officials said. On Saturday, the military’s media wing said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. Also on Saturday, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu. The day before, a policeman was martyred after gunmen attacked him in the Bajaur tribal district, while another died in Khyber when gunmen ambushed a car. Three cops were injured in Bannu last week as a police vehicle transporting prisoners to Hangu came under attack by “terrorists”. Also in Bannu, a former tehsil nazim was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on January 6.",

Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “On the special instructions of the inspector general of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, targeted operations against Fitna-al-Khawarij have been intensified in response to the attacks on the police,” the CTD said.

CTD teams also retaliated in self-defence, as a result of which the khawariji terrorists were killed,” said the statement. During the search operation, it said, the bodies of three terrorists were recovered and identified. According to the CTD, the slain terrorists were directly involved in attacks on police and security forces. The statement added that three Kalashnikovs, nine magazines, two hand grenades and several cartridges were also recovered from the slain terrorists. “In view of the presence of more terrorists and facilitators in the area, the scope of the investigation, including search operations, has also been expanded,” it said.

      "summary_orig": "My journey into higher education began in my coastal hometown of Pasni, passed through the sprawl of Karachi, and eventually settled in Lyari — a neighbourhood with its own rhythms and ruptures. Life here is compressed into narrow lanes, where only a sliver of sky is visible between tangled wires, flags, and ageing buildings. Power outages are routine, and space is scarce. In such a place, a library is not a luxury; it is a necessity. For many residents, the only familiar name is the Mulla Fazil Hall Library. Established in the 1980s, it was known as the Lyari Textbook Library in its early days and became a homestay for students across the town, including myself. My days were spent there, not just studying, but also listening. With pricked ears, I would eavesdrop on conversations at neighbouring tables with determined attention that drifted from philosophy and poetry to art and music. These conversations were as much shaped by curiosity as they were by survival. The entrance to the Mulla Fazil Library before it was demolished. Today, the main library building is undergoing construction and the facility has temporarily been relocated. Reaching it now requires a Qingqi ride along fractured roads, a jolting passage that ends on the main road, followed by a short walk. The bumpy ride often culminates in a locked door as the temporary facility remains closed on most days. When it is open, access comes at a cost: mosquito-infested rooms where dengue and malaria are constant threats, dilapidated and broken toilets, and the air thick with dust. This is a paradox at the heart of Lyari — a neighbourhood long known for its intellectual traditions and political consciousness, yet one that today has almost no functioning public library. The hunger for learning persists, but the spaces meant to sustain it have quietly disappeared. The heart of Lyari Until a few years back, the Mulla Fazil Hall Library stood tall in the heart of Lyari, at the Aath Chowk, where eight roads finally unite. Every day, this neighbourhood throbs to that heartbeat: dust rising from chipped streets, the foul odour of overflowing drains, bare electrical wires tangled with red and green striped flags, and walls stained with chalk markings of political slogans. Young boys dart through untidy lanes wearing worn-out football t-shirts featuring Messi, Neymar, Ronaldo and the likes, manholes lie open, puddles glisten with sewage, and yet people move through it all effortlessly, too well-versed in an art that only Lyari teaches. But amid the chaos, a short pause shows what is often missed: Lyari as it truly is — alive, familiar, and stubborn. In today‘s Lyari, the Mulla Fazil Library has been replaced by a ‘mini civic centre’. In late 2022, the Sindh government, in a notification, announced the demolition of the library. Initially, no one took the notification seriously. “I remember reacting with a laughing emoji when I first saw it,” said Imran Fakhir Baloch, a lecturer at the Abdullah Haroon College. In Lyari, he told Dawn , such notices arrived often full of promise but were rarely followed into reality. “But we were wrong this time,” said Imran. On January 2, 2023, the Sindh government awarded the contract for the civic centre’s construction. The plan featured a basement, five floors, and a sixth to be added later, all to be completed within one year. Yet, no one clarified where the books, the readers, or the library would fit into the design. A rare offering Imran, who also presides over the Lyari Literary Forum — a Baloch-based literary group that has held study circles in the locality since 2017 — recalled that the Mulla Fazil Library was his group’s home. At gatherings there, discussions and debates went on for hours, seamlessly flowing from literature to art, sociology, philosophy and more. The library, neither too well-equipped nor too visually attractive, was a classic example of years of neglect; its iron shelves rusted, the wood chipped, and books covered in dust. Yet, the building offered something rare in Lyari — space and light. In a town where the noise never dies and light scrambles to get past the closely-knit multi-storey buildings, the library, with its wide windows and thick walls, was all people needed to sit and read. A snapshot of literary circles organised at the Mulla Fazil Library. “The beauty of the LLF circles at the library was that they brought together everyone from Lyari in one place, from young students, literary enthusiasts, to the elders. People of all ages sat side by side, listening, debating, learning,” Imran reminisced. But even before the literary forum came to be, the building had long been a quiet gathering spot for Baloch students. “They would bring their own books, meet after classes, and choose a topic to discuss. That’s how it always was here — people gathering at the day’s end,” said Zahid Barakzai, a central member of the LLF and a regular at the Mulla Fazil Library. Thus, when the news of the library‘s demolition spread, a shiver of concern ran through Lyari’s avid readers, manifesting in the form of a protest. They had one clear demand: the books must be saved, and the library relocated. Subsequent discussions and meetings took place, but no one stepped up to offer space. Eventually, Nasir Karim, the then and current chairman of Lyari Town, volunteered to “give space”, all the while emphasising that he was not officially responsible for it. The “space” was a football house owned by him, located a few minutes from the original site of the library. Demolition day And then, on a hot summer afternoon, the day of demolition arrived. Amaan Qazi, a longtime resident of Lyari, has the image of that day etched in his mind. “On one side stood the people of Lyari, those who had spent years at the Mulla Fazil Library and on the other, the local stakeholders: councillors, UC office staff, and others.” “We were waiting, hoping the bulldozers would arrive a little later, just so we could glance at the building one more time,” he recounted to Dawn . But the weak thread of hope that the residents held on to angered the authorities, eventually resulting in an altercation. A view of the torn down Mulla Fazil Library. “There was a fight among the stakeholders over who would take more sariya (iron rods) from the remains of the library,“ said journalist Shabir Arman, who covered the day’s events. “But none of them spoke about the books,” he recalled, adding that during the chaos, several bookshelves disappeared. “Maybe they took those too, to sell.” At a short distance from the site stood Suzuki pickup trucks. They weren’t there for the books, clarified Qazi, but for the officials who loaded the salvaged iron from the library to sell later. The Mulla Fazil Library housed a total of 10,000 books, of which only 7,000 reached their new home. “During the shifting, so many books and shelves were lost,” recalled Akbar Faiz, who was then in charge of libraries in Lyari. Books at the football house. At the football house, the books stayed untouched and unsorted for nearly six months. Rehman Baloch, a member of the Baloch Students Action Committee and another regular at the library, visited the Lyari town office countless times. “Each time, we were told that the football house was being renovated for the library,” he told Dawn . But when the time for sorting finally arrived, not much had changed, contrary to what Rehman and his friends had been told for days and months. The ground floor of the football house, where the library was relocated, was dusty and crumbly. Only the first floor, where the football house’s main gatherings were held, had been freshly painted. A sad state of repairs The first time I visited the ‘new’ library — a pale shadow of what it used to be — was a few months back. It is slumped across the main road in Chakiwara, a restless stretch where a bulk of the traffic from Lee Market rushes toward Shershah, and onward to Hub Chowki. A few steps from the library’s gate, a crowd converges every few hours to catch the Rind Coach, which ferries people between Lyari and Hub Chowki. The sound of engines, horns and chatter never really stops. The entrance of the temporary site of the library. Inside, the library feels small and dim. As I stepped inside, a thin blanket of dust rose, filling my nostrils. Three men greeted me at the entrance: a peon, a member of the football house, and a familiar face from the neighbourhood — all of them conversing at a volume otherwise reprimanded inside libraries. I cleaned my chair before sitting; a spare handkerchief came in handy in wiping off the dust that covered the seat. The table greeted me with yet another layer to clear. A glance around showed scattered books, some out of shelves, some lying in corners — a telltale sign of the shelves lost during the relocation. Finally, when I settled down to read and write, my feet itched incessantly. For the first few minutes, I tried to resist the temptation to scratch until I finally gave in. Mosquito bites. Yet, I was adamant. But every few minutes, the noise from the football house upstairs grew louder, making it impossible to concentrate. When I returned in late September, I found a student bent over his notes, preparing for a medical entry test, a coil of machar jalebi burning beside him, its smoke curling against the walls. “We wrote to the town chairman about the mosquito issue,” said Akmal Khan, a resident of Chakiwara. “But nothing happened. Most students stopped coming. But I can’t afford to go to Liaquat Library (located in another part of the city) every day, so I bring this coil and sit here anyway.” Before the demolition, a local donor had gifted a UPS to the LLF for the Mulla Fazil Library — a small relief against the frequent power outages. After the library was shifted to its temporary space at the football house, LLF central member Barakzai said they brought the UPS along. “But it got stolen.” Dusty tables and chairs at the library relocated to the football house. Much like the rest of Lyari, here too, electricity is elusive. “The football house bill hasn’t been paid,” he explained. “Whenever a new line is installed, it’s cut again. Even with the line there, not much changed because electricity here only lasts from 3pm to 5pm.” In October, I made several visits to the library. Most days, the shutters were shut, but one afternoon I found them open. Inside sat Akbar Baloch, a retired library staffer, along with a few members of the football house. The man currently in charge of the library was away for Zuhr prayers. “He comes around noon,” one of them told me, “and leaves after prayers.” I waited. When he returned, he quietly walked across the dim room, wheeled out his motorcycle parked inside the football house lawn and left. I stayed back with the staff. Akbar Wali told me he had retired recently, but still came by to pass the time. “Students don’t come here anymore,” he said. “Maybe one or two in a month, by chance.” Riaz Baloch, known locally as Ustad Jogh, joined in, his voice heavy with irony. “Look around, no water to drink, no washroom, no electricity. Who would want to study in the dark?” “If you ask the councillor to help with the library, he’ll say he has more important things to handle: like putting lids on manholes,” Ustad added. The great fall Lyari, being one of Karachi‘s oldest neighbourhoods, has for decades attracted the biggest names of Pakistan’s literary world: for poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, the locality was home, where he often frequented to teach, write and read. Muhammad Baig Baloch is another literary figure from Lyari, who wrote several books in Urdu, English, Sindhi and Persian in addition to translating major literary works into the Balochi language But politics, neglect, and poverty took a toll on what used to be a literary hub. Ramzan Baloch, who has authored seven books on Lyari’s history and social fabric, has witnessed this progression and fall since the 1960s. “In 1962, Lyari had 27 municipal units, each of which had elected members and a chairman,” he explained. “An ordinance at the time mandated the creation of reading rooms in every unit — places where people came to read newspapers before work, or in the evening after returning home. There was even a separate budget for them.” “By the 1970s, the local government system changed, and reading rooms began turning into offices; some even got encroached,” he said. “There used to be a fixed annual budget for textbooks, literature, religious works, art, even Balochi titles.” But the decline began quietly after the year 2000. “The focus on libraries vanished,” Ramzan lamented. “Magazines stopped coming, then newspapers too. Eventually, there was no bill left.” In 1992, Lyari had 27 libraries, excluding the reading rooms. The number shrank to 11 in the early 2000s, and new books stopped coming in after 2005. The collage shows (left to right) Baghdadi-Shabaik Lane- Kalari Library, Nishtar Library, and the Syed Mehmood Shah Library — all of which are in decay. Ramzan explained that the Mulla Fazil Library had its own set of flaws even in its prime — the sewer outside overflowed, its compound was taken over by a Nadra office, and long queues of people left the area crowded. Yet, despite the myriad of issues, the library never failed to provide one thing: space — for dialogue, for ideas, for silence. “Whatever I’ve written, the knowledge, the habit of reading — it came from that place,” he said, adding that the library’s demolition also halted gatherings of the LLF. “Those meetings were a relief, especially after years of gang violence.” The fate of the remaining libraries, all visited by Dawn , reflects Lyari’s slow erasure of public learning spaces: Baghdadi–Shabaik Lane–Kalari Library (BSK Project) –now a community hall where weddings and Nikkah ceremonies are held Syed Mahmood Shah Library – now serves as a UC office for registration of births, deaths, and marriages Nishtar Library – converted into a UC office Iqbal Shaheed Library, Bihar Colony – deteriorated and damaged Umer Lane Library – now functions as a community hall and madrassa Iqra Library, Singolane – turned into a boxing club Meeran Naka Library – converted into a community hall. S. Mohamadin Library, Rangiwara – a library in name only; a few books lie on a table under a roof, shedding sand and stones Satellite Library and Reading Room – a twin of the temporary library now housed at the football house The collapse wasn’t just social, it was also intellectual. Professor Hasil Murad Baloch of the Benazir Bhutto University, Lyari, explained: “This decline didn’t come overnight. The gang war period destroyed the social structure that made Lyari what it was, affecting the youth the most.” For decades, newspaper reading had been a daily ritual in Lyari. Elderly men would walk to libraries and reading rooms, flipping through Urdu and Balochi dailies before heading home. “By 2016, even when the streets were calm again, newspapers stopped arriving,” said Nabi Baksh. “There was a tussle between Lyari Town and UC offices over who would pay for them. In the end, no one did.” By 2020, even the Mulla Fazil Library stopped receiving newspapers. “There was no payment for months, maybe years.” Ismail Baloch, the newly appointed Human Resource Director of Lyari Town, admitted that the Town Municipal Commissioner (TMC) is responsible for facilitating the libraries. “There’s always a fund,” he said. “But it’s not always allocated … maybe.” Development or plundering? Back at the Aath Chowk, construction of the mini civic centre continues unabated. Town officials insist it will revive the library in a “modern form”. Nasir Karim, the Lyari town chairman, told Dawn that the first floor of the centre has been allocated for the library. “It will be a digital library,” he said, “and both boys and girls will have their own sections.” The ground floor of the complex, he continued, would accommodate Nadra. “There will also be other civic facilities, like offices for K-Electric, the water board, and the passport department, as well as an auditorium for Lyari’s artists, similar to the Karachi Arts Council, and a cafeteria.” The mini civic centre under construction at Aath Chowk. Karim‘s assurances, however, do nothing to placate the readers of Lyari, who are convinced that the construction of the new complex would entirely erase the Mulla Fazil Library’s essence. “Where will a library fit between offices and government departments?” questioned Ramzan Baloch. “A library needs silence, space, an aura of its own.” “This isn’t development. It’s just plundering.” Header image: A bulldozer razes down the Mulla Fazil Library in Karachi’s Lyari neighbourhood. — All photos by author",

The sound of engines, horns and chatter never really stops. The entrance of the temporary site of the library. Inside, the library feels small and dim. As I stepped inside, a thin blanket of dust rose, filling my nostrils. Three men greeted me at the entrance: a peon, a member of the football house, and a familiar face from the neighbourhood — all of them conversing at a volume otherwise reprimanded inside libraries. I cleaned my chair before sitting; a spare handkerchief came in handy in wiping off the dust that covered the seat. The table greeted me with yet another layer to clear. A glance around showed scattered books, some out of shelves, some lying in corners — a telltale sign of the shelves lost during the relocation. Finally, when I settled down to read and write, my feet itched incessantly. For the first few minutes, I tried to resist the temptation to scratch until I finally gave in. Mosquito bites. Yet, I was adamant. But every few minutes, the noise from the football house upstairs grew louder, making it impossible to concentrate. When I returned in late September, I found a student bent over his notes, preparing for a medical entry test, a coil of machar jalebi burning beside him, its smoke curling against the walls. “We wrote to the town chairman about the mosquito issue,” said Akmal Khan, a resident of Chakiwara. “But nothing happened. Most students stopped coming. But I can’t afford to go to Liaquat Library (located in another part of the city) every day, so I bring this coil and sit here anyway.” Before the demolition, a local donor had gifted a UPS to the LLF for the Mulla Fazil Library — a small relief against the frequent power outages. After the library was shifted to its temporary space at the football house, LLF central member Barakzai said they brought the UPS along. “But it got stolen.” Dusty tables and chairs at the library relocated to the football house. Much like the rest of Lyari, here too, electricity is elusive. “The football house bill hasn’t been paid,” he explained. “Whenever a new line is installed, it’s cut again. Even with the line there, not much changed because electricity here only lasts from 3pm to 5pm.” In October, I made several visits to the library. Most days, the shutters were shut, but one afternoon I found them open. Inside sat Akbar Baloch, a retired library staffer, along with a few members of the football house. The man currently in charge of the library was away for Zuhr prayers. “He comes around noon,” one of them told me, “and leaves after prayers.” I waited. When he returned, he quietly walked across the dim room, wheeled out his motorcycle parked inside the football house lawn and left. I stayed back with the staff. Akbar Wali told me he had retired recently, but still came by to pass the time. “Students don’t come here anymore,” he said. “Maybe one or two in a month, by chance.” Riaz Baloch, known locally as Ustad Jogh, joined in, his voice heavy with irony. “Look around, no water to drink, no washroom, no electricity. Who would want to study in the dark?” “If you ask the councillor to help with the library, he’ll say he has more important things to handle: like putting lids on manholes,” Ustad added. The great fall Lyari, being one of Karachi‘s oldest neighbourhoods, has for decades attracted the biggest names of Pakistan’s literary world: for poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, the locality was home, where he often frequented to teach, write and read. Muhammad Baig Baloch is another literary figure from Lyari, who wrote several books in Urdu, English, Sindhi and Persian in addition to translating major literary works into the Balochi language But politics, neglect, and poverty took a toll on what used to be a literary hub. Ramzan Baloch, who has authored seven books on Lyari’s history and social fabric, has witnessed this progression and fall since the 1960s. “In 1962, Lyari had 27 municipal units, each of which had elected members and a chairman,” he explained. “An ordinance at the time mandated the creation of reading rooms in every unit — places where people came to read newspapers before work, or in the evening after returning home. There was even a separate budget for them.” “By the 1970s, the local government system changed, and reading rooms began turning into offices; some even got encroached,” he said. “There used to be a fixed annual budget for textbooks, literature, religious works, art, even Balochi titles.” But the decline began quietly after the year 2000. “The focus on libraries vanished,” Ramzan lamented. “Magazines stopped coming, then newspapers too. Eventually, there was no bill left.” In 1992, Lyari had 27 libraries, excluding the reading rooms. The number shrank to 11 in the early 2000s, and new books stopped coming in after 2005. The collage shows (left to right) Baghdadi-Shabaik Lane- Kalari Library, Nishtar Library, and the Syed Mehmood Shah Library — all of which are in decay. Ramzan explained that the Mulla Fazil Library had its own set of flaws even in its prime — the sewer outside overflowed, its compound was taken over by a Nadra office, and long queues of people left the area crowded. Yet, despite the myriad of issues, the library never failed to provide one thing: space — for dialogue, for ideas, for silence. “Whatever I’ve written, the knowledge, the habit of reading — it came from that place,” he said, adding that the library’s demolition also halted gatherings of the LLF. “Those meetings were a relief, especially after years of gang violence.” The fate of the remaining libraries, all visited by Dawn , reflects Lyari’s slow erasure of public learning spaces: Baghdadi–Shabaik Lane–Kalari Library (BSK Project) –now a community hall where weddings and Nikkah ceremonies are held Syed Mahmood Shah Library – now serves as a UC office for registration of births, deaths, and marriages Nishtar Library – converted into a UC office Iqbal Shaheed Library, Bihar Colony – deteriorated and damaged Umer Lane Library – now functions as a community hall and madrassa Iqra Library, Singolane – turned into a boxing club Meeran Naka Library – converted into a community hall. S. Mohamadin Library, Rangiwara – a library in name only; a few books lie on a table under a roof, shedding sand and stones Satellite Library and Reading Room – a twin of the temporary library now housed at the football house The collapse wasn’t just social, it was also intellectual. Professor Hasil Murad Baloch of the Benazir Bhutto University, Lyari, explained: “This decline didn’t come overnight. The gang war period destroyed the social structure that made Lyari what it was, affecting the youth the most.” For decades, newspaper reading had been a daily ritual in Lyari. Elderly men would walk to libraries and reading rooms, flipping through Urdu and Balochi dailies before heading home. “By 2016, even when the streets were calm again, newspapers stopped arriving,” said Nabi Baksh. “There was a tussle between Lyari Town and UC offices over who would pay for them. In the end, no one did.” By 2020, even the Mulla Fazil Library stopped receiving newspapers. “There was no payment for months, maybe years.” Ismail Baloch, the newly appointed Human Resource Director of Lyari Town, admitted that the Town Municipal Commissioner (TMC) is responsible for facilitating the libraries. “There’s always a fund,” he said. “But it’s not always allocated … maybe.” Development or plundering? Back at the Aath Chowk, construction of the mini civic centre continues unabated. Town officials insist it will revive the library in a “modern form”. Nasir Karim, the Lyari town chairman, told Dawn that the first floor of the centre has been allocated for the library. “It will be a digital library,” he said, “and both boys and girls will have their own sections.” The ground floor of the complex, he continued, would accommodate Nadra. “There will also be other civic facilities, like offices for K-Electric, the water board, and the passport department, as well as an auditorium for Lyari’s artists, similar to the Karachi Arts Council, and a cafeteria.” The mini civic centre under construction at Aath Chowk. Karim‘s assurances, however, do nothing to placate the readers of Lyari, who are convinced that the construction of the new complex would entirely erase the Mulla Fazil Library’s essence. “Where will a library fit between offices and government departments?” questioned Ramzan Baloch. “A library needs silence, space, an aura of its own.” “This isn’t development. It’s just plundering.” Header image: A bulldozer razes down the Mulla Fazil Library in Karachi’s Lyari neighbourhood. — All photos by author",
      "title": "From reading rooms to commercial centres: The lost libraries of Lyari",
      "summary": "My journey into higher education began in my coastal hometown of Pasni, passed through the sprawl of Karachi, and eventually settled in Lyari — a neighbourhood with its own rhythms and ruptures. Life here is compressed into narrow lanes, where only a sliver of sky is visible between tangled wires, flags, and ageing buildings. Power outages are routine, and space is scarce. In such a place, a library is not a luxury; it is a necessity. For many residents, the only familiar name is the Mulla Fazil Hall Library. Established in the 1980s, it was known as the Lyari Textbook Library in its early days and became a homestay for students across the town, including myself. My days were spent there, not just studying, but also listening. With pricked ears, I would eavesdrop on conversations at neighbouring tables with determined attention that drifted from philosophy and poetry to art and music. These conversations were as much shaped by curiosity as they were by survival. The entrance to the Mulla Fazil Library before it was demolished. Today, the main library building is undergoing construction and the facility has temporarily been relocated. Reaching it now requires a Qingqi ride along fractured roads, a jolting passage that ends on the main road, followed by a short walk. The bumpy ride often culminates in a locked door as the temporary facility remains closed on most days. When it is open, access comes at a cost: mosquito-infested rooms where dengue and malaria are constant threats, dilapidated and broken toilets, and the air thick with dust. This is a paradox at the heart of Lyari — a neighbourhood long known for its intellectual traditions and political consciousness, yet one that today has almost no functioning public library. The hunger for learning persists, but the spaces meant to sustain it have quietly disappeared. The heart of Lyari Until a few years back, the Mulla Fazil Hall Library stood tall in the heart of Lyari, at the Aath Chowk, where eight roads finally unite. Every day, this neighbourhood throbs to that heartbeat: dust rising from chipped streets, the foul odour of overflowing drains, bare electrical wires tangled with red and green striped flags, and walls stained with chalk markings of political slogans. Young boys dart through untidy lanes wearing worn-out football t-shirts featuring Messi, Neymar, Ronaldo and the likes, manholes lie open, puddles glisten with sewage, and yet people move through it all effortlessly, too well-versed in an art that only Lyari teaches. But amid the chaos, a short pause shows what is often missed: Lyari as it truly is — alive, familiar, and stubborn. In today‘s Lyari, the Mulla Fazil Library has been replaced by a ‘mini civic centre’. In late 2022, the Sindh government, in a notification, announced the demolition of the library. Initially, no one took the notification seriously. “I remember reacting with a laughing emoji when I first saw it,” said Imran Fakhir Baloch, a lecturer at the Abdullah Haroon College. In Lyari, he told Dawn , such notices arrived often full of promise but were rarely followed into reality. “But we were wrong this time,” said Imran. On January 2, 2023, the Sindh government awarded the contract for the civic centre’s construction. The plan featured a basement, five floors, and a sixth to be added later, all to be completed within one year. Yet, no one clarified where the books, the readers, or the library would fit into the design. A rare offering Imran, who also presides over the Lyari Literary Forum — a Baloch-based literary group that has held study circles in the locality since 2017 — recalled that the Mulla Fazil Library was his group’s home. At gatherings there, discussions and debates went on for hours, seamlessly flowing from literature to art, sociology, philosophy and more. The library, neither too well-equipped nor too visually attractive, was a classic example of years of neglect; its iron shelves rusted, the wood chipped, and books covered in dust. Yet, the building offered something rare in Lyari — space and light. In a town where the noise never dies and light scrambles to get past the closely-knit multi-storey buildings, the library, with its wide windows and thick walls, was all people needed to sit and read. A snapshot of literary circles organised at the Mulla Fazil Library. “The beauty of the LLF circles at the library was that they brought together everyone from Lyari in one place, from young students, literary enthusiasts, to the elders. People of all ages sat side by side, listening, debating, learning,” Imran reminisced. But even before the literary forum came to be, the building had long been a quiet gathering spot for Baloch students. “They would bring their own books, meet after classes, and choose a topic to discuss. That’s how it always was here — people gathering at the day’s end,” said Zahid Barakzai, a central member of the LLF and a regular at the Mulla Fazil Library. Thus, when the news of the library‘s demolition spread, a shiver of concern ran through Lyari’s avid readers, manifesting in the form of a protest. They had one clear demand: the books must be saved, and the library relocated. Subsequent discussions and meetings took place, but no one stepped up to offer space. Eventually, Nasir Karim, the then and current chairman of Lyari Town, volunteered to “give space”, all the while emphasising that he was not officially responsible for it. The “space” was a football house owned by him, located a few minutes from the original site of the library. Demolition day And then, on a hot summer afternoon, the day of demolition arrived. Amaan Qazi, a longtime resident of Lyari, has the image of that day etched in his mind. “On one side stood the people of Lyari, those who had spent years at the Mulla Fazil Library and on the other, the local stakeholders: councillors, UC office staff, and others.” “We were waiting, hoping the bulldozers would arrive a little later, just so we could glance at the building one more time,” he recounted to Dawn . But the weak thread of hope that the residents held on to angered the authorities, eventually resulting in an altercation. A view of the torn down Mulla Fazil Library. “There was a fight among the stakeholders over who would take more sariya (iron rods) from the remains of the library,“ said journalist Shabir Arman, who covered the day’s events. “But none of them spoke about the books,” he recalled, adding that during the chaos, several bookshelves disappeared. “Maybe they took those too, to sell.” At a short distance from the site stood Suzuki pickup trucks. They weren’t there for the books, clarified Qazi, but for the officials who loaded the salvaged iron from the library to sell later. The Mulla Fazil Library housed a total of 10,000 books, of which only 7,000 reached their new home. “During the shifting, so many books and shelves were lost,” recalled Akbar Faiz, who was then in charge of libraries in Lyari. Books at the football house. At the football house, the books stayed untouched and unsorted for nearly six months. Rehman Baloch, a member of the Baloch Students Action Committee and another regular at the library, visited the Lyari town office countless times. “Each time, we were told that the football house was being renovated for the library,” he told Dawn . But when the time for sorting finally arrived, not much had changed, contrary to what Rehman and his friends had been told for days and months. The ground floor of the football house, where the library was relocated, was dusty and crumbly. Only the first floor, where the football house’s main gatherings were held, had been freshly painted. A sad state of repairs The first time I visited the ‘new’ library — a pale shadow of what it used to be — was a few months back. It is slumped across the main road in Chakiwara, a restless stretch where a bulk of the traffic from Lee Market rushes toward Shershah, and onward to Hub Chowki. A few steps from the library’s gate, a crowd converges every few hours to catch the Rind Coach, which ferries people between Lyari and Hub Chowki. The sound of engines, horns and chatter never really stops. The entrance of the temporary site of the library. Inside, the library feels small and dim.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump warned Tuesday of unspecified “very strong action” if Iranian authorities go ahead with threatened hangings of some protesters, with Tehran calling American warnings a “pretext for military intervention”. International outrage has built over the crackdown that a rights group claimed, without evidence, has likely killed thousands during protests posing one of the biggest challenges yet to Iran’s clerical leadership. Iran’s UN mission posted a statement on X, vowing that Washington’s “playbook” would “fail again”. “US fantasies and policy toward Iran are rooted in regime change, with sanctions, threats, engineered unrest, and chaos serving as the modus operandi to manufacture a pretext for military intervention,” the post said. Iranian authorities have insisted they had regained control of the country after successive nights of mass protests nationwide since Thursday. Rights groups accuse the government of fatally shooting protesters and masking the scale of the crackdown with an internet blackout that has now surpassed the five-day mark. Trump - who earlier told the protesters in Iran that “help is on its way” - told CBS News that the United States would act if Iran began hanging protesters. Tehran prosecutors said Iranian authorities would press capital charges of “moharebeh”, or “waging war against God”, against some suspects arrested over recent demonstrations. “We will take very strong action if they do such a thing,” said the American leader, who has repeatedly threatened Iran with military intervention. “When they start killing thousands of people - and now you’re telling me about hanging. We’ll see how that’s going to work out for them,” Trump said. New videos on social media, with locations verified by AFP, showed bodies lined up in the Kahrizak morgue just south of the Iranian capital, with the corpses wrapped in black bags and distraught relatives searching for loved ones. International phone links were restored on Tuesday, but only for outgoing calls, according to an AFP journalist, and the quality remained spotty, with frequent interruptions. However, the internet remains suspended in the country for more than 132 hours now. Earlier Tuesday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform urge Iranians to “KEEP PROTESTING”, adding: “I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY.” It was not immediately clear what meetings he was referring to or what the nature of the help would be. ‘Rising casualties’ European nations also signalled their anger over the crackdown, with France, Germany and the United Kingdom among the countries that summoned their Iranian ambassadors, as did the European Union. “The rising number of casualties in Iran is horrifying,” said EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, vowing further sanctions against those responsible. Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies. Authorities in Tehran have announced a mass funeral ceremony in the capital on Wednesday for the “martyrs” of recent days. Amir, an Iraqi computer scientist, returned to Baghdad on Monday and described dramatic scenes in Tehran. “On Thursday night, my friends and I saw protesters in Tehran’s Sarsabz neighbourhood amid a heavy military presence. The police were firing rubber bullets,” he told AFP in Iraq. ’Serious challenge The government on Monday sought to regain control of the streets with mass nationwide rallies that supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed as proof that the protest movement was defeated, calling them a “warning” to the United States. In power since 1989 and now aged 86, Khamenei has faced significant challenges, most recently the 12-day war in June against Israel, which resulted in the killing of top security officials and forced him to go into hiding. Analysts have cautioned that it is premature to predict the immediate demise of the theocratic system, pointing to the repressive levers the leadership controls, including the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is charged with safeguarding the Islamic revolution. “These protests arguably represent the most serious challenge to the Islamic republic in years, both in scale and in their increasingly explicit political demands,” Nicole Grajewski, professor at the Sciences Po Centre for International Studies in Paris, told AFP. She said it was unclear if the protests would unseat the leadership, pointing to “the sheer depth and resilience of Iran’s repressive apparatus”.",

      "summary_orig": "THE Islamic Republic of Iran is bracing for a possible American military intervention amid widespread mass protests that have paralysed the country. The regime faces its gravest internal and external challenge since the revolution nearly five decades ago. The protests, which began a couple of weeks ago because of the deteriorating economic situation, have turned into violent civil unrest. Triggered by the massive devaluation of the Iranian currency and the rising cost of living, the protest initiated by shopkeepers in Tehran has now spread across many parts of the country, with students and other groups joining the agitation. The mounting unrest seems to have encouraged American President Donald Trump to threaten military intervention and go for regime change in the country. He has repeatedly said that America was ready to come to the ‘rescue’ of the Iranian people if the regime targeted the protesters. “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!” wrote Trump on his Truth Social platform over the weekend. His warning seems to have stoked the protests. Meanwhile, Israel has also stepped up its campaign for regime change in Iran. The threat of American military intervention has created a dangerous geopolitical situation with far-reaching consequences for regional and global peace. Iran has warned that it would target US military bases in the region in case of an American intervention. The unrest in Iran seems to have encouraged the US president to threaten military action. It will not be easy for Trump to repeat the brazen invasion of Venezuela, however weak the Ira­nian regime appears to be in the face of grave do­­mestic political instability. Iran said that it was pre­­pared for conflict but also ready to negotiate with the US. “We are not looking for war, but we are prepared for war — even more prepared than the previous war,” warned the Iranian foreign minister. It’s, however, not clear what the two countries would be talking about amid Trump’s gunboat diplomacy. Tehran has always shown its willingness to negotiate on its nuclear programme; however, it will not be prepared to discuss internal political matters with Washington. Moreover, Trump has threatened to take some military action before any such talks. Iran’s position has weakened economically and militarily as a result of the 12-day war with Israel and the American bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities last year. Most alarming for Tehran has been the deep penetration of Israeli intelligence agencies in the country. Many of the attacks targeting Iranian military commanders and scientists, including Iran’s top negotiator on the nuclear issue, were carried out by Israeli agents on Iranian territory, exposing the massive gap in national security. Iran has also received a setback in the regional power game in recent years with the fall of the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria and the heavy blow dealt by Israel to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Iran’s economic crisis has worsened due to the sanctions imposed by the US and other Western countries. As a result, Iranian leaders faced intensifying domestic pressures and desperate, angry protests. Initially, the Iranian government sought to placate the demonstrators. But as the protests intensified, the authorities clamped down on them, using brute force that further angered the public. A severe crackdown has led to a high death toll believed to be in the hundreds. Iran has been cut off from the outside world after the government imposed a near-total internet blackout. There has also been a move to project Reza Pahlavi, son of the Shah who was deposed in the 1979 revolution, as an alternative leader for Iran. In the US, where he lives in exile, he appears much more active, guiding the protest through his video messages. But it is difficult for the Iranian public to accept the return of monarchy to the country. The situation, which Trump seeks to capitalise on, is still volatile. According to the American media, Trump has been briefed by his officials on new options for military strikes. “We’re looking at it very seriously,” the US president said. “The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options. We’ll make a determination.” But the threat of Washington’s kinetic action is bound to unite Iranians against external intervention. The massive pro-government rallies in Tehran and other cities this week are seen as a warning against any American intervention in Iran’s internal politics. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said pro-government rallies in Tehran came as a warning to US politicians to “end their deceit”. Iranian officials have warned that in the case of military action, US military bases and shipping lanes will be legitimate targets. It’s an extremely dangerous situation that could plunge the entire region into a wider conflagration. It is particularly a challenging situation for Pakistan, which has a 900-kilometre-long border with Iran. Any American military intervention for regime change in Iran will have a direct bearing on Pakistan. Being a front-line state, it will be hard for Pakistan to escape the fallout of the conflict. So far, Pakistan has maintained a non-aligned stance on the Iran-US tensions, advocating diplomacy and de-escalation, while offering to serve as a potential mediator. In June last year, Pakistan reportedly played the role of a messenger between the US and Iran at the height of tensions before the US bombardment of Iranian nuclear facilities. Pakistan has good relations with both Iran and the US, but it cannot remain unconcerned about Trump’s imperialistic aggression in its neighbourhood. Pakistan needs to condemn America’s intervention in Iran’s internal political matters. Trump’s military escalation would destabilise the entire region, thus presenting a serious national security challenge for Pakistan. A Venezuela-like action in Iran could also draw other major powers, such as China and Russia, into the conflict. Trumpian imperialism presents the biggest threat to global peace, and that must be stopped.

According to the American media, Trump has been briefed by his officials on new options for military strikes. “We’re looking at it very seriously,” the US president said. “The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options. We’ll make a determination.” But the threat of Washington’s kinetic action is bound to unite Iranians against external intervention. The massive pro-government rallies in Tehran and other cities this week are seen as a warning against any American intervention in Iran’s internal politics. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said pro-government rallies in Tehran came as a warning to US politicians to “end their deceit”. Iranian officials have warned that in the case of military action, US military bases and shipping lanes will be legitimate targets. It’s an extremely dangerous situation that could plunge the entire region into a wider conflagration. It is particularly a challenging situation for Pakistan, which has a 900-kilometre-long border with Iran. Any American military intervention for regime change in Iran will have a direct bearing on Pakistan. Being a front-line state, it will be hard for Pakistan to escape the fallout of the conflict. So far, Pakistan has maintained a non-aligned stance on the Iran-US tensions, advocating diplomacy and de-escalation, while offering to serve as a potential mediator. In June last year, Pakistan reportedly played the role of a messenger between the US and Iran at the height of tensions before the US bombardment of Iranian nuclear facilities. Pakistan has good relations with both Iran and the US, but it cannot remain unconcerned about Trump’s imperialistic aggression in its neighbourhood. Pakistan needs to condemn America’s intervention in Iran’s internal political matters. Trump’s military escalation would destabilise the entire region, thus presenting a serious national security challenge for Pakistan. A Venezuela-like action in Iran could also draw other major powers, such as China and Russia, into the conflict. Trumpian imperialism presents the biggest threat to global peace, and that must be stopped.

      "summary_orig": "THE Defence Department has spent more than a year testing a device purchased in an undercover operation that some investigators think could be the cause of a series of mysterious ailments impacting US spies, diplomats and troops that are colloquially known as Havana Syndrome , according to four sources briefed on the matter. According to CNN, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, purchased the device for millions of dollars in the waning days of the Biden administration, using funding provided by the Defence Department, according to two of the sources. Officials paid “eight figures” for the device, these people said, declining to offer a more specific number. The device is still being studied and there is ongoing debate — and in some quarters of government, scepticism — over its link to the roughly dozens of anomalous health incidents that remain officially unexplained. CNN has asked the Pentagon, HSI and the DHS for comment. The CIA declined to comment. The device acquired by HSI produces pulsed radio waves, one of the sources said, which some officials and academics have speculated for years could be the cause of the incidents. Although the device is not entirely Russian in origin, it contains Russian components, this person added. Officials have long struggled to understand how a device powerful enough to cause the kind of damage some victims have reported could be made portable; that remains a core question, according to one of the sources briefed on the device. The device could fit in a backpack, this person said. The acquisition of the device has reignited a painful and contentious debate within the US government about Havana Syndrome, known officially as “anomalous health episodes”. The mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of US diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including vertigo and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world. In the subsequent decade the intelligence community and the Defense Department have sought to understand if those officials were the victims of some kind of directed energy attack by a foreign government — with senior intelligence officials saying publicly that there wasn’t enough evidence to support that conclusion and victims arguing that the US government has gaslit them and ignored important evidence that Russia was attacking American government officials. Still, defence officials considered their findings serious enough that they briefed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees late last year, including reference to the acquired device and its testing. One key concern now for some officials is that if the technology proves viable it may have proliferated, several of the sources said, meaning that more than one country could now have access to a device that may be capable of causing career-ending injuries to US officials. CNN was not able to learn where — or from whom — HSI purchased the device, but HSI has a history of collaboration with the Defence Department for operations that take place all over the globe. The office has broad jurisdiction to investigate crimes linked to customs violations, including investigations into the proliferation of US-controlled technology or expertise overseas. Those investigations are “the single biggest collaboration point between HSI and the US military,” according to a former Homeland Security official. Published in Dawn, January 14th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• US president says Iranians ‘will have to figure it out’ themselves, cancels all engagement with Tehran • Oil prices rise after Trump slaps 25pc tariffs on states doing business with Iran • Iranian official puts death toll from unrest at 2,000 • World leaders react to tariff imposition, ‘horrific deaths’ WASHINGTON/DUBAI/DOHA: Iranian authorities will press charges punishable by death against some individuals arrested during recent demonstrations, prosecutors said on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump urged Iranians to keep protesting, saying help was on the way. “Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING — TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!… HELP IS ON ITS WAY,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding he had cancelled all meetings with Iranian officials until the “senseless killing” of protesters stopped. But when asked to expand on his message to protesting Iranians, he said: “You’re going to have to figure that one out. I’m sorry.” Following the US president’s post, Iranian security chief Ali Larijani said on social media platform X that Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were the “main killers” of the Iranian people. The message came hours after Trump slapped 25pc import tariffs on products from any country doing business with Iran — a major oil exporter. The move triggered movement in global markets, with oil prices surging by about 3pc on Tuesday as the prospect of disruptions to Iranian crude exports overshadowed possible increased supply from Venezuela. While foreign monitors continued to speculate on the number of casualties from the crackdown on recent anti-government protests, Reuters quoted an Iranian official as saying that around 2,000 people had been killed. The official blamed “terrorists” for the deaths of both protesters and security personnel, but did not give a breakdown. Iran’s authorities have tried to take a dual approach to the demonstrations, calling protests over economic problems legitimate while enforcing a harsh security crackdown. The office of the Tehran prosecutor said in a statement quoted by state television that an unspecified number would be charged with “waging war against God”. “The government sees security forces and protesters as its children. To the best of our abilities, we have tried and will try to listen to their voices even if some have tried to hijack such protests,” government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Tuesday. Communications restrictions including an internet blackout over recent days have hampered the flow of information. The UN rights office said on Tuesday that phone services had been restored but internet links with Iran remained patchy. Addressing the blackout, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera : “The government was in dialogue with the protesters. The internet was cut only after we confronted terrorist operations and realised orders were coming from outside the country.” Videos of nighttime clashes between demonstrators and security forces over the past week, including several that were verified by Reuters , have shown violent confrontations with gunfire and burning cars and buildings. World wary World leaders and capitals also weighed in on the tensions simmering in the Islamic Republic, as well as the confusion surrounding the protests and the possible fallout from Trump’s tariff imposition. Qatar said Tuesday that a military escalation between the United States and Iran would have grave consequences for the region, while China vowed to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests, in the context of President Trump’s punitive tariff announcement. “We have always believed that there are no winners in a tariff war, and China will resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news conference when asked about Trump’s levy announcement. Russia also condemned what it described as “subversive external interference” in Iran’s internal politics, saying any repeat of last year’s US strikes would have “disastrous consequences” for the Middle East and international security. In a call with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani, Qatari PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani expressed Doha’s support on Tuesday for “all efforts aiming to de-escalate and peaceful solutions”. The Qatari foreign ministry said the two men had discussed the latest regional developments, without directly mentioning ongoing protests that have convulsed Iran. In addition, the UAE Minister of Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi said on Tuesday it is unclear how President Trump’s announcement of tariffs on countries trading with Iran will be implemented and whether it will impact food imports. Sanctions Saying that he was horrified by the mounting violence against protesters, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk urged Tehran to halt all forms of violence and repression against peaceful protesters, and to restore full access to the internet and phone services. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen also Brussels would “swiftly” propose new sanctions on Iran. “The rising number of casualties in Iran is horrifying. “I unequivocally condemn the excessive use of force and continued restriction of freedom,” she posted online. Underscoring international uncertainty over what comes next in Iran, which has been one of the dominant powers across the Middle East for decades, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he believed the government would fall. But Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi dismissed Merz’s criticisms, accusing Berlin of double standards and saying he had “obliterated any shred of credibility”. ‘Royal family’ White House envoy Steve Witkoff over the weekend met with Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, to discuss the protests roiling that country, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing an unidentified senior US official. Meanwhile, the widow of the deposed shah of Iran has also called on Iranian security forces to support protests. Farah Pahlavi, 87, echoing calls made by her son the former crown prince Reza Pahlavi, said she believed “light will triumph over darkness” despite a crackdown by authorities that activists fear has left hundreds dead. She left Iran on January 16, 1979 alongside her husband Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, just two weeks before the return to the country of Islamic revolution leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Her husband died in 1980. Farah Pahlavi had on January 2 welcomed the protests as “filling my heart with pride”, but this is her first statement since they grew into large-scale demonstrations last week calling for an end to the Islamic republic.

      "summary_orig": "GILGIT: Residents of Nasir­abad in Hunza on Tuesday staged a protest sit-in, blocking the Kara­koram Highway (KKH) against delays in the completion of a water supply scheme from Mina­pin in Nagar, Gilgit-Baltistan. Protesters alleged that thousands of fruit and non-fruit trees had dried up and crops over thousands of acres of agricultural land were damaged due to water shortages. A large number of local residents staged an indefinite sit-in at Nasirabad, blocking the KKH. They said Nasirabad valley has been facing a shortage of water, particularly during the summer season, for a long time. The local population depends on agriculture and fruit trees as their main source of income. Last year, acute water shortages severely affected crops and fruit orchards. According to the protesters, a water supply scheme from Minapin to Nasirabad in Hunza was approved 15 years ago to address the issue. However, they alleged that despite the passage of 15 years, the pipeline-based water supply scheme has not been completed. Baba Jan, a leader of the Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Workers Party and a resident of the area, said the livelihoods of local people have suffered for many years. “Fruit trees, including blackberry, cherry, apricot and other unique varieties in the valley, have dried up. Crops, which are the backbone of the local economy, were badly damaged last year due to the unavailability of irrigation water,” he said. He added that the water supply scheme, initiated 15 years ago, had completed about 90 per cent of its work, but was later revised. The revised project requires approval from a Gilgit-Baltistan CWP meeting; however, for the past three years, it has not been included in the meeting’s agenda. Another protester, Wajid Baig, said local residents were also facing difficulties in accessing water for drinking and daily use. Protesters pointed out that while the GB government claims to promote plantation and the billion tree project, agricultural land and thousands of trees grown by local people are suffering due to water shortages. They said they had repeatedly met officials and requested intervention, but no action was taken. The protesters staged the sit-in on the KKH despite temperatu­res dropping to minus eight degrees Celsius. Traffic remai­ned suspen­ded for several hours; however, in the evening, the road was ope­ned for an hour to allow stranded tou­rists and emergency vehicles to pass. The protesters warned that if practical work on the project does not start this year, half of the village could be completely destro­y­­ed agriculturally, further worsening the local economy and living conditions. They appealed to the caretaker chief minister to take immediate notice of the situation and direct the relevant departme­nts to start work on the water supply project on an emergency basis. They said the sit-in would conti­nue until a notification is issued to begin work on the water project. Published in Dawn, January 14th, 2026",

      "summary_en": "GILGIT: Residents of Nasir­abad in Hunza on Tuesday staged a protest sit-in, blocking the Kara­koram Highway (KKH) against delays in the completion of a water supply scheme from Mina­pin in Nagar, Gilgit-Baltistan. Protesters alleged that thousands of fruit and non-fruit trees had dried up and crops over thousands of acres of agricultural land were damaged due to water shortages. A large number of local residents staged an indefinite sit-in at Nasirabad, blocking the KKH. They said Nasirabad valley has been facing a shortage of water, particularly during the summer season, for a long time. The local population depends on agriculture and fruit trees as their main source of income. Last year, acute water shortages severely affected crops and fruit orchards. According to the protesters, a water supply scheme from Minapin to Nasirabad in Hunza was approved 15 years ago to address the issue. However, they alleged that despite the passage of 15 years, the pipeline-based water supply scheme has not been completed.

      "summary_orig": "• Extends tenure of two other SHC judges • Pir Masood Chishti elected PBC vice chairman; Munir A. Malik made executive committee chairman ISLAMABAD: On the second day of its meeting, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) recommended the confirmation of 10 additional judges of the Sindh High Court (SHC) out of a total list of 12, by a majority of its total membership. Presided over by Chief Justice of Pakis­tan Yahya Afridi, the JCP, after due consideration of the relevant data forms, ant­ecedents and evaluation material placed before it, confirmed Justice Miran Muha­mmad Shah, Justice Ms Tasneem Sultana, Justice Riazat Ali Sahar, Justice Muham­mad Hassan (Akber), Justice Abdul Ham­id Bhurgi, Justice Jan Ali Junejo, Justice Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro, Justice Ali Haider ‘Ada’, Justice Muhammad Osman Ali Hadi and Justice Muhammad Jaffer Raza as permanent judges of the SHC. Meanwhile, the JCP also recommended the extension of two additional judges for another six months, namely Justice Khalid Hussain Shahani and Justice Syed Fiazul Hassan Shah. The meeting was held at the conference room of the Supreme Court to make recommendations for the confirmation of additional judges as judges of the SHC, as well as for the reconstitution and extension of constitutional benches. Similarly, the commission, by a majority vote, also nominated four judges to the constitutional bench of the SHC, besides extending the tenure of the constitutional benches by six months. The nominated judges are Justice Amjad Ali Bohio, Justice Muhammad Hassan (Akber), Justice Ali Haider ‘Ada’ and Justice Muhammad Osman Ali Hadi. On Wednesday, the JCP will consider the confirmation of 10 additional judges of the Peshawar High Court. Meanwhile, in a separate development, the 248th meeting of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) elected Pir Muham­mad Masood Chishti as the new vice chairman of the PBC for the year 2026 by a majority vote. Presided over by Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, who is also the chairman of the PBC, the meeting was held at the council’s office in the Supreme Court building and transacted a number of items on the agenda. While acting as the Returning Officer for the election, the AGP invited proposals for the post of vice chairman. In response, Farooq Hamid Naek proposed the name of Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti from Lahore, which was seconded by Syed Qalb-i-Hassan. On the other hand, Muhammad Maqsood Buttar proposed the name of Qazi Muhammad Arshad from Abbottabad as the other candidate. Both Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti and Qazi Muhammad Arshad consented to the proposals of their respective candidature. As there was a contest, the election was held through a secret ballot. After the completion of the polling process, the ballot papers were taken out of the ballot box, counted and found to be 23 in number. As per the count of the ballot papers, Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti secured 15 votes, while Qazi Muhammad Arshad obtained eight votes. Resultantly, the Returning Officer declared Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti as the elected vice chairman of the Pakistan Bar Council for the year 2026. The council also elected Muneer A. Ma­­l­­ik from Karachi as the chairman of the PBC executive committee for the year 2026. Meanwhile, the PBC strongly condem­n­­ed the campaign of character assassinati­­on against judges of the Lahore High Cou­rt and the Islamabad High Court on baseless allegations, terming it an attack on the prestige and dignity of the judiciary. The council reiterated that the legal fraternity would never allow anyone to succeed in nefarious designs aimed at targeting judges. Published in Dawn, January 14th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "Four terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan‘s Kalat district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Tuesday. In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on January 12 (Monday) security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. During the operation, security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, it said, adding that four terrorists were killed after an “intense fire exchange”. “Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” the statement added. It stated that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. It added that the counterterrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces on the operation. In his statement posted by state broadcaster PTV on X, PM Shehbaz said security forces were achieving notable successes in their fight against terrorism under Azm-e-Istehkam. “The whole nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the fight against terrorism,“ he said, reaffirming Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. In a press conference last week, the Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025. Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.",
