      "title_orig": "Canadian police identify 18-year-old woman as suspect in mass school shooting",
      "summary_orig": "The suspect in a deadly school shooting in western Canada was an 18-year-old woman with mental health issues who killed her mother and stepbrother before attacking her former school, police said on Wednesday, but investigators did not offer a motive for one of the worst mass slaughters in Canadian history. The killer, who police identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, died by suicide after the shooting on Tuesday in Tumbler Ridge, a remote community of 2,400 people in the Pacific province of British Columbia. Police revised the death toll down to nine, including Van Rootselaar, from the initially reported ten. On more than one occasion, Van Rootselaar had been apprehended under the provincial Mental Health Act for an assessment, said Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia. She once attended the school but dropped out four years ago. “Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,” McDonald said. Unlike the United States, school shootings are almost unheard of in Canada, and federal politicians initially struggled to maintain their composure. “We will get through this. We will learn from this,” a visibly upset Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters. Carney, who at one point looked close to tears, postponed a trip to Europe and ordered flags on all government buildings to be flown at half-mast for the next seven days. Hours later, legislators in the House of Commons observed a minute’s silence and listened as a sombre Carney said the killings had left the country in shock and mourning. “It is a town of miners, teachers, construction workers – families who have built their lives there, people who have always shown up for each other there … Tumbler Ridge represents the very best of Canada,” he said. McDonald said Van Rootselaar, who was born male but began identifying as female six years ago, had first killed her mother, 39, and 11-year-old stepbrother at the family home. She then went to the school, where she shot a 39-year-old woman teacher as well as three 12-year-old female students and two male students, one aged 12 and one aged 13. Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun. Dozens were injured, and two severely wounded victims, aged 12 and 19, remain in hospital. Police officers who arrived at the scene two minutes after the initial call encountered active gunfire, including rounds fired in their direction, according to authorities, before discovering Van Rootselaar dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound. “We do believe the suspect acted alone … it would be too early to speculate on motive,” McDonald told a press conference, saying police did not have information to suggest that anyone had been specifically targeted. Several prominent world leaders sent messages of condolence. King Charles, Canada’s head of state, said he was “profoundly shocked and saddened” by the deaths. Shooting among deadliest in Canadian history Details about some of the victims were slowly emerging on Wednesday. In an anguished Facebook post, Abel Mwansa said his 12-year-old son, also named Abel, had died in the shooting. Abel had once cried when his father proposed homeschooling because he loved going to school so much, his father wrote. He raised his son, Mwansa added, to respect his elders, “be strong, work hard, put a smile on the face like I do, focus on his studies, never miss school and to be a good kid.” Another woman, Shanon Dycke, said her 12-year-old niece, Kylie May Smith, was among the victims. “Pray for the other families who have lost their child, or are waiting to hear news,” she wrote on Facebook. “Just pray for Tumbler Ridge.” The attack sent shockwaves through the tiny community. “Everybody knows everybody,” Jordon Kosik, a resident, said in an interview. “People don’t lock their homes. They don’t lock their cars. You can just go to your neighbour’s house, just walk right in.” McDonald said police had seized firearms from the family residence about two years ago but returned them after the owner, who he did not identify, successfully appealed the decision. Canada has stricter gun laws than the United States, but Canadians can own firearms with a licence. Van Rootselaar previously had a firearms licence, but it expired in 2024. Canadians between the ages of 12 and 17 can obtain a minor’s firearms licence after taking a firearms safety course and passing tests. The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history. In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a petrol station. In December 1989, a gunman killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, before dying by suicide. “There’s not a word in the English language that’s strong enough to describe the level of devastation that this community has experienced,” said Larry Neufeld, a local provincial legislator. “It’s going to take a significant amount of effort and a significant amount of courage to repair that terror,” he told CBC News.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan dispatched another consignment of humanitarian supplies to Gaza on Thursday as part of measures to provide Palestinians with life-saving aid following Israel’s invasion of the enclave. The latest aid consignment was dispatched by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), with the support of Al-Khidmat Foundation. This is the second aid consignment sent by Islamabad within the last week. Earlier, on Monday, the 28th consignment was dispatched. Pakistan had sent the first aid consignment, including medicines and tents, for the people of Gaza on Oct 19, 2023, days after the Israeli bombardment began. The relief goods were dispatched through a chartered flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore to Egypt’s Al-Arish airport for onward delivery to Gaza. Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents. Tel Aviv’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, displaced most of its population and left much of the strip in ruins. Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh will hold a national referendum on Thursday together with its first parliamentary election since violent protests ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. The referendum will give people a chance to vote on reforms to state institutions. Here is a look at why the referendum is being held, and what it entails. Why is a referendum needed? The referendum focuses on implementing the ‘ July Charter ’ drafted after the 2024 uprising to establish good governance, democracy, and social justice through institutional reforms, and to prevent “recurrence of authoritarian and fascist rule”. The interim government that took power after Hasina’s ouster approved the charter’s implementation order in November, saying public approval was necessary for key changes. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters What are people voting on? Voters will decide on four major reforms, including the creation of new constitutional bodies and the introduction of a bicameral parliament, whose upper house majority approval shall be needed for constitutional amendments. Other questions cover the implementation of 30 charter reforms — including term limits for prime ministers and enhanced presidential powers, along with broader changes in line with political parties’ commitments. How is the referendum being held? Each person will cast their vote by secret ballot. If a majority votes in favour, a Constitutional Reform Council will be formed to complete the reforms within 180 working days from its first session. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters Has Bangladesh held a referendum before? Bangladesh held three referendums before the Hasina government abolished the provision in 2011. A High Court reinstated it in 2024 after she was ousted. While the 1977 and 1985 referendums asked people if they had confidence in the then-presidents and their policies, the third, in 1991, asked whether Bangladesh should return from a presidential system to parliamentary democracy. People overwhelmingly voted “yes” in all three referendums. What do critics say? The referendum has been criticised for denying voters the chance to decide on reforms individually, instead clubbing together multiple proposals to force a single yes-or-no answer. Critics say this confuses voters by presenting a complicated premise and limits their ability to properly understand and debate the reforms. The interim government and political parties have also drawn criticism for framing a “yes” vote as essential, which critics say shrinks space for dissent by implying voting “no” means rejecting reform altogether.

      "title": "Why is Bangladesh holding a national referendum alongside its general election?",
      "summary": "Bangladesh will hold a national referendum on Thursday together with its first parliamentary election since violent protests ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. The referendum will give people a chance to vote on reforms to state institutions. Here is a look at why the referendum is being held, and what it entails. Why is a referendum needed? The referendum focuses on implementing the ‘ July Charter ’ drafted after the 2024 uprising to establish good governance, democracy, and social justice through institutional reforms, and to prevent “recurrence of authoritarian and fascist rule”. The interim government that took power after Hasina’s ouster approved the charter’s implementation order in November, saying public approval was necessary for key changes. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters What are people voting on? Voters will decide on four major reforms, including the creation of new constitutional bodies and the introduction of a bicameral parliament, whose upper house majority approval shall be needed for constitutional amendments. Other questions cover the implementation of 30 charter reforms — including term limits for prime ministers and enhanced presidential powers, along with broader changes in line with political parties’ commitments. How is the referendum being held? Each person will cast their vote by secret ballot. If a majority votes in favour, a Constitutional Reform Council will be formed to complete the reforms within 180 working days from its first session. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters Has Bangladesh held a referendum before? Bangladesh held three referendums before the Hasina government abolished the provision in 2011. A High Court reinstated it in 2024 after she was ousted. While the 1977 and 1985 referendums asked people if they had confidence in the then-presidents and their policies, the third, in 1991, asked whether Bangladesh should return from a presidential system to parliamentary democracy. People overwhelmingly voted “yes” in all three referendums. What do critics say? The referendum has been criticised for denying voters the chance to decide on reforms individually, instead clubbing together multiple proposals to force a single yes-or-no answer. Critics say this confuses voters by presenting a complicated premise and limits their ability to properly understand and debate the reforms. The interim government and political parties have also drawn criticism for framing a “yes” vote as essential, which critics say shrinks space for dissent by implying voting “no” means rejecting reform altogether.

      "summary_orig": "When the monsoon rains returned in 2025, they brought with them a fear quite familiar to millions of Pakistanis, not because the downpour was unusual, but because they had finally understood what it meant: floods are no longer rare disasters. Over the past several years, floods have become a recurring test of who in this country is protected and who is not. According to figures compiled by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the 2025 floods claimed at least 1,000 lives and affected nearly seven million people across the country. Punjab was the hardest hit, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and parts of Gilgit-Baltistan, where crops spread over hundreds of acres were lost, homes were washed away, and entire communities were displaced. Every time floods come, they bring with them a host of questions, all linked to their disproportionate impact: why do they affect some more than others? Why do some families lose everything while others rebuild within months? Why do they hit the same cities, same villages and same houses over and over again? Because beyond the visible damage that floods wreak is a deeper truth that researchers have been highlighting for years: floods do not create vulnerability; they expose it. It is called social vulnerability. What research says Social vulnerability is not just about income. It reflects where people live, how secure their livelihoods are, whether institutions work for them, and whether they are included in decision-making. Vulnerability grows when exposure, sensitivity, and lack of capacity combine. That is a hard reality faced by millions in Pakistan every year. Research across the world, and increasingly in Pakistan, shows that disasters are shaped by social conditions that exist long before hazards strike. Essentially, poverty, unsafe housing, weak services, poor planning, and lack of political voices determine who suffers most. This is most evident in studies on Pakistan’s flood-prone regions. They expose how households with low education, poor housing, limited land, and weak access to health and social services experience the greatest losses and the slowest recovery. Over one-third of households in flood-prone zones fall into high social vulnerability categories, research from both rural and urban areas shows. This means that even moderate floods can trigger long-term hardship. Informal settlements, which are often absent from official plans, mainly face the worst flooding and the least protection, despite housing essential urban labour. These findings are not academic abstractions; they describe everyday realities. When vulnerability turns into catastrophe For Pakistan, the 2022 floods were a turning point. They affected over 30 million people, with economic losses exceeding $30 billion. Once again, the devastation followed familiar lines. In Sindh, districts with poor housing, limited health services, and weak political representation remained under water for months — a reality that the coastal province, situated at the southern end, has lived with for years. Studies later showed that women, small farmers, tenant cultivators, and landless households faced deeper and longer-lasting impacts, including debt, distress migration, and food insecurity. The floods did not just destroy homes; they reduced people’s ability to cope with future shocks. When the floods returned in 2025, many families were only just beginning to recover from the previous disaster. In Punjab , prolonged river flooding, breaches, and overwhelmed drainage systems hit small farmers and daily-wage workers hardest. Many had already sold assets after previous floods. This time, there was nothing left to fall back on. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, flash floods and landslides struck mountainous districts where weak infrastructure and limited institutional reach turned rainfall into tragedy. In Gilgit-Baltistan, glacial melt and sudden floods damaged roads and homes, isolating valleys and exposing the growing vulnerability of mountain communities to climate extremes. The lesson was clear: when vulnerability is ignored, and recovery is incomplete, disasters return — even if rainfall doesn’t. The problem and the lesson Vulnerability — the word holds more value than it is given. And Pakistan should definitely start taking stock of it because what the country lacks is not disaster authorities or policies, but a vulnerability-centred approach. Disaster planning still prioritises physical infrastructure. Research shows that while embankments and roads matter, they cannot protect people who remain poor, excluded, and unsupported. Data gaps, weak coordination between institutions, limited local government capacity, and minimal community participation continue to undermine resilience efforts. As a result, disasters are treated as temporary emergencies instead of symptoms of deeper governance failure. Decades of vulnerability research point to one conclusion: resilience begins with governance. Reducing vulnerability requires institutions that are accountable, coordinated, and focused on people. Local governments must be empowered, land-use planning enforced fairly, social protection strengthened, and communities, especially women and the poor, should be involved in early warning, evacuation, and recovery. Most importantly, vulnerability must be treated as a development issue, not just a disaster concern. When inequality is reduced and institutions work, disasters lose much of their power to destroy lives. The floods of 2022 and 2025 were not just nature’s wrath. They were mirrors, reflecting how society is organised — who is protected and who is left exposed. If Pakistan continues to rebuild infrastructure without rebuilding institutions, floods will keep returning to the same doorsteps. But if the country listens to what research has long shown and puts vulnerability reduction at the heart of governance, disasters can become survivable, recovery faster, and resilience real. The rain will come again. The question is whether it will still find the same people waiting.

      "summary_orig": "Bangladeshis lined up outside polling booths on Thursday as voting began for what many say is a pivotal election for the South Asian nation, marking a return to democracy after the 2024 ouster of long-time premier Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-driven uprising. Analysts say a decisive result is crucial for steady governance in the nation of 175 million, as the deadly anti-Hasina protests triggered months of unrest and disrupted key industries, including the garments sector, the worlds second-largest exporter. It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party leader Shafiqur Rahman reacts after casting his vote at a polling station during Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka on February 12, 2026. — AFP The contest pits two coalitions led by former allies, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, with opinion polls giving an edge to the BNP. In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008. “I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.” Hasina’s Awami League is banned, and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi deteriorate. Unlike previous elections marred by opposition boycotts and intimidation, more than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, are vying for 300 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation. Bangladeshi soldiers stand guard as people line up outside a polling station ahead of the polls opening for Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka on February 12, 2026. —AFP Voting in one constituency has been postponed due to the death of a candidate. At least 50 parties are contesting in total, a national record. “This election is not just another routine vote, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of an interim government installed after Hasinas ouster, said this week. The public awakening we witnessed against long-standing anger, inequality, deprivation and injustice finds its constitutional expression in this election. In parallel, there will be a referendum on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and imposing a two-term limit on the prime minister. Despite the crowded field and expectations of a close race, the campaign period remained largely peaceful, barring a few incidents. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 12, 2026. — Reuters The crucial test for Bangladesh now will be to ensure the election is conducted fairly and impartially, and for all parties to then accept the result, said Thomas Kean, a senior consultant with the International Crisis Group. If that happens, it will be the strongest evidence yet that Bangladesh has indeed embarked on a period of democratic renewal. On election day, more than 100,000 soldiers from the army, navy and air force will assist nearly 200,000 police in maintaining law and order. Early start, late finish Polling opened at 7:30am (0230 GMT) and closes at 4:30pm. Counting will begin soon after, with early trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, Election Commission officials said. Nearly 128 million people are registered to vote, 49% of them women. But only 83 female candidates are contesting. Members of the army patrol outside the polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 12, 2026. —Reuters Corruption and inflation are the biggest issues among voters, a recent survey found. The two prime ministerial candidates are the BNP’s Tarique Rahman and Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman. They are not related. Several voters are conflicted about participating in the election. Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred. But some are determined to cast their ballots. “During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.” President Zardari hopes for peaceful process President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning. “President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said. He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The Trump administration’s point man for South and Central Asia has told Congress that Pakistan remains an important US partner in the region, with Washington seeking to expand trade, economic cooperation, and security ties with the country. Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Sub-committee on South and Central Asia on Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored Pakistan’s role in regional engagement and highlighted growing bilateral cooperation. “Pakistan is another important partner in the region. We are working together with Pakistan to realise the potential of its critical mineral resources , combining US government seed financing with private sector know-how would benefit both of our countries,” he told the sub-committee. Referring to broader economic engagement, Kapur said: “Our trade in energy and agriculture is expanding as well.” He also pointed to continued security cooperation between the two countries, adding: “And our ongoing counter-terrorism cooperation helps Pakistan combat internal security threats while addressing transnational dangers that can harm the US or our partners.” During the subsequent question-and-answer session, lawmakers raised issues related to militancy, Pakistan’s past security strategy and broader regional dynamics. Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States. Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups. When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere. The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect. The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests. He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific. Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence. At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said. Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people. She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute. Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable. Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces. “We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.",

      "summary_orig": "• Palestinian leader demands ‘firm response’ from US over international law violation • Berlin joins criticism, calling move a step towards ‘de facto annexation’ GENEVA: The United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday that Israel’s plans to tighten control over the occupied West Bank pave the way for further settlement expansion and represent a step toward consolidating “illegal annexation”. Israel’s security cabinet on Sunday approved measures allowing Jewish Israelis to buy West Bank land directly and extending greater Israeli control over areas where the Palestinian Authority exercises power. The plan further grants Israel the authority to administer certain religious sites located in areas under Palestinian Authority control. The plans, which have sparked international outrage, modify the administration established under the Oslo Accords in the 1990s. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said the decisions by Israel’s security cabinet were the latest in a string of measures to annex Palestinian lands. “This is yet another step by the Israeli authorities towards rendering a viable Palestinian state impossible, in violation of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” Turk said in a statement. “If these decisions are implemented, they will undoubtedly accelerate the dispossession of Palestinians and their forcible transfer, and lead to the creation of more illegal Israeli settlements.” Turk noted that these measures would further deprive Palestinians of natural resources and restrict their human rights. He stated the moves will “further cement Israel’s control and integration of the occupied West Bank into Israel, consolidating unlawful annexation”. The UN official warned that these policies are part of a wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers and security forces, alongside a pattern of evictions, home demolitions, and land grabs. “We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” Turk said. “These decisions must be overturned.” Meanwhile, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas called for a “firm response” from the United States and the international community. Speaking during a visit to Oslo on Wednesday, Abbas said he discussed the issue with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store. “These serious violations require a firm response from the US administration and the international community because they hinder President Donald Trump’s efforts and constitute a violation of international law,” Abbas said. Abbas also cited issues including Israeli settler violence and Israel’s freezing of funds intended for the Palestinian people. Germany joined the chorus of criticism on Wednesday, with the foreign ministry calling the move “a further step towards de facto annexation.” “Israel remains an occupying power in the West Bank, and as an occupying power it is a violation of international law to build settlements, including transferring certain administrative functions to civilian Israeli authorities,” a German foreign ministry spokesman said in Berlin.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: In a fresh round of ambassadorial appointments, the government posted envoys across Europe, Africa and Asia, with several senior diplomats reassigned and a few vacancies filled. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, while announcing the new appointments, emphasised economic diplomacy as a central focus of Pakistan’s external engagement. “Building on the momentum of the last two years of robust foreign policy engagement and international outreach, may our envoys carry this mission forward with clarity of purpose and wisdom, with a clear emphasis on economic diplomacy,” Mr Dar posted on X. In Europe, Saadia Altaf Qazi, Pakistan’s ambassador to Norway, has been posted as ambassador to Thailand. She will replace Rukhsana Afzaal in Bangkok. Her transfer created a vacancy in Oslo, where Asim Ali Khan will replace her. Salman Sharif, presently serving at the Prime Minister’s Office, has been named ambassador to Germany. He will take over from Saqlain Syeda in Berlin. Pakistan’s embassy in Sweden will be headed by Ahmed Amjad Ali, currently consul general in Los Angeles. He replaced Bilal Hayee in Stockholm. Dar says clear emphasis on economic diplomacy, terms it central to external engagement In the United Kingdom, where Pakistan maintains a high commission, Tipu Usman, currently chief of protocol at the Foreign Office, has been appointed high commissioner to London. He replaced Dr Mohammad Faisal, who will return to the FO. At the United Nations in Geneva, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, who is serving as Foreign Office spokesperson, has been appointed Pakistan’s permanent representative. He replaced Bilal Ahmed. In a corresponding move, Mr Ahmed has been appointed as ambassador to Kenya, replacing Ibrar Hussain Khan in Nairobi. In Central Asia, Irfan Ahmed, director general for Europe at the Foreign Office, has been posted as ambassador to Tajikistan. The position in Dushanbe had been vacant. Meanwhile, Mudassir Tipu, currently Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran, has been appointed ambassador to Uzbekistan, replacing Ahmed Farooq in Tashkent. His move cleared the way for Imran Ahmed Siddiqui, presently additional secretary at the Foreign Office, to take over as ambassador in Tehran. In Africa, Hasnain Yousaf, currently director general of the Special Investment Facilitation Council at the Foreign Office, has been appointed ambassador to Tanzania, replacing Siraj Ahmed Khan in Dar es Salaam. Ashar Shahzad, presently deputy consul in Houston, has been named ambassador to Uganda, replacing Hassan Wazir in Kampala. In South Asia, Mohammad Aamir Khan, director general for the Americas at the Foreign Office, has been appointed ambassador to Nepal, replacing Abrar Hashmi in Kathmandu. In addition to the ambassadorial postings, the government also announced appointments to several consul general posts. Ali Anser Zaidi has been posted to Frankfurt, Yasir Iqbal Butt to Guangzhou, Shahbaz Hussain to Kandahar, Siraj Ahmad Khan to Los Angeles, Awais Ahmad Khan to Mazar-e-Sharif, and Faisal Abro to Montreal.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) enabled the recovery of about Rs506 billion in disputed tax revenue over the past year by deciding hundreds of long-pending tax and revenue cases and lifting stay orders that had blocked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from collecting dues, according to the court’s Annual Report 2025-26. The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation. To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC). A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes. Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog. LHC strikes down PRA sales tax case against Fauji Wind Energy on jurisdiction grounds Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn. According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn. The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn. The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years. The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives. The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”. Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records. Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction. A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025. Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority. The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million. The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least four policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), were martyred on Wednesday as armed terrorists attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area, police said. According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation. The operation was conducted in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Nawab police station following intelligence reports about militants’ presence in the area, it said, adding that the area was cordoned off before the search operation was initiated. While the police party was returning, militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire, the statement said. Four policemen were martyred in the attack and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire. The officers who lost their lives included SHO Faheem Mumtaz, Constable Irfan Khan, Constable Ghulam Subhani, and Constable Wajahat, the statement said. Paharpur Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police Hafiz Adnan and Assistant Sub-Inspector Tariq were injured in the attack. A police spokesperson earlier said that the martyrs and the wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Teaching Hospital for treatment. Following the incident, the spokesperson said, a heavy contingent of police, led by District Police Officer Sajad Ahmed Sahebzada, reached the scene and launched clearance a search operation to apprehend the militants. The police statement said that the area had been sealed off and the search and clearance operation was under way. It added that efforts were being made to recover the bodies of the slain militants from the forest area, while security in nearby localities has been further tightened. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack. “Eliminating the cancer of terrorism sponsored from abroad from the country is the topmost priority,” the president was quoted as saying. The statement added that he extended his prayers to the martyrs’ families and wished the wounded a swift recovery. Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took notice of the incident and strongly condemned it. In a statement, he paid tribute to the sacrifices of the martyred personnel. “The provincial government will provide all possible assistance to the affected families,” he said. He further said that the KP police were at the frontline in the fight against terrorism. “Terrorism is a common challenge for the entire country. Actions against elements hostile to peace will be further intensified in the province,” he said. He said police morale could not be dampened by such cowardly acts. CM Afridi said that a comprehensive and effective strategy was essential for the complete eradication of terrorism. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi expressed deep sorrow over the attack. He said he was saddened by the deaths of the police personnel and praised the bravery and sacrifice of Dera Ismail Khan police in protecting the public and the nation. The governor also directed that all possible medical care be provided to the injured officers and prayed for their speedy recovery. PTI’s Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, the former chief minister of the province, also expressed profound grief over the incident, stating that the officers laid down their lives in defence of the country and the people. He prayed for the swift recovery of the injured officers and extended his condolences to the families of the martyred personnel, while praying for the elevation of the martyrs’ ranks.",

      "summary": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least four policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), were martyred on Wednesday as armed terrorists attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area, police said. According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation. The operation was conducted in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Nawab police station following intelligence reports about militants’ presence in the area, it said, adding that the area was cordoned off before the search operation was initiated. While the police party was returning, militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire, the statement said. Four policemen were martyred in the attack and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire. The officers who lost their lives included SHO Faheem Mumtaz, Constable Irfan Khan, Constable Ghulam Subhani, and Constable Wajahat, the statement said. Paharpur Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police Hafiz Adnan and Assistant Sub-Inspector Tariq were injured in the attack. A police spokesperson earlier said that the martyrs and the wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Teaching Hospital for treatment. Following the incident, the spokesperson said, a heavy contingent of police, led by District Police Officer Sajad Ahmed Sahebzada, reached the scene and launched clearance a search operation to apprehend the militants. The police statement said that the area had been sealed off and the search and clearance operation was under way. It added that efforts were being made to recover the bodies of the slain militants from the forest area, while security in nearby localities has been further tightened.
