      "title_orig": "US sets 2027 deadline for Europe-led Nato defence, officials say",
      "summary_orig": "The United States wants Europe to take over the majority of Nato’s conventional defence capabilities, from intelligence to missiles, by 2027, Pentagon officials told diplomats in Washington this week, a tight deadline that struck some European officials as unrealistic. The message, recounted by five sources familiar with the discussion, including a US official, was conveyed at a meeting in Washington this week of Pentagon staff overseeing Nato policy and several European delegations. The shifting of this burden from the US to European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation would dramatically change how the US, a founding member of the post-war alliance, works with its most important military partners. In the meeting, Pentagon officials indicated that Washington was not yet satisfied with the strides Europe has made to boost its defence capabilities since Russia’s expanded invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The US officials told their counterparts that if Europe does not meet the 2027 deadline, the US may stop participating in some Nato defence coordination mechanisms, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Some officials on Capitol Hill are aware of and concerned about the Pentagon’s message to the Europeans, one US official said. No clarity on how US would measure Nato’s progress Conventional defence capabilities include non-nuclear assets from troops to weapons and the officials did not explain how the US would measure Europe’s progress toward shouldering most of the burden. It was also not clear if the 2027 deadline represented the Trump administration’s position or only the views of some Pentagon officials. There are significant disagreements in Washington over the military role the US should play in Europe. Several European officials said that a 2027 deadline was not realistic, no matter how Washington measures progress, since Europe needs more than money and political will to replace certain US capabilities in the short term. Among other challenges, Nato allies face production backlogs for military equipment they are trying to purchase. While US officials have encouraged Europe to buy more US-made materiel, some of the most prized US-made weapons and defence systems would take years to be delivered if ordered today. The US also contributes capabilities that cannot simply be purchased, including unique intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance that have proven key to the Ukrainian war effort. Asked for comment, a Nato official speaking for the alliance said European allies had begun taking more responsibility for the continent’s security, but did not comment on the 2027 deadline. “Allies have recognised the need to invest more in defence and shift the burden on conventional defence” from the US to Europe, the official said. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said: “We’ve been very clear in the need for Europeans to lead in the conventional defence of Europe. We are committed to working through Nato coordination mechanisms to strengthen the alliance and ensure its long-term viability as European allies increasingly take on responsibility for conventional deterrence and defence in Europe.” European nations have broadly accepted US President Donald Trump’s demand that they take more responsibility for their own security and have pledged big increases in defence spending. The European Union has set a target of making the continent ready to defend itself by 2030 and says it must fill gaps in its air defences, drones, cyber warfare capabilities, munitions and other areas. Officials and analysts said even that deadline is highly ambitious. Washington-Nato relationship runs hot and cold The Trump administration has consistently argued that European allies need to contribute more to the Nato alliance, but it’s not always clear where the president stands on Nato. On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump frequently bashed European allies, and he said he would encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Nato countries that did not spend their fair share on defence. But at the annual Nato leaders’ summit in June, Trump effusively praised European leaders for agreeing to a US plan to boost the annual defence spending target for member states to five per cent of gross domestic product. In the months since, Trump has vacillated between a harder line on Russia — the bloc’s main opponent — and, more recently, a willingness to negotiate with Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. European officials have complained that they were largely cut out of those negotiations. At a meeting of Nato foreign ministers this week, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said it was “obvious” Nato allies should take responsibility for Europe’s defence. “Successive US administrations have been saying this in one form or another pretty much my whole life … but our administration means what it says,” Landau wrote on X.",

      "summary_orig": "The dust of the city coated everything – the flags, the crisp new doboks, the hopeful faces of fathers shepherding their children. After 18 years, this was Karachi’s welcome: not a red carpet, but a gritty testament. The National Games had come home. The city, in its quintessential fashion, demanded a pilgrimage. For the first Games on its soil after 18 years, it offered an obstacle course of its own making – cranes standing like sentinels over diverted roads that formed labyrinths of progress. But through the grit and the detours, they came. A river of colour, athletes from every corner of the country in their distinct tracksuits, and locals converging on the National Stadium. They arrived not for a mere ceremony, but in spite of the journey. “I am almost covered in this dust,” a father told Dawn , guiding his young son in a taekwondo dobok toward the gates. “But we are glad. We are here.” Flags of various participating contingents seen during the opening ceremony of National Games in Karachi on Saturday. — Tahir Jamal/White Star That sentiment, gritty and determined, was the unspoken anthem. An 18-year wait, borne of the nation’s tumultuous cycles, had culminated not in polished perfection, but in the magnificent, unruly spectacle that only Karachi – impatient, passionate, and perpetually under construction – would dare to stage. In the cool December sunlight, the stadium slowly filled. Nearly 2,500 athletes – a vanguard of the 11,000 competing – along with thousands of students, transformed the stands into a living mosaic. Pakistani flags fluttered. Girls in cultural dresses posed for pictures; athletes snapped selfies. The air buzzed with the screams of students tumbling off buses, their energy infectious. Then, the city’s notorious inertia set in. An almost two-hour delay saw the early carnival buzz curdle under the sun. A view of the National Games in Karachi on Saturday. — Tahir Jamal/White Star The vibrant dances on the field began to feel like a loop. “They brought us here just to bake?” an athlete muttered in the open ground, echoing a growing restlessness. The band’s drills became background noise to shared sighs. A roar, rekindled But when the chief guest, Chairman Pakistan Peoples Party Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah finally arrived, the spark returned violently. Fireworks blossomed against the evening sky. The ceremony opened with the recitation of the Quran, followed by the national anthem. As the last note faded, it was swallowed by a roaring, unified catharsis: “Pakistan Zindabad!” What followed was a parade of pride and personality – the reason for all the chaos. Fourteen contingents marched, each led by its stars. Defending champions, Army, moved with the gravity of expectation, led by judoka Shah Hussain Shah. The Air Force contingent followed in sharp lines. Then came a burst of raw energy as Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s athletes spilled from their vans, the fatigue of their long journey shed the moment their boots hit the Karachi tarmac. One by one, they flowed past: Higher Education Commission led by Shareef Tahir, Commonwealth silver medallist in wrestling and Maheesha Ali, the Asian gold medallist in taekwondo; flag bearers of Islamabad were boxers Mazhar Fayyaz and Summaiya followed by Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Navy, Police. An elderly coach from Balochistan paused, his eyes glistening, to salute a section of the crowd before hurrying to catch up. The hosts, Sindh, led by rugby player Areeba Noor, drew thunder from the stands. But the loudest cheers were reserved for the final entry: the Olympic champion. The flame and the future As the march ended, javelin gold medallist Arshad Nadeem – the nation’s brightest star – stood front and centre, holding the Pakistan flag aloft. The Navy band marched past with drums and flutes, a stirring prelude to the oath, taken by Mahoor Fatima and sprinter Mohammad Zubair Munir. Then came the torch, carried on a journey that had begun in Karachi and travelled the nation. Passed from Olympian Qamar Ibrahim to athlete after athlete – Zameer Hussain, Anahita Fatima, Ayina Moeen, former sprinter Naseem Hameed, hockey legend Islahuddin – it finally reached Arshad.

From the Sindh contingent’s block, a chant rose: “Zindabad! Zindabad!” before melting into the stadium-wide roar. With a final thrust, he lit the cauldron. Then, in a gesture that bridged ceremony and sport, he seized a javelin. With a familiar, powerful motion, he sent it arcing into the waiting net—a symbolic strike igniting the competitive spirit of the Games. Bilawal formally declared the Games open. Fireworks flowered again in the sky. On the field, little girls in colourful dresses waved handkerchiefs to the official song, while young karatekas in crisp gis showed off their kicks.

One by one, they flowed past: Higher Education Commission led by Shareef Tahir, Commonwealth silver medallist in wrestling and Maheesha Ali, the Asian gold medallist in taekwondo; flag bearers of Islamabad were boxers Mazhar Fayyaz and Summaiya followed by Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Navy, Police. An elderly coach from Balochistan paused, his eyes glistening, to salute a section of the crowd before hurrying to catch up. The hosts, Sindh, led by rugby player Areeba Noor, drew thunder from the stands. But the loudest cheers were reserved for the final entry: the Olympic champion. The flame and the future As the march ended, javelin gold medallist Arshad Nadeem – the nation’s brightest star – stood front and centre, holding the Pakistan flag aloft. The Navy band marched past with drums and flutes, a stirring prelude to the oath, taken by Mahoor Fatima and sprinter Mohammad Zubair Munir. Then came the torch, carried on a journey that had begun in Karachi and travelled the nation. Passed from Olympian Qamar Ibrahim to athlete after athlete – Zameer Hussain, Anahita Fatima, Ayina Moeen, former sprinter Naseem Hameed, hockey legend Islahuddin – it finally reached Arshad. Olympic gold medallist Arshad Nadeem and hockey great Islahuddin Siddique with torch for the National Games in Karachi on Saturday. — Tahir Jamal/White Star He held it high, jogging a lap as every stand he passed erupted. From the Sindh contingent’s block, a chant rose: “Zindabad! Zindabad!” before melting into the stadium-wide roar. With a final thrust, he lit the cauldron. Then, in a gesture that bridged ceremony and sport, he seized a javelin. With a familiar, powerful motion, he sent it arcing into the waiting net—a symbolic strike igniting the competitive spirit of the Games. Bilawal formally declared the Games open. Fireworks flowered again in the sky. On the field, little girls in colourful dresses waved handkerchiefs to the official song, while young karatekas in crisp gis showed off their kicks. The cold night had fully settled, but the stadium glowed with more than just flame. A view of the National Games in Karachi on Saturday. — Tahir Jamal/White Star It glowed with a promise. The journey that began in the dust was now alight. For Karachi, and for Pakistan’s athletes, the true test would come at dawn.",

      "title_orig": "‘Imran Khan not a security threat’: PTI deplores ‘ridiculous’ allegations, laments democracy’s backward slide",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI emphatically deplored “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson against ex-premier Imran Khan, saying he was “not a security threat”, and lamented the weakening of democracy in the country following the passage of recent constitutional amendments. In a blistering press conference on Friday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”. Responding to the DG ISPR’s accusations in a press conference today at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “Do not drive away the people of Pakistan, they stand with Imran Khan and the PTI. Imran Khan is not a national security threat. He has kept the people united.” Raja said there were many narratives in the country, including along ethnic and sectarian lines, yet Imran had rejected all of them to stand with the narrative of Pakistan, along with PTI’s supporters and voters. “For God’s sake, don’t do this. You will not be able to minus Imran Khan, but God forbid if you do, it will be very difficult to keep this country’s interests united. If you attack KP and remove its elected government to install an unelected setup, then you yourselves will be responsible for the conditions that follow.” Raja termed the DG ISPR’s press conference “unfortunate” and added that the party will not answer the accusation and charges levelled against the PTI founder. “Today we are being told that the country’s most popular leader is a national security threat, which is ridiculous, but this has not been said for the first time.” Referring to the establishment’s manoeuvring against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in the 1990s, Raja said: “The institutions decided again and again that any popular leader of the people is a national security threat and it is necessary to remove them from the scene, but this did not happen. You cannot remove them from the hearts of the people through your decisions. The nation has always been aware and there is a reason it is standing behind Imran Khan. We are not mad, we know who has always been in control in this country.” Raja elaborated that he wanted to set the context for everyone, noting that there have been countless times in the country’s history when it was pushed from democracy toward force and authoritarianism. Referring to previous military dictatorships in the country, he said prosperity was always promised, and yet, they all ultimately failed. The general secretary of the party said it was claimed multiple times during the past that democracy, law and the Constitution does not suit the country, and needs a stick, but the “ruler always left it weaker than before”. Raja lamented that the party was frequently criticised as a ragtag group without understanding of affairs and what heights the country was being taken towards. However, the PTI secretary general questioned whether the country needed to be forcibly developed through the use of power, noting that if this were the case, it would have already happened during previous periods of military rule. Raja said there was a need for a “grand dialogue”, given the country’s current situation, and that the nation needed to be involved lest the past repeat itself. “There will be no change, and we will go backwards.” Referring to the constitutional amendments and the subjugation of the judiciary, he said the development was not even comparable to anything under previous eras of military rule. Slamming censorship in the country, the senior PTI leader said that anyone speaking freely could be subject to the Peca law, inquiries, and more, referring to the trial proceedings of husband-and-wife lawyer duo Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha. Raja said the PTI was ready to talk, but the people of KP and their chief minister should never be mocked or denigrated. “Don’t put the future of the country or KP at stake in this battle of narratives. This is a very sensitive area, take the people along in the conditions that are there at the moment and the state of terrorism. The PTI is the biggest force in the country that can take it towards betterment.” The PTI secretary general also seemingly criticised the party’s social media wing and supporters, who he said called the party out to respond or answer why it was not taking action. “We are sitting because the country is dear to us and we don’t want discord in the country,” Raja added. He said the party and Imran would take every step required for the benefit of the country. “It is very easy to respond to the brick with a stone but we will not do it because the country’s benefit is not in this.” Former National Assembly speaker and PTI MNA Asad Qaiser also voiced a complaint with the DG ISPR’s remarks. “There is great anger and heightened emotions in our province. Your words should have been appropriate. We think such words should be desisted from and will also demand that they are retracted because a whole society and province think it has been disrespected.” Barrister Gohar calls for easing of ‘tone’ PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali criticised the DG ISPR’s remarks, calling them “inappropriate and wrong” and saying it was “unfortunate for democracy” that a senior officer would use such language against a major political party, its leadership, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister. Gohar said that “there is an enemy of ours” who would be pleased by press conferences against each other, adding that this was why he had earlier said today’s would not be a confrontational press conference. PTI Chairman said the party wanted to clarify that “some people are trying to incite fighting between the workers of a major party and members of a major institution”. Gohar said such incidents should never occur, warning that “the beginning of any great destruction is always due to a few inappropriate words”. He added that ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction. The PTI leader said there was still time for “tone to be eased” and for steps to improve the current situation. He called for Tuesday’s meeting with Imran to be allowed without restriction and urged that no politics be made over the ex-premier’s meetings with his sisters. He maintained that the country deserved to prosper and grow, but if the current tense atmosphere and attitude continued, “then it won’t be minus-one, but minus-everyone, which should not happen”. At the start of the press conference, Gohar welcomed everyone to what he said would be an “unusual” press briefing in response to the military spokesperson’s remarks against the PTI founder, saying it would have a “different tone”. “We are not going to do a confrontational press conference or to respond to a brick with a stone, but it is very important to tell some facts to the people as charges have been levelled at us.” He claimed that the PTI was the country’s largest political party and its leader was Imran, with the support of 70 per cent of the nation. “It is necessary to tell the people what has happened to us in the recent past. From 180 seats, we were reduced to 91 seats, and now we are left with 76. Reserved seats were taken and there was violence against women and children. The injustices against us are a tale of their own.” Barrister Gohar said the party had continued to endure in order to uphold democracy, adding that the PTI’s stance was rooted in democracy, peace and the rule of law, and that Imran Khan had always maintained that both Pakistan and its army belong to the people. The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role. The PTI chairman added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but yesterday’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”. Referring to Imran’s pending cases and delayed proceedings, he said the party began with a position of calling for his release and was now reduced to asking for meetings to be permitted with the PTI founder. “All that we endured was for the sake of democracy and the country, but we say, if such conditions continue and such treatment with each other continues, then democracy will be the one to face the biggest loss.”",

Gohar said that “there is an enemy of ours” who would be pleased by press conferences against each other, adding that this was why he had earlier said today’s would not be a confrontational press conference. PTI Chairman said the party wanted to clarify that “some people are trying to incite fighting between the workers of a major party and members of a major institution”. Gohar said such incidents should never occur, warning that “the beginning of any great destruction is always due to a few inappropriate words”. He added that ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction. The PTI leader said there was still time for “tone to be eased” and for steps to improve the current situation. He called for Tuesday’s meeting with Imran to be allowed without restriction and urged that no politics be made over the ex-premier’s meetings with his sisters. He maintained that the country deserved to prosper and grow, but if the current tense atmosphere and attitude continued, “then it won’t be minus-one, but minus-everyone, which should not happen”. At the start of the press conference, Gohar welcomed everyone to what he said would be an “unusual” press briefing in response to the military spokesperson’s remarks against the PTI founder, saying it would have a “different tone”. “We are not going to do a confrontational press conference or to respond to a brick with a stone, but it is very important to tell some facts to the people as charges have been levelled at us.” He claimed that the PTI was the country’s largest political party and its leader was Imran, with the support of 70 per cent of the nation. “It is necessary to tell the people what has happened to us in the recent past. From 180 seats, we were reduced to 91 seats, and now we are left with 76. Reserved seats were taken and there was violence against women and children. The injustices against us are a tale of their own.” Barrister Gohar said the party had continued to endure in order to uphold democracy, adding that the PTI’s stance was rooted in democracy, peace and the rule of law, and that Imran Khan had always maintained that both Pakistan and its army belong to the people. The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role. The PTI chairman added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but yesterday’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”. Referring to Imran’s pending cases and delayed proceedings, he said the party began with a position of calling for his release and was now reduced to asking for meetings to be permitted with the PTI founder. “All that we endured was for the sake of democracy and the country, but we say, if such conditions continue and such treatment with each other continues, then democracy will be the one to face the biggest loss.”",

      "summary_orig": "The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday that 14 terrorists were killed in three separate intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.. In a statement, the military’s media wing said nine khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij were killed on Friday. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It said an IBO was conducted in Tank on the reported presence of terrorists. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement read. In a separate IBO conducted in Lakki Marwat, “two more khawarij were effectively neutralised by security forces”. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area,” the statement said. Later in the day, the ISPR said security forces conducted an IBO in Balochistan’s Dera Bugti district and killed five terrorists belonging to the Fitna al Hindustan . The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain terrorists in all three instances. According to the military’s media wing, the eliminated terrorists “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians”. It added that a counter-terrorism campaign under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of “foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the operations. According to a statement posted by state broadcaster PTV on X, he said that security forces were making big gains against terrorism under Azm-i-Istehkam. “The nation stands with security forces against terrorism. We are determined to root out terrorism from the country,” he said. President Asif Ali Zardari commended the “courage and timely action” of the security forces in “thwarting the heinous intentions of the terrorists,” PTV reported. He stressed that “the nation’s resolve to eliminate terrorists will continue to stay intact until the menace is rooted out”. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also lauded the efforts of the security forces, stating that “security forces neutralised the militants with remarkable efficiency,” the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported. He also praised their professionalism, courage, and the swift action taken. He noted that the “timely operations thwarted major threats and demonstrated the exceptional skill and commitment of Pakistan’s security personnel”. “The nation takes pride in the bravery and professionalism of its soldiers,” he was quoted as saying. “Security forces remain fully determined to restore and maintain lasting peace in KP,” the minister added. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. Earlier this week, security forces killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in KP’s North Waziristan district.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and the United States agreed to intensify cooperation on security and immigration during a meeting in Islamabad on Saturday between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker. Naqvi and Baker discussed ways to enhance bilateral cooperation in counter-narcotics, security, and the prevention of illegal immigration. The meeting also focused on strengthening collaboration in intelligence sharing, curbing drug trafficking, and expanding joint measures to stop illegal migration. The US envoy offered full technical assistance to Pakistan in combating narcotics and preventing unauthorised cross-border movement. He said the identification of drug trafficking cases at airports remains a top priority, adding that state-of-the-art scanning machines were being installed at all major airports across the country. Naqvi reaffirmed that Pakistan is strictly implementing a zero-tolerance policy against narcotics. Even today, drugs originating from Afghanistan are reaching dozens of countries and destroying young generations, he noted, welcoming US technical support to bolster Pakistan’s counter-narcotics capabilities. On the prime minister’s directive, the National Narcotics Coordination Centre would be established soon, the interior minister informed the envoy. Earlier in November, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties, with Islamabad’s envoy describing it as an effort to build an “economically entrenched strategic partnership”. After years of uneven engagement and recurring mistrust, both sides are now emphasising economic cooperation alongside traditional security ties. In recent months, US officials have pointed to Pakistan’s potential role in regional stability and its capacity to contribute to economic and energy initiatives in South and Central Asia. The Trump administration has also encouraged American firms to explore investment opportunities in Pakistan’s infrastructure, minerals, and technology sectors. For Islamabad, the new tone in Washington offers an opportunity to diversify its partnership with the US, while the Trump administration appears keen to reduce Pakistan’s overreliance on China. Officials in both capitals say they want to anchor the relationship in trade, investment, and long-term development — not merely in aid or counterterrorism cooperation. In October, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the US sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan, but added that the recent strengthening of ties between the two countries did not come at the expense of Wash­i­ngton’s relationship with New Delhi. In September, PM Sheh­baz Sharif also met with Mr Trump in the Oval Off­ice, where they discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism.",

      "summary_orig": "Calm returned to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border at Chaman on Saturday after heavy clashes occurred between the two sides a day earlier. At least three civilians were injured in the clashes last night and were shifted to the district hospital in Chaman. On the Afghan side, five people were injured, according to Afghan government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat. According to officials, Afghan forces fired mortar shells on the Badani area, prompting security forces to retaliate. However, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid claimed it was Pakistan that launched an attack on Spin Boldak, alleging that their forces were responding. Prime Minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, Mosharraf Zaidi, however, confirmed the clashes. In a post on X early Saturday morning, he said, “A short while ago, the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing along the Chaman border. An immediate, befitting & intense response has been given by our armed forces.” “Pakistan remains fully alert & committed to ensuring its territorial integrity & the safety [of] our citizens,” he added. A senior official in Quetta also confirmed on the condition of anonymity that the exchange of fire started at around 10pm and continued till late at night. The clash comes amid stalled negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan after three rounds of talks in Istanbul could not yield any results. Border clashes first broke out between the two nations on October 11. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. A day earlier, the spokesperson Foreign Office (FO) had reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to engage in talks with Afghanistan. Pakistan-Afghanistan talks Soon after the clashes on Oct 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha. Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. But on November 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Pakistan. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the clashes.",

Prime Minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, Mosharraf Zaidi, however, confirmed the clashes. In a post on X early Saturday morning, he said, “A short while ago, the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing along the Chaman border. An immediate, befitting & intense response has been given by our armed forces.” “Pakistan remains fully alert & committed to ensuring its territorial integrity & the safety [of] our citizens,” he added. A senior official in Quetta also confirmed on the condition of anonymity that the exchange of fire started at around 10pm and continued till late at night. The clash comes amid stalled negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan after three rounds of talks in Istanbul could not yield any results. Border clashes first broke out between the two nations on October 11. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. A day earlier, the spokesperson Foreign Office (FO) had reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to engage in talks with Afghanistan. Pakistan-Afghanistan talks Soon after the clashes on Oct 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha. Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. But on November 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Pakistan. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the clashes.",

      "summary_orig": "India capped airfares on Saturday as hundreds of passengers gathered outside Bengaluru and Mumbai airports after IndiGo cancelled 385 flights on the fifth day of a crisis at the country’s biggest airline that has crippled air travel. IndiGo has cancelled thousands of flights this week due to a shortage of pilots after it failed to plan adequately for new rules limiting pilots’ work hours. The government responded on Friday, announcing special relief for the carrier and the operation of additional trains to help clear the backlog. The Delhi airport posted on X on Saturday that flight operations were steadily resuming, but cancellations remained rife elsewhere. ‘Waiting for my luggage’ With IndiGo’s spate of cancellations, fares rose on flights operated by other airlines on popular routes. The government said it was capping fares to maintain pricing discipline, without disclosing details of the caps. The Civil Aviation Ministry said it would “continue to closely monitor fare levels through real-time data and active coordination with airlines”. Fares were last capped during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The flight cancellations are the biggest crisis ever for 20-year-old IndiGo, which has an over 60 per cent market share in the world’s most-populous country and has prided itself on on-time performance while luring passengers with lower fares. IndiGo acknowledges failing to plan properly for the November 1 deadline to implement the stricter rules on night flying and weekly rest for pilots. On Friday, more than 1,000 IndiGo flights were cancelled. After the government announced the exemptions to the rules for IndiGo, the airline said it could return to normal operations between December 10 and 15. On Saturday, IndiGo cancelled 124 flights in Bengaluru, 109 in Mumbai, 86 in New Delhi and 66 in Hyderabad, airport sources told Reuters . The disruptions have upended weddings in India as many families and guests were stranded at airports. Hundreds of passengers gathered outside Bengaluru and Mumbai airports on Saturday, some unaware of the cancellations, according to Reuters witnesses. Satish Konde had to catch a connecting flight from Mumbai to the western city of Nagpur and had checked in before being told it was cancelled. “I am waiting for my luggage to be returned,” he said. Pilots call exemption ‘selective dispensation’ The new pilot rest and duty rules capped the number of night landings to two from six and restricted the maximum number of hours a pilot can fly in the night to 10 hours. For now, IndiGo has been exempted from both measures until February 10. The new rules also said that if a pilot takes a personal leave that cannot be not counted in calculating his weekly rest period of 48 hours. That restriction too has been put on hold for all airlines, given the IndiGo crisis. That has upset pilot labour groups, who told the government that safety must not be compromised to make up for IndiGo’s poor planning, the head of the Federation of Indian Pilots, C.S. Randhawa, told Reuters . The Airline Pilots Association of India objected on Friday, calling the relief for IndiGo “selective dispensation”. The norms “exist solely to safeguard human life,” the association said in a letter to the government. Other major Indian airlines, including Air India and Akasa, have not had to cancel flights due to the new rules.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday slammed the PTI for its reaction to yesterday’s press conference by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, wherein he had launched a scathing attack on party founder Imran Khan. On Friday, Lt Gen Chaudhry — without once naming Imran — called the former premier “a mentally ill person”, “a narcissist” and “a security risk”, while stressing it was for the government to decide how to deal with him. He had accused him and his party of pushing a narrative designed to undermine the armed forces and destabilise the state. In response, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali had expressed “disappointment” over the comments, stating that “PTI’s narrative has never been, nor will it ever be, anti-state”. Speaking to the media in Sialkot, Asif recalled that Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition, insisting that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman. “When they were in power, I remember, he (Imran) would engage in theatrics and sometimes don a dupatta to mimic leaders. He did that for Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who is with him today. He would also use derogatory language for women,” Asif said, adding that the incarcerated leader continued to do the same via statements made on his X account. “If DG ISPR has given a reaction, I believe it is a guarded reaction,” he said. The minister assailed the PTI for engaging in activities that were reflective of an “anti-state” narrative. He lamented that the party leadership did not “acknowledge” the sacrifices of the armed forces in the fight against terrorism. “I have attended the funerals of many martyrs … I have never seen someone from the PTI there,” the defence minister said, urging the party to “speak in favour of martyrs and not terrorists”. “Do not attempt to hold dialogue with terrorists or take a soft stance with them,” Asif warned, telling the PTI that “when you continue to adopt such an approach, this is exactly the kind of language that will be used against you”. Asif was of the view that while the military’s spokesman was “still careful with his words, I, however, have the liberty to give you a hard-hitting answer”. Referring to interviews given by Imran’s sisters to Indian media, Asif assailed the party for “engaging with the enemy”. “How can they call themselves Pakistanis and patriots?” he questioned. The defence minister further said that the PTI’s “sole ideology was to gain power”, alleging that they had no “allegiance to Pakistan”. Referring to the May conflict with India, Asif pointed said, “All our neighbours expressed their sympathies on the martyrdom of our soldiers … they stood with us shoulder to shoulder during the war, but internally this one party here did not play any role in confronting the enemy.” “The PTI leader has something to say about everything; why did he not say anything during the conflict for our soldiers and armed forces?” he asked. “Even during times of war, they continued to criticise the armed forces leadership … how can such people now say that the DG ISPR should not have said this or that. “He has every right to say it,” Asif emphasised. In a warning to the party, the defence minister said: “Do your politics, hold protests, but do not threaten the sovereignty and honour of Pakistan.” In his response to the military spokesperson’s comments yesterday, Barrister Gohar had said, “It is regrettable when state institutions and political figures label each other as mentally ill or perceive each other as threats.” He had also reaffirmed the party’s commitment to the country in his remarks, dismissing allegations of PTI spreading an “anti-state” narrative. “Pakistan belongs to us, and so does the army; we have demonstrated this in practice and will continue to do so.” He had urged that the conduct of “certain non-stakeholders”, without specifying who he was referring to, should not become a cause of tension between PTI and the institutions. Barrister Gohar had said Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were incarcerated, and the overall situation would improve if permission were granted for meetings with them. “The country cannot afford tension and chaos,” Gohar had said.",

He lamented that the party leadership did not “acknowledge” the sacrifices of the armed forces in the fight against terrorism. “I have attended the funerals of many martyrs … I have never seen someone from the PTI there,” the defence minister said, urging the party to “speak in favour of martyrs and not terrorists”. “Do not attempt to hold dialogue with terrorists or take a soft stance with them,” Asif warned, telling the PTI that “when you continue to adopt such an approach, this is exactly the kind of language that will be used against you”. Asif was of the view that while the military’s spokesman was “still careful with his words, I, however, have the liberty to give you a hard-hitting answer”. Referring to interviews given by Imran’s sisters to Indian media, Asif assailed the party for “engaging with the enemy”. “How can they call themselves Pakistanis and patriots?” he questioned. The defence minister further said that the PTI’s “sole ideology was to gain power”, alleging that they had no “allegiance to Pakistan”. Referring to the May conflict with India, Asif pointed said, “All our neighbours expressed their sympathies on the martyrdom of our soldiers … they stood with us shoulder to shoulder during the war, but internally this one party here did not play any role in confronting the enemy.” “The PTI leader has something to say about everything; why did he not say anything during the conflict for our soldiers and armed forces?” he asked. “Even during times of war, they continued to criticise the armed forces leadership … how can such people now say that the DG ISPR should not have said this or that. “He has every right to say it,” Asif emphasised. In a warning to the party, the defence minister said: “Do your politics, hold protests, but do not threaten the sovereignty and honour of Pakistan.” In his response to the military spokesperson’s comments yesterday, Barrister Gohar had said, “It is regrettable when state institutions and political figures label each other as mentally ill or perceive each other as threats.” He had also reaffirmed the party’s commitment to the country in his remarks, dismissing allegations of PTI spreading an “anti-state” narrative. “Pakistan belongs to us, and so does the army; we have demonstrated this in practice and will continue to do so.” He had urged that the conduct of “certain non-stakeholders”, without specifying who he was referring to, should not become a cause of tension between PTI and the institutions. Barrister Gohar had said Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were incarcerated, and the overall situation would improve if permission were granted for meetings with them. “The country cannot afford tension and chaos,” Gohar had said.",

      "summary": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday slammed the PTI for its reaction to yesterday’s press conference by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, wherein he had launched a scathing attack on party founder Imran Khan. On Friday, Lt Gen Chaudhry — without once naming Imran — called the former premier “a mentally ill person”, “a narcissist” and “a security risk”, while stressing it was for the government to decide how to deal with him. He had accused him and his party of pushing a narrative designed to undermine the armed forces and destabilise the state. In response, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali had expressed “disappointment” over the comments, stating that “PTI’s narrative has never been, nor will it ever be, anti-state”. Speaking to the media in Sialkot, Asif recalled that Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition, insisting that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman. “When they were in power, I remember, he (Imran) would engage in theatrics and sometimes don a dupatta to mimic leaders. He did that for Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who is with him today. He would also use derogatory language for women,” Asif said, adding that the incarcerated leader continued to do the same via statements made on his X account. “If DG ISPR has given a reaction, I believe it is a guarded reaction,” he said. The minister assailed the PTI for engaging in activities that were reflective of an “anti-state” narrative.

      "summary_orig": "Notables lawyers and citizens have paid tribute to three judges who resigned in the wake of the 27th Amendment, lauding their decision to “preserve their constitutional oath and honour over office and privilege”. Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah had resigned from the Supreme Court on November 13, hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari. Shah had assailed the amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan” while Minallah said he had sworn to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”. Meanwhile, Lahore High Court’s Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza had tendered his resignation two days later, saying: “After the 27th Amendment in the Constitution, I am not inclined as a matter of principle and in good conscience to continue as a judge.” In a statement printed in Dawn on Saturday, 60 citizens and lawyers issued a statement saying: “We mourn presently, not at the resignations of Justices Shah, Minallah and Mirza — they have permanently etched their names on the short list of national heroes who prized principles over expediency — but at the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the high courts of Pakistan, and the entinguishment of the last embers of an independent judiciary.” The statement included the names of lawyers Abid S. Zuberi, Jibran Nasir, Imaan Mazari, Asad Rahim, Sardar Latif Khosa, Salman Akram Raja, Zainab Janjua, Faisal Siddiqui and Salahuddin Ahmed. Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar was also included in the list. The statement said that Mansoor “undisputedly ranks among the finest jurists ever produced by Pakistan”. “He stood entirely peerless in his zeal for judicial reform and his vision to drag the creaking edifice of the Pakistan judiciary into the 21st century and transform it into an instrument for speedy justice for the common litigant,” it said. “It is our judiciary’s and our nation’s misfortune that we have chosen to sacrifice him at the altar of short-term political expediency and the desire for personal advancement of others,” the statement said. It went on to say that Minallah had been a consistent voice for the weak and disempowered, for the families of missing persons, for journalists muzzled by the state, for the opposition “tormented by the government of the day and for judges hounded by intelligence agencies”. “He was one of the few judges possessed with sufficient self-awareness to be able to cast a critical eye on the judicial history of Pakistan,” it said. “To be lauded by those on the receiving end of power and criticised by those wielding it, is a distinction for the conscientious constitutional judge,” the statement said. It also noted his contribution to transforming the Islamabad High Court as a “citadel of judicial independence”. Talking about Mirza, the statement said that he left behind an enduring example of a judge who “refused to let fundamental rights become casualties of turbulent times and became an anchor of constitutional steadiness”. “In his decisiveness and integrity, he neither courted controversy nor shied away from difficult decisions,” it said. “By choosing judicial defiance over judicial silence, he ensured that when history is written, his name will stand firmly on the side of constitutional courage as the only high court judge who resigned in protest against the pseudo 27th Constitutional Amendment,” it said. The statement said that it was ironic that the judges were castigated by the “wielders of power, not for their own sin but for earlier sins of those whom they resisted”. “Their fault lay in the steadfastness of their ‘no’ when others were willing to say ‘yes’,” it said. “Their decision to preserve their constitutional oath and honour over office and privilege: to speak out instead of silently acquiescing to regression masquerading as reform; to stand instead of kneeling — is a spark to the conscience of a nation,” the statement said.",
