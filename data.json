      "summary_orig": "Iran’s economy is going through one of its most difficult periods in years, fueled by sanctions, high inflation, and a significant drop in the value of the national currency, the rial. These pressures have had a direct impact on living standards and have also fueled recent protests. The protests began on Dec. 28 in commercial hubs in the capital Tehran, when shopkeepers, merchants, and small business owners staged strikes and demonstrations to protest soaring inflation, the collapsing rial, and deteriorating economic conditions, and have since grown into nationwide anti-government expressions of discontent involving workers, students, and others across multiple cities. The Iranian president said Sunday that his government is determined to address Iran’s economic problems amid the protests. Masoud Pezeshkian said the government admits to “shortcomings and problems” and is working hard to alleviate the people’s concerns, especially on the economy. Currency collapse at the centre of crisis The Iranian rial has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, hitting record lows against the US dollar on the open market. It started last year at around 817,000 rials per $1, then sank to 1.42-1.47 million rials on the parallel market by late 2025. Due to the rial’s sharp decline, most Iranians have struggled to keep up with steadily rising prices. The currency has been suffering for years in the face of sanctions and inflationary pressures, going from about 34,000 rials to the US dollar in 2016 to around 270,000 in 2021 and some 430,000 in 2022. By 2023-2024, the rial had crossed the 750,000 mark on the open market, and its depreciation accelerated in 2025. Since 2020, the rial has lost nearly 800 per cent of its value, and as of this week, it trades at around 1.5 million rials to the dollar, severely eroding household purchasing power. As the rial weakened, import costs shot up, feeding inflation and forcing businesses to raise prices. For ordinary Iranians, the falling currency has wiped out savings, reduced purchasing power, and created fear that prices will continue rising. Traders and shopkeepers have been among the first to protest, as they struggle to afford goods amid daily currency swings. Inflation eroding living standards Inflation has remained above 40pc annually, with food and housing costs rising even faster in some areas. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving households with less real income each month. Middle- and lower-income families are increasingly forced to cut back on basic goods. Consumer price inflation remains exceptionally high, with inflation estimated at 30.6pc in 2020 before rising sharply to 43.4pc in 2021 and staying elevated at around 44pc–46pc in both 2022 and 2023. Although inflation eased to about 32.5pc in 2024, it is projected to accelerate again, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting inflation of 42.4pc in 2025 and remaining above 40pc in 2026, underscoring the persistence of price pressures driven by currency weakness and structural constraints. Food costs and staples have grown much faster, with sectoral inflation (such as bread and fruit) substantially outpacing the national rate. The Statistical Centre of Iran reported that food inflation last September reached 58pc, more than double the rate in the same month the previous year. According to the survey, fruit costs have soared 75pc while bread and grains, which are staples in Iranian households, have almost doubled in price. Although the government provides cash handouts and subsidies, including monthly payments, and food staple, electricity, and foreign exchange subsidies, these measures have not offset the impact of rising prices, especially as the value of payments declines alongside the rial. Sanctions and restricted oil revenues Iran’s economy is still severely hampered by international sanctions. US sanctions limit access to the international financial system, banking transactions, and oil exports. Even when Iran is successful in exporting oil, access to hard currency is often restricted, delayed, or held overseas. According to a Reuters survey, Iran’s oil output fell by 100,000 barrels per day in late 2025 due to the sanctions, which directly cut into government revenue. Total exports, oil and non-oil, are forecast to fall by around 16pc to $100 billion in 2025, while imports are expected to fall by roughly 10pc to $98bn, according to the IMF, reflecting tighter foreign exchange and sanctions pressure. In 2025, the IMF projected a 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) decline in both output and exports as of last May. A greater decline of up to half a million bpd has been projected by independent energy analytics companies, including Kpler, Vortexa, and TankerTrackers. As a result, foreign exchange inflows have fallen, and the Central Bank’s capacity to maintain currency stability has been eroded. Additionally, sanctions have hindered trade and discouraged foreign investment, pushing Iran to rely on unofficial routes that raise prices and decrease transparency. Iran’s economy is still largely reliant on oil earnings, which cover a sizable portion of government revenues. In the fiscal year that ended last March, Iran’s Central Bank estimated oil revenues of $67bn. The bank reported oil revenues of $56bn for fiscal 2024, $55bn for 2023, $38bn for 2022, and $23bn for 2021. However, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the export figures vary. In the calendar year 2018, when the first Trump administration tightened sanctions on Iran, oil revenues reached $51bn, according to the EIA. In 2020, they sank to $5bn, before rebounding to $43bn in 2024. Iran’s fiscal position remains under strain, with the government running persistent budget deficits amid constrained revenues and rising spending pressures. According to IMF-based estimates, the budget deficit stood at around 4.1pc of GDP in 2024 and is expected to widen to about 6pc of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025, before remaining elevated at roughly 6.2pc of GDP in 2026. The deterioration reflects limited oil revenue recovery under sanctions, weak non-oil tax collection, and higher outlays on subsidies, wages, and social support, adding to inflationary and currency pressures. In its most recent budget, the government estimated daily oil shipments of 1.85 million barrels per day at $67 per barrel. However, the IMF projected that actual exports would only average 1.1 million barrels per day, showing a significant deficit. GDP, unemployment figures Over the last five years, Iran’s economy has navigated a volatile landscape defined by a modest recovery followed by a recent significant slowdown. After a period of lost growth in the late 2010s, GDP rebounded with growth rates of about 4.1pc in 2021 and 4.4pc in 2022, largely driven by a recovery in oil exports and domestic services following the pandemic. This momentum peaked in 2023 with a 5.3pc expansion, but the trajectory has since cooled considerably. By 2024, growth slowed to roughly 3.7pc, and estimates for 2025 from the IMF and the World Bank suggest a near-stagnant rate of just 0.3pc to 0.6pc. This recent deceleration is attributed to intensified sanctions, chronic inflation (averaging near 40pc), and severe energy shortages that have hampered industrial productivity. While the oil sector remains a primary driver of the nominal economy — which fluctuated between $350bn and $475bn — non-oil sectors continue to struggle under structural constraints and a weakening currency. In addition, the labour market over the last five years has been characterised by a jobless recovery followed by a tightening market amid recent economic stagnation. Official figures showed the total unemployment rate declining from 9.3pc in 2021 to a record low of approximately 7.2pc to 8.2pc by late 2024. Youth unemployment remains a critical challenge, consistently hovering between 20pc and 23pc, nearly triple the national average.

      "summary_orig": "Oil prices fell more than three per cent on Thursday after US President Donald Trump said killings of demonstrators in nationwide protests in Iran were stopping, tempering concerns over military action against Iran and supply disruptions. Brent futures LCOc1 were down $2.19, or 3.3pc, at $64.33 a barrel by 8:45am GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1had slipped $2.07, or 3.34pc, to $59.95 a barrel. Brent futures rose above $66.50 a barrel on Wednesday before giving back most gains after Trump’s remarks reduced expectations of a potential US attack on Iran. Trump turned the oil market mood by saying he had received assurances that killings of demonstrators in Iran had stopped, said PVM analyst John Evans, adding that prices on Thursday reflect the narrative of a near-term future of oversupply. Further weighing on prices, US crude and gasoline inventories rose last week more than analysts had estimated, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Also on the supply side, Venezuela has begun reversing oil production cuts made under a US embargo as crude exports were also resuming, three sources said. On the demand side, OPEC said on Wednesday that oil demand was likely to rise at a similar pace in 2027 as this year and published data indicating a near balance between supply and demand in 2026, contrasting with other forecasts of a major glut. Meanwhile, China’s crude oil imports rose 17pc from a year earlier in December, while total imports in 2025 rose 4.4pc, government data showed, with daily crude import volume hitting all-time highs in December and for all of 2025.",

An accompanying video showed Afridi arriving at the airport in KP, flanked by party members, including his aide Shafiullah Jan. The post added that the chief minister would visit the home of PTI worker Bilal Mehsud, who passed away in the Sohrab Goth area of Karachi, to “offer condolences to the family and express heartfelt sympathy over the tragic incident”. Afridi had already visited Karachi over the weekend, where he rallied PTI’s support base to support the party’s upcoming nationwide street movement. During the visit, the Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue , saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid. The confusion led to unrest and police shelling of supporters who gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah. Afridi, addressing Karachi crowds, had lauded the Sindh public’s warm welcome of him, but lashed out against the provincial government’s treatment of its “guests”, alleging that they had impeded his travelling party on the road from Hyderabad to Karachi.",

      "title_orig": "Trump says killings in Iran have stopped; Tehran reopens airspace after temporary closure",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said Wednesday he had been told the killings of protesters in Iran had been halted, but added that he would “watch it and see” about threatened military action. Trump had repeatedly talked in recent days about coming to the aid of the Iranian people over the crackdown on protests. But in a surprise announcement at the White House, Trump said he had now received assurances from “very important sources on the other side” that Tehran had now stopped, and that executions would not go ahead. “They’ve said the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place — there were supposed to be a lot of executions today and that the executions won’t take place — and we’re going to find out,” Trump said. He offered no details and noted that the United States had yet to verify the claims. Asked by an AFP reporter in the Oval Office if US military action was now off the table, Trump replied: “We’re going to watch it and see what the process is.” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later said there would be “no hanging today or tomorrow”, in an interview with US network Fox News . “I can tell you, I’m confident that there is no plan for hanging,” Araghchi said, also accusing Israel of orchestrating violence. ‘Full control’ But Araghchi said the Iranian government was “in full control” and reported an atmosphere of “calm” after what he called three days of “terrorist operation”. Iran also struck a defiant tone about responding to any US attack, as Washington appeared to draw down staff at a base in Qatar that Tehran targeted in a strike last year. Iran targeted the Al Udeid base in June in retaliation for US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Ali Shamkhani, a senior advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Trump that the strike showed “Iran’s will and capability to respond to any attack”. Fears of possible US military action continued to rile the region. The British government said its embassy in Tehran had been “temporarily closed”, while the US embassy in Saudi Arabia urged staff to exercise caution and avoid military installations. Trump has threatened to intervene militarily in Iran several times since the protest movement that has shaken the country began in late December. Iran’s judiciary chief vowed fast-track trials for those arrested, stoking fears authorities will use capital punishment as a tool of repression. In Tehran, authorities held a funeral for more than 100 security personnel and other “martyrs” killed in the unrest, which officials have branded “acts of terror”. Iran reopens airspace Iran reopened its airspace after a near-five-hour closure amid concerns about possible military action between the US and Iran that forced airlines to cancel, reroute or delay some flights. Iran closed its airspace to all flights except international ones to and from Iran with official permission at 22:15 GMT (3:15am PKT) on Wednesday, according to a notice on the US Federal Aviation Administration website. The notice was removed shortly before 03:00 GMT (8am PKT), according to tracking service Flightradar24 , which showed five flights from Iranian carriers Mahan Air, Yazd Airways and AVA Airlines were among the first to resume over the country. At a similar time last week to the airspace closure there had been dozens of planes in the air over Iran, Flightradar24 said. The United States was withdrawing some personnel from bases in the Middle East, a US official said on Wednesday, after a senior Iranian official said Tehran had warned neighbors it would hit American bases if Washington strikes. Missile and drone barrages in a growing number of conflict zones represent a high risk to airline traffic. Indian airlines among those affected India’s largest airline, IndiGo said some of its international flights would be impacted by Iran’s sudden airspace closure. Air India said its flights were using alternative routes that could result in delays or cancellations. A flight by Russia’s Aeroflot bound for Tehran returned to Moscow after the closure, according to Flightradar24 data. Earlier on Wednesday, Germany issued a new directive cautioning the country’s airlines from entering Iranian airspace, shortly after Lufthansa rejigged its flight operations across the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region. The United States already prohibits all US commercial flights from overflying Iran and there are no direct flights between the countries. Empty airspace over Iran, during a temporary closure of the country’s airspace amid concerns about possible military action between the United States and Iran, in this screengrab obtained from the internet on January 14, 2026. — FlightRadar/Reuters Airline operators like flydubai and Turkish Airlines have canceled multiple flights to Iran in the past week. “Several airlines have already reduced or suspended services, and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” said Safe Airspace, a website run by OPSGROUP, a membership-based organisation that shares flight risk information. “The situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defence, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.” A Ukraine International Airlines jet was downed by Iran’s military in 2020, killing all 176 passengers and crew. Lufthansa said on Wednesday that it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice while it would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman from Wednesday until Monday next week so that crew would not have to stay overnight. Some flights could also be canceled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement. Italian carrier ITA Airways, in which Lufthansa Group is now a major shareholder, said that it would similarly suspend night flights to Tel Aviv until Tuesday next week. ‘Unprecedented level of brutality’ G7 nations said Wednesday they were “deeply alarmed at the high level of reported deaths and injuries” and warned of further sanctions if the crackdown continued. Monitor NetBlocks said Iran’s internet blackout had lasted 156 hours. Amnesty International accused authorities of committing mass unlawful killings “on an unprecedented scale,” citing verified videos and eyewitness accounts. The US-based Institute for the Study of War said authorities were using “an unprecedented level of brutality to suppress protests,” noting reports of protest activity had sharply declined. A senior Iranian official told journalists there had been no new “riots” since Monday, distinguishing them from earlier cost-of-living protests. “Every society can expect protests, but we will not tolerate violence,” he said. Prosecutors have said some detainees will face capital charges of “waging war against God”. State media reported hundreds of arrests and the detention of a foreign national for espionage, without giving details. India tells citizens to leave Iran India’s foreign ministry has urged its citizens to leave Iran, where rights groups say a crackdown on mass protests has killed and arrested thousands of people. India’s foreign ministry estimates there are usually around 10,000 citizens in Iran. “Indian nationals who are currently in Iran (students, pilgrims, business persons and tourists) are advised to leave Iran by available means of transport,” the Indian Embassy in Tehran said, in a post on social media late Wednesday. AI-created Iran protest videos gain traction AI-generated videos purportedly depicting protests in Iran have flooded the web, researchers said Wednesday, as social media users push hyper-realistic deepfakes to fill an information void amid the country’s internet restrictions. US disinformation watchdog NewsGuard said it identified seven AI-generated videos depicting the Iranian protests — created by both pro - and anti-government actors — that have collectively amassed some 3.5 million views across online platforms. Among them was a video shared on the Elon Musk-owned platform X showing women protesters smashing a vehicle belonging to the Basij, the Iranian paramilitary force deployed to suppress the protests. One X post featuring the AI clip, shared by what NewsGuard described as anti-regime users, garnered nearly 720,000 views. Anti-regime X and TikTok users in the United States also posted AI videos depicting Iranian protesters symbolically renaming local streets after President Donald Trump. One such clip shows a protester changing a street sign to “Trump St” while other demonstrators cheer, with an overlaid caption reading: “Iranian protestors are renaming the streets after Trump.” Pro-regime social media users also shared AI videos purportedly showing large-scale pro-government counterprotests throughout the Islamic republic. The AI creations highlight the growing prevalence of what experts call “hallucinated” visual content on social media during major news events, often overshadowing authentic images and videos. In this case, AI creators were filling an information void caused by the internet blackout imposed by the Iranian regime as it sought to suppress demonstrations, experts said. “There’s a lot of news - but no way to get it because of the internet blackout,” said NewsGuard analyst Ines Chomnalez. “Foreign social media users are turning to AI video generators to advance their own narratives about the unfolding chaos.” The fabricated videos were the latest example of AI tools being deployed to distort fast-developing breaking news. AI fabrications, often amplified by partisan actors, have fueled alternate realities around recent news events, including the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and a deadly shooting by immigration agents in Minneapolis. AFP fact-checkers also uncovered misrepresented images that created misleading narratives about the Iranian protests, the largest since the Islamic Republic was proclaimed in 1979. One months-old video purportedly showing demonstrations in Iran was actually filmed in Greece in November 2025, while another claiming to depict a protester tearing down an Iranian flag was filmed in Nepal during last year’s protests that toppled the Himalayan nation’s government.",

The remarks, which came after a high-stakes meeting between US, Danish and Greenlandic officials, indicate that there are still fundamental, if not intractable, differences between how Washington, Copenhagen and Nuuk see the political future of the island. “Greenland is very important for the national security, including of Denmark,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “And the problem is there’s not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there’s everything we can do. You found that out last week with Venezuela ,” he said. After meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Wednesday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt said the US and Denmark would form a working group to discuss a broad array of concerns regarding the island that could meet in the coming weeks. Greenland ‘not for sale’, Copenhagen and Nuuk say But they also made clear that Washington had not budged on its position that it must acquire Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that is strategically located and rich in minerals. Rasmussen and Motzfeldt described such an outcome as an unacceptable breach of sovereignty. “We didn’t manage to change the American position,” Rasmussen told reporters outside the Danish embassy in Washington. “It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland.” Trump has not ruled out taking Greenland by force. Before the two-hour meeting, he argued on social media that Nato would become far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the US. “Anything less than that is unacceptable,” he wrote. In recent weeks, he has frequently repeated longstanding claims that acquiring Greenland is a national security imperative and that Denmark is not capable of warding off Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic region. Greenland and Denmark say the island is not for sale , that threats of force are reckless and security concerns should be resolved among allies. Prominent EU countries have backed Denmark, a member of the Nato alliance. Ahead of the meeting, Greenland and Denmark said they had begun to increase their military presence in and around Greenland in close cooperation with Nato allies, as part of their promise to beef up Arctic defense. Late on Wednesday, a Danish Air Force plane landed at Nuuk airport and personnel in military fatigues disembarked, footage showed. The Danish military will support the preparation of exercise activity, according to the nation’s Joint Arctic Command. Germany, Sweden and Norway have also announced that they would send military personnel to the island. The increased military presence would include a range of exercise activities throughout 2026, according to the Danish defense ministry. Avoiding a Zelensky moment at the White House In their remarks to reporters, Rasmussen and Motzfeldt called the meeting respectful and emphasised that Denmark shared US concerns about Arctic security. But they firmly rejected the idea of the island becoming American. While Trump has at times portrayed the island as besieged by Russian and Chinese ships, Rasmussen rejected that characterisation, saying “it is not a true narrative that we have Chinese warships all around the place.” The meeting presented an opportunity for Copenhagen and Nuuk to de-escalate the crisis and find a diplomatic path to satisfy US demands for more control, analysts said. Noa Redington, an analyst and former political adviser to previous Danish premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt, said concerns were high in Denmark and Greenland that Motzfeldt and Rasmussen could be treated in the same way as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when he suffered a public humiliation in a meeting with Trump — and Vance — at the White House in February 2025. “This is the most important meeting in modern Greenland’s history,” he told Reuters . Denmark and Greenland had originally sought a meeting with Rubio, hoping to have a discussion among top diplomats on resolving the crisis between the two Nato allies. But Denmark’s Rasmussen said Vance had also wanted to participate. European diplomats had said the White House had for months brushed off Denmark’s attempts to engage on Greenland at a high level. Wednesday’s meeting was the first principal-level encounter between US and Danish officials on the issue. Anxiety has been high in Greenland. “I have been sleeping very, very badly, really,” said Liv Aurora Jensen, a craftswoman and designer in Nuuk, right before she watched the Motzfeldt and Rasmussen press conference on television. “I was talking to my sister yesterday and I told her: ‘I’m trying not to get a panic attack.’” ‘We stand with the kingdom’ of Denmark, Greenland says Greenlandic leaders appear to be shifting their approach to handling the diplomatic crisis. Until recently, they were stressing Greenland’s path to independence, but now their public statements put more emphasis on Greenland’s unity with Denmark. “It’s not the time to gamble with our right to self-determination, when another country is talking about taking us over,” Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told Greenland daily Sermitsiaq in an interview published on Wednesday. “That doesn’t mean that we don’t want something in the future. But here and now we are part of the kingdom and we stand with the kingdom,” he said. Motzfeldt had a similar message. “We choose the Greenland we know today as part of the Kingdom of Denmark,” she said in a statement released by the Danish ambassador to the US late on Tuesday. Trump’s desire for Greenland contrasts with Americans’ opposition to annexation of the Arctic island, according to a new poll. Just 17 per cent of Americans approved of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, and substantial majorities of Democrats and Republicans opposed using military force to annex the island, the Reuters/Ipsos poll found. Some 47pc of respondents disapproved of US efforts to acquire Greenland, while 35pc said they were unsure, in the two-day poll which concluded on Tuesday.",

      "summary_orig": "• ‘Bans’ purchase of petrol, diesel vehicles to ‘cut emissions’ • Approval for new fuel pumps linked to installation of EV charging units • S&GAD yet to notify policy • Minister says move part of ‘smog mitigation measures’ LAHORE: The Punjab government on Wednesday announced a complete ban on the purchase of petrol and diesel vehicles across its departments, allowing only electric or hybrid modes of transportation in a move aimed at cutting emissions and accelerating the transition to clean transport. The announcement was made by Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman in a statement issued here. However, it added that vehicles deployed for field duties had been exempted from the restriction. Mr Zaman noted that a comprehensive electric vehicle (EV) policy for the province was expected to be announced shortly. He said the policy would reflect the provincial government’s commitment to environmental protection and the promotion of green energy. New petrol pumps As part of the same initiative, the approval of no-objection certificates (NOCs) for new petrol pumps has been made conditional on the installation of electric vehicle charging units. “No new petrol pump will be allowed to operate without EV charging facilities,” the chief secretary stated. The statement added that NOCs had already been issued through the e-Biz Portal for 170 new petrol pumps across 31 cities in Punjab, all of which are required to install EV charging units. These include 29 petrol pumps in Faisalabad, 14 in Lahore, 10 in Bahawalpur, nine each in Khanewal and Bahawalnagar, eight each in Rawalpindi and Jhang, and seven each in Toba Tek Singh, Mianwali, Kasur, and Chiniot. However, the chief secretary did not respond to a question on whether the policy decision banning the purchase of petrol and diesel vehicles was taken at any formal forum or was merely a statement. S&GAD yet to notify move It is learnt that no notification regarding the policy change banning the procurement of petrol and diesel vehicles and promoting the procurement of electric and hybrid vehicles has been issued by the Services and General Administration Department (S&GAD). When contacted, an S&GAD Transport Wing official told Dawn that the department had neither received any formal approval for the change in policy nor issued any notification in this regard. Answering a question, the official said discussions on shifting to electric and hybrid vehicles had been underway in the department for quite some time, in line with environmental and climate change initiatives. The official added that the policy would take effect once formal approval is granted by the chief minister following the required process. The S&GAD would then issue a formal notification to launch the new policy. ‘Combating smog’ During a meeting with American business leaders, Senior Punjab Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the provincial government would now purchase only hybrid and electric vehicles as part of its smog mitigation measures. “The government has decided to replace petrol vehicles in the official fleet with hybrid and electric vehicles,” she said. According to a statement, the US delegation was given a comprehensive briefing on Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s vision and policy initiatives. It added that the American business leaders commended CM Maryam’s governance reforms and environmental policies. They were informed about the provincial government’s policies and enforcement measures related to the shift towards electric and hybrid transport, brick kiln mechanisation, e-transport, official use of super seeders, and other practical reforms. “For the first time, sectoral-level anti-smog measures have been introduced in Lahore, with the Planning and Development Department designated as the central policy hub,” Ms Aurangzeb said, adding that the city’s air quality had shown marked improvement. To combat smog, she said, 41 monitoring stations had been installed, with the number set to reach 100 by June. The minister added that surveillance was being carried out through drones and thermal cameras. “A Smog War Room is monitoring industries, brick kilns, and vehicles around the clock, while Punjab Climate Watch is fully operational.” The minister told the delegation that to control crop burning, 5,000 super seeders had been provided to farmers at a 60 per cent subsidy. “A Nasa [US space agency] report has confirmed a 60 per cent reduction in smog levels.,” she said. She further said 1,000 e-buses had been added across Punjab, with a decision taken to procure an additional 10,000 this year. Published in Dawn, January 15th, 2026",

The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) held a meeting in the federal capital under the chairmanship of Mahm­ood Khan Achakzai, wherein the participants expressed concerns over the deteriorating regional situation. The participants urged the government to call an urgent joint session of parliament to form a national policy through collective wisdom. They claimed that the international order was changing: the Israeli aggr­ession in Palestine and the conduct of the United States in Latin America have severely undermined international law. They observed that imperial and colonial powers were tightening their grip around Pakistan’s neighbouring country, Iran, while the western media was creating an environment that could be used as a pretext to undermine Iran’s sovereignty. The TTAP proposed that in view of the seriousness of the potential crisis and its possible impact on the region, the government should also convene a meeting of neighbouring countries to develop a joint and coordinated strategy to address these challenges. PTI slams action against Adiala protesters Meanwhile, the PTI denounced the use of force by the Rawalpindi police to disperse its sit-in outside Adiala jail on Tuesday night. The police, in a midnight operation, had used force to disperse the participants. In a statement, the PTI said these actions constituted a grave assault on the Constitution, the rule of law and fundamental human rights, and reflected a systematic campaign of political victimisation designed to silence dissent. The party vowed that such conduct was unacceptable in any democratic society and would be vigorously challenged at every constitutional, legal and democratic forum. The party claimed that family members of Imran Khan and party workers were present outside the jail to exercise their constitutional and legal right to meet their incarcerated leader, but the police suppressed this activity using force, intimidation and harassment. “Peaceful party leaders and workers, along with Imran Khan’s sisters, were subjected to baton charges, manhandling and abuse. As a result of this inhumane operation, 11 male party workers were detained at the Rawat police station, while three women—Zulekha, Dr Asma and Sanaiya Safeer—remained in the custody of Rawalpindi Police,” it claimed. Similarly, the PTI stated that Advocate Raja Yasir, Adil, and Tanveer were also arrested. Furthermore, the party stated that the Raw­alpindi police established checkpoints near Bahria Town, where citizens returning from Adiala were subjected to searches, with mobile phones snatched, women’s vehicles seized, and the windows of several cars smashed. The PTI alleged that the citizens were coerced into paying money to recover their mobile phones and vehicles from the police, while those who refused to pay bribes had their vehicles confiscated.

      "summary_orig": "• Washington withdraws staff from Middle East bases; diplomatic contact cut off • Tehran threatens retaliation; informs Qatar, Saudi Arabia, others • Riyadh assures it won’t allow its territory to be used against Iran WASHINGTON: Tensions flared across the Middle East on Wednesday as the US began withdrawing personnel from crucial bases in the region, while Tehran warned that it would retaliate against American bases in the Gulf, if Washington initiated an attack. The catalyst for the showdown is the violent protests within Iran. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters, declaring in a Tuesday interview that “help is on the way” and vowing “very strong action” if executions of demonstrators continue. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said in a press conference late on Wednesday night he had been told that killings in Iran’s crackdown on nationwide protests were subsiding and that he believed there was currently no plan for large-scale executions. The New York Times also reported that the Pentagon is considering a broader array of strike options than previously disclosed, potentially targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities and ballistic missile sites. European officials also cautioned that an American strike could be imminent. “All the signals are that a US attack is imminent, but that is also how this administration behaves to keep everyone on their toes. Unpredictability is part of the strategy,” a Western military official said. Meanwhile, a senior Iranian official said regional countries — including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey — had been informed that American bases within their borders will be targeted if the US strikes Iran. Direct contact between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff have also been suspended, the official added. As of Wednesday, Britain was also withdrawing some personnel from an air base in Qatar, according to British media reports, though the defence ministry in London offered no immediate comment. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was pulling some personnel from bases in the region as a precautionary measure given the heightened friction. Qatar confirmed that drawdowns from its Al Udeid air base, the largest US military hub in the Middle East, were “being undertaken in response to the current regional tensions.” Facing the threat of regional crossfire, Saudi Arabia moved to insulate itself. Two sources close to the kingdom’s government said Riyadh explicitly informed Iran that it would not permit its territory to be used for offensive operations.

      "summary_en": "• Washington withdraws staff from Middle East bases; diplomatic contact cut off • Tehran threatens retaliation; informs Qatar, Saudi Arabia, others • Riyadh assures it won’t allow its territory to be used against Iran WASHINGTON: Tensions flared across the Middle East on Wednesday as the US began withdrawing personnel from crucial bases in the region, while Tehran warned that it would retaliate against American bases in the Gulf, if Washington initiated an attack. The catalyst for the showdown is the violent protests within Iran. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters, declaring in a Tuesday interview that “help is on the way” and vowing “very strong action” if executions of demonstrators continue. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said in a press conference late on Wednesday night he had been told that killings in Iran’s crackdown on nationwide protests were subsiding and that he believed there was currently no plan for large-scale executions. The New York Times also reported that the Pentagon is considering a broader array of strike options than previously disclosed, potentially targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities and ballistic missile sites. European officials also cautioned that an American strike could be imminent. “All the signals are that a US attack is imminent, but that is also how this administration behaves to keep everyone on their toes. Unpredictability is part of the strategy,” a Western military official said. Meanwhile, a senior Iranian official said regional countries — including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey — had been informed that American bases within their borders will be targeted if the US strikes Iran. Direct contact between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff have also been suspended, the official added. As of Wednesday, Britain was also withdrawing some personnel from an air base in Qatar, according to British media reports, though the defence ministry in London offered no immediate comment. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was pulling some personnel from bases in the region as a precautionary measure given the heightened friction.

      "title": "US says ‘phase two’ of Gaza plan beginning with goal of Hamas demilitarisation",
      "summary": "United States President Donald Trump’s envoy said on Wednesday that a ceasefire plan for Gaza was now entering its second phase with the goal of disarming Hamas, despite several Israeli strikes in the Palestinian territory during the truce that became effective in October last year . “We are announcing the launch of phase two of the president’s 20-Point plan to End the Gaza conflict, moving from ceasefire to demilitarisation, technocratic governance, and reconstruction,” envoy Steve Witkoff wrote on X. The second phase will also include the setup of a 15-person Palestinian technocratic committee to administer postwar Gaza. Its formation was announced earlier on Wednesday by Egypt, a close US ally and mediator. Phase two “begins the full demilitarisation and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorised personnel”. “The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations, including the immediate return of the final deceased hostage. Failure to do so will bring serious consequences,” Witkoff said.",
