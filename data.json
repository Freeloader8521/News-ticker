      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The death toll from Karachi’s Gul Plaza inferno rose to 14 on Monday as eight more bodies were recovered and firefighting efforts resumed after flames re-emerged from the smouldering debris. The fire , which erupted on Saturday night at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road, was finally doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday. A search operation was initiated amid fears of further casualties. Officials initially suspected an electrical short circuit, but said the cause has yet to be confirmed. According to South DIG Syed Asad Raza, 14 bodies have been recovered so far by rescue personnel from the now-gutted shopping plaza. “Fire safety operation has been completed. Cooling process has now started with the removal of debris from the site by KMC, TMC and Pakistan Navy personnel,” said the DIG. Separately, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that so far, five bodies have been brought to the Civil Hospital Karachi. South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khosa said the cooling process is ongoing, while Fire Officer Zafar Khan stated that 90pc of the blaze has been brought under control, although “flames are still present in the inner market”. “Two outer sections of the building have collapsed, and the internal structure is also damaged. Even after the fire is extinguished, the search operation will be conducted with extreme caution,” said the fire official. Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Dr Abid Jalal said that firefighting efforts restarted from the Rimpa Plaza side, as flames continue to emerge from the smouldering debris. Scores missing The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625. Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site of the incident on Monday, spoke to the media and said that “more than 70 people” remained missing. “The reports of more than 70 missing persons are extremely alarming and constitute a major tragedy,” said the governor, adding that the incident has now “turned into a national tragedy”. “Information about a pregnant woman being trapped inside is extremely concerning,” he said. He further stated that while determining the cause of the fire is necessary, the priority for now is to save lives. “I am in constant contact with three major builders of the city for the restoration of the market,” he added, elaborating on efforts to provide relief to traders. Tessori vowed to “stand with the affected people” until their losses are fully compensated. Meanwhile, Gul Plaza Traders Association President Tanveer Pasta said over 40 shopkeepers and salespersons were among those missing in the wake of the incident. Traffic police announce alternate routes In an advisory by the Karachi Traffic Police, the portion of M.A. Jinnah Road from Tibet Centre to Garden Chowk is closed to traffic due to ongoing rescue and recovery operations at Gul Plaza. The traffic police advised that commuters heading towards Tower from Numaish should turn right at Capri and proceed via Saddar Dawakhana, Empress Market, Regal, Burns Road, or Fresco Chowk, then take the route from Dilpasand to M.A. Jinnah Road to reach Tower. Commuters heading towards M.A. Jinnah Road or Mazar-i-Quaid from Fresco Chowk should continue straight towards Regal Market, turn right at Empress Market towards Frere Chowk, and then proceed to M.A. Jinnah Road. A traffic plan for alternate routes. — Karachi Traffic Police ‘Heartbroken’ United Kingdom’s High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriot said she was “heartbroken” by the tragic fire at the shopping plaza. “May strength be with the community at this time,” she said. The German Consulate in Karachi, in a post on X, said the incident at Gul Plaza was deeply saddening. “Our thoughts & prayers are with the victims, their families, and those injured.” ‘Delayed response’ The terrifying fire that erupted at Gul Plaza on Saturday night could have been contained sooner, but the delayed response and limited resources from the authorities allowed the blaze to rage unchecked for hours. Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday. Shopkeepers at the site told Dawn that if the firefighting team had arrived with full force and resources, the scene would probably look very different. One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken. A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation. People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side. Additional input by Asim Khan",

Seven members of the phishing ring, including its call center manager, were apprehended and six of them have been put under arrest, according to the Seoul Seodaemun Police Station. The suspects are accused of inducing money withdrawals from 38 victims by impersonating Financial Supervisory Service or prosecution officials between June and October last year. Most of the victims were deceived into believing that their bank accounts were used for fraud and sent money to the scammers, the police said. The police launched an investigation in August last year after receiving intelligence on the phishing ring. The call center manager in his 40s came to visit Korea and was apprehended before departure at Incheon International Airport last October, the police said, adding six other suspects who worked under the manager were detained later.",

      "summary_orig": "— Courtesy China Daily WHEN the United States attacks another country, it doesn’t just send in troops or launch missiles. It starts with language. What we’re seeing in Venezuela is not random messaging, but a well-designed narrative system — built around three basic steps and repeated through a set of familiar rhetorical tricks. And once you understand how this system works, you start noticing the same pattern again and again. The first step is disguise. Change what an action is called, and you change how it is judged. So the United States did not refer to its action in Venezuela as an “invasion”. In fact, it did not speak the language of war at all. Instead, it talked about “capture”, “arrest” and “joint operations with law enforcement”. All of these terms are synonymous with domestic policing and not war. The effect is powerful. Once it is able to make its action look like law enforcement, questions of sovereignty or the United Nations Charter quietly fade out from the conversation. The violence the US has unleashed is further neutralised through technical language. So, bombing becomes a “precision strike”, invasion becomes an “operation” and the civilian harm it caused is downgraded to “collateral damage”. Such wording does more than soften the blow, presenting war as a form of technical management — something orderly, controlled, almost bureaucratic. At the same time, the targeted state itself is personalised. A country is reduced to a single leader; sovereignty, institutions and the population fade into the background. Once a state is thus reduced to just one individual, regime change can easily be sold as criminal justice rather than aggression. The second step is redirection. If attention is diverted elsewhere, legality becomes irrelevant. This is why so much emphasis is placed on elite units and footage of “dramatic raids”. Command rooms, night-vision images and special forces narratives dominate coverage. The audience is encouraged to admire competence and efficiency. The more impressive the operation looks, the less space there is to ask whether it should have happened at all. Tactical success is then used to conceal strategic violence. A fast, “clean” operation is praised as restrained and responsible, although it says nothing about long-term consequences — regional instability, civilian suffering, economic collapse or endless cycles of intervention. Winning the scene replaces winning the peace. Public debate is carefully redirected toward procedure rather than substance. Media discussions fixate on whether Congress was informed or whether the timing was appropriate. These arguments divert attention from the core issue — who authorised the US to use force across its borders in the first place. Cause and effect are then quietly reversed. Interference came first, but the story is told backwards, as if instability demanded interference, rather than interference leading to instability. History is edited to make aggression appear inevitable. The third step is erasure. Control memory, and you control moral judgment. Latin America is not a new story. The US has interfered there more than 40 times. But that history is wiped clean. Each action is presented as exceptional, as if it has no connection to what came before. And before the public can fully process what happened in Venezuela, new headlines — Trump talking about occupying Greenland within two months, or news about military deployments aimed at Iran — appear. Attention shifts. Venezuela fades. Accountability never arrives. Even imagery is carefully controlled. The public is shown pictures of Nicolas Maduro — poorly dressed, exhausted, humiliated. What is not shown is the brutal process behind those images: the killing of dozens of Cuban bodyguards who died protecting him, and the violence of the raid itself. The focus stays on spectacle, not cost. When invasion is reframed as governance, and war becomes routine administration, the most dangerous transformation has already occurred. It doesn’t happen on the battlefield. It is all in the wording. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LOWER DIR/BAJAUR: Jamaat-i-Islami Khyber Pakhtunkhwa North chief Inayatullah Khan on Sunday warned that the flour crisis in the province was worsening, with prices rising almost daily, and urged both the federal and provincial governments to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. Speaking to reporters after congratulating the newly-elected cabinet of the Timergara Press Club, Mr Khan alleged that trucks carrying flour were being stopped at Attock and bribes demanded, leading to severe shortages in Lower Dir and parts of KP, where a 40kg bag of flour was being sold for as much as Rs6,000. He said the situation amounted to a clear violation of Article 151 of the Constitution, which guarantees free trade among provinces, adding that despite Khyber Pakhtunkhwa being an integral part of Pakistan, the federal government was treating the province unfairly. He also criticised the provincial government for ‘failing to fulfill its constitutional and moral responsibilities’. Responding to a question, Mr Khan said military operations were underway in various parts of the province, but stressed that the growing insecurity must be curbed immediately as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa could not afford further loss of lives. He said instead of military operations, the capacity of police and other civilian institutions be upgraded to cope with the menace of terrorism. Inayat says capacity of police should be enhanced instead of conducting military operations Meanwhile, talking to reporters at the residence of party’s leader Maulana Wahid Gul in Khar area of Bajaur, Inayatullah Khan called for resolving the unrest in the merged districts through dialogue rather than military operations. He expressed sympathies with the family of the JI leader over the Friday night’s bombing targeting his house, and said his party had long held the ‘principled stance’ that issue of law and order in the tribal districts must be resolved through peaceful means, not by use of force. The JI leader alleged that military operations in the tribal districts were not only causing destruction and unrest but also adversely affecting the socioeconomic conditions of residents. Responding to a question, the JI leader said their party was in favour of dialogue on all issues, whether they pertained to security or internal political conflicts. Condemning the bombing at Wahid Gul’s residence, the Jamaat’s provincial chief called it a cowardly act, stating that such incidents were unacceptable and were intended to silence the voices of peace. He stated that the relevant authorities must immediately arrest those responsible for the attack. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

Inayat says capacity of police should be enhanced instead of conducting military operations Meanwhile, talking to reporters at the residence of party’s leader Maulana Wahid Gul in Khar area of Bajaur, Inayatullah Khan called for resolving the unrest in the merged districts through dialogue rather than military operations. He expressed sympathies with the family of the JI leader over the Friday night’s bombing targeting his house, and said his party had long held the ‘principled stance’ that issue of law and order in the tribal districts must be resolved through peaceful means, not by use of force. The JI leader alleged that military operations in the tribal districts were not only causing destruction and unrest but also adversely affecting the socioeconomic conditions of residents. Responding to a question, the JI leader said their party was in favour of dialogue on all issues, whether they pertained to security or internal political conflicts. Condemning the bombing at Wahid Gul’s residence, the Jamaat’s provincial chief called it a cowardly act, stating that such incidents were unacceptable and were intended to silence the voices of peace. He stated that the relevant authorities must immediately arrest those responsible for the attack. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

      "summary": "LOWER DIR/BAJAUR: Jamaat-i-Islami Khyber Pakhtunkhwa North chief Inayatullah Khan on Sunday warned that the flour crisis in the province was worsening, with prices rising almost daily, and urged both the federal and provincial governments to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. Speaking to reporters after congratulating the newly-elected cabinet of the Timergara Press Club, Mr Khan alleged that trucks carrying flour were being stopped at Attock and bribes demanded, leading to severe shortages in Lower Dir and parts of KP, where a 40kg bag of flour was being sold for as much as Rs6,000. He said the situation amounted to a clear violation of Article 151 of the Constitution, which guarantees free trade among provinces, adding that despite Khyber Pakhtunkhwa being an integral part of Pakistan, the federal government was treating the province unfairly. He also criticised the provincial government for ‘failing to fulfill its constitutional and moral responsibilities’. Responding to a question, Mr Khan said military operations were underway in various parts of the province, but stressed that the growing insecurity must be curbed immediately as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa could not afford further loss of lives.

      "summary_orig": "THERE is no doubt President Donald Trump has shaken up the world order by his disruptive and unilateral policies. From upending the global trading system to launching military attacks in the Western Hemisphere and beyond, he has shown contempt for international law and the sovereignty of other nations. For someone who vowed to end wars and not start new ones, his aggressive actions and rhetoric suggest the contrary. Trump’s ‘America First’ foreign policy means riding roughshod over others. His deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, aptly described the Trumpian worldview when he poured scorn on a “rules-based system” and declared: “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.” That means the exercise and projection of raw American power, whatever the consequences. What kind of world is emerging from this? To be sure, Trump is acting in an environment already characterised by a fragmenting global order and increasing disregard for international rules and norms by other big and regional powers. The use of hard power by countries has become all too frequent in pursuit of a ‘might is right’ approach. Trump is reinforcing or sharpening these trends and pushing the world into a Hobbesian state of lawlessness. Today, the world has increasingly become one ruled by impunity. In a speech to the General Assembly over a year ago, UN Secretary General António Guterres said the world had entered “the age of impunity”. He was prompted to say this by the Israeli aggression and desperate situation in Gaza but he was also referring to the growing number of countries acting this way. “They can invade another country, lay waste to whole societies” and “thumb their nose at international law”, he said, pointing to the fact that this “age of impunity” is everywhere. He is, of course, right. This era of impunity is reflected not just in the US assault on Venezuela and bombing of Iran but the genocide carried out by Israel in Gaza, its military attacks on neighbouring countries, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and India’s military strikes against Pakistan. None of these powers thought their actions entailed much cost and they faced no international accountability. Countries have to navigate a no-rules world amid great uncertainty and volatility. If international institutions were designed to deter and check such behaviour that isn’t happening in today’s no-rules world. Multilateralism and multilateral organisations have been under stress for well over a decade. But the attitude of big powers, especially Trump’s conduct, has accelerated this trend and magnified the pressure. The UN’s paralysis and ineffectiveness are evident from its failure to stop the genocide in Gaza, the war in Ukraine and end other conflicts, such as in Sudan. Its growing irrelevance is laid bare by its role as a bystander in wars and crises, unable to perform its core responsibility, albeit due to big power politics and clashing interests. The result is a loss of faith in multilateralism with trust in global institutions at a record low. The recent withdrawal by the US from 66 international organisations including 31 UN entities is another setback for the multilateral system and will further weaken it. The world has now entered an era of a ‘new great game’ which involves intense resource tussles between the big powers. It is reflected in the competition between the US and China over rare earths and critical minerals essential for semi-conductor and defence industries. In this regard, the US under Trump is trying to catch up with China, which has built a virtual monopoly, having made strategic investments in these sectors over decades, including in Africa. China has a near-monopoly in the extraction and processing capacity of rare earth minerals, which are used in electronics, electric cars and military weapon systems including fighter jets. Last year, it used its leverage in the rare earth elements global supply chain to push back against US tariffs. Beijing imposed restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals which forced Washington, faced with an industrial shutdown, to back off and lower tariffs. The Trump administration is now frenetically seeking to reduce its dependence on China by developing alternative sources of supply. It is hosting G7 ministers this week to discuss this. It struck a minerals deal with the Democratic Republic of Congo, which sought US mediation for a peace accord with Rwanda. Washington also signed a mineral resources agreement for joint investment with Ukraine. Of course, the resource battle is not limited to minerals even if that is an important new front. It rages over oil, as Trump’s action in Venezuela shows, over technology and other vital commodities. It is a throwback to the past when colonial powers competed for resources and occupied countries to pillage their resources. What some analysts have called America’s “resource imperialism” has familiar echoes of the past. The Middle East continues to figure as a region of conflict and volatility that is consequential for international peace and security. Beyond Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has temporarily paused under Trump’s peace plan, the region is witnessing a high-stakes contest for regional dominance. But instead of the old confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the Middle East is facing tensions between Gulf states who are competing on many fronts and are engaged in proxy wars to establish their regional ascendancy. The rivalry between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates erupted into the open over Yemen. The two countries back different sides in Sudan and have divergent interests in Libya and Syria. UAE’s close ties with Israel adds another dimension to the geopolitical competition. The US shift in policy priority to China and disengagement from the Middle East over the years created a power vacuum that Gulf states are trying to fill in their contest for influence. The KSA-UAE power struggle is, above all, about who will become the main trade and investment hub. KSA is now planning a military coalition with Egypt and Somalia to contain UAE’s regional power. Their rivalry is destabilising for the region and compounds its challenges. With geopolitical tensions and geoeconomic confrontation intensifying across the globe this points to a disordered world. It challenges countries to navigate a rule-less terrain in an environment of great uncertainty and volatility. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.

      "summary_orig": "THOUGH reports of fissures within the Afghan Taliban are not new, a recent BBC story has detailed some of the major differences that exist between the so-called Kandahar and Kabul factions of Afghanistan’s ruling set-up. The former grouping is seen as loyal to the edicts of Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, while the faction in the Afghan capital is led by the likes of Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Yaqoob. As per the BBC , a leaked audio recording reportedly of Mullah Akhundzada dating back to January 2025 warned against divisions within Taliban ranks, with the hard-line movement’s supremo asserting that differences could lead to the emirate’s “collapse”. Taliban leaders, however, have downplayed the divisions, describing them as differences of opinion within a family. One incident cited by the official British outlet as evidence of divergences between Kabul and Kandahar was last year’s internet shutdown , ordered by Mullah Akhundzada. Within days of the edict, Afghanistan was back online, as the Kabul faction apparently defied their leader and had the internet restored. Differences among the Taliban are natural; the movement has various power centres. While Mullah Akhundzada may reign supreme, Siraj Haqqani has considerable power, being the scion of veteran Mujahideen commander Jalaluddin Haqqani. Mullah Yaqoob, son of ex-supremo Mullah Omar, also has a significant following, particularly amongst younger Afghans. Whereas Mullah Akhundzada is based in his Kandahar redoubt, living a near medieval life, the Kabul leaders are relatively urbane men, hobnobbing with global leaders in the Gulf, Russia, China, etc. The latter faction knows that Afghanistan cannot prosper without shedding some of the rigid curbs ordered by the supreme leader. The Kabul leaders are hardly progressive but they do hold relatively more moderate views compared to Mullah Akhundzada and his inner circle. In the current context, this may be the best bet to reintegrate the country with the rest of the world. For example, the Kabul grouping reportedly favours education for girls beyond primary school, and some members of this faction have previously been disciplined for their views. While major internal strife among the Taliban is unlikely, it is possible that the Kabul leaders may try to further assert themselves to implement more ‘pragmatic’ polices, without rocking the boat, thus giving Afghans a little more freedom. They should also revisit the policy of hosting foreign terrorist groups, including the banned TTP, and impress upon Mullah Akhundzada that cross-border attacks by these groups on Pakistan and other neighbours will further isolate Afghanistan. Although a ‘Kabul Spring’ is hardly in the offing, limited change in Afghanistan could be in the air. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

Taliban leaders, however, have downplayed the divisions, describing them as differences of opinion within a family. One incident cited by the official British outlet as evidence of divergences between Kabul and Kandahar was last year’s internet shutdown , ordered by Mullah Akhundzada. Within days of the edict, Afghanistan was back online, as the Kabul faction apparently defied their leader and had the internet restored. Differences among the Taliban are natural; the movement has various power centres. While Mullah Akhundzada may reign supreme, Siraj Haqqani has considerable power, being the scion of veteran Mujahideen commander Jalaluddin Haqqani. Mullah Yaqoob, son of ex-supremo Mullah Omar, also has a significant following, particularly amongst younger Afghans. Whereas Mullah Akhundzada is based in his Kandahar redoubt, living a near medieval life, the Kabul leaders are relatively urbane men, hobnobbing with global leaders in the Gulf, Russia, China, etc. The latter faction knows that Afghanistan cannot prosper without shedding some of the rigid curbs ordered by the supreme leader. The Kabul leaders are hardly progressive but they do hold relatively more moderate views compared to Mullah Akhundzada and his inner circle. In the current context, this may be the best bet to reintegrate the country with the rest of the world. For example, the Kabul grouping reportedly favours education for girls beyond primary school, and some members of this faction have previously been disciplined for their views. While major internal strife among the Taliban is unlikely, it is possible that the Kabul leaders may try to further assert themselves to implement more ‘pragmatic’ polices, without rocking the boat, thus giving Afghans a little more freedom. They should also revisit the policy of hosting foreign terrorist groups, including the banned TTP, and impress upon Mullah Akhundzada that cross-border attacks by these groups on Pakistan and other neighbours will further isolate Afghanistan. Although a ‘Kabul Spring’ is hardly in the offing, limited change in Afghanistan could be in the air. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "PROTESTERS scuffle with an ICE supporter who was in downtown for ‘Americans Against Islamification’ rally.—AFP WASHINGTON: The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota, the site of large protests against the government’s deportation drive, two US officials told Reuters on Sunday. The army placed the units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence in the midwestern state escalates, the officials said, though it is not clear whether any of them will be sent. President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to use the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces if officials in the state do not stop protesters from targeting immigration officials after a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. But if the troops are deployed, it is unclear whether the Trump administration would invoke the Insurrection Act. Army places units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence escalates Even without invoking the act, a president can deploy active-duty forces for certain domestic purposes such as protecting federal property, which Trump cited as a justification for sending Marines to Los Angeles last year. In addition to the active-duty forces, the Pentagon could also attempt to deploy newly created National Guard rapid-response forces for civil disturbances. The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on the order, which was first reported by ABC News. Trump’s threat “If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. The soldiers subject to deployment specialise in cold-weather operations and are assigned to two US Army infantry battalions under the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, the officials said.

Trump said he would impose an additional 10pc import tariffs from Feb 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, which will rise to 25pc on June 1 if no deal is reached. “Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now — and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring,” Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmied-ing said, expecting the euro could come under pressure when Asian trade begins. “The US-EU trade war is back,” said Tina Fordham, strategist and Fordham Global Foresight founder. On Sunday, European leaders slammed the tariff threat over their opposition to his designs on Greenland, warning transatlantic ties were at risk. “Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden warned in a joint statement. An extraordinary meeting of its ambassadors was called in Brussels on Sunday by the EU, which clinched a deal with Washington in July for most EU exports to face a 15pc US levy. France’s President Emmanuel Macron will ask the EU to activate a never-before-used “anti-coercion instrument” against the US if Trump makes good on his tariff threat, Macron’s aides said. Even Trump’s European allies baulked at the threat. Italy’s far-right Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, called the threatened tariffs a ‘mistake’. “I believe that imposing new sanctions today would be a mistake,” she said during her Seoul trip. Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel called Trump’s threat an “inexplicable” form of “blackmail”. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was planning to discuss the situation with Trump “at the earliest opportunity”, UK culture minister Lisa Nandy told the BBC , calling the president’s tariff threat “wrong”. “We believe it’s deeply unhelpful, and we believe it’s counterproductive, and the prime minister has not shied away from making that clear,” she said. Trade war fear France’s Agricultural Minister Annie Genevard warned that tariffs would hurt Washington, too. “In this escalation of tariffs, (Trump) has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists,” she told broadcasters Europe 1 and CNews.

According to Regional Police Officer (RPO) Bahawalpur Ghazi Muhammad Salahuddin, Rahim Yar Khan police had cordoned off Kacha Rajwani, with contingents from Rajanpur (Punjab) and Ghotki (Sindh) taking part. Sindh police and Rangers were also conducting action in adjoining riverine areas. He said 1,700 police personnel had been deployed along with eight drone teams, six bulletproof vehicles and three armoured personnel carriers. Modern technology was being used to ensure effective progress and restore law and order in the area, he said, adding that police were conducting action against criminal elements under a coordinated and well-planned strategy. The RPO clarified that suspects who renounce criminal activities and voluntarily surrender to the police would not be engaged in encounters and would be produced before the courts in accordance with the law. However, criminals have been strictly warned to lay down their arms and surrender. He further emphasised that the operation would continue until the writ of the government was fully established in the riverine areas. District Police Officer (DPO) Rahim Yar Khan Irfan Ali Samo stated that action against criminals was ongoing and that ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the public remained the top priority. According to details, police with a heavy contingent and full combat equipment have launched a decisive operation against bandits after cordoning off the areas of Machka and Kacha Rajwani. Earlier this month, the Sindh government announced a “massive” operation against dacoits in the katcha areas of the province, vowing to eliminate them through the use of state force. Speaking to reporters after presiding over a high-level meeting on the law and order situation in the Sukkur and Larkana ranges, Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said it had been decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”. “We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits you see on social media,” he said, adding that special focus would be placed on Sukkur and Larkana. Mr Lanjar stressed that dacoits would be given a chance to lay down their arms and join the national mainstream. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them. There will be a fight and they will be eliminated through the use of state force,” he warned. The home minister thanked the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation in which a no-go katcha area was vaca­ted. He said individuals kidnapped from Sindh were recovered from Punjab with the full cooperation of the Rangers and other security agencies. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP) has demanded an “independent probe” into the alleged rigging in the February 8, 2024, election and “punishment for those responsible for it under Article 6 of the Constitution”, as they held an All Parties Conference (APC) in Karachi on Sunday. The TTAP delegation, led by the chairperson and the newly-appointed opposition leader in the National Assembly, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, has arrived in Sindh for four days . The visit is part of the mobilisation efforts for a nationwide ‘street movement’ called by the PTI, scheduled for February 8. TTAP members also announced observing “Black Day” and nationwide strike on Feb 8, to commemorate the second anniversary of the last general elections in Pakistan, which they claimed were rigged. According to the TTAP’s manifesto, “Democracy rests on the foundation of transparent elections; therefore, restoring public trust in the transfer of power is possible only through fair elections.” The manifesto demanded “the immediate appointment of an impartial chief election commissioner and the holding of transparent elections under a new election commission.” It further called for an independent investigation into the alleged rigging in the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, the identification of those responsible, and their punishment under Article 6 of the Constitution, which corresponds to high treason. “Through the 26th and 27th constitutional amendments , the independence of the judiciary has been undermined by keeping the sword of judges’ transfers hanging over their heads,” it said. “Conscientious judges, including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza, have been sidelined.” “The TTAP manifesto said it “strongly condemned” the recent actions against Justice Tariq Jahangiri , terming his disqualification the “latest example of an attack on the judiciary”. It further condemned the “false cases and convictions” against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife. “TTAP demands the immediate release of all political prisoners, including former prime minister Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Mian Mahmood ur Rashid, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Hassan Niazi, Ali Wazir, Haji Abdul Samad, Wali Mohmand, Dr Mahrang Baloch, and the detainees of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee,” the manifesto said. Moreover, it called for an end to restrictions on meetings of party leaders and family with Imran. Referring to the PECA law , the manifesto termed it a move to “silence critical voices and curtail media freedom”. It labelled the legislation as “black law” and demanded its “immediate revocation”. During the APC, members slammed the “economic exploitation” of media networks, including Dawn TV , by imposing an advertisement ban. The manifesto also demanded that the ongoing military operation in the Tirah Valley be “stopped immediately”, urging that the “federal government should take the provincial government into confidence on all matters”. “All issues with Afghanistan should be resolved diplomatically,” the manifesto read, further asking the “unanimous demands” of the Jirga held in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly be immediately accepted. ‘Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if provinces get their rights’ Speaking to the APC, TTAP chief Achakzai said, “Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if the provinces get their rights. “We have to understand the problems of every province.” “Come, let’s save our country,” Achakzai said, adding, “If you call the people of Waziristan and tell them that it is [Pakistan] your country, the terrorism will end.” He alleged that the mandate of 25 million people was stolen in the Feb 8 elections. “We have to come out on Feb 8 to protest peacefully,” he added, saying, “people will have to be united.” ‘90 per cent of people are in favour of Imran Khan’ Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) head and nominated leader of opposition in the Senate, Allama Raja Nasir, said, “90 per cent of people in Pakistan are in favour of Imran Khan.” “Despite keeping Imran in jail, they couldn’t keep people away from him. Only the public can pull Pakistan out of this turmoil,” he said. Abbas also urged people to take to the streets and join the peaceful protest on Feb 8. “If people come out on Feb 8, we will see a big difference on Feb 9.” ‘Over 200 FIRs and over two years in jail’ Former NA speaker Asad Qaiser said that Imran had been in jail for two years, and over 200 first information reports (FIRs) had been registered against him. “His wife and nephew are also in jail,” Qaiser said, adding that the PTI founder had always opted for a life of struggle over lavishness. “Despite problems, he [Imran Khan] stood firm and resolute.” The ex-speaker said that Imran’s perspective was centred around human rights; therefore, he “will never compromise.” He further stated that Imran had denied vengeance once he got in power. “Our Constitution gives the freedom to express and assemble, but we are not allowed to hold public gatherings.“",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been invited to be a part of the Gaza “Board of Peace” that is being formed by United States President Donald Trump, the Foreign Office has said. “The prime minister of Pakistan has received the invitation from the president of the United States to join the Board of Peace on Gaza,” said FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi in response to media queries. “Pakistan will remain engaged with international efforts for peace and security in Gaza, leading to a lasting solution to the Palestine issue in accordance with United Nations resolutions,” he added. The so-called “Board of Peace” has begun to take shape as the US moves on to the second phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza, which stands decimated after two years of Israel’s bombardment. Trump had already declared himself the chair of the body, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in the Palestinian territory. The United States has invited the heads of around 60 states to join the Board of Peace, including those of Turkiye, Egypt, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia. However, the charter of the board, which does not mention Gaza by name, suggests that Trump has begun to position it as a rival to the United Nations. On Friday, the US president named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and his senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to the panel. According to Reuters , the board also includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Israel has repeatedly opposed any Turkish role in Gaza. Other members of the executive board include UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Sigrid Kaag; Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay; and a minister from the United Arab Emirates, which established relations with Israel in 2020. A Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo on Friday, which was attended by Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who has partnered with Witkoff for months on the issue. Former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath , who is leading the committee, has an ambitious plan that includes pushing war debris into the Mediterranean Sea and rebuilding destroyed infrastructure within three years. Analysts say the coming weeks will test whether Washington can translate the ambitious blueprint into tangible progress on governance, security and reconstruction in Gaza, as negotiations over demilitarisation and political transition intensify.",
