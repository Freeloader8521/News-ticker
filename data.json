      "summary_orig": "NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has backtracked from his proposed visit to Malaysia at the weekend to attend an Asean-related summit , joining the discussions “virtually” instead, it was officially announced on Friday. The opposition Congress party blamed the change of plan on Mr Modi’s fear of meeting President Donald Trump. The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, will be held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur. The Hindu said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had not provided any reason for Mr Modi’s decision, though the paper quoted Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as saying that Mr Modi had cited the “ongoing Deepavali celebrations” as the reason for the change in plans. The MEA announced that External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will represent Mr Modi and lead the Indian delegation at the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 27. Asean is a key pillar of India’s Act East Policy and Asia-Pacific vision, the ministry said. Congress says Indian PM’s change of plans betrays his reluctance to meet Trump The Congress claimed that Mr Modi was attending the summit virtually instead of travelling to Malaysia to avoid “being cornered” by Mr Trump. Taking to social media platform X, Congress communication chief Jairam Ramesh said it was “one thing to post messages in praise of President Trump, but far too risky to be physically seen with the man who has claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia”. “The reason why Mr Modi is not going is simple. He just doesn’t want to be cornered by President Trump who will also be there. He refused an invitation to attend the Gaza peace summit in Egypt a few weeks back, precisely for this reason,” Mr Ramesh said. “It’s far too risky for him. The PM may well be recalling that old hit Bollywood number: “ Bachke rehna re baba, bachke rehna re ,” he added. In a separate post on X, Mr Ramesh reacted to a news report quoting a Reliance Industries spokesperson who said the company would recalibrate its import of Russian oil to align with the priorities of the Indian government. “Modi Proposes, Reliance Disp­oses, Trump Exposes,” he said. “Had a warm conversation with my dear friend, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia. Congratulated him on Malaysia’s Asean Chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits. Look forward to joining the Asean-India Summit virtually, and to further deepening the Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Mr Modi in a statement. In a statement posted on social media platform ‘X’, Mr Ibrahim said he discussed details of the 47th Asean summit with Mr Modi. “He [Prime Minister Modi] informed me that he will attend virtually due to the ongoing Deepavali celebrations in India at that time. I respect his decision and extended my greetings for a happy Deepavali to him and the entire people of India.” The East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur will draw a host of dignitaries, including President Trump. It was expected that the venue would provide a meeting opportunity for Mr Modi and Mr Trump, especially as the India-US relations remain uneasy after Mr Trump imposed punitive tariffs on India because of India’s purchase of Russian crude oil. The Hindu said Mr Trump and Mr Modi exchanged greetings on Deepavali on Tuesday as India-US negotiations for a trade pact continue. The two sides, however, gave differing takes on the conversation. It said President Trump was telling a group of prominent Indian-Americans and Indian Embassy officials in the White House that the telephone call focused on a trade deal, the purchase of Russian oil and “no war with Pakistan” and the Indian sources maintained that Pakistan was not discussed during the call. Officials had earlier given mixed signals about Mr Modi’s travel plans for Kuala Lumpur, saying that the Bihar election campaign required the PM’s attention. Earlier, President Trump had invited Mr Modi to the Sharm el-Sheikh peace summit for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but India was represented at the event by Kirti Vardhan Singh, Minister of State for External Affairs.

      "summary_orig": "AFTER the federal cabinet approved the ban on the TLP a day earlier, the interior ministry published a notification on Friday saying that the state believed there were “reasonable grounds” to proscribe the hard-line outfit due to its connection with “terrorism”. Going by the government’s signals, a formal ban had seemed imminent after TLP cadres clashed with the state in a deadly showdown last week. The immediate trigger was the administration’s refusal to let the outfit march on Islamabad in supposed solidarity with Gaza. This would be the second time the religiously inspired party has been banned. The last proscription in 2021 lasted only a few months , but this time the state appears intent on sustaining the ban. However, one should keep in mind that extremist parties and groups have been banned earlier too, but have re-emerged under new monikers. PML-N leader and adviser to the PM Rana Sanaullah has said that the state had no issue with the TLP’s religious views and the ban was not designed to ‘eliminate’ the party. Rather, it was supposed to purge “anti-state and terrorist elements”. Going by this logic, if the aim is to target individuals who break the law, why does the state ban parties and groups? Moreover, in the past, how many heads of militant groups, sectarian outfits and extremist parties have been tried for their crimes? The state’s history of banning groups — from the Musharraf era to date — does not inspire confidence, as outfits are proscribed on paper, but cases against their leaders and active cadres are not diligently pursued. There is also the genuine fear that the powers that be may apply the labels of ‘terrorism’ and ‘extremism’ to ban political parties that have fallen afoul of the state. In reality, the policy of banning groups is tragicomic. Nacta’s current list of proscribed organisations contains over 80 entries, with some going as far back as 2001. Most of the groups that populate this list ascribe to jihadi, sectarian or extremist ideologies, with a smattering of separatist and ethno-nationalist outfits. But the modus operandi of ‘banned’ groups is to restart work under new names after the ban. For example, Jamaatud Dawa, an incarnation of Lashkar-i-Taiba, has at least 10 aliases, most of which are banned. Moreover, sectarian outfit Sipah-i-Sahaba, which now operates under the ASWJ moniker, has worked under three different names, some banned, others not. The point is that unless the leaders and members of extremist groups are prosecuted for their crimes — promoting terrorism, inciting violence, hate speech, etc — the state’s attempts to impose bans will not work. The state has banned TLP today, but until those associated with it who have broken the law are prosecuted, it may re-emerge tomorrow in an even more extreme form.

      "title_orig": "No transit trade at Chaman, but repatriation continues",
      "summary_orig": "QUETTA/ ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan-Afghanistan border continued to remain closed for all kinds of trade activities on Friday, due to persistent security concerns amid tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan. Officials denied reports that Islamabad had partially opened the border crossing at Chaman for Afghan transit trade. Even pedestrians are not allowed to cross the border from both sides, they added. “The border has been closed for the last 12 days and not opened for any commercial activities so far, including transit trade,” a senior customs official told Dawn. The official added that there were very few transit trade trucks parked at the Chaman crossing. The district administration officials also said that they have not yet received any instructions from the authorities from Islamabad about the opening of the border. The border opens for a very limited time for Afghan refugees, who were reaching Chaman from different areas of Balochistan and Karachi, to return to their home country. Officials said only vehicles repatriating the household goods of Afghan refugees and returning to their country via the Chaman border were allowed to travel through the border. However, traders hope that the situation would be relaxed after a meeting between officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul today. ‘Customs staff ready’ Separately, the FBR announced that customs staffers are stationed at border points and ready to resume the clearance process as soon as it reopens and the situation returns to normal. The announcement from the tax department follows the build-up of over 1,000 trucks loaded with transit cargo, export consignments, and imported goods at the border stations with Afghanistan. The disruption stems from the suspension of customs clearance for both exports and imports at major border crossings — Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda — effective Oct 12, and at the Chaman border from Oct 15. An official announcement of the FBR said that bilateral trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan is temporarily halted due to security concerns at the border customs stations Before the suspension of bilateral trade took effect, customs officials successfully processed and cleared 363 import vehicles at Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda crossings, falling under the jurisdiction of Northern region of Appraisement. At Torkham, clearance of 23 import vehicles remains pending due to the failure of importers to file goods declarations. The vehicles are carrying non-perishable items such as fabric, paint, peanuts, and pulses. Customs authorities are expected to process the consignments promptly once the required declarations are submitted by the respective importers or their clearing agents. With respect to exports, 255 vehicles remain parked inside the Torkham terminal due to the ongoing border closure, while around 200 more are stranded along the Jamrud–Landi Kotal road. Meanwhile, no import vehicles are pending clearance at the Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda border stations. Customs clearance operations at the Chaman Border Customs Station have remained suspended since Oct 15. As a result, five import vehicles and 23 export consignments are currently awaiting processing. Notably, the exporters have opted not to dray off their consignments, choosing instead to wait for the resumption of cross-border trade. In terms of transit cargo, approximately 495 vehicles are queued for border crossing at Torkham and Chaman. Of these, the majority — 412 vehicles — are stranded at Chaman, while the remaining 83 are held up at Torkham, the announcement added. Published in Dawn, October 25th, 2025",

      "summary_en": "QUETTA/ ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan-Afghanistan border continued to remain closed for all kinds of trade activities on Friday, due to persistent security concerns amid tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan. Officials denied reports that Islamabad had partially opened the border crossing at Chaman for Afghan transit trade. Even pedestrians are not allowed to cross the border from both sides, they added. “The border has been closed for the last 12 days and not opened for any commercial activities so far, including transit trade,” a senior customs official told Dawn. The official added that there were very few transit trade trucks parked at the Chaman crossing. The district administration officials also said that they have not yet received any instructions from the authorities from Islamabad about the opening of the border. The border opens for a very limited time for Afghan refugees, who were reaching Chaman from different areas of Balochistan and Karachi, to return to their home country. Officials said only vehicles repatriating the household goods of Afghan refugees and returning to their country via the Chaman border were allowed to travel through the border. However, traders hope that the situation would be relaxed after a meeting between officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul today. ‘Customs staff ready’ Separately, the FBR announced that customs staffers are stationed at border points and ready to resume the clearance process as soon as it reopens and the situation returns to normal. The announcement from the tax department follows the build-up of over 1,000 trucks loaded with transit cargo, export consignments, and imported goods at the border stations with Afghanistan. The disruption stems from the suspension of customs clearance for both exports and imports at major border crossings — Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda — effective Oct 12, and at the Chaman border from Oct 15. An official announcement of the FBR said that bilateral trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan is temporarily halted due to security concerns at the border customs stations Before the suspension of bilateral trade took effect, customs officials successfully processed and cleared 363 import vehicles at Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda crossings, falling under the jurisdiction of Northern region of Appraisement. At Torkham, clearance of 23 import vehicles remains pending due to the failure of importers to file goods declarations.

The Punjab governor noted that the alliance serves the country’s interests. “Pakistan is our top priority,” he added. Mr Khan conceded that party workers from both sides were finding it difficult to accept the alliance. “The PPP’s inclusion in the government was borne out of necessity, not choice, and it has come at a political cost for our party,” he said, warning that even a minor irresponsibility could derail the system. Mr Khan further said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had assured the PPP that its concerns would be addressed soon, even though PML-N leaders had admitted they could not meet several commitments. CM’s meeting with Imran The Punjab governor also said that KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi should “definitely” be allowed to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan. “There is democracy [in the country], and in my view, politicians should be dealt with in a political manner. The court has given [Mr Afridi] the permission to meet [Imran Khan], and if there is no legal hindrance, I see no reason why the meeting should not take place,” he said in response to a question. He also urged the KP government to have working relations with the federal government. “You need to hold talks to get your rights though a political process,” he added. View this post on Instagram He said the PPP owned the 26th Constitution Amend­ment and it was not rolled out of compulsion, noting that it would not have become possible without his party’s support. The Punjab governor said that his party had no knowledge about the 27th Consti­tution Amendment, adding that the PPP would only back it if is satisfied there was nothing wrong in it. ‘Role of bridge’ Speaking on the occasion, KP Governor Kundi said CM Afridi recently took oath and his cabinet was yet to be finalised as he was in Rawalpindi to meet his party’s founder. “I understand that every political party has its own age­nda but whenever it involves province, I have already suggested a parliamentary jirga should be formed to talk to the federal government,” he said, noting that issues could be discussed in Council of Common Interest meetings. He said that after merger of the tribal districts with KP, the province’s population had increased, adding that the PM had committed to hold meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC) in August but it was delayed due to floods. “My doors are open. The Governor’s House will play role as a bridge between the provincial and federal government for peace and development of the province.” While talking about military operations in the province, Mr Kundi said the instable law and order situation in the merged districts was worsening with each passing day. “There is no other way except for intelligence-based operations.” He said representatives of the federal government visited Kabul and the Afghan interim government was asked not to allow India and Israel use its land against Pakistan. Mr Kundi noted that 80 per cent of the militant attacks in KP were being carried out in connivance with Afghanistan, adding that except for a facilitator, all the attackers on police training schools in Dera Ismail Khan were Afghan nationals.

      "summary_orig": "A Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday directed the relevant authorities to block the national identity card (CNIC) and passport of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, over her failure to attend the hearing despite the execution of a non-bailable arrest warrant against her. The development came in a case pertaining to a protest staged by the PTI in November last year, in which the court has issued arrest warrants for her multiple times. The last non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema in the case was issued on October 22 over her persistent absences from the hearings. It was executed yesterday as Punjab Sub-Divisional Police Officer Azhar Shah presented the warrant before an Islamabad High Court bench and obtained Aleema’s signature on the spot. During today’s hearing, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah observed that Aleema “is present everywhere but doesn’t appear before the court”. Her attendance at the court would be ensured, he remarked. The judge directed the National Database and Registration Authority director general (DG), as well as the Passports DG, to block her CNIC and passport. The court also ordered the forfeiture of the properties of her guarantor to the state and directed the State Bank of Pakistan to freeze all of Aleema’s bank accounts. Following these directives, the court adjourned the hearing till Oct 27. Case background The case at hand famously came to be knows as the November 26 protest case. The said protest had seen more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad last year, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone had ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”. Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations. Aleema, along with 10 others, was booked in the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station. The Rawalpindi ATC has issued arrest warrants for her in the case at least four times. The last non-bailable arrest warrants for her were issued during the Oct 22 hearing, when the court had also issued show-cause notices to two police of­ficers for submitting a bogus report regarding the non-arrest Aleema Khan. The court had observed that the officers had presented a “fabricated and misleading report” claiming that Aleema Khan had gone into hiding, despite videos circulating on social media showing her addressing the media outside Adiala Jail the previous evening. Prior to that, the court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over her continued absence from the proceedings during an Oct 20 hearing as well. Previously, the court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her during a hearing on Oct 14, noting that she had failed to appear twice before the court. During that hearing, the court had also rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that she was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the Nov 26 protest. The ATC had also issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleem on Oct 8. Aleema was to be indicted during that hearing but didn’t appear before the court.",

The last non-bailable arrest warrants for her were issued during the Oct 22 hearing, when the court had also issued show-cause notices to two police of­ficers for submitting a bogus report regarding the non-arrest Aleema Khan. The court had observed that the officers had presented a “fabricated and misleading report” claiming that Aleema Khan had gone into hiding, despite videos circulating on social media showing her addressing the media outside Adiala Jail the previous evening. Prior to that, the court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over her continued absence from the proceedings during an Oct 20 hearing as well. Previously, the court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her during a hearing on Oct 14, noting that she had failed to appear twice before the court. During that hearing, the court had also rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that she was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the Nov 26 protest. The ATC had also issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleem on Oct 8. Aleema was to be indicted during that hearing but didn’t appear before the court.",
      "title": "Nov 26 protest case: Pindi court orders blocking of Aleema’s passport, ID card",
      "summary": "A Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday directed the relevant authorities to block the national identity card (CNIC) and passport of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, over her failure to attend the hearing despite the execution of a non-bailable arrest warrant against her. The development came in a case pertaining to a protest staged by the PTI in November last year, in which the court has issued arrest warrants for her multiple times. The last non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema in the case was issued on October 22 over her persistent absences from the hearings. It was executed yesterday as Punjab Sub-Divisional Police Officer Azhar Shah presented the warrant before an Islamabad High Court bench and obtained Aleema’s signature on the spot. During today’s hearing, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah observed that Aleema “is present everywhere but doesn’t appear before the court”. Her attendance at the court would be ensured, he remarked. The judge directed the National Database and Registration Authority director general (DG), as well as the Passports DG, to block her CNIC and passport. The court also ordered the forfeiture of the properties of her guarantor to the state and directed the State Bank of Pakistan to freeze all of Aleema’s bank accounts. Following these directives, the court adjourned the hearing till Oct 27. Case background The case at hand famously came to be knows as the November 26 protest case. The said protest had seen more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad last year, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone had ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”. Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations. Aleema, along with 10 others, was booked in the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station. The Rawalpindi ATC has issued arrest warrants for her in the case at least four times. The last non-bailable arrest warrants for her were issued during the Oct 22 hearing, when the court had also issued show-cause notices to two police of­ficers for submitting a bogus report regarding the non-arrest Aleema Khan. The court had observed that the officers had presented a “fabricated and misleading report” claiming that Aleema Khan had gone into hiding, despite videos circulating on social media showing her addressing the media outside Adiala Jail the previous evening. Prior to that, the court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over her continued absence from the proceedings during an Oct 20 hearing as well.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan is among four possible destinations that are being considered to receive exiled Palestinian captives, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club (PPC), a non-governmental organisation established in 1993 to support political prisoners in Israeli occupation jails. They were freed in exchange for Israelis held in Gaza, but instead of going home, 154 former Palestinian prisoners were exiled to Egypt, where they are confined to a hotel and kept under tight surveillance. All of them had been sentenced by an Israeli military court to life in prison on charges of murder, belonging to Palestinian resistance groups banned by Israel and more. But when a ceasefire took effect in Gaza earlier this month, the group was put on buses and sent to Egypt, where authorities have put them in a five-star hotel that they cannot leave without clearance. Egypt first received 150 exiled prisoners in January, and more than eight months later, most of them are still in the same hotel, their fate undecided. PPC official Hasan Abd Rabbo told AFP that the men remain in Egypt with accommodation costs covered by Qatar, while talks are underway over resettlement. He said possible destinations include Pakistan, Qatar, Turkiye and Malaysia. “We were separated from our families for 20 years,” Murad Abu al-Rub, a 45-year-old who spent two decades behind bars for alleged murder and for belonging to a Palestinian organisation banned by Israel, told AFP . Now, he is living in uncertainty and under close surveillance, far from the Palestinian city of Jenin where he was born. “Nothing has changed. I still can’t see my mother or my siblings,” Abu al-Rub told a team of AFP journalists who were able to access the hotel. Since the US-brokered ceasefire took hold on October 10, Hamas has freed all 20 surviving Israelis in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinians, most of whom returned to Gaza and the West Bank. During previous truces in the conflict, thousands of other Palestinian prisoners were freed in similar exchanges. The vast majority of those with life sentences were exiled to Egypt, which has formal ties with Israel and played a key mediation role. Rights groups have long criticised Israel’s use of military courts to try Palestinians suspected of security offences, saying they do not offer fair trial guarantees. Uncertainty In Egypt, the 154 men are not free to move, and they have no work permits and no idea what comes next. The government has not issued any formal statement about their status. “No Arab country wanted to take us in,” said Abu al-Rub, who was imprisoned for the alleged killing of four Israeli soldiers in 2006 in an operation by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade. In the hotel corridors, the men spend hours on the phone, speaking to relatives. “When I was arrested, my little sister was 15,” Abu al-Rub said. “I didn’t recognise her when I saw her on a video call.” Over 19 years, he was shuffled through eight different Israeli prisons, never staying more than a few months in each. Conditions Kamil Abu Hanish, who spent 22 years in Israeli prisons, was jailed allegedly for murder and for belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), according to Israel’s justice ministry records. He described the relief of being freed from jail. “It was like moving between two worlds … from a world of shackles and locked doors to a world of freedom and open space,” he said. But he also described his final hours in custody as some of the harshest. “Dozens of prisoners were tied together with ropes. They blindfolded us and forced us to kneel. Then they made us lie face down with our hands bound,” said Abu Hanish. Before Hamas’s October 7 attack, prisoners could study, play sports and attend daily discussion groups, he said, with inmates recounting a tradition of protest and rebellion in order to obtain these rights. “We played volleyball and table tennis and held three educational sessions a day,” Abu al-Rub said. “We had no rights left — even the simplest,” he said, adding that pens, paper, films, TV and newspapers were banned after October 7. “Everything we had, including clothing and blankets, was confiscated. We were left sleeping on iron beds” during winter. Palestinian, Israeli and international rights groups have documented similar claims of mistreatment, but Israel denies any such violations and says its prison service operates in accordance with the law. According to the Palestinian Authority, nearly 11,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli custody, on charges related to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Mahmoud al-Ardah, 50, also jailed on murder and other security charges, said the last two years were the worst. “Daily beatings and humiliation,” said the man, accused of belonging to the Islamic Jihad organisation. “In the last two years, I suffered more than in the previous 30.” In 2021, Ardah was one of six inmates who escaped Israel’s Gilboa prison by digging a tunnel with spoons and improvised tools. He was rearrested and put in solitary confinement.",

KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed shared these details with Dawn.com , saying that the first blast targeted a police checkpost in the jurisdiction of Bilyamina police station. He said no policemen were usually deployed at the checkpost, adding that some policemen were on their way to the site when a second blast took place near their vehicle. Three policemen were martyred in the second blast, which was caused by an improvised explosive device, the IG said. Kohat division’s Regional Police Officer (RPO) Abbas Majeed shared further details of the incident while speaking to the media in Hangu. He said police security was on high-alert today in Hangu, as well as in other districts of Kohat. Police had been carrying out a search and strike operation in the area and had also cordoned off a location at a distance of around 100 metres from the targeted checkpost since 10am, the RPO said. He added that the checkpost, an old one, was used by law enforcement personnel to rest during breaks when they would cordon off a nearby location. “There was no one at the checkpost at the time of the incident,” he said, adding that an IED blast took place at the checkpost at 2pm. “However, since no police personnel were present there, there were no casualties.” The RPO said SP (Operations) Asad Zubair, along with a police party, had left for the checkpost following the first blast. “As their vehicle approached the location, an IED blast occurred near the checkpost. Fitna-al-Khawarij had planted a more powerful IED there in comparison to the one used in the first blast.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is term designated for the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) by the state. RPO Majeed said the second blast was a “big” one, which resulted in the death of two policemen on the spot. Meanwhile, SP Zubair was taken to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, he added. The official said a large police party was carrying out a search operation at the site of the incident. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi sought an immediate report from the IG following the incident and called a session of the apex committee on the law and order situation in the province, a statement from the CM office said. It added that the CM had “strongly condemned” the incident and termed it “unfortunate”. The statement further quoted him as saying that the “elements involved [in the incident] would be taken to task at all costs. Cowardly attacks cannot demoralise the CTD (counter-terrorism department) and police”. He added the sacrifices of the martyred police personnel, which also included a superintendent of police, “will not go in vain” and that  “all resources will be used to establish peace”. CM Afridi also prayed for the martyred personnel and their families, the statement said. Condemnations President Asif Ali Zardari “strongly condemned” the “attack in Hangu carried out by India-backed Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists,” a statement on the PPP’s X account said. Fitna al-Hindustan is a term used by the state to frame India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. The statement on the PPP’s account quoted President Zardari as saying: “Terrorists are enemies of the country’s peace and stability. Their cowardly acts are unacceptable.” He paid tributes to the policemen martyred in today’s blasts, saying that the nation was “proud of the sacrifices of its brave soldiers”. The president lauded the resolve and courage of police in the fight against terrorism and prayed for the martyred policemen, as well as their families, the statement said. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the police had always played a frontline role in the war against terrorism.\n“We are determined to completely eradicate terrorism from the country,” he said. Earlier, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also “strongly condemned” the blasts, a statement posted on his ministry’s X account said, adding that he paid tributes to the martyred police, including SP Zubair. He also extended condolences to the families of the martyred policemen. “The sacrifice of martyred SP Asad Zubair and two other police personnel will not go in vain. The sacrifices of the officers and personnel of KP Police cannot be forgotten,” the statement quoted him as saying. Former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur also expressed sorrow over the martyrdom of policemen in the incident. “Saddened to hear about the martyrdom of SP (Operations) Asad Zubair and two [other] policemen during an IED attack in Hangu. KP police, security forces and the brave people of KP have been paying the price for our peace with their blood,” he posted on X. Uptick in terror incidents Pakistan has been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan since TTP broke a ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022. Ending the ceasefire agreement, the TTP had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel. Today’s blasts take place five days after law enforcers foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in KP’s Bannu district on Oct 19. According to police, the failed attack was carried out by the TTP and targeted the Baka Khel police station and three terrorists were killed as cops opened fire on them. Previously on Oct 18, unkn­own assailants had l aunched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan. According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the Frontier Corps personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident. Prior to that, on the night of Oct 17, police had intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.",

Claiming that Venezuela is “run by a dictator who is now the head of the Cartel de los Soles,” the former Colombian president stated: “If the US wants to undertake precision operations against those cartels, I am in favour of that.”",

In today’s operation in Tank, “troops effectively engaged terrorist locations, and after an intense fire exchange, eight Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. “On 24 October 2025, on [the] reported presence of Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij , security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Tank District,” the statement read. In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij , mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, the ISPR said. It added that the slain terrorists “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies as well as killing of innocent civilians.” “Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored Kharji found in the area as relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan [who] will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement added. In June last year, the federal government approved a reinvigorated and re-energised national counter-terrorism campaign, Operation Azm-i-Istehkam. On Oct 16, Security for­ces killed 34 “India-ba­cked” terrorists during multiple operations across KP over the course of three days, the military’s media wing said. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan after the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.",

      "title_orig": "Interior ministry notifies ban on TLP following federal cabinet’s approval",
      "summary_orig": "The interior ministry on Friday notified the ban on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), saying that the federal government had “reasonable grounds” to believe the religiopolitical party was connected to terrorism. The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , said: “The federal government has reasonable grounds to believe that TLP is connected with and concerned in terrorism. “In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 11B(1)(a) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (XXVII of 1997), the federal government hereby orders TLP to be a proscribed organisation for the purpose of the Act and list the aforesaid organisation in the first schedule to the said Act,” the notification said. The development comes a day after the federal cabinet approved a proposal to proscribe party under the Anti-Terrorism Act, days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on a proposal from the Punjab government. A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting said the ban was “unanimously” approved by the federal cabinet. The interior ministry briefed the cabinet on what it called the TLP’s “violent and terrorist activities”, stressing that the organisation had repeatedly incited unrest across the country. The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It was previously banned by the PTI government in 2021 after violent protests. The interior ministry informed the cabinet that the 2021 ban on TLP was lifted after six months on the assurance that it would refrain from violence. It added that the current ban on TLP stemmed from its reneging on those guarantees. “In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP,” the PM Office statement said. A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that participants were asked to share their views on TLP’s “firebrand” approach, and “almost everyone was of the view that the organisation must be barred from paralysing the country time and again”. Later, speaking on Geo News, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the intent behind a ban was not to eliminate a party but to purge it of “anti-state and terrorist elements”. He said no one had any issue with the TLP’s religious views. But whenever the party staged protests in the past, it “led to violence and loss of life, such as the 2017 Faizabad demonstrations”. In separate remarks to Geo News , Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the TLP had acted like an extremist group and violated its prior commitments. Chaudhry said the government had no other option in light of reports submitted by the Punjab government than to ban the party. He said the interior ministry had summoned reports from all provinces about the party’s conduct in the past decade regarding its involvement in violence, targeting of minorities, incitement of sectarianism and other such matters. Legal framework Under the country’s legal framework, the Nat­ional Counter-Terrorism Aut­hority (Nacta) maintains lists of proscribed persons and groups. Those designated as terrorists or associated with terrorism face severe consequences, such as travel bans and financial sanctions. Individuals may also be placed on the Fourth Schedule of the ATA for monitoring. Historically, proscribed entities have included the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Hizbut Tahrir, Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Jaish-i-Mohammad and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). The provincial government can request a ban on a party, as in the case of the TLP. In turn, the federal government has the power to refer this request to the Supreme Court by declaring that the party “has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan”, according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution. However, according to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court under the Constitution. “The federal government shall, within 15 days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,” the article says. The government can also invoke Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek the dissolution of a political party. Any declaration is subject to adjudication by the Supreme Court.",
