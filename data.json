      "summary_orig": "Gaza’s civil defence agency said 21 people were killed and dozens more wounded in multiple Israeli air strikes on Saturday, as Hamas and Israel again traded allegations of violating the fragile ceasefire . Saturday was one of the deadliest days since the US-brokered truce between Israel and Hamas came into effect on October 10, after two years of war. The Israeli military claimed an “armed terrorist” had crossed the so-called Yellow Line within the Gaza Strip, behind which Israeli forces have withdrawn, and fired at Israeli soldiers. In response to the incident in southern Gaza, which it said was on a route used for humanitarian aid deliveries in the territory, the Israeli military said it “began striking terror targets in the Gaza Strip”. Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the civil defence agency which operates under Hamas authority, told AFP there were “21 martyrs this evening in five separate Israeli air strikes, in a clear violation of the ceasefire in Gaza”. They included seven killed and more than 16 injured in a strike on a house in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip, and four killed and several injured in an air strike on a residential apartment in the Al-Nasr district, west of Gaza City, he said. The first reported strike targeted a vehicle in the Al-Rimal neighbourhood in western Gaza City. Five people were killed and several injured, said Bassal. An AFP photographer at the scene witnessed passers-by approaching the wreckage of the burnt-out car, with children appearing to be trying to salvage food from inside. AFP has sought a comment from the Israeli military on Saturday’s air strikes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office accused Hamas of breaching the truce agreement. “Today, Hamas violated the ceasefire again, sending a terrorist into Israel held territory to attack IDF soldiers. In response, Israel eliminated five senior Hamas terrorists,” it said on X. “Israel has fully honoured the ceasefire, Hamas has not. Throughout the ceasefire, dozens of Hamas terrorists have crossed the Israeli lines to attack our troops.“ “We again call on the mediators to insist that Hamas fulfil its side of the ceasefire.” In a statement, Hamas said the “escalation” of Israeli violations were “attempts to undermine the ceasefire”. “We affirm our rejection of all attempts” by Netanyahu’s government “to impose a de facto reality that contradicts what was agreed upon, and we call on the mediators to intervene urgently and exert pressure to stop these violations immediately”. On Wednesday, Gaza had already seen one of its deadliest days since the truce came into effect, with officials reporting 27 fatalities. According to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza on Thursday, 312 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the truce took hold. The war was sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people. Israel’s retaliatory assault on Gaza has killed at least 69,733 people, according to figures from the health ministry that the UN considers reliable",

      "summary_orig": "Spinner Mohammad Nawaz set it up for Pakistan before opener Sahibzada Farhan finished it off to the joy of a packed crowd at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. With Nawaz (3-16) weaving his magic with the ball, including two wickets in two balls, in the Twenty20 tri-nation clash, Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to 128-7 before romping to their target with 4.3 overs to spare in their Twenty20 tri-nation series clash on Saturday. Sahibzada led the batting effort with his sixth T20 half-century, hitting five sixes and six fours in an explosive 80 not out off 45 balls, as Pakistan eased to a six-wicket victory that made in two in two for the hosts, who beat Zimbabwe by five wickets in the series opener. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have no wins in two with the defeat following a humbling at the hands on Zimbabwe on Thursday. But it had seemed all so different at the start when skipper Dasun Shunaka won the toss and elected to bat with openers Kamil Mishara and Pathum Nissanka tearing into Pakistan’s bowling with the latter cutting away Salman Mirza for four on the first ball of their innings. Mishara then pulled Mohammad Waseem Jr, in for the injured Shaheen Shah Afridi, for six and then smashed Salman for a four and a six off consecutive deliveries in the third over. Mishara then slashed at Faheem Ashraf and got a top-edge that ran for four but his enterprising 22 off 12 ended on the next ball when he was undone by the change of pace and found Fakhar Zaman at mid-off. One-drop Kusal Mendis, didn’t last long as he was run out in an attempt to scamper a quick two and Sri Lanka ended the powerplay at 44-2 after the incoming Kusal Perera pulled Faheem away past mid-on for four. Spinner Abrar bowled an expensive first over, giving away 11 — four of them wides, with Perera raising Sri Lanka’s 50 with his second four. But Abrar hit back in his second over, having Nissanka caught at long-off for a sluggish 23-ball 17 and Sri Lanka trudged to 65-3 by the midway point of their innings. Perera, who made 25 off 19, welcomed Saim Ayub into the attack with a six over deep square leg but Nawaz’s double-wicket burst left Sri Lanka reeling. First Perera was cleaned up with a ball that was tossed outside off but turned enough to find a way between bat and pad and hit the off-stump before Shanaka was sent packing in similar fashion. From 78-3, Sri Lanka slipped to 86-6 when Nawaz had Kamindu Mendis caught thanks to a superb display of athleticism by Waseem in the deep. A first boundary in six overs came when Janith Liyanage, who hit a valiant 41 not out, lifted Abrar straight back over his head for six on the first ball of the 17th and as Sri Lanka crossed 100, Wanindu Hasaranga got a four over extra cover two balls later. An upper-cut for off Waseem got Liyanage his first four and he followed it up with another off Salman in the penultimate over before Hasaranga (11) holed out in the deep. Liyanage, though, couldn’t give Sri Lanka the lift they were looking for in the last over with just seven coming off it. Pakistan got off to a flyer in the chase, Saim (20) getting the first boundary when he dispatched a full toss by Eshan Malinga and the left-hander ended the second over with two fours through the offside. Sahibzada got on the act, lifting Hasaranga over mid-off for four and then hitting Dushmantha Chameera for a four and six — over square leg. Saim sliced Shanaka for four to bring up his 1000 runs in T20Is but was stumped two balls later. Sahibzada, though, was unfazed by losing his opening partner; crashing Vijayakanth Viyaskanth for four as Pakistan ended the powerplay at 53-1. A glorious cover drive by Sahibzada off Malinga ended a 24-ball boundary drought and Pakistan were well-placed after ending the first 10 overs at 68-1. Viyaskanth was then crashed by Sahibzada for a four and six, both in the square leg area, off consecutive balls before the right-hander raised his half-century off 33 balls. At the other end, Babar Azam (16) got his first boundary on the 17th ball he faced when he pulled away Shanaka for six. Sahibzada, though, was having no difficulty in getting the big hits — smoking two sixes off Hasaranga in the 13th over and following it up with another down the ground in the next off Chameera, who hit back by cleaning up Babar and trapping captain Salman Ali Agha lbw off consecutive balls. But with Sahibzada at the crease, Pakistan had no late jitters and the right-hander lifted Malinga for four to seal a comfortable victory for his side.",

Sahibzada, though, was having no difficulty in getting the big hits — smoking two sixes off Hasaranga in the 13th over and following it up with another down the ground in the next off Chameera, who hit back by cleaning up Babar and trapping captain Salman Ali Agha lbw off consecutive balls. But with Sahibzada at the crease, Pakistan had no late jitters and the right-hander lifted Malinga for four to seal a comfortable victory for his side.",

      "summary_orig": "Lawyers of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) staged a protest on Saturday at the Sindh High Court (SHC) against the recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment. The contentious amendment, which resulted in the establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), was passed by Parliament amid the opposition’s outcry. It has also been criticised by some legal experts as a means to dethrone the Supreme Court (SC) as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to the FCC. Former and sitting judges , as well as lawyers , voiced opposition to the amendment, particularly citing its impact on the SC. Hours after the amendment was enacted on November 13, two judges of the SC resigned , citing their reservations against it. The two judges were Athar Minallah and Mansoor Ali Shah, who was the senior puisne judge of the SC at the time. Today, lawyers began their protest outside the SHC’s premises by chanting slogans against the amendment and later entered the high court’s premises. Visuals showed some lawyers engaging in a scuffle with police personnel. Following the scuffle, police personnel backed up and allowed the protest to continue. There were reports of some minor injuries to police officials. The lawyers entered the Sindh High Court Bar Association’s hall and continued their protest with sloganeering against the amendment and the government. They later took their demonstration outside the bar room after the electricity supply was switched off. The KBA had observed a full-day strike in the subordinate judiciary last week in protest over the amendment’s passage and to express solidarity with the retired judges. It had also observed a full-day strike on Monday, during which litigants were not allowed to enter the City Courts premises and proceedings were adjourned due to the boycott. The KBA had stated that from Tuesday to Saturday (today), “token strikes will be observed from 11am onwards”.",

      "summary_orig": "Ukraine and the US will soon meet in Switzerland to discuss Washington’s plan for ending the war with Russia, Kyiv said Saturday, as it seeks to fix the draft that heeds to some of Moscow’s hardline demands. US President Donald Trump gave Ukraine less than a week to approve the 28-point plan to end the nearly four-year conflict, which would see the invaded country ceding territory, cutting its army, and pledging to never join NATO. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s European allies, who were not included in drafting the agreement, said the plan requires “additional work” as they scrambled at the G20 summit in South Africa to come up with a counter-offer to Trump’s plan to beef up Kyiv’s positions. “In the coming days, consultations will take place with partners regarding the steps needed to end the war,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said, after he issued a decree stating Ukraine’s team for the talks, which will be led by his top aide, Andriy Yermak. “Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine’s national interests and what is necessary to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion,” Zelensky added. The wartime leader was also holding rounds of phone calls with European counterparts, as he earlier promised to work round the clock to ensure the final peace agreement will protect Ukraine’s future. Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s security council secretary who’s also on board for the talks, earlier indicated Switzerland as a location for the deliberations. “This is another stage of the dialogue that has been ongoing in recent days and is primarily aimed at aligning our vision for the next steps,” added Umerov, formerly a defence minister. He previously led a few rounds of negotiations with Russia in Turkey, which only yielded prisoner exchanges and bodies repatriations. Zelensky’s decree also said the negotiations will include “representatives of the Russian Federation.” There was no immediate confirmation from Russia whether it would join the talks. More work needed The unilateral US plan to end the war in Ukraine “is a basis which will require additional work”, Western leaders gathered in South Africa for a G20 summit said Saturday. “We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force. We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack,” the leaders of key European countries as well as Canada and Japan said in a joint statement. France’s Emmanuel Macron earlier sent a sombre message to the gathering, saying “the G20 may be coming to the end of a cycle,” adding that the grouping was struggling to resolve major crises around the world, referring to the unilateral US plan for resolving the Ukraine war. Britain, Germany and France emerged as key Ukraine backers, providing it with crucial military and financial support, especially after the US sponsorship waned after Trump’s return to office. Difficult choice Ukraine faces one of the most challenging moments in its history, Zelensky said Friday in an address to the nation, adding that he would propose alternatives to Trump’s proposal. “The pressure on Ukraine is one of the hardest. Ukraine may face a very difficult choice: either the loss of dignity or the risk of losing a key partner,” Zelensky said in his address, referring to a possible break with Washington. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the blueprint could “lay the foundation” for a final peace settlement, but threatened more land seizures if Ukraine walked away from negotiations. Better equipped and larger in numbers, the Russian army is slowly but steadily gaining ground across the lengthy front line. Ukrainians were meanwhile facing one of the toughest winters since the war began, after Moscow carried out a brutal bombing campaign against energy infrastructure. This comes as a sweeping corruption probe that unveiled graft in the energy sector was unravelling in Kyiv, sparking public outcry.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed eight terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, said a statement by the military’s media wing on Saturday. The IBO was conducted on November 21, according to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian-proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the “Indian-sponsored *khawarij”*, as per ISPR, “who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, LEAs and target-killing of innocent civilians.” “The operation underscores the strengthened collaborative efforts between [LEAs] and security forces, who have significantly intensified intelligence-driven operations in the region,” said ISPR. “These meticulously coordinated and synchronised security measures are designed to constrict the operational mobility of khawarij elements, systematically dismantle their facilitation networks, and curtail their capacity to reorganise,” the statement stressed, adding that operations are producing “substantial and measurable success” with continuous efforts to achieve more peace and stability. “Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khawariji found in the area, as the relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision Azm-i-Istehkam (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and [LEAs] of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” ISPR added. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of LEAs. Earlier today , a terrorist plot to blow up Dawa bridge in Bannu’s Basia Khel area using an improvised explosive device (IED) was foiled. Yesterday, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked in Bannu, according to police. Police officials had told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Taliban’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives.",

      "summary_orig": "On a lush cricket ground outside Colombo, the sharp jingling of a ball cuts through the afternoon air. Every rattle is a pushback against the stigma of disability. Sri Lanka and India are co-hosting the first T20 World Cup for visually impaired women. The semi-finals are on Saturday between India and Australia and Pakistan and Nepal, followed by the final on Sunday. India manager Shika Shetty told AFP that the sport has transformed lives and helped change attitudes. “I think this (world cup) is one of the biggest opportunities for our visually impaired girls,” said Shetty, who is not blind. India captain T.C. Deepika recalled the disbelief she faced when she first picked up the bat. “People were saying, ‘How do they do it? They must be lying,’” she said in a video posted by the Cricket Association for the Blind in India. “(Later) they realised I can do something. People began to see that I have ability,” Deepika added. Playing by the ear While able-bodied cricket requires players to keep an eye on the ball at all times, blind players must have sharp ears. The white plastic ball, the size of a tennis ball, is packed with ball bearings that rattle as it rolls. The bowler must ask the striker if he or she is ready and then yell “play” as the jingling ball is delivered underarm with at least one bounce. Like a regular cricket match, each side has 11 players, but at least four must be totally blind. They are required to wear blindfolds for fairness. Fielders clap once to reveal their positions. Others are partially sighted, classified by how far they can see — two metres for B2 players, six for B3. Each team can have up to eight B1, or totally blind, players. Any run scored by a B1 player is counted as two. ‘Liberating’ Chaminda Karunaratne says cricket has been both a refuge and a way to prove that blindness cannot impede his sporting ambitions. The blind 40-year-old Sri Lankan school teacher has represented his country in international tournaments and now wants women to share that space. “Cricket has done wonders, especially for my mental health,” Karunaratne said as the Indian and Pakistan women’s teams battled it out on the ground. Pakistan’s Noor Fatima (C) celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of India’s Simu Das during the Women’s Blind Twenty20 World Cup 2025 match between India and Pakistan at the BOI Cricket Stadium in Katunayake on November 16, 2025. — AFP “When you get into a sport like this it boosts your self-confidence, you can move more freely and you tend to take part in community activities,” he said. “That is liberating.” Karunaratne, a key member of the Sri Lanka Cricket Association for the Visually Handicapped, added: “I appeal to parents to send their blind girls to take up cricket. It is an opportunity to interact with others.” “You can show that you are not helpless, not dependent,” he said. Association president Sudesh Tharanga admitted forming a women’s team had been a challenge, although nearly a million Sri Lankans are estimated to have some form of visual impediment. “We started assembling a team only after we were asked in September if we could co-host the T20 tournament in November,” Tharanga told AFP . Despite limited preparations Sri Lanka managed to field one of the tournament’s youngest squads.",

      "summary_orig": "I have spent the past few weeks staring at what seem to be digital ghosts; they look human, speak the way we do, and cause anger and despair. But they are not real. They are machines wearing human skin. Something is shifting in Pakistan’s social media landscape. It is not merely a rumour. It is not the old cycle of misinformation. It feels darker. Artificial intelligence is reshaping reality frame by frame until the internet resembles a hall of mirrors. For me, it began on November 8, when an account called ‘PakVocals’ posted a video on X that claimed to show journalist Benazir Shah dancing in a nightclub. The caption was cruel. It tried to mock her by using derogatory comments against her professional credibility. At the time of writing this piece, that video had garnered more than half a million views. It did exactly what it was designed to do: turn a journalist into a target. Mission accomplished! To most viewers, the clip probably passed as real, but for me, something felt off. When the mask slips I opened the clip in DaVinci Resolve — a video editing software that can be downloaded online — and watched it frame by frame because deepfakes are rarely perfect; they usually leave behind little crumbs of evidence. And at the 30th frame, I found it! For a split second, the skin tone flickered. The outline of the face rippled like water. The mask, it seems, had slipped — a clear sign of face manipulation had thus been identified. Screengrab from deepfake video showing clear signs of face manipulation. I then used Google Lens, another free online tool, to scan multiple screenshots of the deepfake video. The aim was to identify the source of the video, and success was clearly in sight when several search results popped up, one after the other. The body in the video didn’t belong to Benazir Shah but to Indian actress Jannat Zubair Rahmani — the clothes were the same, and so was the lighting. The only thing the fakers had changed was the face. A screengrab of the original video of Indian actress Jannat Zubair. On X, Shah called out the deepfake video and noted that the account was followed by the information minister of the incumbent government. That is when the story took a weird turn. ‘PakVocals’ issued an apology, citing religious fear of slander. But despite the pious language, the video is still there, which shows that their true intention was to damage someone’s reputation. On November 18, another X account by the name ‘Princess Hania Shah’ posted a new deepfake of Benazir Shah and accused her of being a “traitor”. This deepfake edit was a lazy attempt, I thought to myself. But the intent, again, was dangerous. This time, I didn’t even need editing software. I used Google Lens to put the fake video side-by-side with the original footage I found online. They were perfect mirrors — same moves, same lighting, just a different face. It took five minutes to prove it was a lie. Yet, more than 180,000 people had already watched it. A screengrab of the Nov 18 X post. Fact-checking — a necessity X, formerly Twitter, has a system called “Community Notes” designed to flag fake content. But it has failed too many times. Deepfake videos are still up on the social media platform without a warning label. What’s worse is that when users asked X’s own AI chatbot, Grok, to verify the videos, it failed to identify them as AI-generated content, revealing the limitations of billion-dollar algorithms. Simply put, we can’t rely on tech giants to protect us. If third-party fact-checkers fail to do their job, nobody will. With every passing day, fact-checking is becoming a necessity, especially during times of conflict and wars, because AI-manipulated content is not just consumed by ordinary people but also by mainstream news media. During the recent Israel-Iran conflict in mid-2025, a viral post on X allegedly showed analysts at an Israeli news channel fleeing their studio after a purported strike by Iran. While the footage initially seemed convincing, closer inspection revealed ghostly movements, immaculate camera panning and flat audio. But many Pakistani news outlets aired the clip as an authentic event. A screengrab of the AI video that went viral during the Israel-Iran war. After the Benazir Shah deepfakes, just a few hours later, I found another deepfake video. It claimed to show Pakistani soldiers abusing a Baloch woman in a desert setting. The account that posted the clip, namely ‘Yousuf Bahand’, added a taunt: “Some will say this is fake.” He was right. It is a fake! I went back to the frame-by-frame analysis. The clues were in plain sight. The name tags on the soldiers’ uniforms read “PRMRACCH” and “BAMY” — a classic AI mistake in writing text, hallucinating words while producing gibberish. Screengrab of visual inconsistencies in the video. The clip was crammed with other visual inconsistencies as well. For one, one of the hands of the supposed soldier in the video appeared to be merged into the hands of the woman. Not just the video, but the audio too gave it away. When the soldier yelled “damn it”, it came out in a clean American accent, nothing like what you’d expect in that setting. So I ran the clip through FFMPEG, a command-line tool that converts audio or video formats. The data showed something you never see in a real desert recording: 0.21 seconds of total silence at the very start. In a windy, open environment, the mic always picks up ambient noise the moment it switches on. That dead air only happens when someone pastes the audio track onto the video later. And this is not a one-off episode of playing on real issues. I remember, for instance, the wide circulation of clips showing cows drowning during the 2025 Punjab floods . Instead of authentic chaos, the videos presented a sterile calm: unnaturally still, perfectly framed, and entirely lacking the expected camera tremor or human sounds. Unfortunately, most viewers appeared to stop at the initial shock of the disaster, arguably failing to question the engineers behind the synthetic content. The ‘AI Slop’ A recent BBC investigation revealed that Pakistan has become a global hub for “AI Slop”. Creators appear to be mass-producing fake content, using real-world settings to spread lies, just to game algorithms and earn money. The incentive is simple: virality pays, truth does not . Until early 2024, AI videos were mostly a glitchy novelty shared by enthusiasts, but the landscape arguably shifted with Sora (OpenAI), which created a sense of competition in the market with heavy hitters such as X’s Grok and Google’s Veo. But to their credit, Google just stepped in with a partial remedy: its Gemini chatbot can now flag images created with Google’s own AI tools by detecting invisible SynthID watermarks, a technology that embeds invisible watermarks into AI-generated content like images, audio, and text to identify it as machine-created. The tools I used to expose these lies are free. Anyone can use them. But unfortunately, the tools to make these lies are just as accessible. That is the frightening symmetry: anyone with an ulterior motive, whether financial or otherwise, can fabricate a reality, but not everyone will have the incentive to break through such fabrications. AI isn’t a futuristic threat anymore. It is a street-level weapon. The next viral clip you see might not be real at all, yet the truth still sits there beneath the distortions. You only have to slow down long enough to find it. Sometimes it is a flicker on a cheek. Sometimes it is a melting hand. Sometimes there is a silence in the waveform. The ghosts can be unmasked, but only if we choose to look closely. Header image created with generative AI",

      "title_orig": "India trade unions condemn new labour codes, plan nationwide protests",
      "summary_orig": "Ten large Indian trade unions condemned the government’s rollout on Friday of new labour codes, the biggest such overhaul in decades, as a “deceptive fraud” against workers. The unions, aligned with parties opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanded in a statement late on Friday that the laws be withdrawn ahead of nationwide protests they plan to hold on November 26 (Wednesday). Modi’s government implemented the four labour codes, approved by parliament five years ago, as it seeks to simplify work rules, some dating to British colonial rule, and liberalise conditions for investment. It says the changes improve worker protections. While the new rules offer social security and minimum-wage benefits, they also allow companies to hire and fire workers more easily. Unions have strongly opposed the changes, organising multiple nationwide protests over the past five years. The Labour Ministry did not immediately respond on Saturday to a Reuters request for comment on the union demands. The government has held over a dozen consultations with unions since June 2024, an internal ministry document on the labour codes shows. The rules allow longer factory shifts and night work for women, while raising the threshold for firms that need prior approval for layoffs to 300 workers from 100, giving companies greater flexibility in workforce management. The codes define gig and platform work for the first time, expanding legal and social protection to workers outside traditional employment structures. The gig workforce has surged since the pandemic, with more than 23.5 million expected to be employed in the sector by 2030, up from around 10m in 2024/25, according to government think tank NITI Aayog. Businesses have long criticised India’s work rules as a drag on manufacturing, which contributes less than a fifth to the country’s nearly $4 trillion economy. Strengthening the manufacturing sector is key to creating jobs in the world’s most populous country. But the Association of Indian Entrepreneurs expressed concern that the new rules would significantly increase operating costs for small and midsize enterprises and disrupt business continuity across key sectors. It asked the government for transitional support and flexible implementation mechanisms. “The labour codes have been implemented despite strong opposition from the trade unions and it will snatch the workers’ rights, including fixed-term jobs and rights available under the earlier labour laws,” said Amarjeet Kaur, national general secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC).

The right-wing Bharatiya Majdoor Sangh, aligned with Modi's party, called on states to implement them after consultations on some of the codes. The labour ministry said the codes — covering wages, industrial relations, social security and occupational safety — would “ensure better wages, safety, social security and welfare for the country’s workforce”. The codes will replace 29 existing laws. Indian states are expected to craft rules aligning with the new federal codes covering wages, industrial relations and occupational safety. Despite parliamentary approval in 2020, the BJP had until now not been able to implement the laws uniformly across the country due to political resistance and opposition from some unions. Modi yesterday defended the overhaul, saying on X that the codes would serve as “a strong foundation for universal social security, minimum and timely payment of wages, safe workplaces and remunerative opportunities”, adding that the reforms would boost job creation and productivity.",

      "summary_en": "Ten large Indian trade unions condemned the government’s rollout on Friday of new labour codes, the biggest such overhaul in decades, as a “deceptive fraud” against workers. The unions, aligned with parties opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanded in a statement late on Friday that the laws be withdrawn ahead of nationwide protests they plan to hold on November 26 (Wednesday). Modi’s government implemented the four labour codes, approved by parliament five years ago, as it seeks to simplify work rules, some dating to British colonial rule, and liberalise conditions for investment. It says the changes improve worker protections. While the new rules offer social security and minimum-wage benefits, they also allow companies to hire and fire workers more easily. Unions have strongly opposed the changes, organising multiple nationwide protests over the past five years. The Labour Ministry did not immediately respond on Saturday to a Reuters request for comment on the union demands. The government has held over a dozen consultations with unions since June 2024, an internal ministry document on the labour codes shows.

      "summary_orig": "Influential right-wing United States lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Friday that she is resigning from Congress, one week after former President Donald Trump withdrew his support for the Georgia Republican. Her last day in office will be Jan 5, 2026. In a video posted online, the 51-year-old congresswoman, elected in 2020, said she had “always been despised in Washington DC and never fit in”. Greene added she did not want her supporters and family to endure “a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms”. The resignation marks the clearest sign yet of a growing rift in the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, which has been shaken by strong Democratic victories in this month’s off-year elections, including the leftist New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani , who met with Trump earlier on Friday. Greene’s break with Trump appeared linked to his flip-flop on releasing emails connected to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, a wealthy financier, had cultivated ties with elite politicians, business leaders, academics and celebrities, and was accused of trafficking girls and young women for sex. Greene referenced the affair in her resignation speech. “Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,” Greene said. Trump, in a phone interview with ABC News , described Greene’s resignation as “great news from the country”, adding that she had not given him notice but “it doesn’t matter … I think she should be happy”. Earlier this week, Congress passed and Trump signed a law requiring government records on Epstein to be made public, after months of the former president attempting to block their release. Before reversing his position, Trump had withdrawn all support for Greene, whom he dubbed “Wacky Marjorie”, and attacked her on Truth Social as a “lightweight” and “traitor” to the Republican Party. Greene subsequently reported receiving a wave of threats. A prominent MAGA ally, Greene had championed Trump’s agenda, advocated for immigrant deportation, gun rights, and vaccine scepticism. The rupture comes amid criticism of Trump over the US cost of living and the Epstein scandal. Greene’s departure sparked speculation she may run for president in 2028, which she dismissed as “baseless gossip”. In her resignation speech, Greene highlighted her loyalty to Trump and the Republican Party. She said she “fought harder than almost any other elected Republican to elect Donald Trump and Republicans”, spending “millions” of her own money. Greene also contrasted herself with “establishment Republicans who secretly hate him and who stabbed him in the back”. She emphasised, “My voting record has been solidly with my party and the president. Loyalty should be a two-way street.”",

According to an official statement from KP police, terrorists attempted to blow up Dawa bridge in Bannu’s Basia Khel area using an improvised explosive device (IED). It said that the plot was thwarted due to timely action by the Bannu police bomb disposal squad. It said that the terrorists had attached the IED, a bucket full of 8-10 kilogrammes of explosive material, to the central pillar of the bridge. “The local people praised the timely action taken by Bannu police,” the statement said. It also quoted Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan as saying that it was necessary to “eliminate elements inconveniencing the public by destroying infrastructure”. He asserted that such elements do not deserve any mercy. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Yesterday, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked in Bannu, according to police. Police officials had told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Taliban’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives. Earlier this week, a bid to blow up another bridge in Bannu had failed when an IED detonated prematurely while it was being installed.",

      "summary_orig": "• FO says Islamabad understands ‘economic pain’ caused by closures but security threat ‘existential’ • Can’t let ‘our people be killed indiscriminately’ • Scheduling of planned Turkish delegation’s visit in connection with Pak-Afghan conflict still awaited ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups. “The onus of delay in the reopening of the border crossings rests with the Afghan Taliban regime,” Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said at a weekly media briefing. Pakistan and Afghanistan’s bilateral trade, estimated at $1.6 billion to $1.8bn in 2023-24, with key border gateways like Torkham and Chaman handling most of the traffic, has been suspended since mid-October, following deadly clashes between Pakistani forces and Taliban fighters. This suspension is estimated to be costing Afghan traders an estimated $2.5 million a day. The impasse has pushed Kabul to increasingly rely on Iranian routes, including Chabahar, while risking the erosion of Pakistan’s roughly $1bn in annual transit fees in addition to its own trade losses. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had closed border crossings and suspended all trade because of “the support being extended to Fitna-al-Khawarij [FAK] and Fitna-al-Hindustan [FAH] terrorist elements by the Afghan Taliban regime”. FAK is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­i­stan, while the Balochistan Liberation Army and other militant groups based in the province have been designated FAH to highlight India’s alle­ged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. ‘Economic pain’ The FO spokesperson said Islamabad understood the economic pain caused by the closures but described the security threat as “existential”. “If you recall, on November 10 and 15, the trade posts were actually attacked from Afghanistan. So, either we get ourselves killed, or we undertake a very risky trade. What is the choice?” he added. “Carrying out trade has become risky. So, with respect to trade, the position remains the same as I outlined last week.” Mr Andrabi said Islamabad had for years attempted to insulate trade from security tensions but that patience had run out. “From 2022, 23, 24 and the mid of 25, we segregated trade and security. But then there is a threshold of patience. I think that threshold of patience has been crossed,” he continued. The FO spokesperson noted that Islamabad could not allow trade to continue as if it were a “licence to kill Pakistanis from Afghan soil”. He rejected suggestions that trade losses should override security concerns. “Can you put a price tag on a human life, a Pakistani life?” he said. “Consider the people whose father, children, mother have been killed in these terrorist attacks. Can we convince them that look, let these killings continue because we are having an X amount of dollars of trade with Afghanistan?” Regional projects He also warned that major regional infrastructure projects including the Turkmen­istan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline and the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000) depended on a shift in the Taliban’s conduct. “The success of all these projects also depends on the Taliban regime halting its support and abetment of terrorist outfits operating from Afghan soil,” he said. Calling this a central “denominator” of ties, Mr Andrabi said the Afghan Taliban must stop backing groups such as FAK, FAH and their affiliates, and prevent Afghan nationals from carrying out attacks inside Pakistan. “We are cognisant of the losses to Pakistani traders, who are suffering,” he said. “But now we cannot let our people be killed indiscriminately.” Turkish delegation The spokesperson said the scheduling of a planned Turkish delegation’s visit in connection with the Pakistan-Afgha­nistan conflict was still awaited, despite Ankara’s announcement earlier this month that senior officials would travel to Islamabad for renewed mediation efforts. The third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, held under the Turkish-Qatari initiative, ended without an agreement on Nov 7 in Istanbul, leaving the ceasefire fragile amid continued TTP attacks. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later announced on Nov 9 that a high-level delegation, including Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin would visit Islamabad the following week to help secure a lasting ceasefire and work towards reopening trade routes. Pakistan welcomed Ankara and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process. “This visit has not taken place. It is being scheduled. The travel schedules of ministers take time to firm up,” Mr Andrabi said. He rejected suggestions that Islam­abad’s lack of cooperation was causing delays.“The delay should not be attributed to any non-cooperation from Pakistan,” he said.“Whether there is any non-cooperation from the Afghan Tali­ban regime, I am not aware of it.” The FO spokesperson said it was premature to comment on other mediation proposals, including those from Russia and Iran. “Many states have offered mediation, and we appreciate the support of our friendly and brotherly countries,” he said. “It is too early to comment on any specifics or other mediation offers. We will respond once we receive them.” Published in Dawn, November 22nd, 2025",
