      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter to his counterpart in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, has raised concerns over the alleged manhandling of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters by police and the obstruction of the incarcerated ex-premier’s visitation rights. The development comes after Afridi on Thursday was denied access to meet Imran for a seventh time. Further, two days ago police had allegedly manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with him. The letter, which was shared by the PTI on social media platform X early on Friday, said that Afridi wished to draw Maryam’s attention to “serious concerns” regarding the “administration of court-mandated visitation rights” of Imran and the recent treatment of his family members. “Clear and binding judicial directions govern Imran’s visitation schedule. These orders explicitly permit his close family members and nominated individuals to meet him on specified days. Despite the unambiguous nature of these instructions, repeated reports indicate persistent non-implementation by the authorities responsible for compliance,” Afridi said. He also termed accounts of the “inappropriate and rough treatment” of Imran’s sisters during a recent attempt to visit him as “particularly disturbing”. “These individuals are apolitical private citizens, seeking only to meet their brother in accordance with court permissions. Even if restrictions were to exist for political visitors — which is a different category altogether — there is no conceivable legal or administrative basis for obstructing or mishandling immediate family members whose presence is neither political nor disruptive in nature,” the KP chief minister said. “Their obstruction, physical restraint or temporary detention is therefore wholly unacceptable,” he said. Afridi said that such actions created a “clear impression” that judicial directives were being disregarded, and that jail and police authorities were not safeguarding or facilitating the rights of visitors. He urged Maryam to ensure a proper, safe and dignified waiting area for authorised visitors. “The current practice of stopping them nearly a kilometre away and compelling elderly family members — particularly women — to sit on roads is wholly inappropriate and must be discontinued,” he said. He said that the Punjab government should ensure the implementation of all court directives on visitation. He also called for identifying and holding individuals accountable for obstructing, insulting, or physically manhandling peaceful visitors, including Imran’s family and members of the KP cabinet. He said that the Punjab government should also issue instructions to the prison and police authorities to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Further, he called for establishing a mechanism ensuring that all future meetings were facilitated in an “orderly, respectful and legally compliant manner”. Afridi ended his letter by saying that Imran was a former prime minister and the leader of a political party he himself represented. “Any deviation from court-mandated procedures in his case, or any disrespectful treatment of his immediate family, becomes a matter of direct institutional concern,” he said, adding that he could not remain indifferent when Imran’s dignity and rights were being compromised. “I am therefore constrained to demand that these issues be addressed promptly, decisively and in full conformity with judicial directions,” he said. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. On Thursday, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed concern over the reports of Imran’s sisters being “manhandled” and noted that the rights of prisoners’ families to meet their relatives and the right to peaceful assembly were protected under national and international human rights law. “HRCP calls for a transparent inquiry and urges authorities to ensure the rights, safety and dignity of all involved are fully respected,” it said in a post on X.",

      "summary_en": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter to his counterpart in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, has raised concerns over the alleged manhandling of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters by police and the obstruction of the incarcerated ex-premier’s visitation rights. The development comes after Afridi on Thursday was denied access to meet Imran for a seventh time. Further, two days ago police had allegedly manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with him. The letter, which was shared by the PTI on social media platform X early on Friday, said that Afridi wished to draw Maryam’s attention to “serious concerns” regarding the “administration of court-mandated visitation rights” of Imran and the recent treatment of his family members. “Clear and binding judicial directions govern Imran’s visitation schedule. These orders explicitly permit his close family members and nominated individuals to meet him on specified days. Despite the unambiguous nature of these instructions, repeated reports indicate persistent non-implementation by the authorities responsible for compliance,” Afridi said. He also termed accounts of the “inappropriate and rough treatment” of Imran’s sisters during a recent attempt to visit him as “particularly disturbing”. “These individuals are apolitical private citizens, seeking only to meet their brother in accordance with court permissions. Even if restrictions were to exist for political visitors — which is a different category altogether — there is no conceivable legal or administrative basis for obstructing or mishandling immediate family members whose presence is neither political nor disruptive in nature,” the KP chief minister said. “Their obstruction, physical restraint or temporary detention is therefore wholly unacceptable,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "THE UN Security Council Resolution 2803 passed on Nov 17 on Gaza has some noticeable features from the standpoint of international law. Let us take up at least a few. Firstly, it does not mention the UN Charter ’s provision under which it is adopted, and this is a deviation from the practice in vogue in the UNSC wherein resolutions mention in their respective preambles the legal provision under which they are enabled. However, when one examines the substance of Resolution 2803, it seems to be in the nature of conferring a mandate on separately negotiated “regional and collective arrangements” by member states of the Middle East, Turkiye, Pakistan, and of course, the US — the lead driver in initiating and pushing through this particular ‘regional arrangement’. All this is actually closer to the mandate under Chapter VIII of the Charter — to be more specific, under Article 52 of the said chapter. So what difference does this make? After all, President Donald Trump and the US administration have received the much-needed mandate from the UN. There was no veto by China or Russia. All OIC states, including Pakistan, have agreed, and those in the UNSC have voted favourably. Clearly, the first and foremost motivation of all Muslim states — and rightly so — was to secure legally what was possible and achievable politically a halt to any further genocide plans and killing of Palestinians. However, if the resolution is to be taken as being passed under Chapter VIII titled ‘Regional Arrangements’, then it is submitted that the regional arrangements of neighbouring countries can now have a life of their own. Let’s explain this. A regional arrangement of the sort being authorised by the present resolution will be constrained to seek authorisation from the UNSC itself for any enforcement action (read: military action) due to the requirements of Article 53 of the UN Charter. However, what if due to any reason, such as Israeli action or Hamas’s defiance, or for that matter if President Trump is no longer in office, the process at the UNSC is stalled? That’s when the independent mandate of any existing regional arrangement is resurrected as envisioned under Article 52 of the Charter. It is striking that Resolution 2803 in its annexed plan assures that ‘Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza’. It is striking that Resolution 2803 in its annexed plan assures in paragraph 16 that “Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza”. This is an important statement from the sponsors of regional arrangements and is now reflected as a collective position with the consent of Israel. This adds legal clarity and reinforces the most important principle of modern statecraft that the occupation of a territory under international law cannot legitimise title. The entire regional arrangement or a series of them, including measures to create a board of peace and international stabilisation force (ISF), will eventually lead to the gradual withdrawal of the Israeli Defence Forces from Gaza territory. One may ask if the resolution contains a roadmap leading to a two-state solution. It does, but not so explicitly as one would want. That process is tied to the reform programme of the Palestinian Authority and the advancement of Gaza’s redevelopment plan. It is then that the issue of “Palestinian self-determination and statehood” will be taken up. Though the regional arrangement under Resolution 2803 is a sort of a detour from the chain of dozens of resolutions on the two-state solution by the UNSC, 2803 does not defy the resolutions and the plans contained in them per se, and instead, notes their existence in the preamble. In other words, this resolution sets up a regional arrangement, sponsored and led by the US, as a parallel regime, arguably also calling for a solution under Chapter VI of the Charter relating to the ‘Pacific Settlement of Disputes’. But it cannot be interpreted in any way as to render ineffective the previous proposals for two-state solutions already adopted by UNSC resolutions, including 242 and 1397 among several others. The setting up of the ISF mandate under Resolution 2803 is also unique because it will be installed with the consent of both Israel and Egypt. It is initially for two years, but the period is extendable. It is to “use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate consistent with international law including international humanitarian law [emphasis added]”. As things move forward, one foresees a tense moment amongst ISF commanders debating the limits or extent of the mandate, particularly if there are incidents such as defiance by Hamas or Israeli bombing. It must be known clearly that when the ISF is in place, Israel’s ‘right’ to use force in an area of ISF mandate is forfeited. That will actually increase manifold the responsibility of the ISF to maintain security and peace in the region. The plan annexed to Resolution 2803 makes a very interesting mention of what is referred to as “interfaith dialogue” to “try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis”. As we know, the Palestinian narrative is primarily drawn from the modern international law principle of self-determination and the right to resist occupation as recognised by the UN itself all along. On the other hand, the Israeli narrative is based, inter alia, on an ancient biblical covenant of the promised land as a justification for a ‘Greater Israel’. It will be interesting to see how the US, through interfaith dialogue, is able to make Israel understand that notwithstanding which religion dominated which area in the past or which nation was allowed permission to enter or use land resources, it is now the UN Charter that can override religious or cultural narratives as the prevailing law today to determine mutual relations, the legitimate means of adding to existing territories and to ensure respect for state boundaries.

The groups, a number of which have boasted about their involvement in sharing dossiers on Palestine activists with the administration, have claimed credit for Khalil’s arrest, according to the Center for Constitutional Rights, which is part of the legal team representing Khalil, and they say there is evidence that indicates the Trump administration “acted on information and misinformation – provided by these groups in cracking down” on Khalil and other pro-Palestine activists.

      "summary_orig": "The JF-17 Thunder Block-III drew significant attention, emerging as a “major focal point” at the Dubai Airshow 2025, with an MoU (memorandum of understanding) signed with a friendly country for the procurement of the jet. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), in a statement released on Thursday, said that several countries also expressed interest in acquiring the battle-proven fighter aircraft. The fighter has proved its combat capabilities during two conflicts with arch-rival India in 2019 and 2025. The biennial airshow is being held at Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport from November 17-21. “Demonstrating increasing international confidence in Pakistan’s aviation industry, several countries expressed interest in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder. In a noteworthy development, an MoU was signed with a friendly country for the procurement of the JF-17 Thunder, marking another significant milestone in Pakistan’s expanding defence and industrial partnerships.” A Pakistan Air Force (PAF) contingent arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to participate in the Dubai Airshow 2025. The contingent features the advanced JF-17 Thunder Block-III and the renowned Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, reflecting Pakistan’s growing expertise in indigenous military aviation. The JF-17 Block-III is a 4.5-generation multi-role fighter jet equipped with an advanced radar and long-range, beyond-visual-range missiles capable of undertaking a wide variety of combat missions. The ISPR further said Chief of the Air Staff Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu held a series of high-level engagements with air chiefs from friendly countries on the event’s sidelines. He also held comprehensive discussions with UAE Defence Undersecretary Lieutenant General Pilot Ibrahim Nasser Al-Alawi and Air Force & Air Defence Commander Major General Rashid Mohammed Al-Shamsi on strengthening cooperation in advanced training, fostering collaboration in emerging aerospace technologies and enhancing the mechanisms for effective operational coordination. “The UAE military leadership lauded PAF’s modernisation initiatives and growing indigenous capabilities with a shared resolve to further strengthen military engagement through joint exercises, professional exchanges and forward-looking partnerships,” the ISPR said. During Pakistan’s conflict with India in May, the ISPR said the plane’s supersonic missiles destroyed the S-400 missile system in Adampur. It was also used to carry out strikes across the Line of Control from inside the Pakistani airspace, in response to the Indian strikes in Balakot in April 2019. PAF’s Thunder The JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter was jointly developed by China and Pakistan. Development on the aircraft started in 1999, and the maiden flight was conducted in 2003. It is a single-engine multi-role fighter, capable of performing air superiority, interdiction, maritime strike, Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) and ground attack roles. The fighter was inducted as a replacement for the PAF’s ageing fleet A-5C, F-7P, Mirage 3 and Mirage 5 aircraft. The initial Block 1 JF-17s were received in 2007, with production of the upgraded Block 2 JF-17s starting in 2013. The latest variant, Block 3s, were inducted in March 2023. Armed with state-of-the-art weapons, the aircraft has emerged as an affordable and highly capable 4.5-generation fighter aircraft. The JF-17 is flown by the air forces of Pakistan, Nigeria, Myanmar and Azerbaijan, which recently inducted Block 3s in the Azeri air force.",

      "summary_orig": "European countries pushed back on Thursday against a United States-backed peace plan for Ukraine that sources said would require Kyiv to give up more land and partially disarm, conditions long seen by Ukraine’s allies as tantamount to capitulation. Two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that Washington had signalled to President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine must accept a US-drafted framework to end the war, which includes territorial concessions and curbs to Ukraine’s armed forces. The sources spoke on condition they not be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The acceleration in American diplomacy comes at an awkward juncture for Kyiv, with its troops on the back foot at the front and Zelensky’s government undermined by a corruption scandal. Parliament fired two cabinet ministers on Wednesday. A Ukrainian soldier sits in a pickup truck before a combat mission near the frontline town of Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region of Ukraine on November 20. — Reuters Moscow played down any new US initiative. “Consultations are not currently underway. There are contacts, of course, but there is no process that could be called consultations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He said Russia had nothing to add beyond the position President Vladimir Putin laid out at a summit with US President Donald Trump in August, adding that any peace deal must address the “root causes of the conflict”, a phrase Moscow has long used to refer to its demands. ‘Peace cannot be capitulation,’ says France European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels were careful not to comment in too much detail about a US peace plan that has not been made public. But they made clear they would not accept demands for punishing concessions from Kyiv. “Ukrainians want peace — a just peace that respects everyone’s sovereignty, a durable peace that can’t be called into question by future aggression,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. “But peace cannot be a capitulation.” The White House has not commented on the reported proposals. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that Washington would “continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict”. ”Achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions,” Rubio wrote. A US Army delegation, led by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and the Army’s Chief of Staff Randy George, was in Kyiv and expected to meet Zelenskiy late on Thursday. They met Ukraine’s top military commander Oleksandr Syrskyi late on Wednesday. Syrskyi said he told them the best way to secure a just peace was to defend Ukraine’s airspace, extend its ability to strike deep into Russia and stabilise the front line. Fourth winter approaching Russia has been pounding Ukrainian cities and infrastructure with nightly bombardments, killing civilians and causing power cuts as winter sets in. Authorities said 22 people were still missing and 26 dead from airstrikes that destroyed an apartment block early on Wednesday, one of the worst attacks in months. In Ternopil in western Ukraine, hundreds of miles from the front, smoke was still rising from smouldering masonry as crews on cranes tried to make nearby buildings safe and uncover more bodies. Ihor Cherepanskyi was searching for the body of his great-grandmother, who had lived on the sixth floor. After the strike, he had run into the building to try to rescue her, but made it only as far as the fifth floor before the ceiling caved in. “What kind of ‘strategic target’ is this?” he said. With the fourth winter approaching of Europe’s deadliest war in eight decades, Russian troops have been inching forward and are poised to finally capture their first substantial city in nearly two years, the ruined eastern railway hub of Pokrovsk. Ukraine said on Thursday it had received 1,000 bodies from Russia in the latest swap of human remains from the battlefield. A view of a damaged apartment building in Pokrovsk, Ukraine, in a screenshot taken from a video released on November 20.  — Russian Defence Ministry via Reuters Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022, occupies almost a fifth of Ukraine and says it will fight on unless Ukraine cedes additional land, accepts permanent neutrality and cuts its armed forces. Ukraine says that would amount to capitulation and leave it unprotected should Russia attack again. After the early months when Ukraine fended off Russia’s assault on Kyiv and recaptured swathes of territory, the war has settled for three years into a relentless grind along a 1,000-kilometre front line, with huge losses on both sides. A Ukrainian counterattack stalled in 2023, and since then, Moscow has made slow but relentless progress, with the enemies separated across a charred no-man’s land, hunting each other’s forces down with drones. Moscow says its expected capture of Pokrovsk will lead to further battlefield gains. Kyiv says Russia’s advances have only limited strategic significance, but it lacks the capability to halt them. Trump, who returned to office this year vowing to swiftly end the war, has reoriented US policy away from staunchly supporting Ukraine towards accepting some of Moscow’s justifications for its invasion. But he has also imposed sanctions on Russia’s two main oil companies, a step never taken by his more overtly pro-Ukrainian predecessor Joe Biden. November 21 is the deadline for foreign buyers of Russian oil to wind down their purchases.",
