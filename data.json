The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) held a meeting marking the launch of the development project at the headquarters of HD Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan, South Gyeongsang Province. Under the plan, the agency aims to replace the combat systems and towed array sonars of three KSS-II submarines with the latest equipment by 2033. They will also be newly equipped with mine avoidance sonars and buoyant wire antennas, according to DAPA. The planned upgrade is expected to significantly enhance the submarines' operational capabilities, including their detection, navigation and attack skills, and help demonstrate the optimal combat system developed through homegrown technology, DAPA said.",

      "summary_orig": "In fresh comments on the military escalation between Pakistan and Indian in May, United States President Donald Trump has said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif phoned him to say that he had “saved millions”, adding that it took the threat of “350 per cent tariffs” to end the conflict. Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared earlier this year when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was blamed on Islamabad, which denied the accusations. The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump in May, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries. Addressing the US-Saudi Investment Forum on Wednesday, the US president said, “I’m good at settling disputes, and I’ve always been — I’ve done very well with that over the years. “India, Pakistan — they were going to go at it, nuclear weapons. I said that’s okay, you can go at it, but I’m putting a 350pc tariff on each country. No more trade with the United States,” he said. “No, no you can’t do that,” Trump said, doing an impression. “I said I am going to do it. Come back to me and I’ll take it down, but I’m not going to have you guys shooting nuclear weapons at each other, killing millions of people and having the nuclear dust floating over Los Angeles. I’m not going to do it,” he said, reiterating that it took the threat of a 350pc tariff to settle the conflict. “No other president would have done that. Joe Biden doesn’t even know what countries we are talking about. He wouldn’t have any idea,” Trump said as laughter rang out. The US president said that he settled five out of eight wars he has taken credit for ending by threatening tariffs. “I tell you what, the prime minister of Pakistan called me … he actually said I saved millions — and he said in front of Susie. He said, ‘President Trump saved millions and millions of lives. He doesn’t even know that, but he saved millions of lives’.” The person the US president was referring to appeared to be White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. Trump also said he had received a call from Indian PM Narendra Modi, recounting the exchange between the two, where the latter said that “we’re not going to go to war”. “I said, ‘Thank you very much. Let’s make a deal’.” Trump also recounted his role in ending other conflicts, including brokering a peace plan for Gaza in October, saying, “I’ve settled eight wars. I have one to go.” However, he expressed disappointment in Russian President Vladimir Putin for his resistance to ending Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. “I thought that was going to be my easy one, because I have a good relationship with President Putin,” he said. “But I’m a little disappointed in President Putin right now. He knows that.” The US president also said that the Saudi crown prince wanted him “to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan ” and expressed his resolve to turn his attention there, although it had not previously been “on his charts”. “I just see how important that is to you … and we’re going to start working in Sudan,” he said to applause. “I didn’t think that that was one that was going to be so easy to do, but we’re going to start working.” The US president has previously stated on several occasions that five to eight planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September. India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.",

      "summary_orig": "KABUL: The Afghan Taliban trade minister arrived in India on Wednesday on a maiden visit to draw greater investments and goods, as both countries consider ways to enhance their relations in the backdrop of Kabul’s souring relations with neighbouring Pakistan. India last month upgraded its ties with the Taliban by reopening its embassy in Kabul that was shut in 2021, following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces. New Delhi is also ramping up its aid to the country as it competes with China for influence. Minister Alhaj Noor­uddin Azizi will hold talks with his Indian counterpart and the foreign minister, as well as with traders and investors, Afgha­nistan’s commerce ministry said in a statement. “These meetings will focus on expanding economic cooperation, facilitating trade relations, creating joint investment opportunities, and stren­g­thening Afgh­anis­tan’s role in regional transit routes,” it added. Landlocked Afgh­a­nis­tan is seeking access to grains, medicines and industrial goods following the closure of its border with Pakistan in recent weeks after armed clashes last month between the neighbours over cross-border terrorism. In the past six months, Afghanistan’s trade through Iran has reached $1.6 billion, higher than the $1.1 billion exchanged with Pakistan, Afgha­ni­stan’s commerce ministry told Reuters. “Advancing bilateral trade and investment ties are the key focus of the visit,” Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry, wrote on X along with a photograph of Azizi’s arrival in Delhi.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: At least 27 militants were killed and several others wounded in encounters with security personnel in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, sources said on Wednesday. They said an intelligence-based operation was carried out on the reported presence of nearly two dozen terrorists in Kurram district’s  Manato and Marzai areas, sources said, adding that they were hiding in a residential area and planted explosives in a house. During the operation, they said, 22 militants were killed, while there were reports about some security personnel being injured due to an explosion, though locals remained unhurt. No official statement was issued by the ISPR on developments in Kurram. However, the military’s media wing, in a post on X, stated on Wednesday night that in a failed attempt to target innocent civilians in Bannu, an Indian-sponsored terrorist got eliminated while planting an improvised explosive device. The ISPR said: “The incident highlights the growing desperation of the khwarij, who, due to sustained and effective pressure from security forces and law enforcement agencies, were increasingly resorting to cowardly attempts against soft targets. Their failed actions reflect their diminishing capabilities and frustration in the face of ongoing counter terrorism efforts.” Earlier, the military’s media wing said that security forces carried out intelligence-based operations (IBO) on the reported presence of, what the official statement said Fitna al Khwarij, in Bajaur, North Waziristan and Dera Ismail Khan disttricts on Nov 17 and 18. It said troops effectively engaged a terrorist’s location in Bajaur. After an intense exchange of fire, one terrorist was killed. It read that more militants were neutralised in an IBO conducted in the Spinwam and Zakir Khel areas of North Waziristan district, while another terrorist was killed in Dera Ismail Khan. In Lakki Marwat, two militants were killed in an exchange of fire with counterterrorism department (CTD) personnel, police said. A statement issued by CTD said the militants were killed during an intelligence-based operation carried out in Sraye Norang area of the district. It explained the militants opened fire on the CTD team as soon as they saw them. The CTD team retaliated and killed two militants, later identified as Mohammad Sohail and Azmatullah alias Hafiz.

Their failed actions reflect their diminishing capabilities and frustration in the face of ongoing counter terrorism efforts.” Earlier, the military’s media wing said that security forces carried out intelligence-based operations (IBO) on the reported presence of, what the official statement said Fitna al Khwarij, in Bajaur, North Waziristan and Dera Ismail Khan disttricts on Nov 17 and 18. It said troops effectively engaged a terrorist’s location in Bajaur. After an intense exchange of fire, one terrorist was killed. It read that more militants were neutralised in an IBO conducted in the Spinwam and Zakir Khel areas of North Waziristan district, while another terrorist was killed in Dera Ismail Khan. In Lakki Marwat, two militants were killed in an exchange of fire with counterterrorism department (CTD) personnel, police said. A statement issued by CTD said the militants were killed during an intelligence-based operation carried out in Sraye Norang area of the district. It explained the militants opened fire on the CTD team as soon as they saw them. The CTD team retaliated and killed two militants, later identified as Mohammad Sohail and Azmatullah alias Hafiz.

Brazil knew that they wanted to host this COP since three years ago, probably even earlier.

      "summary": "As president Lula tries to find common ground between negotiating countries, planetary scientists say emissions must be urgently cut Mother Earth is watching over Cop30. “I am taking care to watch over all the decisions taken here about me,” she told the Guardian. The blessing card she presented said: “Knowing the powerful impact my thoughts can have on others and the environment, I choose to create a positive mindset.” This beautiful vision is in everyday life Nazaré Oliveira, an indigenous woman from Belém, and a descendant of the Potyguar people. She is part of the international spiritual organisation Brahma Kumaris , led by women and which uses meditation to emphasise the concept of identity as souls rather than bodies and the idea that humanity and nature are one. This is my fifth COP. I’ve been around since COP26 in Glasgow and this has been the most militarised COP I’ve attended. We had really high expectations because I’m from Latin America, and this is also the Latin American COP – apart from the Amazonian and the Brazilian Cop. So we had really high expectations of also being able to demonstrate, protest and exercise our right to the civic space. But we have encountered heavy militarisation and a heavy crackdown on civil society protesting outside the venue. I think it’s very disconcerting. Like it was definitely a very racist letter where the UN seems to want to inflict power over the autonomous territory of Brazilian authorities. I think this is a confrontation that is needed. What’s happening in between civil society, the military and the UN, it’s a reflection of the tension that exists within this space. So I hope for this COP that the United Nations authorities and the Brazilian authorities open their eyes and they realise that what they are doing, what they are inflicting with the militarisation of COP is completely opposite of what they have been preaching in the last three years. Brazil knew that they wanted to host this COP since three years ago, probably even earlier. So the way that they are responding to it does not show that they were ready to receive all this flow of international civil society. So my hope is that they can release, relax the heavy militarization that they’re putting in the space and allow us to use the civic space to demonstrate. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "At least 25 Palestinians were killed in four Israeli airstrikes on Wednesday in Gaza since a shaky ceasefire took effect in October, health authorities said. Medics said 10 people were killed in the Gaza City suburb of Zeitoun, two in the Shujaiya suburb to the east and the rest in two separate attacks in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. The Israeli military claimed its forces struck Hamas targets across Gaza after members of the Palestinian group fired on its troops in violation of the nearly six-week-old ceasefire. No Israeli forces were injured. Multiple air strikes have pointed to the fragility of the ceasefire. Israel and Hamas have traded blame for what both call violations of the US-brokered truce, the first stage of President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan for a post-war Gaza. All three attacks were far beyond an agreed-upon imaginary “yellow line” separating the areas under Israeli and Palestinian control, according to medics, witnesses and Palestinian media. The Zeitoun attack was on a building belonging to Muslim religious authorities and the Khan Younis attack was on a UN-run club, both of which house displaced families. The October 10 ceasefire in the two-year Gaza war has eased the conflict, enabling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to Gaza’s ruins. Israel has pulled troops back from city positions, and aid flows have increased. But violence has not completely halted. Palestinian health authorities say Israeli forces have killed at least 305 people in strikes on Gaza since the truce, nearly half of them in one day last week when Israel retaliated for an attack on its troops. Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire began and claimed it has targeted scores of fighters.",

He said the decision to lift the legal move to prevent Nexperia from moving intellectual property and physical assets from its European factory in Hamburg and its corporate headquarters in Nijmegen was the “right step” after consultation with the European Commission and others. “The Netherlands has considered it the right moment to take a constructive step by suspending the order under the Goods Availability Act, in close consultation with European and international partners. The Netherlands will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the Chinese authorities in the period ahead.” Continue reading...",

      "title_orig": "Saudi crown prince heads to a friendlier US Congress",
      "summary_orig": "Lawmakers are set to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) at the United States Capitol on Wednesday on the second day of a visit to the US that has aimed to tout stronger-than-ever economic and security ties with Washington while brushing off scrutiny of his human rights record. President Donald Trump gave bin Salman a lavish welcome at the White House on Tuesday and defended him over the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, which US intelligence agencies have concluded the crown prince approved. A handful of Republican members of Congress, including House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast attended a black-tie dinner at the White House for bin Salman on Tuesday, according to a White House official. MBS was considered an outcast by Washington in the aftermath of the Khashoggi killing, but his rehabilitation was rubber-stamped this week. In one example of this, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who as a US senator in 2019 denounced the crown prince as a “gangster”, sat a few steps away during Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting. Trump repeatedly said it was “an honour” to be friends with the Saudi leader. This was in sharp contrast to Washington’s view of the Saudi leader during Trump’s first term, as members of Congress became angry with Riyadh’s role in the civil war in Yemen and its human rights record, fueled by Khashoggi’s murder at a Saudi consulate in Turkiye. “He is reckless, he’s ruthless, he has a penchant for escalation, for taking high risks, confrontational in his foreign policy approach and I think increasingly willing to test the limits of what he can get away with the United States,” Rubio said at the time. There were multiple and persistent calls from members of Congress for accountability. The crown prince has denied ordering the operation but acknowledged responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto ruler. In 2019, Congress passed a resolution demanding an end to military support for the Saudi-led coalition waging war in Yemen, although there were too few votes to overturn Trump’s veto. Subdued reception Although memories of that time may have faded, MBS’s reception on Capitol Hill on Wednesday was likely to be far more subdued than the welcomes given to other world leaders. The crown prince arrived at the Capitol building on Wednesday morning, where congressional aides said Johnson was holding a reception for him attended by some Democratic as well as Republican members of Congress. The meeting was not announced and the speaker’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither Johnson nor Republican Senate Leader John Thune planned the type of press opportunity, with photos and brief remarks, that is often held when world leaders visit the Capitol. A handful of lawmakers criticised MBS this time around. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, where Khashoggi lived, blasted Trump after the Oval Office meeting with MBS. “Instead of rolling out the red carpet for MBS and leveraging the presidency for private hotel deals, Trump should be demanding accountability on behalf of Khashoggi’s Virginia-based family and pressing Saudi Arabia to advance US security interests. Unfortunately, this is just the most recent example of Trump placing his personal financial interests above the interest of the American people,” he said in a statement. MBS, who agreed in the meeting to increase the kingdom’s planned investments in the US to $1 trillion from $600 billion, is also attending an investment conference in Washington on Wednesday that will include CEOs from major US companies. The two sides also announced new agreements on arms sales, civil nuclear cooperation and artificial intelligence after the meeting. Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the foreign relations panel, said she was concerned about some of the initiatives announced during the visit, and called on Trump and his administration to brief the committee on every commitment.",

Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “On [the] reported presence of khwarij , an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the security forces in Bajaur district,” the statement read. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, one kharji was sent to hell.” The ISPR said that two more terrorists were killed in IBOs conducted in the areas of Spinwam and Zakir Khel in North Waziristan, while another terrorist was killed in an IBO in Dera Ismail Khan District. “Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian sponsored killed khwarij , who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement added. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as [the] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm e Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.” Yesterday, the ISPR said that 38 terrorists had been killed in counter-terrorism operations carried out from November 15-17 in KP. The first IBO was conducted by security forces in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said. In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan district, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said. In a separate statement later in the day, the ISPR said two IBOs took place between November 16-17 in Bajaur district and Bannu district, killing 11 and 12 terrorists, respectively. It added that terrorist ringleader Sajjad alias Abuzar was also killed in the Bajaur IBO. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.",

      "title_orig": "PTI denounces ‘brutal’ attack on Imran’s sisters, will observe countrywide ‘black day’ on Friday",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI on Wednesday strongly condemned the Punjab government for unleashing “ a reign of terror ” on party founder Imran Khan’s sisters, party leaders, lawyers, and workers outside Adiala Jail, describing the act as utterly intolerable and completely unacceptable. The party announced that the opposition alliance would observe a countrywide ‘black day’ on Friday to demand the restoration of the Constitution, the rule of law and ‘real freedom’, as Imran repeatedly stated that the nation was left with no choice but to choose between freedom and death. Speaking at a press conference alongside Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Niazi — as well as Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and other party leaders, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja condemned the acts carried out on Tuesday night and issued a stern warning to the authorities. He stated that the PTI continued to urge those in power to abandon their “reckless arrogance” and act responsibly before it was too late. Raja emphasised that it was the undeniable constitutional right of Imran’s sisters to meet their brother — a right no authority could take away. The PTI secretary general warned that no society could survive, let alone progress, without the freedom of speech, press, conscience and an independent judiciary. “We are confronting a power structure intoxicated by its own might, blind to morality and law,” he said, vowing, “We will expose this tyranny, for God’s justice may be silent but is relentless — no oppressor will escape it.” Speaking on the occasion, Aleema denounced the alleged assault on her sister and others by police units. She alleged that a female officer openly directed male personnel to beat the protesters. “Yesterday, our people, including MPAs and MNAs, were subjected to violence,” Aleema said. Imran’s sister claimed that the PTI founder was placed in solitary confinement while party members peacefully exercised their court-approved right to demand justice. She recalled that police allegedly threw 71-year-old Noreen to the ground, dragged her, forcibly pulled women’s dupattas, slapped them and beat young girls, locking them in vans with male detainees. “Women officers, armed with batons, acted as Gullu Buttnis , and one even directed the others, shouting: ‘Beat them,’” she added. “Do you think that by beating us you can silence us? We will return and you cannot intimidate us,” Aleema vowed. She further asked, “Is this country now ruled by gangsters?” Imran’s sister affirmed that the family would continue to stand outside the jail for her brother, exposing oppressors and injustice. Aleema recalled that on August 4, 2023, a day before his arrest, Imran was asked to leave the country. “But he made it clear: I will not abandon my country,” she said, highlighting his 500-day-long trial without personal demands. PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram condemned the treatment and manhandling of Imran’s sisters, stating that such coercive and arbitrary tactics could not break the courage of the family, party leaders or workers. He vowed that the party would continue to strive for the country’s real independence, true democracy, constitutional supremacy and judicial independence come what may. Noreen vowed that the nation would never forget the tragedies of May 9 and November 26. “Those who have played with the lives of innocent people will never find peace,” she said, expressing gratitude to those on social media who continued “exposing the truth despite immense pressure”. “Every act of oppression will be accounted for,” she declared. Noreen stated that the authorities had crossed all limits — assaulting citizens, demolishing homes and smashing mobile phones to silence the people. “This brutality will not erase the truth, nor break the resolve of the people,” she asserted. She noted that her son, Hassan Niazi, remained imprisoned, yet the “oppression outside jail is even more frightening”. Recounting her own ordeal, Noreen said, “I still do not know where they took the woman who grabbed me. She pulled me by my hair, threw me to the ground and dragged me across the road.” Noreen praised those facing military trials for their bravery and unwavering resolve despite intimidation. Uzma expressed deep concern over her brother’s condition, stating that he had been in solitary confinement for the past two weeks. “Yesterday, we simply requested permission to see him to ensure his well-being,” she said. She added that Imran urged the nation to prepare, declaring that the time had come to choose between freedom or death. “If they want to beat us, let them. If they want to throw us in jail, let them. We are not afraid.“ Abbas too condemned the treatment of women outside Adiala Jail, calling the manhandling and snatching of headscarves an “unforgivable national disgrace”. “No civilised society, culture, or moral framework — legal, religious or traditional — permits violence against women. What happened yesterday stains our collective conscience,” he said. “What crime has the PTI founder committed? His sole ‘offence’ is speaking the truth and standing fearlessly with the people,” he remarked. Abbas described the movement as unstoppable, highlighting this Friday’s countrywide ‘black day’, symbolised by black flags and ribbons, as a “decisive moment”. “All notions of lifetime immunity violate the Holy Quran, Sunnah and Constitution — a false idol born of fear,” he added, urging critics of Imran to emulate his “integrity, courage, and commitment to justice” rather than harbouring hatred. KP Minister Meena Khan Afridi said that after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the path to justice had become extremely difficult, yet the judiciary must at least ensure the implementation of its own orders. He noted that Imran’s sisters and elected representatives reached Adiala Jail in full accordance with court directives, yet in the freezing cold, they were assaulted with water and police unleashed further violence. Afridi warned the station house officer involved in the events that “only your uniform shields you” and asked Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nwaz how she could authorise violence against women. He said KP would seek action and vowed they would return until allowed to meet Imran.",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday announced the allocation of 80 electric buses for Rawalpindi, aiming to improve public transportation and reduce congestion. The chief minister was scheduled to inaugurate the new transport system in the garrison city on October 15, but the ceremony was cancelled due to the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan protest in Islamabad. Addressing the inauguration ceremony of the electric bus initiative in Rawalpindi today, CM Maryam said, “The electric buses are equipped with modern amenities, including air conditioning, free Wi-Fi, and charging ports.” The initiative, the chief minister highlighted, is part of a broader effort to enhance infrastructure and public services in Rawalpindi. Other projects include signal-free corridors, flyovers, and hospitals. “The government has allocated significant funds for road construction and improvement,” she said, adding that the electric buses are part of a larger plan to promote sustainable transportation and reduce pollution. “The buses are wheelchair accessible and have dedicated compartments for women,” CM Maryam pointed out. She detailed that the fare for the buses is Rs20, with free travel for women, the elderly, and children with special needs. “The government has also launched initiatives to improve healthcare, education, and social welfare,” CM Maryam said. “New hospitals and schools are being built, and existing ones are being upgraded.” “Crime has reduced by 70 per cent in Punjab, and efforts are being made to further improve public safety,” she claimed. “The initiatives are part of a broader effort to promote development and improve the quality of life for citizens.” Earlier today, Dawn reported that in the first phase, 45 e-buses will be operated on four routes and the number of buses will be expanded in the coming days. “As Kutchery Chowk remodeling project is in progress, it is not included among the routes,” said Regional Transport Authority (RTA) Secretary Asad Shirazi told Dawn earlier. A total of seven buses will be operated from Saddar to Qabristan Chowk at Misrial Road via Qasim Market, Shalley Valley (total 7 kilometres), eight buses on the second route from Fawara Chowk to Koral Chowk via Liaquat Bagh and Sir Syed Road and the Old Airport Road (11.3 kilometres) and seven buses on the third route will be from Saddar Metro Bus Station to Munawar Colony via Tulsa Road. Moreover, 14 buses will be operated on the fourth route from Marrir Metro Bus Station to the Motorway Chowk via The Mall and Peshawar Road (13.1 kilometres).",

      "summary_orig": "The Punjab government has formed 12 joint investigation teams (JITs) to probe several cases registered against the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in Lahore and Sheikhupura districts, it emerged on Wednesday. The teams were notified by the provincial home department in similar notifications, of which 11 are dated November 6 and one was issued on October 31. According to the notifications, seen by Dawn , the provincial government ordered the formation of five JITs under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 for as many cases registered against the TLP in Sheikhupura district. Of these, four cases have been registered in Muridke tehsil and one in Ferozewala tehsil. Another seven JITs have been formed to carry out the investigation in as many cases registered in Lahore. Of these cases, three have been registered in the  Nawankot area, three in Shahdara Town and one in the Ravi Road area. For the cases registered in Sheikhupura, each JIT will comprise six members, including a superintendent of police (SP), sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), station house officer (SHO), investigating officer (IO), a representative from the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD) in the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP), and any co-opted member. For the cases lodged in Lahore, each JIT is to have five members, including SP Investigation, DSP Investigation, IO, a representative from CTD in the rank of DSP and any co-opted member. The notifications further added that the “convener of the JIT shall depute one of the members of the JIT, for the purpose of submission of the report,” as required by Section 19(1) of the ATA 1997. Crackdown on TLP In recent weeks, the Punjab government has intensified action against the TLP following a ban imposed on the party after a violent clash between TLP protesters and law enforcement personnel in Muridke last month. The now-banned group had launched a protest march in support of Gaza and Palestine, planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration outside the US embassy. However, the group’s movement was thwarted as violent clashes erupted, with reports of party workers attacking law enforcement agencies. Subsequently, the federal government imposed a ban on the party at the request of the Punjab government, concluding that TLP was “involved in terrorism and violent acts”. Meanwhile, authorities continue to look for TLP Chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi, whose disappearance has seemingly baffled the Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies. The TLP chief and his brother were marked as high-profile targets by the Punjab police for being wanted in more than 100 first information reports lodged against them. On October 29, the duo, including 21 other senior TLP leaders, were placed on the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL) to prevent them from travelling abroad. A senior officer in the Central Police Office (CPO) Lahore told Dawn on Nov 13 that so far, Lahore police have reportedly arrested a total of the group’s 1,250 key members, including their financiers and the workers wanted in over 100 criminal cases. The official said the provincial capital has been the hub of activities of the TLP’s top leadership and other workers for housing the headquarters of party. So, the major focus of the police remained on arrests of the hardcore members of the TLP from Lahore. A list of the targeted TLP members was prepared on the basis of the geofencing carried out in Lahore’s route that they had used to launch the march on Islamabad and in Muridke, where they had encountered the LEAs. The second list provided to all the 85 police stations of Lahore was of the financiers, the police official said, adding that the crackdowns continued daily. As per sources, the sufferings of the families of the ‘wanted’ TLP members have increased manifold due to the frequent police raids at their homes. A majority of the families have locked their houses and gone into hiding to avoid a police crackdown. On Tuesday, Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari detailed that assets worth Rs23.40 billion belonging to the TLP had been frozen, along with 92 bank accounts linked to the organisation.",

The teams were notified by the provincial home department in similar notifications, of which 11 are dated November 6 and one was issued on October 31. According to the notifications, seen by Dawn , the provincial government ordered the formation of five JITs under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 for as many cases registered against the TLP in Sheikhupura district. Of these, four cases have been registered in Muridke tehsil and one in Ferozewala tehsil. Another seven JITs have been formed to carry out the investigation in as many cases registered in Lahore. Of these cases, three have been registered in the  Nawankot area, three in Shahdara Town and one in the Ravi Road area. For the cases registered in Sheikhupura, each JIT will comprise six members, including a superintendent of police (SP), sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), station house officer (SHO), investigating officer (IO), a representative from the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD) in the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP), and any co-opted member. For the cases lodged in Lahore, each JIT is to have five members, including SP Investigation, DSP Investigation, IO, a representative from CTD in the rank of DSP and any co-opted member. The notifications further added that the “convener of the JIT shall depute one of the members of the JIT, for the purpose of submission of the report,” as required by Section 19(1) of the ATA 1997. Crackdown on TLP In recent weeks, the Punjab government has intensified action against the TLP following a ban imposed on the party after a violent clash between TLP protesters and law enforcement personnel in Muridke last month. The now-banned group had launched a protest march in support of Gaza and Palestine, planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration outside the US embassy. However, the group’s movement was thwarted as violent clashes erupted, with reports of party workers attacking law enforcement agencies. Subsequently, the federal government imposed a ban on the party at the request of the Punjab government, concluding that TLP was “involved in terrorism and violent acts”. Meanwhile, authorities continue to look for TLP Chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi, whose disappearance has seemingly baffled the Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies. The TLP chief and his brother were marked as high-profile targets by the Punjab police for being wanted in more than 100 first information reports lodged against them. On October 29, the duo, including 21 other senior TLP leaders, were placed on the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL) to prevent them from travelling abroad. A senior officer in the Central Police Office (CPO) Lahore told Dawn on Nov 13 that so far, Lahore police have reportedly arrested a total of the group’s 1,250 key members, including their financiers and the workers wanted in over 100 criminal cases. The official said the provincial capital has been the hub of activities of the TLP’s top leadership and other workers for housing the headquarters of party. So, the major focus of the police remained on arrests of the hardcore members of the TLP from Lahore. A list of the targeted TLP members was prepared on the basis of the geofencing carried out in Lahore’s route that they had used to launch the march on Islamabad and in Muridke, where they had encountered the LEAs. The second list provided to all the 85 police stations of Lahore was of the financiers, the police official said, adding that the crackdowns continued daily. As per sources, the sufferings of the families of the ‘wanted’ TLP members have increased manifold due to the frequent police raids at their homes. A majority of the families have locked their houses and gone into hiding to avoid a police crackdown. On Tuesday, Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari detailed that assets worth Rs23.40 billion belonging to the TLP had been frozen, along with 92 bank accounts linked to the organisation.",
