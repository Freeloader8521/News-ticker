      "summary_orig": "PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters, party workers and supporters commenced a sit-in on Tuesday at Factory Naka, near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, to demand their court-mandated meeting with the ex-premier. A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran over the past several weeks. Last Tuesday, after being denied a meeting with the PTI chief, his sisters and party supporters staged a sit-in , which was dispersed early morning with water cannons. Today, Imran’s sisters marched toward the prison before being stopped. Speaking to a reporter as she marched, Aleema said, “We will sit wherever we are stopped.” When asked if she had prepared for the deployment of water cannons or a prolonged sit-in, she replied that she had brought warm clothes and a blanket, showing the latter on camera. A large number of party workers and supporters participated in the sit-in, where a heavy contingent of police was also present. Speaking to reporters, Aleema stated that this occurs every Tuesday at the same location, maintaining that she and her party supporters are not engaging in any illegal or unconstitutional activities. “We have no other option left besides protesting,” she said. “Our founder’s demand is the restoration of the Constitution, democracy and the rule of law.” She claimed that the judiciary has been stripped of independence, unemployment is rising due to the stoppage of trade with Afghanistan and that the security situation is deteriorating. Referring to her sister Uzma’s brief meeting with Imran on December 2 and the government’s claim of “political conversations” that violated jail rules, Aleema urged the government to tell the family what was discussed. “Tell me what political matters my sister discussed in the last meeting. Political topics should be discussed with the people of the party,” she said. Naeem Haider Panjhuta, Imran’s spokesperson on legal affairs, filmed a video from the site of the sit-in, showing crowds of PTI workers staging the demonstration into this evening. “We are waiting for a meeting with Khan sahib . Today is the designated day for family and lawyers to meet him,” he said. “They are not letting us meet him, despite the IHC court order and visits being permitted in the jail manual.” PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who was also present at the sit-in, urged everyone to come and join the demonstration and express solidarity with the sisters of the party founder. “This is not only the job of the assembly members,” he said. “How can these people (the government) tell someone what can and cannot discuss in a meeting? Meanwhile, Noreen Niazi told reporters that the PTI is a peaceful political party and claimed that they had been “injured” by the water cannons deployed last week. She added that they would “do whatever is necessary to free Imran Khan” and maintained that he was unlawfully imprisoned. A livestream posted by the party on X showed crowds of young PTI supporters waving flags and chanting slogans as they made their way towards the prison. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health. In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes. Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards. Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”",

      "summary_orig": "In a message on the 11th anniversary of the Army Public School (APS) attack, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said the nation stood firm and united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism. In the deadliest terror attack in the country’s history, at least 144 people ─ mostly schoolchildren ─ were killed when heavily armed militants stormed the army-run public school on Dec 16, 2014. Seven soldiers of the Special Services Group and two officers were among the wounded. In a message posted on his X account, PM Shehbaz said, “Today, we commemorate the martyrs of the APS Peshawar tragedy — the innocent children, teachers and staff whose sacrifice is forever etched in our national conscience. “Their sacrifice remains a constant reminder of our collective responsibility to defeat terrorism,” the premier stressed. “The Pakistani nation will always stand united, firm and unwavering in its resolve to eradicate the scourge of terrorism,” he added, praying for the families of the martyrs. In his message, President Asif Ali Zardari remembered the sacrifices of the children and the staff, vowing to stand with the families of the martyrs. “Today, we remember the innocent children and staff of the Army Public School whose lives were taken in the brutal terrorist attack on December 16, 2014,” he said in a message posted by his spokesperson on X. “Their sacrifice remains a solemn reminder of the heavy price our nation has paid in the fight against terrorism,” the president said. He vowed to stand with the families “who continue to bear this pain with courage”. “The nation will always honour the resilience of the APS families who transformed their grief into strength for Pakistan,” he stressed. He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to eliminating terrorism, stating that the country’s resolve remained “absolute”. “There can be no soft corner for terrorists or those who support, finance, shelter or justify them,” he said, emphasising that “there can be no negotiations with those who raise arms against the state or target our children”. “We strongly condemn Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan,” he went on to say. The evidence of its involvement in efforts to destabilise our country is well documented. Pakistan will continue to expose these hostile activities and will defend its people with full resolve,” he said. The president warned terrorists’ “apologists, facilitators, and supporters” that the armed forces will not “spare them and will defeat terrorism, no matter what political, ideological or fake religious garb they try to shroud themselves in”. President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence services “whose efforts have prevented many such tragedies.” “We will continue to pursue every terrorist and every facilitator until justice is done,” he added. “The memory of the APS martyrs strengthens our resolve. Pakistan will never allow the enemies of peace to succeed,” the president concluded. The Foreign Office (FO) also issued statement, saying: “On the anniversary of the heinous terrorist attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan solemnly remembers the innocent children and teachers who were martyred in an act of sheer inhumanity. “Their sacrifice stands as an enduring symbol of the nation’s resolve to confront and defeat terrorism in all its forms.” The statement added that “this tragic anniversary underscores the continuing urgency of eradicating the menace of terrorism”. It highlighted that Pakistan had been among the hardest-hit countries in this fight, having lost more than 90,000 lives and borne immense economic and social costs. “These sacrifices remain an enduring reminder of Pakistan’s frontline role and unwavering commitment to counterterrorism.” The statement further said that Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies had a role in saving “countless precious lives — not only of Pakistanis, but also of people across the region and beyond”. The country’s security forces and law enforcement agencies continued to take decisive and effective action against terrorist groups, the statement said, adding that at the same time, “Pakistan faces a persistent threat from terrorist elements operating from across the border, with sustained support from our adversaries”. “We have consistently drawn attention to this challenge and have taken resolute measures to prevent terrorism from spilling over into our territory. “In doing so, Pakistan has acted as a bulwark against the spread of terrorism beyond its borders, contributing significantly to the security and stability of the wider region and beyond. “This unrefuted reality underscores the urgent need for concrete action to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries and to cut off all forms of support to all terrorist groups, including those targeting Pakistan,” the statement said. It added: “As we honor the martyrs of APS, Pakistan reaffirms its unshakeable resolve to protect its people, defend its sovereignty, and pursue its vision of lasting peace through unity, resilience, and an uncompromising stance against terrorism —irrespective of its origin.”",

      "summary_orig": "At least two people, including a constable, were killed after unidentified assailants attacked a polio team in the Salarzai tehsil of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, the police said, as the nationwide polio campaign entered its second day. The attack comes a day after the government launched the final polio campaign of 2025, which is set to run until December 21. Public Relations Officer (PRO) police, Israr Khan, confirmed to Dawn that two people, including a passerby and a policeman guarding the polio team, were killed in the attack on Tuesday afternoon in the Thangi area of Salarzai. Khan identified the martyred cop as Constable Sajad Ahmed, who passed away after sustaining critical injuries, while another civilian was “shot dead by the armed men when he attempted to chase after the assailants.” “Local residents also confirmed the account, while the assailants managed to escape,” Khan said, adding that the police had launched a search operation. He also confirmed that no polio workers were harmed in the incident. Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed, and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in KP. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack, extending condolences to the families of the deceased, according to a statement posted on X by his digital media spokesperson. “Polio workers and the security personnel assigned to protect them are performing their national responsibility,” KP CM was quoted as saying. He termed the incident “an assault on humanity and national responsibility”. He vowed that the “campaign will not be allowed to be impacted in any way”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack, expressing grief over the death of the police constable, state broadcaster PTV reported. He vowed to “bring the perpetrators to justice,” stressing that the campaign will continue until the virus is eradicated from the country. The premier also prayed for the “speedy recovery of the injured”. In October, a Levies constable deployed for the security of a polio team was killed when unidentified assailants opened fire on him in Swat. According to official data cited in a November 9 report, a total of 96 people had been killed by alleged terrorists in KP since 2012 until then, including 61 policemen, 27 health workers and five civilians. Also, 170 people, including 124 policemen, 28 health workers and 21 civilians, had been injured in attacks on polio teams. During this period, 32 health workers, three civilians and one policeman were kidnapped during vaccination campaigns. Of the people who were subjected to violence in the shape of death, injuries and kidnapping, 283 were men and 18 women. Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases this year, with the highest number of cases in KP at 19. Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts. Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.",

Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed, and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in KP. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack, extending condolences to the families of the deceased, according to a statement posted on X by his digital media spokesperson. “Polio workers and the security personnel assigned to protect them are performing their national responsibility,” KP CM was quoted as saying. He termed the incident “an assault on humanity and national responsibility”. He vowed that the “campaign will not be allowed to be impacted in any way”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack, expressing grief over the death of the police constable, state broadcaster PTV reported. He vowed to “bring the perpetrators to justice,” stressing that the campaign will continue until the virus is eradicated from the country. The premier also prayed for the “speedy recovery of the injured”. In October, a Levies constable deployed for the security of a polio team was killed when unidentified assailants opened fire on him in Swat. According to official data cited in a November 9 report, a total of 96 people had been killed by alleged terrorists in KP since 2012 until then, including 61 policemen, 27 health workers and five civilians. Also, 170 people, including 124 policemen, 28 health workers and 21 civilians, had been injured in attacks on polio teams. During this period, 32 health workers, three civilians and one policeman were kidnapped during vaccination campaigns. Of the people who were subjected to violence in the shape of death, injuries and kidnapping, 283 were men and 18 women. Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases this year, with the highest number of cases in KP at 19. Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts. Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.",

      "summary": "At least two people, including a constable, were killed after unidentified assailants attacked a polio team in the Salarzai tehsil of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, the police said, as the nationwide polio campaign entered its second day. The attack comes a day after the government launched the final polio campaign of 2025, which is set to run until December 21. Public Relations Officer (PRO) police, Israr Khan, confirmed to Dawn that two people, including a passerby and a policeman guarding the polio team, were killed in the attack on Tuesday afternoon in the Thangi area of Salarzai. Khan identified the martyred cop as Constable Sajad Ahmed, who passed away after sustaining critical injuries, while another civilian was “shot dead by the armed men when he attempted to chase after the assailants.” “Local residents also confirmed the account, while the assailants managed to escape,” Khan said, adding that the police had launched a search operation.

      "title_orig": "Police confirm Bondi gunman was from India’s Hyderabad; family claims no knowledge of his radicalisation",
      "summary_orig": "Indian police said on Tuesday that one of the gunmen in Australia’s Bondi Beach shooting , Sajid Akram, was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad but had limited contact with his family in India. The death toll in one of Australia’s worst mass shootings stands at 16, including 50-year-old Akram, who was shot by police. The man’s 24-year-old son and alleged accomplice, identified by local media as Naveed Akram, was in critical condition in hospital after also being shot. Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana state. Australian police said both men had travelled to the Philippines last month, the father on an Indian passport and the son on an Australian one. “The family members have expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalisation,” Telangana state police said in a statement. The purpose of the trip is under investigation, officials said, adding it was not conclusive whether they were linked to any terrorist group or whether they received training in that country. Telangana police said the factors that led to the radicalisation of the two gunmen “appear to have no connection with India or any local influence in Telangana”. In its statement on Tuesday, Telangana police said Sajid Akram visited India on six occasions, mainly for family-related reasons, since he migrated to Australia in 1998. There was no “adverse record” on him before he left India, the statement added. This screen grab made from UGC handout video footage courtesy of Timothy Brant-Coles shows two gunmen dressed in black firing multiple shots on a bridge at Bondi Beach in Sydney on December 14, 2025. — AFP Sajid and his son Naveed, who allegedly killed 15 people and wounded dozens of others at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, arrived on November 1 with the southern Philippine province of Davao listed as their final destination. The father and son spent nearly the entire month of November in the Philippines, Manila’s immigration department confirmed on Tuesday, with the father entering the country as an Indian national. “Sajid Akram, 50, Indian national, and Naveed Akram, 24, Australian national, arrived in the Philippines together last November 1, 2025 from Sydney, Australia,” immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval told AFP , adding they departed on November 28. Australian police said on Tuesday both men had travelled to the Philippines last month and the purpose of the trip is under investigation. Philippines police have said they are investigating the matter. Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country. They have been reduced to weakened cells operating in the southern Mindanao island in recent years, far from the scale of influence they wielded during the 2017 Marawi siege. “Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State, allegedly committed by a father and son,” Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said at a news conference. “These are the alleged actions of those who have aligned themselves with a terrorist organisation, not a religion.” Police also said the vehicle which is registered to the younger male contained improvised explosive devices and two homemade flags associated with ISIS, or Islamic State, a militant group designated by Australia and many other countries as a terrorist organisation. The father and son allegedly fired upon hundreds of people at the festival during a roughly 10-minute killing spree at one of Australia’s top tourist destinations, forcing people to flee and take shelter before both were shot by police. Some 25 survivors are receiving care in several Sydney hospitals, officials said. Australian PM says ‘Islamic State ideology’ drove Bondi Beach gunmen The father and son were driven by “Islamic State ideology” when they fired on crowds at Bondi Beach, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday. “It would appear that this was motivated by Islamic State ideology,” Albanese told national broadcaster ABC . “With the rise of ISIS more than a decade ago now, the world has been grappling with extremism and this hateful ideology,” he said in a separate interview. Albanese said Naveed, reportedly an unemployed bricklayer, had come to the attention of Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019 but was not considered an imminent threat at the time. “They interviewed him, they interviewed his family members, they interviewed people around him,” Albanese said. “He was not seen at that time to be a person of interest.” Memorial of flowers Israeli Ambassador Amir Maimon visited Bondi on Tuesday and urged the Australian government to take all required steps to secure the lives of Jews in Australia. “Only Australians of Jewish faith are forced to worship their gods behind closed doors, CCTV, guards,” Maimon told reporters in Bondi, after laying flowers at the temporary memorial and paying his respects to the victims. “My heart is torn apart … it is insane.” A string of anti-Semitic incidents in Australia has unfolded in the past 16 months, prompting the head of the nation’s main intelligence agency to declare that anti-Semitism was his top priority in terms of threat to life. At Bondi, the beach was open on Tuesday but was largely empty under overcast skies, as a growing memorial of flowers was established at the Bondi Pavilion, metres from the location of the shootings. Mourners gather at a tribute at the Bondi Pavilion in memory of the victims of a shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on December 16. — AFP Bondi is Sydney’s best-known beach, located about 8.2km (5 miles) from the city centre, and draws hundreds of thousands of international tourists each year. Olivia Robertson, 25, visited the memorial before work. “This is the country that our grandparents have come to for us to feel safe and to have opportunity,” she said. “And now this has happened right here in our backyard. It’s pretty shocking.” Ahmed al Ahmed, the 43-year-old Muslim father-of-two who charged at one of the gunmen and seized his rifle, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds. He has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump. A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.9 million ($1.26 million). Tougher gun laws Australia’s gun laws are now being examined by the federal government, after police said Sajid Akram was a licenced gun owner and had six registered weapons. Akram received his gun licence in 2023, not 2015 as had been earlier stated, police said on Tuesday. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said gun laws introduced by the previous conservative Liberal-National coalition government following the Port Arthur massacre needed to be re-examined. Former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the gun restrictions in 1996, said on Tuesday he didn’t want to see gun law reform become a “diversion” from the need to tackle anti-Semitism. Albanese had let the Jewish community down, Howard told reporters. “He should have done more to fight anti-Semitism, a lot more,” he said. The 15 victims ranged from a rabbi who was a father of five, to a Holocaust survivor, to a 10-year-old girl named Matilda Britvan, according to interviews, officials and media reports. Two police officers remained in critical but stable condition in hospital, New South Wales police said. Matilda’s aunt has spoken publicly of her family’s heartbreak, saying they were devastated by her death. “I am beyond belief that this happened. I look on the phone and I am hoping it’s like a little big joke, not real,” Lina Chernykh told 7NEWS Australia.",

      "summary_en": "Indian police said on Tuesday that one of the gunmen in Australia’s Bondi Beach shooting , Sajid Akram, was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad but had limited contact with his family in India. The death toll in one of Australia’s worst mass shootings stands at 16, including 50-year-old Akram, who was shot by police. The man’s 24-year-old son and alleged accomplice, identified by local media as Naveed Akram, was in critical condition in hospital after also being shot. Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana state. Australian police said both men had travelled to the Philippines last month, the father on an Indian passport and the son on an Australian one. “The family members have expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalisation,” Telangana state police said in a statement. The purpose of the trip is under investigation, officials said, adding it was not conclusive whether they were linked to any terrorist group or whether they received training in that country. Telangana police said the factors that led to the radicalisation of the two gunmen “appear to have no connection with India or any local influence in Telangana”. In its statement on Tuesday, Telangana police said Sajid Akram visited India on six occasions, mainly for family-related reasons, since he migrated to Australia in 1998. There was no “adverse record” on him before he left India, the statement added. This screen grab made from UGC handout video footage courtesy of Timothy Brant-Coles shows two gunmen dressed in black firing multiple shots on a bridge at Bondi Beach in Sydney on December 14, 2025. — AFP Sajid and his son Naveed, who allegedly killed 15 people and wounded dozens of others at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, arrived on November 1 with the southern Philippine province of Davao listed as their final destination. The father and son spent nearly the entire month of November in the Philippines, Manila’s immigration department confirmed on Tuesday, with the father entering the country as an Indian national. “Sajid Akram, 50, Indian national, and Naveed Akram, 24, Australian national, arrived in the Philippines together last November 1, 2025 from Sydney, Australia,” immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval told AFP , adding they departed on November 28. Australian police said on Tuesday both men had travelled to the Philippines last month and the purpose of the trip is under investigation. Philippines police have said they are investigating the matter. Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country. They have been reduced to weakened cells operating in the southern Mindanao island in recent years, far from the scale of influence they wielded during the 2017 Marawi siege. “Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State, allegedly committed by a father and son,” Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said at a news conference. “These are the alleged actions of those who have aligned themselves with a terrorist organisation, not a religion.” Police also said the vehicle which is registered to the younger male contained improvised explosive devices and two homemade flags associated with ISIS, or Islamic State, a militant group designated by Australia and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.

      "summary_orig": "Flowers were laid on Tuesday in front of the shuttered shop of Ahmed al Ahmed, the 43-year-old tobacco shop owner who locals hailed as the Bondi hero after he wrestled a gun from one of the attackers during a mass shooting on Sydney’s Bondi Beach. Ahmed was identified on social media as the bystander who hid behind parked cars before charging at the gunman from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. The act saved several lives, authorities have said. View this post on Instagram “I think he’s a role model for us all and it really encompasses the Aussie spirit and I’m incredibly proud to live in the area and I think everybody is, it blows me away, absolutely blows me away,” said Adam Pogorzelski, a local resident in Ahmed’s neighbourhood, in the suburb of Sutherland, about 26 kilometres from the centre of Sydney. Ahmed, a father of two, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited him earlier on Tuesday and told media that Ahmed will undergo more surgery. Ahmed has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump who said Ahmed was “a very, very brave person” who saved many lives. A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$2 million. A 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son allegedly carried out the attack at a Jewish celebration on Sunday afternoon, killing 15 people in the country’s worst mass shooting in almost 30 years. “I was actually proud when I saw it, I thought to myself, wow is that Ahmed, because I know him, then I looked at it twice and then I realised it was him …,” said a 20-year-old worker at a neighbouring chemist who did not wish to be named.“What he did was unbelievable.”",

      "summary_orig": "The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday ordered the trial court hearing the controversial social media posts case against rights activist Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha to record witnesses’ statements afresh within three days. IHC’s Justice Mohammed Azam Khan passed the directives while hearing a petition filed by Mazari challenging the trial court’s November 19 order, when the court had recorded the testimonies of all prosecution witnesses. Chattha had appeared before the court while Imaan’s lawyers had marked her presence. The court, however, had ordered the prosecution to proceed with the witnesses’ testimonies. On Tuesday, IHC’s Justice Khan observed that witnesses’ statements should be recorded again and said that the case was being referred back to the trial court without touching its merits. During the hearing, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad told the court that senior advocate Faisal Siddiqui had submitted his power of attorney but was busy with cases in Lahore, seeking a hearing after court vacations. He also pointed out that the Supreme Court (SC) had directed an early decision in the matter, though no specific timeframe was fixed. Last week, the apex court had stayed trial proceedings against the two until their pending appeals were decided by the IHC. Meanwhile, the prosecutor, Raja Naveed, maintained that the complete record was available before the court. Azad then argued that the accused were entitled to full protection under Article 10A (right to a fair trial) of the Constitution and raised the objection that the record had not been properly provided. He contended that the issue had been raised at the previous hearing as well. During the hearing, the court also questioned whether the statement of the four witnesses had been recorded in the absence of one of the accused. At this, the prosecutor responded by saying that the conduct of the accused was also a relevant factor. Defence counsel Azad insisted that witness statements must be recorded in the presence of the accused and sought time until Monday. Subsequently, the court issued directives to the trial court. The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca). The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.",

IHC’s Justice Mohammed Azam Khan passed the directives while hearing a petition filed by Mazari challenging the trial court’s November 19 order, when the court had recorded the testimonies of all prosecution witnesses. Chattha had appeared before the court while Imaan’s lawyers had marked her presence. The court, however, had ordered the prosecution to proceed with the witnesses’ testimonies.

      "summary_orig": "Ten people among those who were kidnapped by Katcha area dacoits from a Quetta-bound bus near Ubauro in Sindh’s Ghotki district have been recovered, Sukkur police said on Tuesday, adding that an operation for the rescue of the remaining passengers was under way. Around 15 dacoits had attacked the bus on Monday night and kidnapped several passengers after injuring the driver. A statement from the office of Sukkur Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) captain (retd) Faisal Abdullah Chachar today said that 10 of the kidnapped passengers had been rescued in an overnight operation under the DIG’s command. “Police and Rangers personnel rescued 10 of the abducted passengers after an exchange of fire [with the dacoits] in Sonmiani,” the statement said. Quoting the rescued passengers, it added that at least two dacoits were injured during the operation. “All routes leading to the Katcha area were blocked, preventing the bandits from taking the hostages there,” the statement said, adding that the blockade was still in place and would continue “until all bandits are eliminated”. It further stated that the dacoits were being chased and “the fight with them is ongoing” for the recovery of the remaining passengers. Meanwhile, the rescued passengers were taken to safe locations. The attack According to some videos shared on social media after 9:30pm on Monday, a passenger said a Sadabahar Company coach departed for Quetta from Sadiqabad at 8pm. When it reached near the Murid Shaikh area near M-5 Motorway, it took a turn towards Guddu at the Punjab-Sindh border. Some 65kms from the area, the dacoits intercepted the coach and started firing. They entered the bus after smashing the windows and asked the passengers to leave the coach, but did not harm the female passengers. It was reported that the dacoits had kidnapped 25 passengers, but the number of abducted passengers has not been confirmed by police yet. Katcha is the area of land running along the Indus River, which is divided between Punjab and Sindh. The region is notorious for banditry. For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets, brutal killings and robberies on major highways occur frequently. PTI leader’s condemnation PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, in a statement, condemned Monday night’s incident and  called into question the efficiency of Sindh and Punjab police. “More than twenty citizens were kidnapped; now their bids will be put up,” he said, stressing that the rulers were “failing” to protect their citizens. He noted that Katcha areas had been declared “no-go” areas. Sheikh called for the immediate release of all the hostages.",

      "summary_orig": "Police armed with rifles will be part of a beefed up security presence at the third Test between Australia and England at Adelaide Oval after the Bondi Beach shooting attacks , officials said, while flags will be flown at half-mast. South Australia state Premier Peter Malinauskas said extra measures would be in place for the Ashes clash that starts on Wednesday, although there was no intelligence pointing to an elevated threat level. “Given the events that have occurred in Sydney, there will be additional protocols put in place at Adelaide Oval,” he said late Monday. “This is done only as a precautionary measure, but it is appropriate that we are in an increasing sense of alertness just at the moment.” An attack by a father and son on a Jewish celebration at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on Sunday killed 15 people with dozens injured. One of the assailants was killed, while the other is in a critical condition in hospital. South Australia Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said special security-response police, armed with rifles, would be present in and around the Adelaide Oval during the Test. “There’s a balance between the concern about police officers carrying rifles in and about the community, balanced with the need for us to be able to effectively respond to an event, should an event occur and these officers are specifically trained for that purpose,” he said. “There’s no intelligence at this time to indicate that there are any increased levels of threat or security risks around the cricket or any other community event,” he said. Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board released a joint statement to pay tribute to the Bondi Beach victims, saying they were “horrified”. “All of our thoughts are with the victims, their friends and families, the Jewish community and the people of Australia at this deeply distressing time,” they said. “Our condolences go out to all those affected.” There will be a moment of silence observed before the Test and players from both sides will wear black armbands. “While sport can seem insignificant at times like this, we have the unusual opportunity to bring millions of people together to pay tribute, to console and to contemplate what we want our nation to be,” said Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg. “We will continue to look at ways cricket can support and honour those who have been affected by the Bondi shootings and thank those who provided assistance during and since this tragedy.”",

      "summary_orig": "GWADAR: A large group of armed men looted millions of rupees from three private banks while counter-terrorism department (CTD) personnel along with local police foiled two other bank robberies after heavy gun battle in Panjgur on Monday. A CTD official and a civilian lost their lives and three other police personnel injured in a heavy exchange of fire took place as the armed robbers atte­mpted to loot two other banks, including National Bank of Pakistan, in Chitkan Bazaar. Officials said over 50 heavily armed men arrived in the area in several vehicles and barged into three banks in the main bazaar area and looted millions of rupees after holding the security guards and staff hostage at gun point. After looting three private banks, the armed men then attempted to enter the NBP and another bank. In the meantime, officials said, police and CTD personnel reached the site and challenged them. Police claim to have foiled two more bank heists “Armed men used heavy weapons in the gun battle and lobbed grenades, which continued for at least an hour,” SSP Dost Muhammad Bugti said, adding police and CTD officials returned fire. During the exchange of fire, the CTD official, Dura Baloch, and the civilian, Amanullah, emb­r­aced martyrdom and three other cops suffered injuries, while armed robbers fled, police said. “The armed men belonged to a banned militant organisation,” an official of the local administration said on the condition of anonymity. According to some media reports, armed men looted around Rs190 million from three banks. Security officials said that an operation was launched in the area to trace out the armed gang. However, no arrest was reported till filing of this report on late Monday night. Eyewitness account said the bodies and injured were shifted to Panjgur district hospital. Two CTD and police personnel were shifted to Karachi as they rece­ived serious injuries, they said. While lauding the timely and courageous response of the law enforcement personnel, Baloch­istan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said CTD and police personnel demonstrated exceptional bravery and professionalism in safeguarding the lives and property of citizens. The chief minister paid tribute to martyred CTD constable Dura Baloch, saluting his courage, sense of duty, and supreme sacrifice. He said the sacrifices of brave sons like Dara Khan would never be forgotten and that the nation remains indebted to the blood of its martyrs. Expressing heartfelt condolences to the family of the martyred civilian, the chief minister prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the deceased. He reiterated that there was no place for terrorists and criminal elements in Balochistan and vowed that the state would continue operations against anti-state elements with full force. Mr Bugti emphasised the sacrifices of security forces for the restoration of peace and order would not go in vain and assured that the protection of life and property of the people would be ensured at all costs.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump sued the BBC on Monday for defamation over edited clips of a speech that made it appear he directed supporters to storm the US Capitol , opening an international front in his fight against media coverage he deems untrue or unfair. Trump accused Britain’s publicly owned broadcaster of defaming him by splicing together parts of a January 6, 2021 speech, including one section where he told supporters to march on the Capitol and another where he said “fight like hell”. It omitted a section in which he called for peaceful protest. Trump’s lawsuit alleges the BBC defamed him and violated a Florida law that bars deceptive and unfair trade practices. He is seeking $5 billion in damages for each of the lawsuit’s two counts. The BBC has apologised to Trump, admitted an error of judgment and acknowledged that the edit gave the mistaken impression that he had made a direct call for violent action. But it has said there is no legal basis to sue. Trump, in his lawsuit filed on Monday in Miami federal court, said the BBC despite its apology “has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses”. The BBC is funded through a mandatory license fee on all TV viewers, which UK lawyers say could make any payout to Trump politically fraught. A spokesman for Trump’s legal team said in a statement the BBC “has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda”. A BBC spokesperson told Reuters earlier on Monday that it had “no further contact from President Trump’s lawyers at this point. Our position remains the same.” The broadcaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the lawsuit was filed. Crisis led to resignations Facing one of the biggest crises in its 103-year history, the BBC has said it has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any of its platforms. The dispute over the clip, featured on the BBC’s ‘Panorama’ documentary show shortly before the 2024 presidential election, sparked a public relations crisis for the broadcaster, leading to the resignations of its two most senior officials. Trump’s lawyers say the BBC caused him overwhelming reputational and financial harm. The documentary drew scrutiny after the leak of a BBC memo by an external standards adviser that raised concerns about how it was edited, part of a wider investigation of political bias at the publicly funded broadcaster. The documentary was not broadcast in the United States. Trump may have sued in the US because defamation claims in Britain must be brought within a year of publication, a window that has closed for the ‘Panorama’ episode. To overcome the US constitution’s legal protections for free speech and the press, Trump will need to prove not only that the edit was false and defamatory but also that the BBC knowingly misled viewers or acted recklessly. The broadcaster could argue that the documentary was substantially true and its editing decisions did not create a false impression, legal experts said. It could also claim the program did not damage Trump’s reputation. Other media have settled with Trump, including CBS and ABC when Trump sued them following his comeback win in the November 2024 election. Trump has filed lawsuits against the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal and a newspaper in Iowa, all three of which have denied wrongdoing. The attack on the US Capitol in January 2021 was aimed at blocking Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s presidential win over Trump in the 2020 US election.",

According to the state-run APP , the minister said the government recently provided foreign media with background information on how terrorists and organised networks were exploiting social media platforms to manipulate public opinion in Pakistan. The minister explained that investigations revealed how artificial trends were created and sold through WhatsApp groups and other platforms. He said individuals were paid small amounts ranging from a few rupees to cents per post to repeatedly tweet or forward messages, sometimes hundreds of times a day. Many of these accounts, he said, originate outside Pakistan and are operated by companies using fake identities. He added that account names are frequently changed depending on the campaign being promoted, making it harder to trace their origins. The state minister claimed the same networks had been found promoting content linked to terrorist organisations, as well as ‘unrelated international causes’, demonstrating that the activity was commercial rather than ideological. These trends are not organic or natural, he added. Mr Chaudhry clarified that the evidence shared was gathered directly from the same social media platforms being misused, including details of temporary WhatsApp groups formed to run trends and then deleted to avoid detection. He said social media companies’ own community guidelines were being violated, leading to account closures and further action by the platforms. While emphasising that the government did not want ordinary citizens to face criminal cases, the minister issued a clear warning, saying that if people knowingly became part of paid trends that were against the country, they could face legal consequences. Freedom of expression is not without responsibility, he said, claiming that no one had the right to hurt religious sentiments, target friendly countries, or malign individuals and institutions under the guise of free speech. Responding to questions, Mr Chaudhry stated that most accounts involved were fake and that privacy laws limited access to IP addresses and ownership details, although Pakistan was engaging with platforms and foreign governments to address the issue. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm condemnation of terrorism in all forms, anywhere in the world, noting that the country has long been on the front line in the global fight against terrorism. The press conference, he said, was aimed at dispelling the notion that controversial online narratives reflected genuine public opinion. This is not popularity. This is a money-driven mechanism operated through fake accounts across the world, Mr Chaudhry said, adding that Pakistan would continue to work with international partners to curb such activities. PTI blamed Mr Chaudhry also accused PTI-linked social media accounts of receiving foreign funding to promote the “enemy’s narrative and target institutions by creating anti-state trends”. He said that PTI social media accounts were being operated from abroad, mainly from North America, Europe, and some parts of South Asia, and were used specifically to create trends. He alleged that a malicious campaign was being run against state institutions on social media, vowing that no compromise would be made on national sovereignty. He regretted that the PTI was using social media to promote a ‘specific narrative’ and said coordinated campaigns were allegedly launched to unleash propaganda against national security. He alleged that some companies auction and sell trends and hashtags. He said certain elements were actively working against the country’s sovereignty, reiterating that the government would not compromise on national security.

      "summary": "• Talal Chaudhry claims terrorists using social media to manipulate public opinion • Alleges PTI-linked accounts creating ‘anti-state trends’ • Warns citizens against becoming part of ‘paid trends’ ISLAMABAD: As he targeted the opposition for alleged social media campaigns, State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Monday claimed that Pakistan had uncovered extensive evidence of coordinated and paid online campaigns being run through fake accounts operated largely from abroad. According to the state-run APP , the minister said the government recently provided foreign media with background information on how terrorists and organised networks were exploiting social media platforms to manipulate public opinion in Pakistan. The minister explained that investigations revealed how artificial trends were created and sold through WhatsApp groups and other platforms. He said individuals were paid small amounts ranging from a few rupees to cents per post to repeatedly tweet or forward messages, sometimes hundreds of times a day. Many of these accounts, he said, originate outside Pakistan and are operated by companies using fake identities. He added that account names are frequently changed depending on the campaign being promoted, making it harder to trace their origins. The state minister claimed the same networks had been found promoting content linked to terrorist organisations, as well as ‘unrelated international causes’, demonstrating that the activity was commercial rather than ideological. These trends are not organic or natural, he added. Mr Chaudhry clarified that the evidence shared was gathered directly from the same social media platforms being misused, including details of temporary WhatsApp groups formed to run trends and then deleted to avoid detection. He said social media companies’ own community guidelines were being violated, leading to account closures and further action by the platforms. While emphasising that the government did not want ordinary citizens to face criminal cases, the minister issued a clear warning, saying that if people knowingly became part of paid trends that were against the country, they could face legal consequences. Freedom of expression is not without responsibility, he said, claiming that no one had the right to hurt religious sentiments, target friendly countries, or malign individuals and institutions under the guise of free speech. Responding to questions, Mr Chaudhry stated that most accounts involved were fake and that privacy laws limited access to IP addresses and ownership details, although Pakistan was engaging with platforms and foreign governments to address the issue. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm condemnation of terrorism in all forms, anywhere in the world, noting that the country has long been on the front line in the global fight against terrorism. The press conference, he said, was aimed at dispelling the notion that controversial online narratives reflected genuine public opinion. This is not popularity. This is a money-driven mechanism operated through fake accounts across the world, Mr Chaudhry said, adding that Pakistan would continue to work with international partners to curb such activities. PTI blamed Mr Chaudhry also accused PTI-linked social media accounts of receiving foreign funding to promote the “enemy’s narrative and target institutions by creating anti-state trends”. He said that PTI social media accounts were being operated from abroad, mainly from North America, Europe, and some parts of South Asia, and were used specifically to create trends. He alleged that a malicious campaign was being run against state institutions on social media, vowing that no compromise would be made on national sovereignty. He regretted that the PTI was using social media to promote a ‘specific narrative’ and said coordinated campaigns were allegedly launched to unleash propaganda against national security. He alleged that some companies auction and sell trends and hashtags.

      "summary_orig": "A soldier was martyred during a counter-insurgency operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district on Monday, in which seven terrorists were killed, the military’s media wing said in a statement. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in DI Khan’s Kulachi area on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read. During the battle, Naik Yasir Khan, 34, a resident of Mardan, embraced martyrdom after “having fought gallantly [and] paid the ultimate sacrifice”, the ISPR said. The statement added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area. “[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded. Earlier, security forces killed 13 terrorists in two IBOs across KP, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday. “On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a statement. It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district, while the other was carried out in Bannu. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025 , published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.

      "summary_en": "A soldier was martyred during a counter-insurgency operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district on Monday, in which seven terrorists were killed, the military’s media wing said in a statement. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in DI Khan’s Kulachi area on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read. During the battle, Naik Yasir Khan, 34, a resident of Mardan, embraced martyrdom after “having fought gallantly [and] paid the ultimate sacrifice”, the ISPR said. The statement added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area. “[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded. Earlier, security forces killed 13 terrorists in two IBOs across KP, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday. “On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a statement. It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district, while the other was carried out in Bannu. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025 , published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years. Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.",
