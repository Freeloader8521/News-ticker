      "summary_orig": "THE ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan remains ‘fragile’, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has described it . Mr Sharif, who was speaking at a multilateral forum in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan on Friday, also observed that the international community should press the Afghan Taliban to fulfil their commitments vis-à-vis preventing terrorists from using their soil to attack others. At the same forum, Turkish President Recep Erdogan again offered his good offices to maintain an “extended ceasefire” between Islamabad and Kabul. Meanwhile, a recent resolution adopted by around 1,000 Afghan clerics at a gathering in Kabul, calling for prohibition of cross-border movement of fighters, is a step in the right direction. Yet the effectiveness of this decree will only be proved if there is a visible drop in the number of terrorist attacks targeting Pakistan carried out by Afghanistan-based militants. According to reports, the clerics pledged that Afghan soil would not be used against other countries, while calling for “necessary measures” towards those who violate the edict. They also observed that Afghan Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada had prohibited Afghan nationals from participating in military activity abroad. The resolution is most likely referring to Mullah Akhundzada’s 2023 decree in which the Taliban head declared cross-border attacks, including those targeting Pakistan, as “haram”. Yet the Taliban chief’s prohibition has not been heeded by terrorists, who continue their bloody campaign against Pakistan. The resolution seems to be an attempt by the Afghan side to rebuild trust with Pakistan, and prevent bilateral ties from deteriorating further. The call was issued by independent clerics, not by the Taliban authorities, though as an Afghan participant of the Kabul conclave told this paper, Mullah Akhundzada “does not want a neighbour to have problems because of us”. The number of Afghans participating in cross-border attacks has risen, so perhaps the resolution is also an attempt to quell this trend. But the question remains: what about Pakistani terrorists based in Afghanistan who are involved in cross-border attacks? Will the Taliban regime take concrete action against them? If the realisation has dawned in Kabul and Kandahar that giving free rein to terrorist groups such as the TTP to attack Pakistan and other neighbours will further isolate Afghanistan regionally and globally, then it would be a case of ‘better late than never’. We hope these are not mere words, and that there is a sincere will on the Afghan side to address the issue of terrorism. The Foreign Office has cautiously welcomed the resolution. Continued bilateral tension and conflict is in the interest of neither state. Therefore, the mediation efforts of friendly states must continue. Once the terrorism issue is resolved, both states can start work on building a fruitful relationship. Published in Dawn, December 14th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office’s decision to summon Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsaas over his “unwanted presence” at a Supreme Court hearing involving rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, has sparked debate over the boundaries of diplomatic engagement in sensitive cases and the interpretation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. While the Foreign Office has described the envoy’s presence as interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs and a breach of diplomatic protocol and Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, several diplomats and former envoys argue that observing open court proceedings does not, in itself, amount to meddling. Former ambassador to India Abdul Basit, when asked whether the move could be construed as interference, said that “in the strict sense of the word”, it could not. He added that there was no provision in the Vienna Convention that bound diplomats to stay away from public court proceedings. However, he noted that diplomatic practice “would strongly suggest that diplomats in their host countries usually keep themselves away from internal politics”. But this doesn’t mean “they cannot interact with opposition politicians, which they do all the time, including our diplomats around the world”, Mr Basit added. The summoning of Norway’s envoy over attending a court hearing has ignited debate over how far diplomats can go in observing sensitive domestic proceedings under the Vienna Convention A senior European diplomat also insisted that mere observation of open court proceedings could not be labelled as interference. Citing Article 3(d) of the Vienna Convention — which outlines the functions of a diplomatic mission and includes “ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State” — the diplomat said it was not a breach of protocol for an envoy to attend open proceedings in a host country. Diplomatic immunity protected envoys from the jurisdiction of host-country courts but did not prevent them from observing public proceedings out of professional interest, the diplomat added. The Vienna Convention also emphasises freedom of movement (Article 26) and does not explicitly prohibit attendance at public events, including court hearings, as long as diplomats do not interfere with proceedings or undertake actions that could be seen as official intervention in domestic affairs. The diplomat said the Norwegian ambassador attended as a silent observer, sought no meeting with any judge and made no public comment about the case, which could not be viewed as an attempt to influence the judiciary or interfere with the judicial process. “When foreign observers monitor elections in Pakistan, do they interfere in the electoral process?” he asked, arguing that independent observation strengthened transparency. “Observers should be welcomed if there is nothing to hide and the trials are fair,” he said. ‘Serious error of judgement’ However, former ambassador to the European Union Naghmana Hashmi took a different view, saying Article 41 was explicit in requiring diplomats not to interfere “in any way” in the internal affairs of the host country. “If I were to analyse the actions of the Norwegian ambassador, I would say that it certainly falls under a violation of Article 41 of the Vienna Convention. He should not have gone there. I think it is a very, very serious error of judgement,” she said. Ms Hashmi acknowledged that the envoy did not make public statements or speak to the media, but she argued that the diplomat’s presence created an impression that he had been asked to attend by individuals facing accusations in a sensitive case. She pointed out that no other ambassador was seen attending the hearing, adding that the envoy was also seen on television shaking hands and speaking with the accused within the Supreme Court premises. “The Norwegian government may not be expressly saying that, but the perception certainly is that Norway is supporting the accused, which in any case is totally unacceptable,” she said. Ms Hashmi maintained that amb­assadors generally do not sit in court proceedings in other countries, particularly in cases linked to internal affairs and national security. Dip­lo­matic conduct, she said, was gov­ern­­ed by international law and established norms that must be respected. ‘Fair trial is a human right’ A European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the right to a fair trial was a human right and alleged violations could not be termed an internal matter. The diplomat cautioned against setting new precedents by summoning an ambassador for observing proceedings in open court, and questioned whether the move was intended as a signal to the rest of the diplomatic community in Pakistan. Former ambassador Muhammad Ayaz Wazir said attending court proceedings was not interference in itself, but added that any public comment on a pending case would be inconsistent with an envoy’s role. “He is not only an individual but a representative of a government. His words would therefore be attributed to the authority he represents,” he said, adding that much depended on how the host government viewed a particular case. “It is my personal view, as I am not privy to the government’s current policies on various issues,” he said. Another former ambassador said there was “no issue” with a foreign diplomat at­­­tending court or parliamentary proceedings, calling it part of normal diplomatic reporting and observation. He described the summoning as “intimidatory tactics” to discourage outside interest in the human rights situation in the country. The Vienna Convention and diplomatic conduct The Vienna Convention on Diplo­matic Relations (1961) is a cornerstone treaty of international law go­­verning diplomatic relations bet­ween sovereign states. It sets out the privileges, immunities and obligations of diplomatic missions, and is intended to ensure diplomats can perform their duties without intimidation or undue hindrance from the host state. The convention was adopted on April 18, 1961, and entered into force on April 24, 1964. It has achieved near-universal acceptance, with almost 200 states party to it. By codifying long-standing customs and practices, it provides a detailed framework for diplomatic engagement and has been central to maintaining channels of communication even amid serious disagreements between states. While the purpose of diplomacy is to preserve communication and manage differences, actions perceived as offending the host country can cause tension and lead to a formal protest, including summoning an ambassador to the foreign ministry to convey concern. In rare cases, disputes escalate to the downgrading or suspension of diplomatic representation. Some of the key provisions of the convention include: Article 9: The host country can declare a diplomat “persona non gr­­a­ta” and expel them, no reason ne­­ed­­ed, typically used in serious breaches. The declaration of persona non grata is a mechanism frequently employed in diplomatic disputes. Specific instances where ambassadors or other diplomatic agents have been declared persona non grata are often the result of bilateral tensions or breaches of the conduct expected under the convention. High-profile cases often make it to public knowledge, typically in the context of espionage, interference in domestic affairs or other diplomatic indiscretions. Article 22: Diplomatic missions are inviolable. The host country can’t enter without permission. Article 26: Diplomats have freedom of movement and travel in the host country, with some security exceptions. Article 27: Diplomatic missions can communicate freely with their government, using diplomatic bags that aren’t to be opened or detained. Article 29: Diplomats can’t be arrested or detained. Their private residences are also protected. Article 30: Diplomatic archives and documents are inviolable, wherever they are. Article 31: Diplomats have immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the host country. Civil immunity applies except in specific cases (e.g. private property disputes). Article 41: Diplomats must resp­ect the laws of the host country and not interfere in its internal affairs. These provisions aim to ensure diplomats can perform their duties without fear or hindrance, promoting smooth international relations. Published in Dawn, December 14th, 2025",

His words would therefore be attributed to the authority he represents,” he said, adding that much depended on how the host government viewed a particular case. “It is my personal view, as I am not privy to the government’s current policies on various issues,” he said. Another former ambassador said there was “no issue” with a foreign diplomat at­­­tending court or parliamentary proceedings, calling it part of normal diplomatic reporting and observation. He described the summoning as “intimidatory tactics” to discourage outside interest in the human rights situation in the country. The Vienna Convention and diplomatic conduct The Vienna Convention on Diplo­matic Relations (1961) is a cornerstone treaty of international law go­­verning diplomatic relations bet­ween sovereign states. It sets out the privileges, immunities and obligations of diplomatic missions, and is intended to ensure diplomats can perform their duties without intimidation or undue hindrance from the host state. The convention was adopted on April 18, 1961, and entered into force on April 24, 1964. It has achieved near-universal acceptance, with almost 200 states party to it. By codifying long-standing customs and practices, it provides a detailed framework for diplomatic engagement and has been central to maintaining channels of communication even amid serious disagreements between states. While the purpose of diplomacy is to preserve communication and manage differences, actions perceived as offending the host country can cause tension and lead to a formal protest, including summoning an ambassador to the foreign ministry to convey concern. In rare cases, disputes escalate to the downgrading or suspension of diplomatic representation. Some of the key provisions of the convention include: Article 9: The host country can declare a diplomat “persona non gr­­a­ta” and expel them, no reason ne­­ed­­ed, typically used in serious breaches. The declaration of persona non grata is a mechanism frequently employed in diplomatic disputes. Specific instances where ambassadors or other diplomatic agents have been declared persona non grata are often the result of bilateral tensions or breaches of the conduct expected under the convention. High-profile cases often make it to public knowledge, typically in the context of espionage, interference in domestic affairs or other diplomatic indiscretions. Article 22: Diplomatic missions are inviolable. The host country can’t enter without permission. Article 26: Diplomats have freedom of movement and travel in the host country, with some security exceptions. Article 27: Diplomatic missions can communicate freely with their government, using diplomatic bags that aren’t to be opened or detained. Article 29: Diplomats can’t be arrested or detained. Their private residences are also protected. Article 30: Diplomatic archives and documents are inviolable, wherever they are. Article 31: Diplomats have immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the host country. Civil immunity applies except in specific cases (e.g. private property disputes). Article 41: Diplomats must resp­ect the laws of the host country and not interfere in its internal affairs. These provisions aim to ensure diplomats can perform their duties without fear or hindrance, promoting smooth international relations. Published in Dawn, December 14th, 2025",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office’s decision to summon Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsaas over his “unwanted presence” at a Supreme Court hearing involving rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, has sparked debate over the boundaries of diplomatic engagement in sensitive cases and the interpretation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. While the Foreign Office has described the envoy’s presence as interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs and a breach of diplomatic protocol and Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, several diplomats and former envoys argue that observing open court proceedings does not, in itself, amount to meddling. Former ambassador to India Abdul Basit, when asked whether the move could be construed as interference, said that “in the strict sense of the word”, it could not. He added that there was no provision in the Vienna Convention that bound diplomats to stay away from public court proceedings. However, he noted that diplomatic practice “would strongly suggest that diplomats in their host countries usually keep themselves away from internal politics”. But this doesn’t mean “they cannot interact with opposition politicians, which they do all the time, including our diplomats around the world”, Mr Basit added. The summoning of Norway’s envoy over attending a court hearing has ignited debate over how far diplomats can go in observing sensitive domestic proceedings under the Vienna Convention A senior European diplomat also insisted that mere observation of open court proceedings could not be labelled as interference. Citing Article 3(d) of the Vienna Convention — which outlines the functions of a diplomatic mission and includes “ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State” — the diplomat said it was not a breach of protocol for an envoy to attend open proceedings in a host country. Diplomatic immunity protected envoys from the jurisdiction of host-country courts but did not prevent them from observing public proceedings out of professional interest, the diplomat added. The Vienna Convention also emphasises freedom of movement (Article 26) and does not explicitly prohibit attendance at public events, including court hearings, as long as diplomats do not interfere with proceedings or undertake actions that could be seen as official intervention in domestic affairs. The diplomat said the Norwegian ambassador attended as a silent observer, sought no meeting with any judge and made no public comment about the case, which could not be viewed as an attempt to influence the judiciary or interfere with the judicial process. “When foreign observers monitor elections in Pakistan, do they interfere in the electoral process?” he asked, arguing that independent observation strengthened transparency. “Observers should be welcomed if there is nothing to hide and the trials are fair,” he said. ‘Serious error of judgement’ However, former ambassador to the European Union Naghmana Hashmi took a different view, saying Article 41 was explicit in requiring diplomats not to interfere “in any way” in the internal affairs of the host country. “If I were to analyse the actions of the Norwegian ambassador, I would say that it certainly falls under a violation of Article 41 of the Vienna Convention. He should not have gone there. I think it is a very, very serious error of judgement,” she said. Ms Hashmi acknowledged that the envoy did not make public statements or speak to the media, but she argued that the diplomat’s presence created an impression that he had been asked to attend by individuals facing accusations in a sensitive case. She pointed out that no other ambassador was seen attending the hearing, adding that the envoy was also seen on television shaking hands and speaking with the accused within the Supreme Court premises. “The Norwegian government may not be expressly saying that, but the perception certainly is that Norway is supporting the accused, which in any case is totally unacceptable,” she said. Ms Hashmi maintained that amb­assadors generally do not sit in court proceedings in other countries, particularly in cases linked to internal affairs and national security. Dip­lo­matic conduct, she said, was gov­ern­­ed by international law and established norms that must be respected. ‘Fair trial is a human right’ A European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the right to a fair trial was a human right and alleged violations could not be termed an internal matter. The diplomat cautioned against setting new precedents by summoning an ambassador for observing proceedings in open court, and questioned whether the move was intended as a signal to the rest of the diplomatic community in Pakistan. Former ambassador Muhammad Ayaz Wazir said attending court proceedings was not interference in itself, but added that any public comment on a pending case would be inconsistent with an envoy’s role. “He is not only an individual but a representative of a government. His words would therefore be attributed to the authority he represents,” he said, adding that much depended on how the host government viewed a particular case. “It is my personal view, as I am not privy to the government’s current policies on various issues,” he said.

The minister also asserted there were still other charges against Hameed on which legal proceedings would be initiated soon. He made these remarks after the former director general of Inter-Services Intelligence was sentenced to a 14-year jail term in a case related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others. Addressing a press conference in Sialkot, Mr Asif claimed both the ex-spymaster and the ex-premier were partners in the ‘plan to destroy Pakistan and its army’. “Faiz Hameed and Imran Khan were equally involved in planning what happened in Mianwali, Lahore, Peshawar, and in front of GHQ on May 9,” he said. “Those who have put the country’s future at stake for power cannot be considered Pakistanis whe­ther they are in uniform like Faiz or in a waistcoat and Peshawari sandals like Imran,” he added. Calling the May 9 riots an ‘attack on the sanctity of the armed forces’, he said the same institution had restored national pride through Operation Bunyanul Marsoos against India in May , earning Pakistan international acclaim. “God forbid, if the Faiz-Imran nexus still existed, perhaps there would not have been a need for war at all since they would have ensured the country’s destruction from the inside,” he said. Nawaz’s ouster, parliament’s role The minister alleged Hameed was in charge of ‘Project Imran’, blaming him for the ouster of prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017. “The removal of Nawaz Sharif, the cases lodged against him, the allegations, and Imran’s [Khan] coming into power, this whole project was enacted under the supervision of Faiz Hameed. Nawaz Sharif was kept in prison during the 2018 elections. Imran [Khan] had put Nawaz Sharif, his family members and other politicians in jail through Faiz.” He claimed Mr Khan was made the prime minister through rigging under Hameed’s supervision and alleged that they played a ‘dangerous game’ with the country during the next four years. He said the ex-spymaster facilitated the ‘imprisonment of political opponents’. While terming the period a ‘shameful chapter’ in country’s history, the defence minister said parliament was converted into an ISI ‘subsidiary’. “During the Faiz’s tenure [as ISI chief], the agency used to dictate legislation to parliament.” He claimed that after Hameed’s transfer, the ‘project’ started to slowly ‘unravel’, but as a corps commander he continued to facilitate Mr Khan. “Faiz used to plan mischief in Pakistan, and the PTI provided the manpower to execute those plans.” ‘Conspirators still active’ While admitting that the current system of governance a ‘hybrid system’ involving cooperation bet­ween the government and the military, the defence minister said the stability was brought through this. But, he added, conspirators were again attempting to prop up the PTI founder and bring him back to power, adding that ‘all these seeds were sown by Faiz’. He said 3,000 to 4,000 Afghans were brought to and settled in Pakistan to cause mischief in the country. “These Afghans were accommodated in the homes of citizens.” He accused PTI leaders of bribing the Taliban, alleging that party wanted to hold talks with Pakistan’s ‘enemies’. About the recent conviction of the ex-spymaster, the minister noted that Hameed still had the right to appeal at relevant forums, including the army’s court of appeals and high court.

The explosion also caused partial damage to a nearby house and a private vehicle parked close to the site. Police said that at the time of the blast, the minor Afghan girl was present on the roof of her house. The force of the explosion caused a portion of the roof to collapsed, leaving her critically injured. Local residents rushed to the scene and shifted the injured girl to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Wana for emergency treatment. Hospital officials said she was in a critical condition upon arrival and later succumbed to her injuries despite efforts by doctors to save her. Following the explosion, police cordoned off the area, collected evidence from the site, and launched an investigation to trace the perpetrators and determine the nature of the explosive device.

      "summary_orig": "Three United States military personnel, two soldiers and a civilian interpreter, were killed on Saturday by a suspected Islamic State (IS) attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces, the US military said. Three other US soldiers were wounded, the US military’s Central Command said. In a statement, Central Command said the attack by a lone gunman occurred “as the soldiers were conducting a key leader engagement” in the central Syrian town of Palmyra. “Partner forces” killed the attacker, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth wrote in a social media post. IS did not immediately claim responsibility, but a senior US official said initial assessments indicate the militant group probably carried out the attack. It took place in an area not controlled by the Syrian government, the official said. The soldiers’ names will be withheld until 24 hours after the next-of-kin notification, the US military said. Syrian state news agency SANA quoted a security source as saying two Syrian service personnel were injured, without providing further details. The source told SANA that American helicopters evacuated the injured to a US base in Syria’s Al-Tanf region near the Iraqi border. Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkiye and special envoy to Syria, condemned the attack. “We mourn the loss of three brave US service members and civilian personnel and wish a speedy recovery to the Syrian troops wounded in the attack,” Barrack said in a statement. “We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.” The attack came barely a month after Syria announced it had signed a political cooperation agreement with the US-led coalition against IS, which coincided with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s visit to the White House. The coalition has carried out air strikes and ground operations in Syria targeting IS suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces. Syria last month also carried out a nationwide campaign arresting more than 70 people accused of links to the group. The US has troops stationed in northeastern Syria as part of a decade-long effort to help a Kurdish-led force there.",

      "summary_orig": "RT India has deleted a post on social media platform X about Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “waiting to meet” Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that it “may have been a misrepresentation of events”, it emerged on Saturday. The development came as PM Shehbaz was in Ashgabat to attend an international forum. On Friday, the premier met a host of leaders on the sidelines of the gathering, including Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon, Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov and Putin. “Great interactions with world leaders. Pakistan shining at the global stage,” said Information Minister Ataullah Tarar on X on Friday night, sharing a video of PM Shehbaz shaking hands with Putin as the two stood in what appeared to be a hallway. He also termed the meetings with Putin, Erdogan and Pezeshkian “warm and cordial exchanges”. Prime Minister’s Spokesperson for Foreign Media Mosharraf Zaidi also shared the same video, saying PM Shehbaz had “productive meetings with his peers from all the countries” that attended the forum. “The customary warmth in relations was in ample evidence as the prime minister shared the day with President Erdogan, President Putin and a host of other key world leaders,” he said. The same video was also shared by the Russian embassy in Pakistan. However, RT India , appeared to have shared a different video, which has since been deleted from X. In a clarification issued late on Friday night, it said, “We deleted an earlier post about Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif waiting to meet Vladimir Putin at the Peace and Trust forum in Turkmenistan. The post may have been a misrepresentation of the events.” RT India is the newest branch of Russia’s state-funded global media network. Putin had launched the RT India news channel last week during a visit to New Delhi. According to Indian media, the original RT India post stated that PM Shehbaz waited for Putin for 40 minutes before “growing tired and gate-crashing” the Russian leader’s meeting with Erdogan. “He left ten minutes later,” Times of India and Hindustan Times quoted the original post as saying. Meanwhile, Russia’s RIA news agency reported that PM Shehbaz had later joined the talks between Erdogan and Putin, which had lasted 40 minutes behind closed doors. In a remark on the situation, Tarar told Dawn : “No need for any comment on an Indian outlet which posted a fake story then deleted it, calling a misrepresentation of facts.”",

      "summary_orig": "Germany will host US and Ukrainian delegations over the weekend for talks on a ceasefire in Ukraine, before a summit with European leaders and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Berlin on Monday, a German official said. A US official said President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were travelling to Germany for talks involving Ukrainians and Europeans. The choice to send Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia regarding a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress after nearly four years of war since Russia’s 2022 invasion . The White House had said on Thursday Trump would send an official to talks only if he felt there was enough progress to be made. Show of support for Ukraine “Talks on a possible ceasefire in Ukraine are taking place in Berlin this weekend between foreign policy advisers from, among others, the US and Ukraine,” a German government source said on Saturday when asked about the meetings. On Monday, Merz is hosting Zelenskiy and European leaders for a summit in Berlin, the latest in a series of public shows of support for the Ukrainian leader from allies across Europe as Kyiv faces pressure from Washington to sign up to a peace plan that initially backed Moscow’s main demands. Britain, France and Germany have been working in the last few weeks to refine the US proposals, which, in a draft disclosed last month, called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its ambition to join NATO and accept limits on its armed forces. Merz said in a speech on Saturday that Europe had to brace for a fundamental shift in its relations with the US while facing a growing threat from Russia. “The decades of Pax Americana are largely over for us in Europe, and for us in Germany as well. It no longer exists as we knew it. And nostalgia won’t change that,” he told a party congress in the southern city of Munich. “The Americans are now very, very aggressively pursuing their own interests. And that can only mean one thing: that we, too, must now pursue our own interests.” Attacks cause blackout in Odesa The European Union has sought to shore up Ukraine’s position by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget. Ukraine meanwhile has battled to contain Russian advances on the battlefield and the frequent bombardment of its energy and water supplies going into winter. The southern Black Sea port city of Odesa and the surrounding region suffered blackouts on Saturday after a large missile and drone attack on the electricity grid that left more than a million households without power, officials said. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, said “peace is not far away” and that he hoped to discuss a peace plan with Trump. Erdogan had told Putin on Friday that a limited ceasefire in the war, focused on energy facilities and ports in particular, could be beneficial. “The Black Sea should not be seen as a battleground. Such a situation would only harm Russia and Ukraine,” Erdogan said in comments released by his office on Saturday. Russia attacked two Ukrainian ports on Friday, damaging three Turkish-owned vessels including a ship carrying food supplies, Ukrainian officials and one ship-owner said, days after Moscow threatened to cut Ukraine off from the sea.

      "summary_orig": "Angry spectators broke down barricades and stormed the pitch at a stadium in India after football star Lionel Messi, who is on a three-day tour of the country, abruptly left the arena. As a part of a so-called GOAT Tour, the 38-year-old Argentina and Inter Miami superstar touched down in the eastern state of West Bengal early Saturday, greeted by a chorus of exuberant fans chanting his name. Hours later, thousands of fans wearing Messi jerseys and waving the Argentine flag packed into Salt Lake stadium in the state capital Kolkata, but heavy security around the footballer left fans struggling to catch a glimpse of him. Messi walked around the pitch waving to fans and left the stadium earlier than expected. Inter Miami’s Argentine forward #10 Lionel Messi arrives at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata on December 13. —AFP Frustrated fans, many having paid more than $100 for tickets, ripped out stadium seats and hurled water bottles onto the track. Many others stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents. “For me, to watch Messi is a pleasure, a dream. But I have missed the chance to have a glimpse because of the mismanagement in the stadium,” businessman Nabin Chatterjee, 37, told AFP. Before the chaos erupted, Messi unveiled a 21-metre (70-foot) statue which shows him holding aloft the World Cup. He was also expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium. Another angry fan told the Press Trust of India ( PTI ) that people had spent “a month’s salary” to see Messi. View this post on Instagram “I paid Rs 5,000 ($55) for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians. The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame,” Ajay Shah, told PTI . Javed Shamim, a senior police official in the state, told reporters that the event’s “chief organiser” had been arrested, without giving any further details. “There is total normalcy,” he said, adding that authorities would look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets. State chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was “disturbed” and “shocked” at the mismanagement. “I sincerely apologise to Lionel Messi, as well as to all sports lovers and his fans, for the unfortunate incident,” she said in a post on X, adding that she had ordered a probe into the incident. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the “organisation, planning, or execution” of the “private event”. “Furthermore, the details of the event were neither communicated to the AIFF, nor was any clearance sought from the Federation,” a statement said. View this post on Instagram Messi will now head to Hyderabad, Mumbai and New Delhi as part of the four-city tour. His time in India also includes a possible meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Messi won his second consecutive Major League Soccer Most Valuable Player award this week after propelling Inter Miami to the MLS title and leading the league in goals. The former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain attacker will spearhead Argentina’s defence of the World Cup in June-July in North America.",

      "summary_orig": "Devastating floods and landslides have killed 1,003 people in Indonesia, rescuers said on Saturday as the Southeast Asian nation grapples with relief efforts. The disaster, which has hit the northwestern island of Sumatra over the past fortnight, has also injured more than 5,400, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said in its latest toll. The deadly torrential rains are one of the worst recent disasters to strike Sumatra, where a tsunami wreaked havoc in 2004 in Aceh province, which lies at the northern tip of the island. The final toll is expected to rise, with the disaster agency reporting 218 people are still missing. With vast tracts of territory hit, 1.2 million residents have been forced to take refuge in temporary shelters. Frustration has grown among flood victims, who have complained about the pace of relief efforts. President Prabowo Subianto said on Saturday the situation has improved, with several areas which had been cut off now accessible. “Here and there, due to natural and physical conditions, there have been slight delays, but I checked all the evacuation sites: their conditions are good, services for them are adequate, and food supplies are sufficient,” Prabowo said after visiting Langkat in North Sumatra province. Costs to rebuild after the disaster could reach 51.82 trillion rupiah ($3.1 billion) and the Indonesian government has so far shrugged off suggestions that it call for international assistance.",

      "summary_orig": "Thailand’s leader vowed to keep fighting on the disputed border with Cambodia as fighter jets struck targets on Saturday, hours after US President Donald Trump said he had brokered a ceasefire . Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul posted on Facebook that the Southeast Asian nation would “continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people”. Trump, who brokered a ceasefire in the long-running border dispute in October, spoke to Anutin and Cambodian premier Hun Manet on Friday, and said they had agreed to “cease all shooting”. Neither of them mentioned any agreement in statements after their calls with Trump, and Anutin said there was no ceasefire. “I want to make it clear. Our actions this morning already spoke,” Anutin said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the continued fighting. Hun Manet, in a statement on Saturday on Facebook, said Cambodia continues to seek a peaceful resolution of disputes in line with the October agreement. Since Monday, Cambodia and Thailand have been exchanging heavy-weapons fire at multiple points along the 817km (508 mile) border, in some of the heaviest fighting since the five-day clash in July. Trump halted that fighting, the worst in recent memory, with calls to both leaders. Trump, who has repeatedly said he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, has been keen to intervene again to rescue the truce. Thailand suspended it last month after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine, one of many that Bangkok says were newly laid by Cambodia. Cambodia, which nominated Trump for the peace prize in August, rejects the landmine allegations. On Saturday, a Thai Defence Ministry spokesman, Rear Admiral Surasant Kongsiri, told a press conference that clashes had taken place across seven border provinces and Cambodia had fired heavy weapons, “making it necessary for Thailand to retaliate”. Cambodia’s Information Ministry said Thai forces had struck bridges and buildings overnight and fired artillery from a naval vessel. Thai leader Anutin dismissed comments by Trump that a “roadside bomb” that wounded Thai soldiers was accidental, saying the incident was “definitely not a roadside accident”. Cambodia’s Hun Manet said he had asked the US and Malaysia, which has been a mediator in peace talks, to use their intelligence gathering capabilities to “verify which side fired first” in the latest round of fighting.",
