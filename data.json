At the time, prosecutors dropped the sexual assault charges due to insufficient evidence, and B was instead fined 3 million won ($2,200) for assault.

This is state censorship.” On X, the president of the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada, Tino Gagliardi , issued a statement in response to ABC taking Jimmy Kimmel Live! , which employs musicians from the American Federation of Musicians Local 47 in Los Angeles , off the air. In it he said: This is not complicated: Trump’s FCC identified speech it did not like and theatened ABC with extreme reprisals. This is state censorship. It’s now happening in the United States of America, not some far-off country. It’s happening right here and right now. This act by the Trump administration represents a direct attack on free speech and artistic expression. These are fundamental rights that we must protect in a free society. The American Federation of Musicians strongly condemns the decision to take Jimmy Kimmel Live! off the air. As a Guild, we stand united in opposition to anyone who uses their power and influence to silence the voices of writers, or anyone who speaks in dissent. If free speech applied only to ideas we like, we needn’t have bothered to write it into the constitution. What we have signed on to – painful as it may be at times – is the freeing agreement to disagree.” Democracy thrives when diverse points of view are expressed. The decision to suspend airing Jimmy Kimmel Live! is the type of suppression and retaliation that endangers everyone’s freedoms. Sag-Aftra stands with all media artists and defends their right to express their diverse points of view, and everyone’s right to hear them. Continue reading...",

This is state censorship.” On X, the president of the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada, Tino Gagliardi , issued a statement in response to ABC taking Jimmy Kimmel Live! , which employs musicians from the American Federation of Musicians Local 47 in Los Angeles , off the air. In it he said: This is not complicated: Trump’s FCC identified speech it did not like and theatened ABC with extreme reprisals. This is state censorship.

      "title_orig": "Here is what analysts have to say about the Pak-Saudi defence agreement",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed a landmark defence agreement on Wednesday during a visit to the latter country by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, marking what is being considered the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence relations in decades. The announcement was made in a joint statement by Islamabad and Riyadh. The statement said the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”. “[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said. While not many details have been shared yet, the key driver of Wednesday’s agreement appears to be the principle that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both.“ The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. It is important to note that the agreement comes in the wake of Israel’s recent strike on Qatar, which has raised concerns for the overall security of the Middle East. Former envoy Maleeha Lodhi termed the agreement a “significant development”, noting that it has “far-reaching implications” for both countries. Speaking to Geo News , the former ambassador said, “Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have been engaged in a defence cooperation for a long time, and their diplomatic relations have always remained strong; however, with this agreement, the relationship has been shifted to a qualitatively different place.” “At this point, it is clear that Pakistan has taken up  the role of a security provider, not just for Saudi Arabia but for the Middle East.” Lodhi believed that “it is important to take into consideration the timing and the context of this agreement, since in the aftermath of Israeli aggression against Qatar, Arab countries have started to look elsewhere for security guarantees.” “The United States’ role as a security guarantor has come under scrutiny as of late, and its credibility has been severely damaged,” Lodhi said. “The agreement may have been in the works for some time, but it is important to look at the context.” She added that, “currently, it is hard to say any more, and a full assessment can only be made when more details come to light.” On the question of India’s place in the situation, she said: “It is clear that if Pakistan continues to strengthen its defence like this, its opponent cannot be happy about it, but we have to wait and see what sort of reaction will come from India.” South Asia Analyst Michael Kugelman, in a post on X, said that, with the inking of the agreement, Pakistan now finds itself “in a very good place”. Kugelman noted that, “This pact would not deter India from attacking Pakistan. But with 3-key powers — China, Turkey, and now KSA — fully on [Pakistan’s] side, [Pakistan] is in a very good place”. Former Senator Mushahid Hussain, on the question of India’s place in the situation, said: “India is in a state of shock, they are taken by surprise.” Mushahid, while speaking to Geo News , hailed the agreement as “the single most important military and diplomatic initiative in the past 50 years, after the Lahore Islamic summit.” Noting the significance of the agreement, he pointed out that “this is the first defence deal between two muslim countries.” Mushahid added that “Saudi Arabia is not just any muslim country but one of the richest countries in the world, with a strong diplomatic influence.” On the matter of Israel,  Husasain noted that the pact will serve as a deterrent for Israel; “With Pakistan’s military capability and Arab economic strength combined, Israel can’t do anything.” According to the former senator, the recent four-day military conflict between India and Pakistan “showed our will, skill and capability that we can defend our Arab friends just as well,” positing Pakistan as a regional security guarantor. He also speculated that the agreement could have implications for terrorist elements within the country, particularly the TTP. Former diplomat Hussain Haqani, in a post on X, noted the use of the term “strategic” in the agreement, saying, “‘Strategic Mutual Defense Agreement’ implies that it [covers] nuclear and missile defence. Pakistan has always used the term ‘strategic assets’ for its nuclear & missile programs.” In a separate tweet, he said, “Most likely, Pakistan will now be able to buy US weapons it needs, with Saudi money, which [the] Trump administration seems willing to sell. Similar purchases occurred in the 1970s when the US Congress was unwilling to approve loans under Foreign Military Funding (FMF) for Pakistan.” Analyst Uzair Younus noted that the agreement has cemented “Pakistan’s role as a net security provider in the Arabian peninsula.” Journalist Iftikhar Firdous branded the pact “symbolically powerful and strategically consequential,” saying that Pakistan will now be seen as a “direct deterrent to Israel”. “For Saudi Arabia, it’s a hedge against uncertainty and a signal of independence. Even though the pact does not officially include nuclear guarantees [at least from the available information], Pakistan’s arsenal casts a deterrence shadow.” “This gives Saudi Arabia a de facto “nuclear umbrella” without formally breaching non-proliferation norms,” he said, cautioning that the move “increases the chance that local conflicts could spiral into regionalised wars with nuclear undertones.” The agreement has brought Pakistan into the Arab world and its politics “like never before,” he said.

The ISPR statement said that during the operation, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location”, adding that “after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from slain terrorists, the ISPR said. The terrorists were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”, it added. “Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area,” the statement read. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” it added. A day ago, the ISPR had issued another statement, saying that the armed forces had eliminated five “Indian sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Khuzdar earlier this week. Yesterday, two police stations and a Levies station had also come under attack in Balochistan’s Sherani district. In those attacks, a policeman was martyred and two Levies personnel were injured. On September 12, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan captain Salman Agha said his team were ready to face India in the next round of the Asia Cup on Sunday after last week’s group-stage match between the arch-rivals ended in acrimony when the Indian side refused to shake hands. Pakistan beat United Arab Emirates in their final Group A game on Wednesday to advance to the Super Fours stage, where they will also play two teams from Group B in a round robin format. Bilateral cricket between India and Pakistan has been suspended since 2013, and they play each other only in multi-team tournaments. “We are ready, we are ready for any challenge,” Salman said after their 41-run victory against UAE. “We just want to play good cricket. If we play good cricket, like we have played in the last few months, I think we’ll be good against any side.” Fakhar Zaman made 50, but Pakistan’s frontline batters disappointed against the UAE’s modest attack, with opener Saim Ayub falling for his third successive duck in the tournament. Salman acknowledged they had to bat better. “We got the job done, but we still need to improve our batting in the middle order,” Salman said. “That’s been a concern and something we need to work on.” India had cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Pakistan last weekend in the first cricket match between the sides since a four-day military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end. India skipper Suryakumar Yadav dedicated their victory to the armed forces back home, which was seen as politicisation of the game. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match. The matter was settled after the PCB said ahead of yesterday’s match that Pycroft had apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts over a controversy during the recent Pakistan-India match. India and Pakistan could meet for a third time at the tournament if they both reach the September 28 final.",

      "summary_orig": "To be weak is to be wrong/ To be right is not enough/ To be good/ You need to be strong. WE are at a turning point of regional and global history because of several seminal developments. The moral, institutional, political, and economic degeneration of the US. The berserk aggression of Israel , which has finally destroyed the credibility of the US as a force for regional and international stability. The realisation among Arab elites that they can no longer rely on a trade-off between national humiliation and external protection against Arab streets. China’s recognition that its diplomacy will not significantly postpone a day of reckoning with a fearful and implacable US. The emergence of a vast Afro-Asian Muslim playground waiting to be co-opted by the East as deliverance from the West. India’s failure to transition from regional power status to international power status, and become a credible partner for the US against China. Above all, climate change in the Anthropocene age, in which human activity becomes a principal determinant of the rate of global warming and the fate of plant and animal species, including human beings. Because of the irresponsibility of the principal industrial powers, climate change will shortly become irreversible. Management of and adaptation to climate change may at most delay, but not avert the demise of human civilisation — possibly within this century. As a result, Noam Chomsky observed that far from the noblest of God’s creatures, mankind will be the stupidest and most short-lived of animal species. All of the above is reflected in the last reset of the Doomsday Clock , which at 89 seconds to ‘midnight’, is the closest yet to doomsday. The next reset next January will be even closer. This is the global context in which we are today witnessing the culmination of a century-long genocidal process against the trapped and defenceless Palestinian people. This unparalleled crime against humanity was initiated by Imperial Britain , and is culminating in the comprehensive connivance of the US. If, God forbid, Palestine dies, the Arab and Muslim world will face a colossal moral and civilisational failure, which it may not survive. The genocidal policy of the US and Israel has made the two-state solution for Palestine, as mandated by the UN, impossible to achieve. Accordingly, Israel has forfeited the right to exist. The only just solution now is the liberation of the State of Palestine in which people of all faiths who have the right to be there — including all Palestinians who have an internationally recognised right of return — are encouraged and assisted to live together in harmony, peace and justice. All other proposed solutions to the Palestinian tragedy have been rendered impossible by the violence, greed, guilt and hypocrisy of the US and its European allies, in support of the rabid racism of the criminal and illegitimate State of Israel. What is to be done? What can be done? How can it be done? Where do we begin? If answers to such questions regarding the genocide in Palestine can be agreed upon and implemented, it will be possible to similarly address other challenges that in greater or lesser measure threaten the future of humanity. What is to be done? What can be done? How can it be done? Where do we begin? Historically, power systems have always opposed the implementation of sensible and practical answers to such questions. This has been the warp and woof of human history. The finest brains have been selected to conjure up appealing or convincing reasons for such perversity. The difference today is that mankind has the capacity to destroy itself. The stakes are globally existential. Alex Carey noted that ‘grass-roots’ propaganda is designed to sway the masses through their beliefs, fears and prejudices, as well as their ignorance which is sustained by the social system in which they are confined. ‘Tree-top’ propaganda, on the contrary, is designed to comfort the upper- and middle-class intelligentsia who like to see themselves as decent human beings while serving the avarice and rapacity of their masters, who similarly wish to see themselves in a benevolent light. The comprador intellectual, whatever his or her profession, is accordingly among the vilest of social beings. Nevertheless, Chomsky suggests there are things that can be done to make a difference. One is for concerned people “not to be passive and quiescent” and to make life uncomfortable for exploiting elites and their cohorts who wish to preserve a decent opinion of themselves. Just persistently asking questions in all kinds of forums can be effective. Being a pest can also make a significant contribution. But he also notes that whatever one does should be done consistently. Power systems do not mind occasional protesters. In fact, they welcome them as proof of their tolerance and respect for free speech. A jihad or struggle has to be an organised and sustained learning process for it to be meaningful and ultimately successful. And this is where the men are distinguished from the boys. And this is also where women are often ‘more men’ than most men. They “hold up half the sky”, according to Mao. That is why they are taught by men — and unfortunately but understandably often enough by their mothers — to see their world in the household and virtue in obedience, tolerance, and suffering. Those women who excel in these docile qualities are worshipped by men — largely in the abstract. Men never seem to ask why God gave human intelligence to women if it was superfluous, even when they rightly suspect women are wiser, stronger, and braver than them. To sum up, starting with turning points, I focused on Palestine, asked questions, quoted Chomsky and Carey, and paid due homage to women. Good things can lead to more good things. So let us begin by feeling uncomfortable about the prevailing situation at home and abroad. That might lead to reflection, anger, action and eventually deliverance from climate catastrophe and political evil. Let us then resolve to keep doing something good for Pakistan, our only country, and for Earth, our Mother Planet.

WE are at a turning point of regional and global history because of several seminal developments. The moral, institutional, political, and economic degeneration of the US.

China’s recognition that its diplomacy will not significantly postpone a day of reckoning with a fearful and implacable US. The emergence of a vast Afro-Asian Muslim playground waiting to be co-opted by the East as deliverance from the West. India’s failure to transition from regional power status to international power status, and become a credible partner for the US against China. Above all, climate change in the Anthropocene age, in which human activity becomes a principal determinant of the rate of global warming and the fate of plant and animal species, including human beings.

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA/GWADAR: Security forces killed five terrorists in an intelligence-based operation in Khuzdar district of Baloch­istan, said the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Wednesday. According to the military’s media wing, the terrorists were killed in the district on the night of September 14-15. The ope­r­a­tion was conducted aft­er the “reported presence of terrorists” belonging to the separatist Baloch outfits, it added. ISPR said the forces eff­e­c­tively engaged the ter­­­r­­o­­rists’ location, five terrorists were killed after aft­er an intense exchange of fire. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained act­ively involved in num­erous terrorist activities in the area,” the ISPR said, adding that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any oth­er terrorists found in the area. Four killed in Kech Four alleged militants were also killed in the Kech district. The Counter-Terrorism Department of the Balochistan police claimed two suspects were killed in Dasht, Turbat, at a crossing of the M-8 motorway. They were allegedly spotted in the CCTV footage planting an explosive device. The CTD personnel immediately acted and killed the suspects. Policeman slain In the Sherani district, an official of the Balochistan Police Constabulary was martyred and two Levies men were injured in the attack on the police and Levies stations on Tuesday night in Mir Ali Khel area of the district. The assailants used heavy weapons, including rockets, to target the personnel from nearby mountains. The law enforcement officials immediately took positions and returned fire. “A heavy gun battle continued for over two hours in the area,” Deputy Commissioner Hazrat Wali Kakar told Dawn . He said the attack was repulsed and the militants’ effort to enter the police lines was foiled. In the exchange of fire, Balochistan Police Constabulary’s Aftabur Rehman, a resident of Muslim Bagh, was martyred, while two Levies personnel were injured in the attack. “One Levies man is missing,” DC Kakar said, adding that the search operation in the area was ongoing. The assailants set a Levies vehicle on fire, and buildings also sustained damage. Landmine blasts In another incident, three civilians were killed and a girl was injured in two landmine explosions in the Dera Bugti district. Officials said that both incidents occurred in the Lanjo Saghari area of the Sui tehsil. In the first explosion, a woman was killed, while in the second blast, two men were killed. No one had claimed responsibility by the time this report went to press. Published in Dawn, September 18th, 2025",

In the exchange of fire, Balochistan Police Constabulary’s Aftabur Rehman, a resident of Muslim Bagh, was martyred, while two Levies personnel were injured in the attack. “One Levies man is missing,” DC Kakar said, adding that the search operation in the area was ongoing. The assailants set a Levies vehicle on fire, and buildings also sustained damage. Landmine blasts In another incident, three civilians were killed and a girl was injured in two landmine explosions in the Dera Bugti district. Officials said that both incidents occurred in the Lanjo Saghari area of the Sui tehsil. In the first explosion, a woman was killed, while in the second blast, two men were killed. No one had claimed responsibility by the time this report went to press. Published in Dawn, September 18th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: Pakistan has warned the UN Security Council that terrorist groups operating from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan pose the gravest threat to its national security, urging stronger international action against networks using both physical and digital platforms to target the country. Ambassador Asim Ifti­khar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told a Council meeting on Afghanistan on Tuesday that entities like Al Qaeda, IS-Khorasan, TTP, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Baloch insurgent groups such as the BLA and Majeed Brigade continue to operate with impunity from across the border. “We have credible evidence of collaboration among these groups through joint training, illicit weapons trade, refuge to terrorists and coordinated attacks,” he said. More than 60 terrorist camps function as hubs for infiltration, targeting civilians, security forces and development projects inside Pakistan, he added. The envoy said the threat extended to cyberspace, where nearly 70 propaganda accounts traced to Afghan IP addresses were spreading extremist messaging. “Curb­ing these networks requires full cooperation from social media platforms with governments,” he stressed. Ambassador Ahmed said Pakistan and China had jointly asked the Security Council’s 1267 Sanctions Committee to designate the BLA and Majeed Brigade as terrorist organisations. He urged the Council to act swiftly on the request to curb their terrorist activities. He also pointed to the TTP, describing it as the largest UN-designated group on Afghan soil with nearly 6,000 fighters. Pakistan, he said, had thwarted multiple infiltration attempts, seizing caches of sophisticated military equipment abandoned by international forces during their withdrawal from Afghanistan. “These efforts come at a heavy price … just this month, 12 Pakistani soldiers were martyred in a single incident,” he noted. He said that while four years of Taliban rule had ended decades of civil war, the country remained mired in sanctions, poverty, narcotics and human rights concerns. He lamented that the UN’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan had received only 27pc of its required $2.42 billion. The envoy reminded the Council that Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for over four decades, often with inadequate international assistance. Published in Dawn, September 18th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Israel strikes more than 150 targets, kills 62 across the enclave • New route opened for Palestinians fleeing the embattled city • EU proposes curbing Israel trade ties, sanctioning far-right ministers GAZA CITY: Huge numbers of Palestinians were fleeing Gaza City by any means on Wednesday as the Israeli military pressed its ground offensive, killing dozens in strikes. The Israeli army said it had struck more than 150 targets in Gaza City since launching a major ground offensive on the Gaza Strip’s main urban hub early on Tuesday. AFP images showed a steady stream of Gazans heading south on foot, by car and on donkey carts, with their few belongings piled high as Israel bombarded the city. Israel had announced the day before that the US-backed campaign in the Gaza Strip’s largest city had begun, pledging to destroy Hamas in the area. The offensive has sparked outrage among the international community, with the Palestinian territory already devastated by nearly two years of war and the Gaza City region gripped by a UN-declared famine. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire had killed at least 62 people across the territory on Wednesday. The Israeli military said it was opening a temporary new route on Wednesday to allow people to flee, after unleashing a massive bombardment before dawn on Tuesday and pushing its troops deeper into Gaza City. It came as a United Nations probe accused Israel of committing genocide in the Palestinian territory, saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials had incited the crime. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it was opening “a temporary transportation route via Salah al-Din Street”, as AFP images showed fresh bombardments. Its Arabic-language spokesman, Colonel Avichay Adraee, said the corridor would remain open for just 48 hours from midday (0900 GMT). ‘Death is cheaper’ The United Nations estimated at the end of August that about one million people were living in Gaza City and its surroundings. The Israeli military said Wednesday that more than 350,000 had so far fled south. But many Gazans say nowhere is safe and have vowed to stay in their homes. “I won’t leave Gaza. There’s shelling here and there,” said Umm Ahmed Yunes, who is living in her partially destroyed home. “Where would I find $1,000 or $2,000 for transport costs? Where would I buy a tent? There are no tents and prices are insane,” said the 44-year-old. “Death is cheaper and more merciful.” Mother of four Fatima Lubbad left Gaza City with 10 relatives but said the ordeal was unbearable. “I wish we would all die together,” said the 36-year-old. “Last night we slept in the street by the sea in Deir el-Balah — there was nowhere to put a tent… I cried all night as I looked at my children sleeping on the ground.” In Gaza City’s Shati camp, an Israeli air strike killed four people, including a woman and her child, according to the civil defence agency. “Enough, we want to be free. We want to live, we don’t want to die, who told you we want to die? Tell Netanyahu: we don’t want to die!” said Mohammed al-Danf, an eyewitness. EU sanctions The European Union on Wednesday proposed curbing trade ties with Israel and sanctioning ministers in its strongest action yet over the war in Gaza, though reluctance from key member states risks blocking adoption. The bloc’s executive, however, said it would take immediate action by freezing some 20 million euros ($23.7m) in support for Israel. “The horrific events taking place in Gaza on a daily basis must stop,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said. “There needs to be an immediate ceasefire, unrestrained access for all humanitarian aid, and the release of all prisoners.” Under its new proposals, Brussels is pressing to suspend the parts of a cooperation deal that allow for reduced tariffs on goods coming from Israel. The EU also called for asset freezes and visa bans on far-right Israeli government ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich over their “extremist” rhetoric. Those measures — initially floated by von der Leyen in a speech last week — represent the firmest attempt by the EU chief to pressure Israel. “Today marks a critical turning point in holding Israel accountable,” said Irish foreign minister Simon Harris.

It came as a United Nations probe accused Israel of committing genocide in the Palestinian territory, saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials had incited the crime. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it was opening “a temporary transportation route via Salah al-Din Street”, as AFP images showed fresh bombardments. Its Arabic-language spokesman, Colonel Avichay Adraee, said the corridor would remain open for just 48 hours from midday (0900 GMT). ‘Death is cheaper’ The United Nations estimated at the end of August that about one million people were living in Gaza City and its surroundings. The Israeli military said Wednesday that more than 350,000 had so far fled south. But many Gazans say nowhere is safe and have vowed to stay in their homes. “I won’t leave Gaza. There’s shelling here and there,” said Umm Ahmed Yunes, who is living in her partially destroyed home. “Where would I find $1,000 or $2,000 for transport costs? Where would I buy a tent? There are no tents and prices are insane,” said the 44-year-old. “Death is cheaper and more merciful.” Mother of four Fatima Lubbad left Gaza City with 10 relatives but said the ordeal was unbearable. “I wish we would all die together,” said the 36-year-old. “Last night we slept in the street by the sea in Deir el-Balah — there was nowhere to put a tent… I cried all night as I looked at my children sleeping on the ground.” In Gaza City’s Shati camp, an Israeli air strike killed four people, including a woman and her child, according to the civil defence agency. “Enough, we want to be free. We want to live, we don’t want to die, who told you we want to die? Tell Netanyahu: we don’t want to die!” said Mohammed al-Danf, an eyewitness. EU sanctions The European Union on Wednesday proposed curbing trade ties with Israel and sanctioning ministers in its strongest action yet over the war in Gaza, though reluctance from key member states risks blocking adoption. The bloc’s executive, however, said it would take immediate action by freezing some 20 million euros ($23.7m) in support for Israel. “The horrific events taking place in Gaza on a daily basis must stop,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said. “There needs to be an immediate ceasefire, unrestrained access for all humanitarian aid, and the release of all prisoners.” Under its new proposals, Brussels is pressing to suspend the parts of a cooperation deal that allow for reduced tariffs on goods coming from Israel. The EU also called for asset freezes and visa bans on far-right Israeli government ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich over their “extremist” rhetoric. Those measures — initially floated by von der Leyen in a speech last week — represent the firmest attempt by the EU chief to pressure Israel. “Today marks a critical turning point in holding Israel accountable,” said Irish foreign minister Simon Harris.

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump was treated to a royal reception featuring gun salutes, soldiers on horseback and bagpipes as he met Wednesday with Britain’s King Charles III for a historic second state visit, which unfolded far from marching protesters. The pair laughed and joked as Trump inspected troops at Windsor Castle, west of London, in an elaborate spectacle featuring a carriage procession designed to play into the mercurial American leader’s love of pomp and pageantry. Some 120 horses, and 1,300 members of the British military — some in red tunics and gold plumed helmets — feted Trump during a ceremonial guard of honour that United Kingdom officials called the largest for a state visit to Britain in living memory. The president and First Lady Melania Trump were greeted by heir-to-the-throne Prince William and wife Catherine at Windsor after stepping off the Marine One helicopter under grey skies at 12:15pm (1115 GMT). Inside a ring of steel and out of sight from thousands of demonstrators shouting anti-Trump slogans in London, William and Catherine then walked Trump and his wife a short distance to meet the waiting Charles and Queen Camilla. As the president shook hands with the king, a 41-gun salute was fired simultaneously from six World War One-era guns on the castle’s east lawn, as a similar display occurred at the Tower of London, in the centre of the capital. The Trumps and the royals were then taken in a black and gold coach, surrounded by mounted cavalry, through the Windsor estate towards the nearly 1,000-year-old castle, where Trump and Charles inspected the guard of honour. The pair were seen sharing smiles, and the president saluted as the US national anthem played, before the royals and their guests headed inside for lunch. They exchanged gifts, with the royals giving Trump a book to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US declaration of independence next year, and Trump gifting Charles a replica of President Dwight Eisenhower’s sword. ‘Warm my heart’ Britain is pulling out all the stops to dazzle and flatter the unpredictable Trump as the UK government tries to keep him onside during a host of international crises. The 79-year-old Republican is, however, being kept far away from Britons as polls indicate he remains unpopular with the public, with the entire visit happening behind closed doors. An estimated 3,000 people marched through central London waving Palestinian flags and displaying banners with slogans, including “Migrants welcome, Trump not welcome”. “I’m just scared of the way the world’s being taken over by really nasty men,” Jo Williamson, a 58-year-old funeral director from Kent, southeast England, told AFP . Trump is the first US president to receive two state visits, after his previous one with Queen Elizabeth II in 2019. At Windsor, he laid a wreath on the tomb of Charles’s mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022, and viewed a collection of US-related items, including a letter sent from president Abraham Lincoln to Queen Victoria in 1862 after the death of Prince Albert. The president and Charles will wrap up with a white-tie state banquet, where they are due to make speeches. Trump’s unpredictability on everything from tariffs to Ukraine and Gaza has caused global turmoil and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will be hoping the president leaves on Thursday feeling the warm glow of royal soft power — but there are no guarantees. Epstein’s shadow “A lot of things here warm my heart,” the president, whose mother hailed from Scotland and who owns two golf resorts in the country, said on arriving late on Tuesday at the US ambassador’s official residence in London. The US leader may also relish a chance to escape a turbulent period at home, where the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has caused deep turmoil. But the spectre loomed of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who is providing domestic headaches for both Trump and Starmer . Police arrested four people after they projected images of Trump and Epstein onto Windsor Castle late Tuesday. Starmer will host Trump on the second day of the visit on Thursday at his country residence, Chequers. The pair will be buoyed by the announcement of billions of pounds of investment in each other’s economies, including from British pharmaceutical group GSK and Google, but there could be awkward moments. Starmer’s government seeks to cement the two nations’ “special relationship”, deepen economic ties, secure billions of dollars of investment, discuss tariffs and press the US president on Ukraine and Israel. Companies including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and OpenAI have already pledged 31bn pounds ($42bn) in British investments over the next few years, in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy. Starmer also wants further progress on trade, after Britain secured the first deal with Trump to lower some tariffs. Talks may touch on remaining levies on steel, whisky and salmon. “They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,” Trump said when he left the White House for Britain on Tuesday. But while Starmer is banking on the unrivalled royal allure helping cajole the Anglophile president, many pitfalls for Britain’s prime minister remain. Polls show Trump is widely unpopular in Britain and Starmer, faced with plummeting poll ratings of his own and economic woes, will need to show that his royal trump card can reap benefits. Starmer faces political troubles at home after sacking his UK ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, over his links to the late Epstein. Awkward questions about Epstein could also come to the fore. Commuters in the capital had mixed views about the visit, with some angry about the invitation and others saying it was smart politics and a good use of Britain’s soft power. “We’re looking to sort of make the best of a bad situation,” said lawyer Kirstie Robertshaw, 54. For Charles himself, the visit might provoke mixed emotions. He has little in common with Trump, from his 50 years championing environmental causes to his efforts to bring harmony between religions and his recent steadfast support for Canada, where he is head of state. But the occasion will also afford him the greatest global attention since his coronation. “If it goes well … I think this will go down as the most consequential event in his reign,” said historian Anthony Seldon.",
